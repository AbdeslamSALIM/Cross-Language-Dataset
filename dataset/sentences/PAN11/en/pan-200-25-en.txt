What value does the gentleman! - Is anything of value to beg to call your dear friend? - For what it takes courage, great courage, is to ask the person Celia who knows where she is. - And I know better than you?
Come and Dona Josefa Nemesia, I do not do that.
You teasing you. - Who has the blood like water for chocolate not tease. - Well, Celia is not here, where is?
There's been a sham, a intrigue, a nefarious plot to snatch my Celia.
Tell me what happened, everything. - I was present, repeated, but a woman of the house, he saw how the thing happened, I told yesterday afternoon suddenly came Cantalapiedra, Celia asked, and as she left, said he was imprisoned, he took her by the arm, and with no one took it to no know where. - The strange thing is that Celia turn left without defense, without investigating the reason for the prison.
Commissioner Celia was in a wheel. - What a plot!
But find out the truth, whatever it may be the author outrage, I will pay to sevenfold.

I have served as godmother to Miss and would cook at home.
She is not in the public jail. - Shall I not reveal it now.
