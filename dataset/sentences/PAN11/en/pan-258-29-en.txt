We are like fish in the sea, do you understand, capers?
Fish living in the same water in which dissolved his grandparents and the germs that beat their successors.
Our water is the environment in which we exist: space and earth live surrounded by those who were and those who will.
And I, capers friend, when I feel like to mourn no one remembering the mound, the sad futility of the florets surrounding it, I think mom is not there completely, that something has escaped, be moving through life, I encountered friendliness attracted to a mysterious, and accompanies me by engaging in touch as soft as a kiss ... "Lie," a voice yells at me thinking.
But I desoigo, I dream, I invent beautiful lies for my comfort.
Maybe in this breeze brushes we face, there is something gentle and trembling hands I caressed one last time before going to prison.
The gypsy had ceased to moan, watching their eyes African Salvatierra, enlarged by amazement.
Salvatierra he felt influenced by the cries of the family, the agony he had seen, by the misery of that body that swayed a few steps inside the car.
Poetry Sad night, the silence torn at intervals by screams of pain flooded his soul.
If, capers he feel about his beloved dead.
Some of it would go up to her face as a perfume, plowing the earth with the hoe and the groove again send his nose the freshness of the soil removed.
Some would also its soul in the ears of wheat, poppies red dripping gold flanks of the harvest, the birds singing at dawn when the human herd going into the pit, in the bushes of the mountain, about fluttering insects which frightened by racing mares and snorting bulls. - Who knows - went on the rebel - whether those stars which appear as blinking your eyes high, there is something at this time of the light of those other eyes that you loved so much, capers? ...
But the look of astonishment betrayed Roma, who had some compassion, as if he thought crazy Salvatierra. - You scared the greatness of the world, compared to the smallness of your poor dead, and back.
The glass is too big for a tear is true.
But the drop is lost the sea ...
In a drop of liquid were millions upon millions of beings, all life own: as many as men roamed the planet.
I despise it, I laugh at it, I hope without fear to rest than once, and me, lots.
The car, rattling his departure, had left the gypsy and Salvatierra, who stopped to speak.
And did not see him.
Served as their guide their distant chirp and family plan, marching behind, rushing back the bass motion of your pain. - Bye, Mari-Cru! - Shouted the little ones, as acolytes of a religion .-- funeral has been killed our cousin! ...
VII On reaching the vintages with the month of September, the wealthy were more concerned Jerez the attitude of the workers who the good result of the collection.
In The Circle Caballista, even more cheerful gentlemen forgot the merits of their ponies, the excellence of their dogs and the elegance of the girls whose ownership is disputed, not speak only of those people tanned, weathered by the penalties, dirty, smelly and resentful eyes that provided arms to their vineyards.
Wages earned real ten, ate the stew in bowls that they were settled without the love intervene, they had an hour off in winter and two in summer, to avoid choking limestone on the sparks flying, they gave up eight cigarettes per day and slept at night, most of them having a blanket over cattail mats.
In the horse, which owned the vineyard showed themselves suddenly softened by piety, and spoke of the farmhands of the estates.
Two real wages, a ranch across tasteless food and sleep in Dresses soil, less warm than the beasts.
It was logical for them to complain, not vineyard workers who lived as if they were gentlemen compared to the farmhands.
But the owners of the estates protested indignantly, seeing that they intended to throw on them all the weight of the danger.
When rejoiced in such a fortune was to be generous, give a little of welfare parle they supported their efforts.
And the gatherings of the rich, passed in a continuous fight between the owners the two sides.
His life of leisure had become paralyzed.
The wheel stood still, the cards were not open on the green table, spent the best girls on the sidewalk without windows overlook groups the heads casinos throwing compliments and sly winks.
The concierge of the Horse, he was crazy looking for the key to what is pompously titled library in the articles of association: a hidden closet in the darkest corner of the home, poor foolish as cupboard, showing through their windows dusty and cobwebbed, a few dozen books that no one had opened.
The lords they felt stung partners suddenly by the desire to learn, to train for what they called social question and every evening watching the closet as a tabernacle of science, hoping to appear the key to seek her inside the light they wanted.
It was not really big its rush learn from those things that brought socialism to the workers scrambled.
The man, the more ignorant, more blissful ...
Y Abomination looks threw the closet of books, like a reservoir of evil, while keeping the cabinet was unhappy in her womb a wealth of volumes harmless given away for the most part by the Ministry at the request of deputy district; verses the Virgin Mary, and patriotic song books, guides for the breeding of canary and rules the domestic rabbit reproduction.
While the rich vied with each other or be outraged by examining the claims of workers, they remained in an attitude of protest.
The strike had begun in part, with a lack of cohesion showed the spontaneity of the resistance.
In some vineyards owners, driven by fear of losing the harvest, "passed around", but stroking in the rancorous mind the hope of retaliation and that the clusters were at the winery.
Don Paul Dupont was the most spirited of them.
This is to deny my sacred rights of love ...
To me the money I care little, and the proof is that rather than give, the better I harvest is lost Marchamalo.
And Dupont, aggressive in defending what he called his rights, not only refused to hear claims of the laborers, but was expelled from the vineyard to all that is meant as long before agitators who tried to rebel.
Marchamalo remained in very few tenants, but Dupont had replaced the strikers Jerez with Gypsy and girls coming from the mountains to the abundant bait wages.
As the harvest did not require great hardships, Marchamalo was full of women crouched cutting slopes in clusters, while from the way the strikers insulted private work for his "ideas." The rebellion of the laborers had coincided with what Louis Dupont entitled his period seriously.
The skull had ended by surprise with its cousin, the powerful new behavior ...
La Marquesa and did not remember him, offended by its detours, had become to join the pig handler, "the only man who could make it go." The gentleman looked sad when he talked about his famous binges.
It had gone forever: no one could be young forever.
He had something in his head, his former teachers, the Fathers of the Company recognized him.
I did not think stopping on his way to conquer a position as high politics as his cousin was in the industry.
Other, more wicked than himself, ran land issues and were heard by the government, back in Madrid, as viceroys of the country.
Of past life preserved only with the brave friendships, strengthening their courtship new bullies.
And to entertain the honorable court, was dining at the grocery and getting drunk with them.
In addition, this gave some popularity.
And Louis Dupont, convinced of the importance of his person, going from one casino to another speaking the "social question" with vehement gesticulations that endangered the bottles and glasses line the tables.
Caballista shunned in the Circle gatherings of young people, which only reminded him of his past follies to applaud, suggesting larger ones.
He sought the conversation "Parents serious', the great planters and wealthy farmers, who began to hear with some attention, recognizing that he had a good head Perdis.
Dupont hinchábase with vehement speech by talking about the country's workers.
Repeating what he had heard from his cousin and religious who frequented the house of Dupont, but exaggerating solutions, with an authoritarian and brutal burning to the taste of his hearers, so rude people as rich, who found pleasure in breaking down bulls and tame wild horses.
For Luis, the question was very simple.
A little charity, and then religion, many religions, and stick to it gets out.
Always there would be rich and poor, hungry and sated, only the insane or criminals could dream of equality.
All jokes that the noblest of human aspirations had inspired his cousin Paul and his court priests, repetíalos Luis with a very firm conviction, as if they were the summary of universal thinking.
Dupont, emboldened by the general assent, still talking, but now grimly.
The people down, I needed before wages, was the consolation of religion.
Without religion we live raging, a victim of all kinds of unhappiness, and this was the case of workers Jerez.
Do not believe in anything, not going to Mass, the priests mocked, thought only of the degollinas social revolution and executions of bourgeois and Jesuits had no hope of eternal life, comfort and compensation for the misery here below, which are insignificant they last only a few dozen years, and as a logical outcome of such impiety, were their poverty harder, with new dark tones.
Let's see: I submitted a laborer that I have saved your savings.
All were silent, shaking his head in assent.
No one had the worker required by Dupont, and he smiled in triumph, hoping in vain to be wonderful to achieve savings a fortunilla on his wages of a few real. - Here - continued with solemnity - no taste for work and thrift.
bracero here as a young man thinks only in catching someone neglected girl behind a haystack or Gañanía during sleep, and old, barely meeting few cents, used in wine and gets drunk.
The Master knew the means of ending the anarchy.
The government played much of the blame.
In those hours, having started the strike, had to take a battalion Jerez, army, if need be, and guns, many guns.
And he complained bitterly about the neglect of above, as if the army of Spain had one mission for the rich store of Jerez for them to live peaceful, and would amount to a felony not to fill the streets and fields of pants bayonets bright red, just the tenants showed some dissatisfaction.
Luis was a liberal, very liberal.
Dissented on this point teachers of the Company, who spoke Don Carlos with enthusiasm, saying it was "the only flag." He was with his command, and not once mention the real people who do not cast forth the title ahead His Majesty, as if they could hear from far-fetched these samples respected and rewarded what he wanted.
It was liberal, but their freedom was of decent people.
Because the bandits grasped the Commune, and was charged a few days more than forty thousand of those points.
He used the barrel and ametrallodora to finish quicker with the mob, and everything was clean and quiet ...
But I want for this country a man as Thiers.
This is what needed here, a man who smiles and machine gunned the bastard.
And smiled to show he was able to be as Thiers as the other.
The conflict in Jerez as arranged in twenty-four hours.
To give him the authority and would what ero good.
The following performances of La Mano Negra, had had some effect.
The mob quailed before the gallows erected in the square of the prison.
But this was not enough.
Desirable to remove a loose drain the beast rebel forces.
To send him already be in prison the hubs of all societies of the field workers brought revolt in the city.
But it also seemed bland and insufficient, and immediately be rectified with propositions more fierce.
Ero better harass the rebels, abort the plans came prepared, "prick to jump out early, "and once placed in an attitude of rebellion, to them and that there was not one!
Much civil guard, many horses, many artillery.
For that held the weight of the rich contributions, whose best part was taking the army.
If not so, what they were for the soldiers who so expensive side, in a country that had to sustain wars? ...
As a precaution, should suppress the evil shepherds who rose up the herd misery. - To all those who walk on the field, in Gañanía Gañanía, spreading evil and vile papers poisonous books, four shots.
Those who cast howl harangues and barbarity in those meetings to bells covered with at night in a ranch or in the vicinity of a tavern, four shots.
And the same to those in the vineyards, disobeying their masters and the pride of knowing read, learn to their colleagues in the nonsense that bring the papers ...
A Fernando Salvatierra four shots ...
But sir, just said it seemed to repent.
Goodness and virtue of that rebel infundíanle some respect.
Same as approved their plans, they remained silent, as if they were repugnant to include the revolutionary in throw lavish distribution.
It was a crazy admiration imposed, a saint who did not believe in God, and those landlords felt for him a respect equal to the Moor to the holy man mad curses him and threatens him with his stick. - No - continued the gentleman, - in a straitjacket Salvatierra, and to be spread their doctrines in a madhouse what you have left.
The public approved of these solutions Dupont.
The owners of the herds of horses, old Pin grizzled who spent hours looking at the bottle with a priestly silence, its gravity broke the young man smiled. - Er Tié talented boy - said one .-- Talk like a diputao.
And the others approve. - You will Pablito, his cousin, that take it out when yeguen elections.
Luis felt fatigued at times of triumphs to harvest in the casinos, the amazement inspired by his sudden seriousness to former colleagues of gay life.
Hobbies reborn fun with the little people. - I'm sick of snobs - the man said nonchalantly over his loyal acolyte the Goat .-- Come and field, a little fanfare body thanks you.
And with the desire to remain under the protection of his powerful cousin, you've passed the day in Marchamalo, feigning interest in the outcome of the harvest.
The vineyard was full of women, and Luis liked dealing with those girls mountain to thank the gentleman laughed, and appreciated their generosity.
Maria de la Luz and her father as an honor hosting the regularity with which Louis visited the vineyard.
These people, traditionally accustomed to respect the noisy pleasures of the rich, disculpábanlos as if it were a duty of youth.
Fermin was aware of the great change that was made in Don Luis, his boasts serious man, and saw with pleasure that came to the Vineyard to escape the temptations of the city.
Her daughter also warmly welcomed the gentleman, calling him sir as in the days of his childhood, and laughing all through.
Was the master of Raphael, and someday she would be his servant in that farm, he saw all the time with imagination, like the nest of their happiness.
Of revelry scandal that had so incensed against the overseer, barely remembered.
Young master showed himself repented of his past, and people, to take a few months, I had forgotten the entire farm scandal.
Luis showed great love for life Marchamalo.
Sometimes at night he was surprised and stayed to sleep in the tower of Dupont. - I'm there as a patriarch - he told his friends Jerez .-- Surrounded by girls who love me as if his dad
