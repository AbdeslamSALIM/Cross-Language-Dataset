Valero Archbishop Losa lawsuit put them in the early eighteenth century.
Look at his tomb at the foot of the altar.
He lost the lawsuit, died of disgust, and had him buried he set foot here for the insolent wool after death, and who had beaten in life.
The arrogance of these ecclesiastical princes drove them to the proudest modesty ....
But this is what I wanted to teach? - Things you look better.
The great jembra.
Nights I dream about it ...!
They walked a few steps toward the front door of the cathedral to best view cover around the exterior end wall of the choir.
On the three holes drilled or chapels that runs a strip of ancient reliefs, the work of an obscure medieval carver, representing scenes of Creation.
Gabriel acknowledged his rude and contemporary sculptures from the door Clock and the first works of the cathedral. - See you.
In the first medallions, Adam and Eve are naked as worms.
But the Lord The cast of Paradise.
They have to dress for the world, and look what they do just clothes are.
Gabriel looked carefully for the first time those reliefs forgotten.
It was simple naturalism of the Middle Ages, the confidence with which the artists depicted their secular conceptions at the time of idealism, the desire to perpetuate the triumph of the flesh in every corner ignored the mystical monuments, to testify that life was not dead.
Eva was fall from the trees, with their clothes in disarray, and Adam about it, with a gesture of madness sex, grabbed her arms to dominate it, and hit his mouth to his chest with such avidity that the same could kiss than bite.
El Tato was proud to the surprise of his uncle. - Hey, how are you?
I discovered that rolling down the church.
Sing the canons every day to the other side of that wall, never suspecting that their heads are on such joys.
And the glass, man?
But I've spent entire afternoons studying them, and I know them by heart.
They are stories, things that painted his time there the glassmakers, whose intricacies are lost, without any Christian who can get it.
He pointed to the windows of the second ship, through which filtered the light of the afternoon with caramel tone. - See you there - continued the dogcatcher -.
A man with a red cape and sword climbs a ladder string.
In the window expect a nun.
Think it's Don Juan Tenorio representing by All Saints.
Further, these two are in bed and people knocking at the door.
And in the other window, mind you either: porridge ball, neighbor without the robe of hair, things in order, the times when people had no shame and walked with her face up ...
Gabriel smiled at the foolishness that the vagaries of ancient art inspired by the dogcatcher. - For in the choir, man, there is something to see.
Luna was the annihilation of admiration whenever he entered the choir.
That stalls high, work on one side of Philip of Burgundy and other Berruguete, he reveled in the profusion marble, jasper and gold, statues and medallions.
It was the spirit of Michelangelo resurgent in the Cathedral of Toledo.
The dogcatcher examined the lower stalls, ferreting Gothic reliefs discoveries made by his morbid curiosity.
The first seating at ground level, where they sat category clerics of tiny, half a century earlier was the high chairs, but during the past fifty years has made the great leap art from the Gothic stiff and hard to softness and good taste of the Renaissance.
Maestre Rodrigo had carved at the time that Spain Christian, moved with enthusiasm, attended the recent efforts of the Catholic Monarchs to complete the Reconquista.
In the backs and on the boards of the friezes, fifty and four carved paintings reproduced the main incidents of the conquest of Granada.
El Tato not watching these planes of oak and walnut with throngs of riders and clusters of soldiers Climbing up the walls of the Moorish cities.
Was more interested in the arms of chairs, handrails of the stairs leading to the high chairs, the projections that separate seats and serve to lay his head, covered with grotesque animal and dogs, monkeys, birds, brothers and little page, all in awkward, rare and obscene.
Pigs and frogs mated in monstrous municipalities, the monkeys, with ignoble gesture, writhing in lustful spasms, and little page linked in position against the head sank on the cross of shims partner.
It was a cartoon world of lust, and thrills monkey gestures satiríacos, which poked his carnal passion with the grimace of the most grotesque animalism. - Look here, man.
As funny, this is the most notable.
And Tato taught Gabriel figurine of a monk preaching chubby with huge ears donkey.
When they left the choir, Gabriel was near the large fresco of St.
Just immediately close a small door of the colossus, which leads to a staircase spiral to the music file.
The artist under his arm a large book with covers dusty Gabriel showed. - I'll take it up.
And you hear something, it's worth.
And from his view of the tome to the hatch immediately, said: - Oh, that file, Gabriel, what a pity da!
Each time I visit I leave sad.
All music books have pages torn, cuts where there was a letter painted a cartoon, something nice.
The old music sleep in the dust.
The canons do not want it, do not understand or are able to devote a few pesetas to be heard in the great feasts.
It is enough to get by with any piece Rossini, and as for the organ, the only thing that matters is you play slow, very slow.
The more slowly, more religious, but the organist play a habanera.
Still watching the door of the file with melancholy eyes, as if to mourn over ruin the music. - And there, Gabriel, is very remarkable work that should not die as the world exists art.
We in secular music are not much, but believe me that Spain was something religious authors ....
It is understood that if there really is secular music and religious music, which I doubt, for me, there's only music, and do not know what the handsome check separation, detailing where one ends and another begins ....
To hear what is sung in this choir!
There is Christopher Morales, who was three centuries ago Kapellmeister at the cathedral and twenty years before Palestrina began reforming music.
In Rome shared the glory with the famous teacher.
His portrait is in the Vatican and Lamentations, his motets, the Magnificat, sleep here forgotten for centuries.
Another from the same period.
Envious contemporaries called him "the monkey Palestrina ', taking all these works, imitations, after his long stay in Rome but believe me that rather than ripping into Italian perhaps exceeded.
Here is Rivera, a teacher Toledo, which nobody remembers, and has on file an entire volume of Masses, and Romero de Avila, the best studied Mozarabic chant, and Ramos de Pareja, a musician no less than fifteenth century, written in Bologna his book Tractatus music, and destroyed the old system Guido of Arezzo, discovering the "temperament of the sounds," and the monk Ureña, which adds note if the scale, and Javier Garcia, who in the past century reformed the music, leading it to Italy (God forgive him!) beaten path which have not yet emerged, and Nebra, the great organist Charles III, a man who a century before Wagner was born in Spain and used musical dissonance.
Believe me, Gabriel, that file is a pantheon of great men, but finally pantheon, where nobody comes back.
Then he added, lowering his voice: - The Church has always been a little music lover.
To understand it and feel it should be born artist, and you know what all these guys that come to sing in the choir ...
without knowing music.
When I see you, Gabriel, smiling at religious things, I guess in his expression how much he is silent, and give the reason.
I have been curious to know history of music in the Church have followed step by step the long ordeal of art unhappy taking up the cross of worship throughout the centuries.
You have heard many times of religious music, as if it were a thing apart, created by the Church.
Well, is a lie: there is religious music.
The dog catcher had moved away to hear that the Kapellmeister of tireless verve when talked about his art, he attacked the subject of music.
It was a guillati, who only knew how to play blues in his harmonium, not brighten it occurred to the poor of the Claverias with something danceable as requested by the niece of Silver Stick.
Gabriel walked the priest and talking about the silent ships.
There were more people a group of people in the house at the door of the sacristy and two women kneeling before the gate of the altar praying out loud.
Began to spread through the twilight cathedral of rapid winter evenings.
The first bats descended from the vaults, flying between the forest of columns. - Music Church - said the artist - is a true anarchy.
In all, the Church anarchic.
Believe me, the unity of the Catholic religion in all the land there is much to say.
Christianity, to train as a religion, not invented or a bad chant.
Take the Jews their songs and how to sing: a primitive, barbaric music, which if known now taladraría our ears.
It seems this of "Greek music" means a great deal, right, Gabriel?
The Greeks so large in the arts and poetry, all that bears his name seems wrapped in an environment of outstanding beauty.
Well, no sir, the Greek music that should be a Charivari.
The progress of the arts has not been paralleled in the life of mankind.
When the sculpture Phidias had reached the summit, the painting was no more than that character almost rudimentary can still be seen in Pompeii and the music was a baby talk.
The script could not perpetuate the music, there were so many "modes", musical people, and almost all of it were left to the performer.
Unable to look at the parchment what they were singing mouths and instruments, progress was therefore impossible.
For this has been a renaissance for sculpture, to painting and architecture and the arts rise again after Middle Ages, they found the music in the same children who had left when leaving ancient world.
Gabriel nodded his head movements to the words of Kapellmeister. - This was the early Christian music - continued Don Luis -.
Committed to the tradition and transmitting ear, religious chants disfigured and corrupted.
In each church sang differently.
The mystics tended to the hard drive, the inscrutable, and San Gregorio in the sixth century published his Antifonario, a pastiche of all liturgical melodies, purifying their discretion.
It was a mixture of two elements: Greek, but oriental and floral, something like the current Malaga, and Roman, serious and tough.
Grades are expressed in letters, the tones were still Phrygian, Lydian, etc., And continued the labyrinth of Greek music, but very lively, with fioritudes, sighs and aspirations.
The patchwork was lost, and much regret that want to return to the old, believing it better.
Judging by the fragments that remain, whether now runs the music that nothing would of religion, as religion is understood today in art, it would be a song as of the Moors, or Chinese, or some schismatic Greeks still remain in the liturgies old.
The harp was the instrument of the temple until the court appeared in the tenth century, rude and barbarous instrument that had to play with his fists, and gave him air swollen skins.
Guido of Arezzo was a musical arrangement on the basis of pastiche, an arrangement nothing more, and this was enough for the Benedictine hung the invention of the staff.
Continued using the letters of Boethius and Gregory as notes, and only put in two lines with three different colors.
Learn music badly then cost twelve years, and there was no singing in different cities that they understood the same role.
San Bernardo, dry and austere as his time, he found absurd this song, to be minor.
The cathedrals were the point of distraction, drama, the center of life at that time.
The temple was going to pray a little to God and have fun forgetting the wars, violence and outrages abroad.
Again came the popular music in the Church, and sang in cathedrals songs in vogue, who were almost always obscene.
The people took part in church music, singing in various tessitura, each which, as he thought best, and these were the first attempts of polyphonic singing voices or agreed.
Religion was so happy, popular, democratic, as you say, Gabriel; Inquisition had not yet suspected of heresy or sour the mood with fanaticism and fear.
Air crude instruments and string that entertained artisans in cities and peasants in the mowing entered the temple and the body was accompanied by violas, violins, trumpets, bagpipes, flutes, guitars and lutes.
The chorale was liturgical in most of Europe, but the faithful and despised by incomprehensible alternábanlo with songs.
In major parties were singing religious hymns, set to music of popular tunes that were in vogue, such as Song of the gunman, Morena Give me a kiss I do not know what bulle; Duélete me, madam Curse whom you married, and others of same style ...
The Church lived without artistic criteria, not ever had.
Failed to create an architecture as hieratic, like other religions, or a painting or a sculpture that were his work, and less music.
Was adapting to the environment was acceptable and appropriate, with a lack absorbency originality, so it was not his work, but of human progress.
Greco-Roman style, Byzantine, Gothic, Renaissance, all went into their construction, but art pure and original Christian does not exist, never existed.
In music, much talk of "severity" of "anointing" of "Gregorian traditions" hollow words without precise meaning, vagueness that hide the lack of artistic criteria.
