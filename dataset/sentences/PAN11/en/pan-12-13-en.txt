Having been in the savage state fanatics and cruel in the highest degree to keep the observance of superstitious beliefs, failed to embrace the Catholic religion, without Like letting go of exaggeration, for what was a very easy subject to all the rules Christianity.
The Indians were not yet baptized they going to listen to the rout daily sermons of the missionaries, and those who already were, time to attend Mass in the holidays, and once in the ordinary, particularly on Saturday to sing and pray at morning and evening choir, and Spanish, and in Moxo.
Arguably however, in this regard, that the Jesuits were let go very far to the fans Moxos, submitting to the severe regime, reserved only for the monastery.
An immense amount of time was spent by these Indians in the exercise of church, he often took communion, and the slightest lack religious lashed them to ask themselves as for any ordinary crime [1].
Father Eguiluz speaking of Holy Week, said that all individuals, without distinction of age, confessed and communicated.
On Friday, while the sermon lasted passion, dábanse all "many slapping and beating of breasts ... "" After ordering the procession through the square and main streets carried on a litter package the image of Christ crucified, and in others of the Holy Virgin, with more than two hundred lights, a big silence and composure do not hear a word, but the whipping of a large number of penitents blood, dragging ropes and heavy sticks, and other dresses of Nazareth, with crosses to the shoulders, singing the chorus of musicians the miserere ... "" Several church choirs sing lamentations, for the duration of penance and penitents, they pass in front of the monument, and most recently bowing discipline to view the image of Christ crucified [2]. "When a plague ensuing immediately they prayed a novena, accompanied by fasting and other penances, then, - "every night there talk and act of contrition, and go along the bias to make discipline, and if some for old, or by the novelty of the exercise, its given with little force, angry listeners, and scold him to squeeze his hand [3]. "Thus, according to the state's religious exaggeration Spain at that time, the Jesuits to most of the principles of sound morality and religion Catholic imposed Moxos fans such corporal punishment, the reviled, removing not a little to their human dignity.
They left the Jesuit Fathers meantime, since the said year 1696, to carry out his conquests and taking advantage of fame, and highly publicized, the well-being enjoyed by the Moxos Christians, formed on, San-Pedro with Canichana, Santa-Ana with Moximas; Exaltation with Cayuvava, San-Joaquin, Concepcion, Saint-Simon and Saint-Martin Baures and the tribes, and finally, with Magdalena Itonama.
It seems, however, that the conversion of these savage nations was not made without cost the lives of some religious [1]; but it never did weaken the evidence of the Jesuits, who persisted in their purpose to submit the entire province.
In 1742, the Portuguese adventurers Saint-Paul, who occupied the province of Mato Grosso, made his first expedition down the river or Guaporé Itenes.
So it was when Manuel Lima, accompanied by five Indians, three mulatto and black, in a canoe down the rivers Guaporé, Mamore, Madeira and Marañon to the town of order [1].
Little more or less around the same time, calculating the Jesuits the importance of navigation of rivers, had established the mission of Saint-Simon, Guaporé very immediate, and later, in 1743, the Santa-Rosa, in the same place where it is today Fort Beira belonging to the Brazilian, ie on the right bank of the river Itenes, but jealous the Portuguese of such an undertaking, espulsaron the Jesuits in 1752 [2], under the pretext of that they were blocking the way on their own property, and Don Antonio Rolin, to seize definitely the domain of the river, he built the fortress there is today.
After all this, the first care of the monks was reinforcing the existence of missions, introducing all possible improvements, to this end, Santa-Cruz trageron many cattle, encouraged local people to farm work; perfected tected, already in practice among Baures, taught all kinds of handicrafts, and multiplied religious ceremonies and to give them a range of pleasant rest to the workers.
