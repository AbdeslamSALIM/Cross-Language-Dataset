Finding out free Don Marcelo saw the poor woman with red eyes, the bony face, hair in disarray.
The night had gravitated to its existence with a weight many years.
All their energy suddenly vanished as he recognized the owner. "Lord ...
Don Marcelo did not want to know anything, was afraid of the truth.
Now he was awake and free, stroked momentary hope that everything seen him last night was a nightmare.
Perhaps the poor man was still alive ... - They killed him, sir ...
He suspected that the body was in the pit.
The waters were calm green mysteriously closed on the offering of the night ...
