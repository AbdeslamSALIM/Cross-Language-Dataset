Sun and his face lit up, not knowing what to say, and Lucia is the color off, looking in vain for the forces that move one side and open lips into a smile. - But this should not be so, no.
The director put his arm at Sol de Lucia, accompanied by glances and jealous and took refuge for a few moments with them on a balcony railing of granite, which was hidden under a twisted vine of roses bloom.
Balcony was great and solemn night, very late, and the sky, loving and talkative, as it is in our country where the air is clear, and it seems that they talk and visits are the stars. - And above all, Lucia y Sol, give you a kiss. - Look, Lucia - said his hands clasping those of girls and talk as if the sun is not with them, who felt his cheeks burning, and tightness in the chest with what the teacher said, therefore that for a moment the sky was black, as well as his house was calling Ms.
Yo, I love her like a daughter, I tried to educate people to be saved from danger of being nice to be so poor.
Lucia felt at that moment as the Sol's hands trembled, and made a motion to withdraw and stand up. - Lady .... - No, no, Lucy.
