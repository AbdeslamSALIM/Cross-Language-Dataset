Margarita is already all of Faust, Faust wants to be of God, and expresses its condolences to see little religious.
No doubt it is admirable the creative force of Goethe, so real that we are introduced to Margarita and the surrounding art by such candor, which, notwithstanding all its faults, continues to seem pure and innocent, as if he had in it an evil that steals numen responsibility and free will.
No wonder God has made the same permission to try to Fausto, no wonder he is bound to him.
Crimes are needed; matter is born and is increasing the tragic terror, but despite this, and although much has to be evil in history that such a role does the devil, could not be excused the narcotics detail, given by his mother Margaret at night to unveil and not surprised in the arms of his beloved?
Although Margaret has the certainty that the drug will not do evil to his mother, is not horrible yet to be given, and then have your hand in that dream violent, death shadowing him while she enjoys with the man she loves?
No missing women who tease their mothers and their husbands, but we are certain that for every cent, just one that will not discard the use of narcotics.
