Did not cause me hesitation that flow of words, but I finally hear.
The affectionate exasperation Oliver served as a calming on my nerves terribly excited and tempered his tension.
I asked him to forgive me that start, end of my daze, ensuring in my words there were no hints of distrust.
I begged him to let this crisis pass of weakness, pain and fatigue result and promised to change the gender of life.
Lived in the same social and recognized it was wrong of me not to haunt him.
Had should certainly not be singled out with a systematic withdrawal.
He said a portion of sensible things, as if suddenly regained his reason.
And he also missed unless the expansion of our privacy, making us more flexible, more conciliatory, better, being together, I spoke to him, his life almost entirely passed away from me, and I regretted not knowing what was done and whether he had reason to be satisfied. - Satisfied.
That is the word - he said with an almost comical .-- Every man has particular vocabulary for their ambitions.
Yes, I'm pretty satisfied at this point, and if I settle for satisfaction which have no information of chimeric, my life will run in perfect balance and will be happy to satiety. - Have you heard of Ormesson? - None.
The atmosphere of this room is permeated a very respectable emotion.
There is no promiscuity among women of which you speak and that other one whose name must not be uttered even while on the other hand.
Sound of footsteps in the hall interrupted our conversation.
The sight of this energetic and forceful face me returned to some extent a bit of energy.
It seemed as if the fate sent me a reinforcement at that moment you need it. - You arrive in good time - I said .-- seeking animated show was not worth the take me so much work, right?
Hablábale always meets a former student on his teacher, and giving them the right questioning me about my homework. - It's about to start - he said, not surprised by what I saw .-- I know what is! ...
After several minutes of silence, yawned gently stroked with hand his curly hair and said: - I'm bored and I'm taking a walk in the Forest ...
X - Does it work? - Augustine asked me when Oliver left us. - Very little, and yet, learn as if working. - So much the better.
If life were a lottery, this young man's dream numbers would come out winners.
Augustine was not the kind that induce or those who should enrich a dream number.
What I have been told it must have made him understand that he was not born for favors of chance and that all the items he had made his will stop, worth putting more than profit.
From the day I saw you leave Trembles, with a letter arrived from Paris in the pocket, as a soldier with his itinerary in hand, their hopes had received more than one check, but this had not diminished his strong faith nor did he hesitate, just for a minute that success, if not glory, were Paris at the end of the road that he undertook.
He did not complain, did not accuse anyone, do not despair for nothing.
Without any illusions had the tenacity of the blind hopes and what other would like pride, there was in it rather than feeling very accurately determined their right.
Appreciated the things with the serenity of a jeweler who tested quality jewelry doubtful, and rarely mistaken in choosing which were worth devote time and labor.
Do not think it would dishonor seek support, because he only proposed an exchange of equivalent values.
And this contrast - he said - not ever humiliate that contributes to society the number of his intelligence, zeal and talent.
Did not affect contempt of money - which was in great need Sabíalo .-- I without him tell me.
Did not disdain the results, but placed well below a capital of ideas, as him, no one can represent, or pay. "I am - he said - a worker who works with tools low cost, it is true, but what they produce is priceless, it is good. " Not considered, therefore, grateful to anybody.
The services we had done had bought and pagádolos well.
And in that kind of sales - which exclude hand if conventionalism social treatment, humiliation all at least - was his way of offering, which determined notably the high price that his understanding was only fair. - From the time that half the money - he said - and no more than a business in which the heart does not fit all and that does not compromise in any way, to thank.
I and das.
The talent itself, in such cases is not simply a duty of honesty.
Not being able to choose the media, had the gift of the application rather than the flexibility which allows applying all.
A force of will, vision, burning almost made up for natural powers which recognized private.
His will, supported on special good sense and perfect righteousness, miracles.
Did not feel it all, but nothing that he did not understand.
Also approached the manifestations of pure imagination by a tensile stress of his mind, always in touch with everything that the world has better ideas and more beautiful and bordered on the pathetic by the perfect knowledge of the hardships of life and the devouring ambition to achieve legitimate satisfaction, even if it were to barter a long struggle.
Having addressed the theater - for which it was not considered sufficiently recommended or with enough preparation, - was launched in journalism.
When I say it was launched, do not use the word to explain the idea, because she did not corresponds to the action of a man who, being unable to stunning, are presented in fore with the courage informed of prudence does not risk much more than that to achieve favorable success.
A few months ago he had entered the service of an eminent public man, as secretary. - I - I said - in the midst of a movement that appeals to me, but I am interested and illustrated.
Politics, in these times, includes many ideas, makes so many problems, which is the test mean more instructive and more especially designed to be a crossroads looking ambition output.
His material situation was unknown to me.
The supposed hard, but was that an issue about which it seemed unwise to speak.
Sometimes the only continent that tireless fighter betrayed to his dismay, no hesitation, but suffering.
His attitude was the same as ever, their way of thinking had not lost one iota of the usual strength.
Acted, thought, resolved as if he had never suffered the slightest onslaught of luck, but it was an indescribable indefinable, something like the red spots that appear in the garb of a wounded soldier.
For a long time I had asked what part of that organization vulnerable iron had been lacerated, and finally realized that Augustine, like everyone, had heart and realized it was the noble and courageous heart that bled.
Then he sat down and so I saw him cross his legs one over the other, with the attitude of a man who has nothing to say and enter a friend's house forgetting the object of his visit, I realized that he was not in the spirit and cheerful disposition. - Have not you are happy, my dear Augustine? - I asked. - Have you guessed it! - Replied in a tone that showed bitterness. - Need is to guess when you have pride in not declaring it. - My son - he continued, using that form paternal always lent a certain charm to the rudeness of his advice - the problem is not whether one is happy, what matters is to find if you have done everything to become so.
A good man deserves, undoubtedly, be happy; but do not always have the right to complain because it is not yet.
It's about time, the moment of opportunity.
There are many ways to suffer: some suffer in error, others impatience.
Maybe I'm just a little impatient. - Impatient?
Then he added: - Do not talk about these things too soon.
You'll be the first who will realize them when the time comes.
He was silent a moment, standing up said: - We are not here: this smacks of defeat.
Not that it bothers me, but makes you want to be abandoned.
We went out and walking, walking you caught up with the specific complaints of nuisance and disappointment that I had.
My letters had warned him and the rest of the day it assumed Magdalena and he saw.
Well Well, at first I was shocked, unable to admit that college composition could anyone move like that.
Then I reasoned that had nothing to do with Hannibal emotion.
Whereas the issue from different viewpoints of those who take Oliverio, advised me to heal, but using procedures considered to be the only ones worthy of me.
We parted after many laps around the walls of the Seine.
The night was approaching.
I found myself alone in Paris at a time unusual, aimless, lacking in daily habits, no connections, no obligations, thinking anxiously - What shall I do tonight?
It seemed to me that when they had abandoned acting in me, and I was no Assistant to handle a life hereafter would leave me in the vacuum idleness.
The idea of ??turning my house does not even crossed my mind by thinking I went to look at books I had gotten sick with disgust.
I remembered that Oliver should be at the theater knew what and who accompanied him.
Not having why more cowardly to resist, I took a car and I drive.
I took a dark box from which expected to see Oliver without being noticed.
It was not in any of the other boxes he had in front of me.
I figured that would have changed the project or would in any locations high above me occupied and I was given no see.
Having failed the plan of him in his gallant adventure, I wondered what it was that there had to be done.
I was, however, and it would be difficult to explain to you why: such was the disorder my spirit which is shuffled with boredom, penalties and fainting with perverse curiosity.
Sinking look at all the boxes occupied by women, views from below were an irritant exposure almost disembodied breasts and bare arms only partly covered by gloves.
Examined the hair, eyes, smiles and looking for persuasive comparisons can endanger the perfect memory of Magdalena.
He had only one desire: the impetuous desire in any way to evade prosecution of that one memory.
The debased to my taste, and dishonor waiting for that environment, render it unworthy of it, get rid of it by dint of dirtying.
Leaving the theater, when crossed the lobby I heard a group of people the voice of Oliver.
He spent about me and not I saw.
I could barely see a distinguished-looking person, very elegant, who accompanied him.
We went into our respective departments about the same time and I was still in suit, when he appeared at the door of my room. - Where are you? - He said. - From the theater.
And what I said. - Am I looking for? - I was not intending to get you, just wanted to see - I replied. - I do not understand.
In any case these are trifles or other shrimp that if you were not the forgive you.
I did not see more for two or three days.
Severity had to be vigorously addressed.
It was reported me and my man and I knew I was worried about my condition and without seeming to watch me.
Each day of inaction exhausted me more and more demoralized me.
Took no decisive match, but I felt that my weakness was going to swoop down the first accident that moved him.
Three days later, at a Forest Avenue why I walked desperate, I saw slowly a fine carriage harness.
Iban in it three persons: two young women and Oliverio.
Regarding the two months of this loss - which lasted only the time at best - I'll refer only easy to foresee the incident that ended.
At first I forget to Magdalena, because I remember every time he came to my mind, I said, "Flee!" as respected hidden from view at certain frames hurtful or embarrassing.
I put together an obstacle world and indignities.
Oliverio A moment came to believe that this was over, but the person with whom I was trying to kill unwelcome memory that was not deceived.
At that moment it was adopted a resolution and decided to break. - I come to say goodbye - I said when entering a room that had never set foot. - That's what I would have done something later, but soon - she told me without express surprise, or disappointment. - So Do not resent me? - No way.
He sat in front of the toilet and said, 'Goodbye', without looking back.
I left her without explanation. - Another folly more - Oliver told me when he heard what I had done. - Stupidity or free heme - I said .-- I'll Trembles and take you with me.
I'll be cautious, very cautious, but I will be happy too, give me those two months, they will not return, I will make a finding that it is short time and perhaps the only period of that that I will in my life.
He spoke so ardently driven by desire, I was so refreshed, so changed by the prospect unexpected that trip, that she was tempted and was weak and the generosity of nod everything. - Sea - said .-- In short, it is incumbent on you to you alone.
I am not a guardian angel.
After I quite all the steps leading only two raving lunatics like you and me.
XI Those two months' residence with Magdalena in our lonely home in the countryside, shores of our sea, so beautiful in such a season, was a source of constant delight, mixed with purified torments me.
Not a single day that is not designated for any large or small temptation, not a minute that does not correspond to a beat of my heart, chill, a hope, a disappointment.
I could tell you today, the date and precise location of a thousand emotions very faint traces of which has remained in my memory, despite the smallness of fact: I would show you this corner Park, just steps from the terrace, this field site, the people of the escarpment, in where the soul of the insensitive things so well preserved the memory of Magdalena and mine, if you seek - God forbid - I would find as recognizable as the next day our departure.
Magdalena had never been in Trembles and that residence, although a bit sad and median liked.
As much as I had the same reasons as I to have deposited love it, I had heard it so often that my own memories had been fully released v helped him feel good there. - The earth is like you - I said .-- I had imagined how, with just him to you.
Now I understand better certain features of his character because it corresponds to the characteristic features of his native country.
I was very pleased and it penetrated the intimacy of so many things closely related to my life.
It was like a series of subtle confidence that I initiated in and had been led to understand what it was.
Besides the desire to surround welfare distractions and care, was also the secret desire to establish between us ties of education, intelligence, sensitivity, almost by birth and parentage, which had to make our friendship more legitimate, paying who knows how many years old.
Magdalena Complacíame test the effect of certain influences, physical rather than moral, to which I was continually subject.
Put before their eyes some natural scenes, chosen from those who, invariably consisting of some vegetation, plenty of sunshine and a vast expanse of sea, had the gift to move me infallible.
Observed in what sense could impress, why aspects of poverty or of greatness might like that horizon always sad.
As I was given wondered about the details of sensitivity all outside.
And when he was in agreement with me - that happened much more frequently I would never have expected - when it sensed the echo entirely accurate, as the moved in unison fiber vibrating in me, finding an agreement most of which welcomed me as a new alliance.
So I started to see me in many ways she would have suspected without understanding.
Judging on more or less normal routine of my life was learning quite exactly what was the hidden background of my nature.
My predilections will reveal some of my concerns, and what she described as singularities more clearly seemed to him discovered as the sources.
None of that was the effect of calculation yielded a result quite ingenuity to not leave room to have to reproach me if there was something that resembled at the slightest appearance of seduction, but innocently or not this is that I give.
She seemed happy.
For my part, thanks to such continuous communications between us created innumerable connection points, tornábame freer, stronger, more sure of myself in every way; and this represented a great improvement because Magdalena saw this as a step in the path of openness.
This merger complete, consistent and progressive without an accident lasted two long months.
Failure to do secret wounds, countless, infinite, were nothing compared with the consolations that followed the cure.
In short, I was happy and seemed to be whether that is to live fast, in love with all his might no cause for repentance and hopeless.
The Lord of Nièvre was a hunter, and he is the subject that I have come to be.
He gave me with great cordiality in the first trials of an exercise class that I liked after to the passion.
Magdalena and Julia sometimes accompanied us away or we waiting on the shore while we were making long sweeps toward the sea.
Distinguíaselas from afar as bright flowers perched on the boulders to edge of the blue waves.
When incidents of the hunt took us too us away or held until later, we heard the voice of Magdalena who invited us back.
Tan soon appointed to her husband or Oliver and me.
The wind brought us those calls alternating our three names.
Pearly notes of that voice, launched a large space from the sea weakened as they flew over that area without echo; came to us as a slightly audible murmur and when my name is not distinguished predictable sense of infinite tenderness and sadness she felt.
Sometimes, and hid the sun we were still sitting on the high on the coast, engaged in do die at our feet the long waves that came from America.
Covered boats crossed the purple glare of the sun, awash lit lights, headlamps, with lightning flashes and intervals fixed and the yellow vessels at anchor in the harbor, resinous those of fishing boats.
