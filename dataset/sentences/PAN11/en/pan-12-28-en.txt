Yet progress is undeniable, if not us, in what is outside us, although our power and accumulated inheritance.
Napoleon, for instance, is not better than Alexander the Great, but Napoleon has guns and other means of warfare that Alexander did not have.
Neither Kant nor Hegel worth as much as Aristotle but Aristotle did not possess the scientific data twentieth of Kant and Hegel.
