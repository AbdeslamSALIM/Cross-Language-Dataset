I have a duty to inform you of a circumstance that surely justify me, as executor of the deceased Galba to reject their claims.
Negligible value legacy, mostly land, then a low value, prevented his executors surrogates to carry out his will, and even open and will make public the formulas prescribed by law, until about two or three years when the value of property had already increased considerably.
The provisions of that bequest are simple, but strict.
By communicating the results of it to Madame de Ponce, it took John's hand to lean lips. - Nothing can add to my present happiness, Juan, but tell me, why is it hidden Carolina?
John smiled quietly.
After a week completed the necessary legal formalities, and Carolina was returned his stepmother.
A proposal for the sick, rented a house in the suburbs of the population, there to await the spring came late this year, and the lady's convalescent Ponce did not come ever.
He liked to observe sprouting beyond the window trees unknown to her in California, and ask their names and Carolina fruit.
Still planned for the summer long walks with Carolina through the lush woods, where the gray and dry lines could be seen from the cottage.
Wanted to write a poem dedicated to them, one of the members of this makeshift family kept it a song joyful, pure and simple, like an echo of pitirrojo who called from the window at birth dawn.
Then, abruptly, spread over the sky a clear day, mystically soft, sleepy and beautiful, throbbing as if swooping life with invisible wings, Nature woke up to an exuberant resurrection.
And the poor sick woman was seated outdoors, prostrate under that glorious sun gilded it all with his rays.
There he lay for a long time in sweet and peaceful bliss.
One day, tired of ensuring Carolina, had stayed by his side, and the thin lady fingers Ponce perched upon his head as if in tender benediction.
A bit, called John. - Who has been recently? - Said in a barely audible voice. - Mademoiselle de Corlear - John said, answering the look in his sunken eyes. - John - said after a pause, - beloved John, sit beside me for a moment, I have to tell you something.
If in recent days I have ever seemed hard or cold, or coquettish, was because I loved you, John, I loved you too much to jeopardize your future, chaining with mine and obsolete.
Everything happened already, but I recently had a dream, John, I dreamed of a woman, who would find As for me I was missing - and looked lovingly at tender bud slept beside him, - and would love as you loved.
John shook his hand, but did not answer.
After a few moments of silence, said: - Maybe hits in your choice.
The last trace of life that head came off weak, crazy and passionate.
A butterfly had landed on his chest blew, and the hand away from head Carolina fell to his side, motionless.
DE-HINCHÚ, The idolater The menu at Hop-Sing, fluttered to the ground a strip of yellow paper, which at first view candidly that I figured would be the label of a package of Chinese surprises, so many figures and hieroglyphics were contained.
There was also within a smaller strip rice paper with two exotic characters, drawn with ink, in which recognized card immediately Hop-Sing.
The translation of all this was: "The doors of my house are not closed to the outsider, the bowl of rice is on the left and sweets to the right of the input. "The teacher gave these two sentences: "Hospitality is the virtue of the child and the wisdom of parents. "The sane is tender-hearted, after the harvest, a festival. "If you see the stranger in your hedgerow, melons, did not observe very closely, while meeting is often the highest form of wisdom. "Happiness, peace and prosperity .-- Hop-Sing." I am obliged to confess that, after a very free translation, I found myself in serious trouble immediate implementation to carry the message that I was going.
By wise and judicious than were the above adages, I was, as they say, fasting, on what Hop-Sing wanted to tell me, the darkest of all the comedians, as a good Chinese philosopher.
Fortunately, I discovered a third paper, folded as a note, containing a few words English, written in block letters running of Hop-Sing.
Said: "I hope you will honor their attendance numbers ...

It was a visit to the warehouse of Hop-Sing, openness and exhibition of some rare Chinese novelties and curios, a session in the back office house, a cup of tea, for goodness unknown outside of these holy places, cigars and a visit to the theater or Buddhist temple.
Indeed, this was the favorite of Hop-Sing while in the exercise of their hospitality, as the principal or superintendent Ning-Fu Company.
Specified day at eight o'clock and entered the warehouse of Hop-Sing.
The house was stuffed of that mysterious odor, pleasant and indefinable, of foreign goods, could be seen there the usual exhibition of objects of unusual appearance, the endless procession of tile or china, whimsical brotherhood of the grotesque and the mathematically precise finish and, endless manifestations of the fragile frivolity, lack of chromatic harmony, everything with strange and peculiar coloring.
Huge kites dragons and gigantic butterflies; other so artfully arranged, which threw intervals, entering into the wind, the cry of the hawk, some so large that it was impossible for any boy could dominate, so large that they did understand why comets in China take a fun the elderly; mythology of china and bronze so disastrously ugly, for the same failure so, no waking nor human sympathy nor any feeling of piety candy jars completely covered by moral thoughts of Buddha and Confucius, hats that looked with baskets and baskets that looked like hats, silk so thin and delicate that I dare not to tell the incredible number of square yards that could pass both a child ring.
These and many other indescribable objects were known to me.
I continued my way through warehouse lighting sparingly until you reach the back office or living room, where I found Hop-Sing, who received me with peculiar kindness.
Not go into the description without the enlightened reader dispose of your mind all sorts of ideas about the Chinese may have acquired works and performances biased.
Not wearing their pants legs with scalloped full of bells, I never found a Chinese to take them, no progress steadily extended her index finger at right angles with the body, even as I ever heard utter the mysterious sentence Ching a ring a ring chaw, nor danced as those at the slightest indication.
Rather it was, overall, a gentleman serious, decorous and all respectability.
His color, which stretched across the head to her long braid, resembled that of a beautiful agarbanzado paper and glossy, and her eyes were piercing black.
He was straight and finely shaped nose, mouth small, teeth giblets, clean, and eyebrows inclined at an angle of fifteen degrees.
Her dress characteristic was a dark blue silk blouse, and the street, on cold days, a short leather jacket Astrakhan.
In the legs was but leggings blue brocade closely tight around the calves and ankles would have said that that morning he had forgotten wearing the pants, but they were so aristocratic manners, which completely concealed alleged lack of those.
Although Spartan severity was fine person and spoke with ease in English and French.
In sum, I doubt you would have to find another Like this Pagan shopkeeper among Christians of its kind in San Francisco.
A Federal Court judge, a senior government official, a wealthy merchant and a publisher.
After we had drunk our tea and tried some candy from a artistic vase rose Hop-Sing, and doing badly sign to follow him, indíconos that low to the basement with him.
Once there, we were surprised to see brightly lit and some chairs arranged in a circle on the smooth pavement.
After we had done lay, said ceremoniously: - I invited you to witness a spectacle that ever I can assure foreign some have seen, outside of you.
The magician of the court, De-Hinchú, arrived yesterday morning.
Function has never been outside the palace, but I asked you to amuse my friends tonight and has agreed willingly.
For your gaming needs no theater, tables, accessories, or help some, but only what you see here.
It was the usual ground floor or the basement is the stores in San Francisco, asphalt, to prevent moisture.
We hit the pavement with our rods and both walls to please our guest policy, no otherwise, they were fully compliant to be victims of any clever management.
Of me to say that I was willing to be deceived, and if I had offered an explanation of what followed, probably would have excused.
I am convinced that together, the role of De-Hinchú was the first of its kind given on American soil, however, as it surely will have become so familiar since some of my readers, I will not be annoying to insist on it.
He began by casting the flight, with the help of her fan, a large swarm of butterflies, made to our view small bits of tissue paper and kept in the air for the rest of the session.
Certainly the judge tried to grab one, which had been standing on his knee, and escapósele the way of a lepidopteran truth.
At the same time De-Hinchú, still driving your fan, pulled chicken hat, palm oranges, extracted yards of silk without end of his sleeves, and filled the basement surface of genres that sprang up mysteriously soil, their own dress from scratch.
He swallowed knives to the detriment of their digestion for years to come, dislocated all members of his body and leaned back in the air, as resting in the ether.
But fortune that crowned the function, and so far I have not seen repeatedly, was the most amazing, fantastic and mysterious.
It is my apology for this long preamble, my only excuse for writing this story, the genesis of this true story.
At one point, cleared the ground of the objects that encumbered, and then invited us all to get up and further consideration.
Hicímoslo with gravity, nothing but asphalt notice pavement.
Then asked to lend him a handkerchief, as if by chance I found myself closer to him I offered him mine.
Took it in his hands and spread it open on the floor, unfolded upon him a large box of silk, and this, again, a large shawl, which covered most free field.
Situose after one of the vertices of this rectangle, and began a monotonous chant, rocking back and forth to the beat of a mournful melody.
We hope still, and dominate the song, we heard the bells of the city clocks, and shake a car that rolled down the street on our heads.
The anxious anticipation, the opaque and mysterious twilight of the cellar, hovering in a fantastic on deformed bulk a Chinese deity in the background, the drowsy smell of opium mixed with the smell of spices and uncertainty of what we were really expecting, we were overwhelmed with shivering of instinctive fear: we looked at each other with a forced smile.
And something that was not there before, at first an imperceptible relief, the vague but growing more and more distinct and visible at every moment happened.
The chant still continued, the sweat began to run down the face of the singer, for the hidden object was now taking shape and body, which raised the shawl in its center a few inches of soil.
It was undoubtedly because the outline of a small but perfect human body with arms and legs open.
Pale and felt restless, the Finally, the editor broke the silence with a joke, however poor it was, received with spontaneous joy.
Suddenly ceased singing, and De-Hinchú, with a quick and clever movement, snatched and silk shawl, and discovered sleeping peacefully upon my handkerchief, a tiny urchin.
The resounding applause that followed this discovery had to leave De-Hinchú satisfied, even if his audience was small, at least, was quite loud to wake creature, a beautiful boy about a year old, who looked like a statue of Cupid.
