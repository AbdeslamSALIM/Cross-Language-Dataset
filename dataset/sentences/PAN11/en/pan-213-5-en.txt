THE PURIFICATION OF POETRY ON THE 'ODAS' OF D.
I do not want to understand it all, as I heard that Goethe understood.
Such a way of understanding it is more than enough selfish.
The poet, example, feels like suicide, and instead of and to dispose of such harmful Werther writes wanted.
Thus, not only provides healing of the mania of suicide but applaud you and admire your talent.
The trouble is that the book from which the poet has healed and where he dumped the poison which can suffocating poison to which no take and read it carefully and produce a hideous epidemic of suicides.
No lies or not I love that lies in this purifying virtue of poetry.
Legitimate and holy virtue purifying the same has to assert and goes for the poet to his readers.
In the epic and the drama it is seen clearly.
Tyrants, traitors refined, monsters of iniquity may appear in the drama or epic, but in sin shall penance, and the universal condemnation will be your punishment.
It also understood that crimes and the horrors depicted in a poetic work should not take the appearance or likeness Full of real events, as claimed today that called naturalism.
Represented all that live very far without the appropriate ideality, is the opposite of art: no compassion and purifies the terror, Aristotle as he wanted.
It will be more vivid picture, as they say in the day, but evil art and vicious.
