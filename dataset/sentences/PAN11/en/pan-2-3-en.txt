Nothing can be as interesting for the people of the New World as the study of the societies of Spain.
My quick three month trip to Spain is inadequate to make a solid assessment of this particularly as within Europe Spain's society and people are unique due to the ethnicity and geography of the region.
I also did not have enough time to visit several regions that I consider especially important such as Extremadura, Galicia, Asturias, Aragon and Navarra that deserve special attention for various reasons.
