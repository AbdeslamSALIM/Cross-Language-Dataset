Presented the last groups of dragons out to the road for various items forest.
They had their horses at a walk, as if they ache this retreat.
It rebuilt the squad, sounded the voices of officers, and trot to the accompaniment of live metal shock went away in the rear Don Marcelo.
It was beside the barricade, in a deep solitude of silence, as if the world had suddenly depopulated.
Two dogs abandoned by the flight of their masters roamed and sniffed around him, imploring his protection.
They could not find the desired track that land trampled and disfigured by the passage of thousands of men.
A hungry cat spying to the birds that were beginning to invade this place.
With timid peck revuelos waste food expelled by the horses of the dragons.
A stray chicken also appeared to contest their feast to the granujer√≠a winged, hitherto hidden in trees and eaves.
The was reborn silent whisper of the leaves, the hum of insects, respiration Soil burning summer sun, all the sounds of nature, which seemed fearfully contracted under the weight of men in arms.
No exact Desnoyers realized the passage of time.
The calm that surrounded him as he witnessed was unbelievable.
Suddenly he saw something move in the last term of the road, at the top of the hill, there where white tape played the blue horizon.
They were two men on horseback, two soldiers lead that seemed to have escaped from a toy box.
He had brought with him some twins that served to surprise raids on their properties, and looked.
The two riders, gray-green dresses, carried spears and his helmet was topped by a horizontal plate ...
Remained motionless for some time, as horizon scanning.
Then the masses vegetation that puffed dark side of the road were out others and others to form a group.
The toy soldiers are no longer marked his silhouette against the blue horizon.
The whiteness of the road fund are now served, rising above their heads.
They moved slowly, like a troop fearing ambushes and examines her surroundings.
The convenience removed as soon as Don Marcelo had ceased to look.
It was dangerous to catch him in that place.
But to lose her twins, something extraordinary happened by field of view of the lens.
Within walking distance, as if to touch his hand, saw many men who marched under the trees on both sides of the road.
His surprise was still greater than the French were convinced that, for all wore his vest.
The re-examined without the aid of the twins, now close to the barricade.
They were behind, in a lamentable state, offering a colorful variety of uniforms, soldiers line, Zouaves, dragons without a horse.
And mixed with them, guards and gendarmes belonging to people who had received the news late withdrawal.
All kept their weapons.
They reached the barricade, continually looking back to monitor, under the trees, the slow progress of the Hulan.
In front of this heterogeneous army officer was gendarmerie old and obese, with a revolver in his right hand, his mustache bristling with excitement and brilliance murderer in her blue eyes shadowed by the heaviness of her eyelids.
They slid across the barrier of cars without looking at this fellow curious.
Iban to continue his progress through the town, rang a huge explosion, shaking the horizon in front of them, making shake houses. - What is that? - Asked the officer looking for the first time to Desnoyers.
This provided an explanation: it was the bridge, which had just been destroyed.
But his confused troops, clustered random encounter, remained indifferent as if he had lost all touch with reality. - The same die here than elsewhere - the official continued.
Many of the fugitives with a prompt obedience thanked the decision, which will deliver the torture of walking.
Most were glad they cut blasting step.
Were standing instinctively covered places of the barricade.
Others were introduced in a abandoned houses whose doors had violated the dragons to use upstairs.
Everyone seemed pleased to be able to rest while fighting.
The officer was a another group to communicate their orders.
Don Marcelo witnessed such arrangements with the immobility of surprise.
Been so rapid onset and unheard of stragglers still imagined to be dreaming.
Could not be a danger in this situation unreal was all a lie.
The echo of the explosion had filled the road riders.
Coming from every angle, joining the primitive group.
The Hulan galloped with the certainty that the town was abandoned. - Fire! ...
Desnoyers was enveloped in a cloud of crackling, as if the wooden stumps all trees had before his eyes.
The squad stopped abruptly violent.
Several men rolled on the ground.
Some were built to jump out of the way, bending, in order to become less visible.
Other remained lying on his back or face down, arms in front.
Horses without Rider began a mad gallop through the fields, with the reins to the sled, spurred by loose brackets.
And after the hard swing that made him suffer shock and death, scattered, disappearing almost instantly absorbed by the trees.
IV Next to the sacred grove Argensola had a new job more exciting than to point to the location on the map of hosts. - I do now to continue to taube - said to his friends -.
We present four to five, with timeliness of a right person who comes to tea.
Every afternoon, at the hour mentioned, a German plane flew over Paris, dropping bombs.
The intimidation did not produce terror: people accepted the visit as a special show and interesting.
In vain dropping bombs, destroying and killing dormers wounding or old, women and children. "Ah, brigands!" The crowd shook his fist the evil mosquito, barely visible to two thousand feet high, and after this relief eyes followed him from street to street or are immobilized in their seats to watch developments.
A viewer of the most punctual was Argensola.
At four was in the Place de la Concorde face up and eyes open, next to other people linked to him by friendly companion relationships.
Some had flushed and panting by the haste, fearing she had come late to the show ...
Dragged on the faces of twins and glasses; sellers Popular items offered all kinds of optical ...
And for an hour was developing exciting spectacle of aerial hunting, noisy and useless.
The insect tries to put the Eiffel Tower, and the base of this arose booms, while its various platforms fierce strumming spitting machine guns.
When turning on the city musketry sounded on the roof and bottom of streets.
All pulled: the neighbors who had a gun in your home, soldiers on duty, British and Belgian soldiers visiting Paris.
They knew that their shots were useless, but threw for the sake of harassing the enemy even if only with the intention, waiting that chance, in one of his whims, perform a miracle.
But the only miracle was not shooters killed one another with this rash and fruitless fire.
Argensola going from street to street uproar following the enemy bird, trying to guess where their shells were falling, wanting to be among the first that arrived in front of the house bombed emboldened by downloads that answered from below.
Finally, the Tauber, tired of developments, disappeared. "See you tomorrow - I thought the Spanish -.
The morning is perhaps more interesting. " The hours between geographic observations and contemplations of used air to roam around the seasons - especially the Quai d'Orsay - the crowd watching of passengers who escaped from Paris.
The sudden vision of the truth - after illusions that the government had created optimism parts - the certainty that the Germans were next, when a week before the imagined many in full defeat, the flying Taubes on Paris, the mysterious threat of Zeppelins, getting crazy part of the neighborhood.
Stations, military guarded, admitting only those who had purchased a ticket advance.
Some waited for days to receive it turn out.
The more eager to set off on foot, hoping sooner be out of town.
Iban south by car, cab, a gardener in carts, on foot.
This leakage Argensola gazed calmly.
He was of those who stayed.
Had admired many men because they witnessed the siege of Paris in 1870.
But was bothered by the distraction and indifference of his audience present.
Returned to study pleased with the news that he was the bearer, to communicate Descoyers feverish, and this I listened as if he could hear.
The night I told him that the government, Chambers, the diplomatic corps and to the artists of the Comedie Francaise were coming to those hours in special trains to Bordeaux, his companion answered with a shrug.
In the morning he had received a letter from Margaret: Two simple lines drawn in haste.
And nothing else.
The panic had forgotten many affections, cut long-term relationships, but she was superior in character to these inconsistencies from anxiety to flee.
In the afternoon took a dare that she had always forbidden.
He entered the house Margaret lived, speaking at length with the goalkeeper to acquire news.
The good woman expansion could thus give his loquacity, abruptly cut off by the flight of tenants and servitude.
The lady on the main floor - the mother of Margaret - had been the last to leave the house, notwithstanding that he was sick since the departure of his son.
Had left the day before, without saying where they went.
All I knew was that they had taken the train Orsay station.
They fled to the South, like all rich.
And extended his revelations with the vague news that the daughter was very impressed by reports he had received from the war front.
A family member was wounded.
Maybe it was the brother, but the concierge did not know.
With so many innovations, surprises and impressions, learn difficult things.
His family was away.
His father - according to the findings Argensola - also was gone, without saying where.
With the mysterious flight of Margarita left alone in a loneliness that inspired him remorse.
That afternoon, walking along the boulevards, had experienced something with a friend in years, a fellow member of the Circle of fencing frequented by him.
It was the first one was from the beginning of the war, and together they reviewed all colleagues incorporated into army.
Desnoyers questions were answered by the old. "John Doe? ...
disappeared in Charleroi.
And so the heroic and funereal parade.
Other foreign partners, young Poles, British residents Paris Americans in the southern republics, had just registered as volunteers.
The Circle should be proud of these young people who exercised in their weapons during peace: all were in the front exposing her existence ...
But going to the South, like all fleeing the war.
The next morning, Argensola was responsible for getting a rail ticket to Bordeaux.
Fifty francs delivered on time performed the miracle to provide it with a numbered piece of cardboard, represented the conquest of which, for many, days Integer expected. - It's for today - he said to his comrade -.
You go on the train tonight.
Argensola refused to accept the donation of July, which wanted from him all his money.
Heroes need very little, and the painter of souls was encouraged by a heroic resolution.
The brief remarks to charge Gallieni the defense of Paris was hers.
Thought continued until the last effort, as the general drive. - Let them come! - Said with a tragic -.
Would hold, with their supplies of food and wine.
Furthermore, had the project - and his companion disappear - to bring to live with him to some friends who wandered in search a food problem and felt fear in the solitude of their homes.
The danger approaches to good people and add a new attraction to the pleasures of the community.
The study of the rue de la Pompe was going to attend the same parties crazy and desperate stranded ship with supplies plentiful.
Desnoyers left the Orsay station in a first class compartment.
Mentally praised good order with which the authority had arranged everything.
But at the Austerlitz station a stampede attacked the train.
The doors were opened as if they were to break, packages and children came through the windows as well as missiles.
People are pushed to the roughness of a crowd fleeing a fire.
In space reserved for eight people were installed fourteen, the corridors are blocked forever with lots of luggage, which served to new passenger seat.
The villagers invaded preferably luxury cars, believing find them more space.
Those with first-class ticket went in search of worst cars in the vain hope of traveling well off.
On side roads waiting one day before your departure time long trains made up of cattle cars.
Stalls trailers were full of people sitting on the wooden floor or on chairs brought from home.
Each train was a camp that wanted to start, and while he still, a layer of greasy paper and fruit peels was forming over it.
The attackers, when pushed, is tolerated and condoned fraternally. "In war as in war, "they said as a final excuse.
And each one clutching a neighbor to snatch a inch seat, to introduce their small baggage hanging over packages people with the most improbable balances.
Desnoyers was gradually losing its advantages of first occupancy.
He inspired pity these poor people who had waited the train at four in the morning at eight o'clock in the evening.
Women wailed in exhaustion, right in the corridor, looking fierce envy those who occupied a seat.
July finally give way, dividing between the needy and improvident all foods that had provided Argensola.
The restaurants seemed stations looted.
During the long wait the train, only military were on the platforms, soldiers running to hear the call of the trumpet to return to take his place in the strings of cars going up and rose to Paris.
In sidings, rail of war long hoped that the route is free to continue travel.
Cuirassiers, wearing a yellow vest on his chest of steel, were sitting with legs hanging on the doors of wagons stables, inside which they neighing.
The slender throats 75 pointed to the top like telescopes.
He spent the night in the corridor, sitting on the edge of a suitcase, watching others slept the brutalization of fatigue and excitement.
It was a cruel and endless night of shock, clatter cut by snoring and pauses.
At each station, the trumpets sounded hastily as if the enemy was near.
The soldiers from the South ran to their jobs, and a new wave of men were dragged along the rails to Paris.
They seemed happy and eager to arrive early to the places of slaughter.
Julio, looking out a window, heard the screams and dialogue on these platforms impregnated with a pungent odor of men and mules.
All showed an unshakable confidence. "The Boches! ...
but there was no rather than the bayonet charge and fled like rabbits. " The faith of those who went to meet death in contrast to the panic and doubt the fleeing Paris.
An old gentleman and decorated, kind of official retirement was Desnoyers to questions when the train resumed its march. "Do you think that will come to Tours?" Before receiving a reply fell asleep.
Stupefying sleep wore her down the aisle lead foot.
Then the old man woke up suddenly. "Do you think that will come to Bordeaux ?...¬ª And their desire not to stop until you reach your family will absolutely safe shelter did accept vague answers as oracles.
They were armed with rifles old, wore a red kepi as the only distinctive military.
In the Bordeaux train station, the civil crowd, struggling to get out or for assaulting new cars, mingled with the troops.
Many were men of color, indigenous handles large gray pants and a red cap on black or tan face.
North continued to the tight roll of the armed masses.
Desnoyers saw a train of wounded from the fighting in Flanders and Lorraine.
Uniforms cooling of dirt fatigued with the whiteness of the bandages that held members sore or broken heads defended.
All seemed to smile with their mouths livid and feverish eyes to the first land of the south that showed through the morning mist, crowned sun, covered with the royal robe of its branches.
Northern men spread their hands to the fruits that were offered for women, picking grapes with the sweet delight of the country.
Spent four days in Bordeaux, dazed and disoriented by the agitation of a provincial town suddenly converted into capital.
The hotels were full, many characters were content with a domestic room.
The Head of State was installed in the prefecture ministries were established in schools and museums, two theaters were enabled future meetings of the Senate and the House popular.
July found a seedy hotel and equivocal at the end of the street by passers-by constantly damp.
A cherub adorned the glass door.
In his room, the mirror was recorded women's names, phrases intranscribibles, in memory of lodging an hour ...
And still some ladies Paris, engaged in seeking an accommodation, envied so fortunate.
A disciple of its glory, who kept the old style in her nurse's uniform, he gave vague reports. "" The little Madame Laurier? ...
He remembered have heard someone who lived nearby ...
The first person I met upon arrival was Chichi.
I will end by living alone. "Then he found his mother, hugs and tears
