The mountain that occupies the center be confused with a piece of the Pyrenees, and its beautiful houses, smaller than the figures, and trees with figurative evónimus twigs, leaves behind the very nature.
The plain is where the most beautiful and most characteristic figures, the laundresses who washed in the stream, the paver and smugglers driving their herds, a leading civil guard two rogues prisoners, knights riding in luxurious camel barouches next to a King Magician and Parrot the blind playing guitar in a huddle where the shepherds browse have become the portal.
For medium to medium, a tram passes him just what the neighborhood of Salamanca, and as you have two rails and wheels, every moment you are running from east to west to the astonishment of the Black King, do not know what this devilish machine.
In front of the Portal is a lovely square, whose center is occupied by a flask of fish and not far from where she sells a boy's pick, and dance gently two nice.
The old selling fritters and chestnut on the corner are the funniest parts of this wonderful village of mud, and preferably by themselves attract the eyes of the children crowd.
Above all, this little boy in a tattered hand has a lottery ticket, and the another robs the chestnuts out of the basket nicely to Aunt Lambrijas ago cackle them all.
In short, the birth number one in Madrid is that of the house, one of the main and collected in their classrooms to children nicest and most thoughtful of twenty streets around.
VIII Well what about the tree?
Consists of branches of oak and cedar.
The solicitous friend of the house has made with great difficulty, he states that he never left his hands so complete and perfect work.
You can not have outstanding gifts of their leaves.
Are under the assumption of a little boy was present, in greater number than the sands of the sea.
Sweets wrapped in paper shells Curly, mandarins, who are infants oranges, chestnuts tucked into blankets silver paper, boxes containing confectionery homeopathic globules, various figurines on foot and on horseback, as God hath created to be perfected what then mayonnaise or sell it Scropp has been put there by a hand so generous and skillful.
Lit that tree footlights life in such abundance that, as a guest ratio of four years there are more lights than stars in the sky.
The joy of children swarm can not be compared to any human feeling: the joy ineffable heavenly choirs in the presence of the Supreme Good and Beauty Addition.
Superabundance satisfaction almost makes them wise, and are as perplexed in seraphic rapture with all the soul in his eyes, savoring in advance what they eat, and swimming, as blessed angels, pure ether of things sweet and delicious, sweet-smelling flowers and cinnamon, in the uncreated essence of the game and treat.
IX But suddenly felt a rumor that came from them.
Everyone looked at the ceiling, and as did not see anything, he looked from one to the other, laughing.
Could hear loud murmur of wings brushing against the wall and crashing into the ceiling.
If you were blind, would have believed that all pigeon pigeons of all the universe had gone into the room.
Noticed, yes, suddenly, something inexplicable and phenomenal.
All of the Nativity figurines moved, all without noise varied from site.
The tram car went up to the top of the mountains, and the Kings put the legs in the creek.
The turkeys were cast without permission in Portal, and San Jose went all embarrassed, as if to know the origin of such strange confusion.
If at first the translations are made no mess, then put together a racket such that there seemed to walk one hundred thousand plodding hands to mix it up.
It was a miniature universal cataclysm.
The mountain was coming down, lacking its secular foundations, and the creek course ranged, and casting off channel their Espejillos, horribly flooded the plain, the houses sank the roof in Sandy, the Portal was shaking as if it were fought with horrible winds, and as quenched many lights the sun was clouded and darkened the lights of day and night.
To the amazement that such a phenomenon occurred some little ones laughed and others cried wildly.
Hácenlo dead children are in heaven, and which allows Father God, this night, they come to play with the Nativity. " All this came to an end, and was again flutter away.
Attended many of those present to examine the damage, and a man said: "It has sunk the table and all figures have been upset." Began to collect the figures and to put in order.
After careful counting and recognize one by one all the pieces, something was missing.
Searched and researched, but to no avail.
X And close the day, the rioters were way to heaven, happier than a lark, hopping through those clouds, and there were millions of millions, all precious, pure, divine, with short white wings that beat faster than the fastest bird on earth.
The band formed was larger than what they can cover their eyes in space visible and covered the moon and stars, as if the sky full of clouds. "A rush, to hurry, young gentlemen, who is going to be day - one said, - and Grandpa is going to fight if we are late.
But what have you got there? - This - said Celinina pressing against his chest two coarse clay animals .-- They are pa me, pa me. - Look, kid, pull those dolls.
Well now it is known that salt of the earth.
Know that although the games have eternal Heaven, always delicious, Grandpa sent us to the world tonight that wrapped up a bit in the Birth.
Have fun up there too tonight, and I think we sent down to them dizzy with the great noise that we put ....
But if Father God let us down and walk through the houses, is on condition that we not take anything, and you've striven that. " Celinina did not take charge of these powerful reasons, and most pressing against your chest two animals, repeated: - Pa me, pa me. - Look, dummy, - said the other, - if you ignore that we're going to cause an upset.
Low in flight, and leave that which is of the earth and the earth should be.
I wait in this cloud. " Celinina finally relented, and down, gave land to his theft.
XI So noted that Celinina beautiful body, what the person was visible, in his hands, instead of flowers, two clay critters.
Neither women the veiled, neither the father nor the mother knew how to explain this, but the pretty girl, so mourned of all, entered the land in their cold little hands squeezing the Mule and Ox.
FEATHER IN THE WIND Ó THE JOURNEY OF LIFE Poe ....[ 1] INTRODUCTION On the matted floor of the yard between an eggshell and a piece of radish, about where they drank half a bowl of chicken and about two inches of arugula that had been born at the site without asking anyone's permission, lay a small and very light pen, apparently fall some pigeon neck neighbor, ten minutes before had stopped stroking female oh condescension!
John that was raging on the rooftops of the neighborhood.
The corral was sad, ugly and lonely.
From where the pen was not seen anything but the top of some brown planted outside the wall, the steeple of the church with its dented auction, after the manner of old hat, the big stick and a poplar lackluster invalid and almost dying, and the tiles of the adjacent house, which on stormy days sprinkled with plenty of cried the yard and garden.
The vine, the vine and honeysuckle bush, barely covered between three full extent of the wall, bristling with broken glass on top, which served as impregnable bulwark against foxes and little boys.
This reduced the landscape, in addition to the vast and ever-beautiful sky, so splendid day as imposing and mysterious night.
The pen (why should not we give it life?) Lay, as we, along with several objects rather ignoble, own the place, and constantly exposed to be trodden by the barbarian plant geese, chickens and even other little animals but clean and decent had room in a nearby swamp.
I must not say that the pen must be very boring, as if a soul have delicate, air and supple body, the consequence is that the soul could not live happy described in the corral.
By a mysterious harmony between the elements of that be if the body looked like a ghost of matter, the soul had been created to fly and soar heights, rising to the longest distance possible on the ground, in which ever mud should touch the lace of her subtle almost imperceptible cover.
For this was born certainly, but it, like us men remained predestination an empty word.
Was the poor in the corral, lamenting his fate, staring at the sky, without distraction in the wind see the whites of her clothes festoons undefiled, and saying in the unknown language of feathers: "I do not know how annoying stand this life.
It's better to die a hundred times. " Other equally sad lot said, but at the same moment a gust of wind who put in turmoil all straw and small objects thrown in the pen, the suspended, Unexpected oh joy!
raising it on the ground more than half a yard.
For short time was fluctuating back and forth, threatening to fall at times and going back others with large din of the chickens, who saw this white thing was walking through the air such majesty, went behind her waiting for her in the fall, hoping it was something eating.
But the wind blew more loudly, and with a strong swirling around the campus the pen, drew it out quickly.
When she saw higher than the wall, higher than the house, the chestnut, the height of poplar, trembled all over with excitement and admiration.
Arribita there, the wind swayed, holding no violent shaking, seemed to sway in visible hammock or in the arms of a loving genius.
Down the pen with chickens scratching constantly restless, the garden, the house, the chestnut trees poplar, how small what once seemed so big!
Then, the whole expanse of beautiful Valley village of houses, trees, flowers, cattle, in the distance the mountains with their slopes covered with forests, red and blue eminences and peaks encaperuzadas with a whiteness in which our traveler thought he saw huge piles of feathers above the endless sky, the morning sun making bright colors throughout the landscape, water scribbling ray of light producing reflections quivering in the foliage of the elms, and reverberating in the crops straw scattered here and there patches of poppies.
Tremendous thing would be to fall back into the corral.
The pen, at the height of his joy, found no better way to express it spinning on its axis, so that although its members orearan wet and shivering, bathed in the sun fluffy, cupping with some tiny fringe vanity that your body is composed.
The sun shone in between the interstices of one thousand wonderful fit, and our traveler was seen threads of glass dressed more tenuous than that spiders tend branch to branch, and covered with diamonds, emeralds and rubies ranging from light to every move, and so tiny, the grains of sand mountains appear at his side.
Extending the view of the valley, the mountains, the horizon, and wanting to cross it all to the end, was in the pen work of a moment.
His amazement and joy knew no bounds, and if at first surprise kept at that height, rambling, without detracting from their status First, after a bit and feeling Serenada on his chest (?) the fire of enthusiasm, was launched in the immense space, genie arms.
Gone pen, house, village, the tower of the church, as a giant panicked, was walking too large to miss Zanchetta of view.
In the excitement of that giddy flight, the pen sometimes rose so high, I could barely distinguish objects, others down to almost to the ground, and looked their fleeting image in the green surface of the puddles.
Sometimes going back then, that seemed confused with the clouds and disappear into the vast ocean of space down sometimes Therefore, it very nearly touched the ground, and in language unknown to the wind said: "Put me down a little friend, I get dizzy at these heights, "or" please pick me up, buddy, I'm going to fall in that quagmire. " The wind, compliant vehicle, up and down as desired, always walk, and spent valleys, rivers, mountains, hills, towns, without stopping.
On their journey, the pen never stopped admire what he saw.
The birds spent singing along to it, the butterflies stopped, watching her in amazement, we fail to understand if it was a living thing or object carried by the wind.
When they were near land and went skimming over brambles and thorny plants, you'd think all bristling barbs and claws to get it, and fly over a pond, geese returning from the bank's head sideways at her, and hopefully to see her fall, ran screeching after it: - "Lift me up, buddy," he cried, refusing to hear these barbarians. " CANTO FIRST And rose to the top of the mountain, passing the ridge, and traveled another valley, and so all the way, never stopping.
Both walked the pen, feeling satisfied their curiosity, swirled, gave a few turns on itself, and told the genius that drove: "You know we've run enough?
Although he wanted to leave the pen to travel the world, you believe that what I like is the quiet and peaceable life.
For a moment I thought that happiness is to fly from here to there, seeing different things every minute, and receive different impressions.
And I'm convinced it is better to remain quietly in one place a not be as ugly as poultry, live without fear or danger.
I see there, near the river, large trees, which I think the most beautiful place we found on our trip. " Drew near and saw indeed that the shade of those trees was the site most appealing and delicious than a pen could aspire to spend their days.
Fine lawn covered the ground near the river ran with gentle flow, not so quick to drag and Turning the soil of the green margins, nor so slow that muddied the waters: easy was to count all the stones from the bottom, but not the multitude of fish that wander over its transparent glass.
The branches of trees, living sifting the sunshine, kept in warm darkness the small meadow, and from there all the insects had fled importunate and dirty, and all birds irrelevant and frivolous.
The few things that were there pitch or with a permanent residence, were the most learned and distinguished of creation: insects dresses gold and decorated with wonderful jewels, birds sang sentimental and discrete their love in courtly style, and only at certain hours of the morning or afternoon.
It was noon, and all were silent at the top of the branches, entertaining spirit in abstract meditations. 'Fresh and beautiful place this is! - Said the ruffled feathers of enthusiasm to be there .-- Here I spend my whole life, all, all, I repeat not safely complete range of purpose.
Wandered beneath the shade of the trees, sliding on the cool grass, when he saw approaching a shepherd, guiding two dozen sheep with the odd lamb, and a dog that served custody and companionship.
The pastor was concerned, walking, weaving a crown of flowers that brought on the side, and such was her beauty, grace and elegance, the pen was absorbed.
He sat the girl, and the pen again soaring through the air, spun around his admiring up close and from afar, and the whiteness of complexion, and expression and brightness eyes and black hair, and his lips turned on, each and every one of the perfections copy of such creature. "Here I have to be a lifetime - the traveler exclaimed in his convoluted language .-- This really is live.
and what a great thing to love!
I do not know where, or hide in your clothes and meat tickling estarme there for all eternity?
This drives me crazy ...
and indeed I am madly in love.
Here and not away from it for a moment, I spend all life. " The pen was flying and falling away around the pastor, until he came to rest gently on his shoulder, and he made a thousand grimaces and fuss with their fringes.
He saw the girl that object White, who at first tried to be anything but delicate falling branches of the tree, and took her, squeezed between his fingers and threw it from him with contemptuous indifference.
Much took our unfortunate traveler return from his swoon.
He opened his eyes in vain sought the object of his tender passion, recognizing the site, shaking his bruised sockets and broken, and gave the wind its complaints in this way: "Oh, little wind, get me out of here, for the blessed souls, lift me up, I am dying of sadness.
I want to run again, as I now understand that happiness does not exist in what I thought.
Love is not only fatigue and pain.
Just love that I know tired and what it brings.
That is, the way I like: Lift me up all you can.
Look, there in the distance is reached to see a house that has to be very large: Do you see how bright the sunlight, as if it were silver, and next is again and again, many, many houses?
Thank God I find what I like.
Let's go right there, and let us hills and valleys, places unfit for this my genius ...
Now, now you look closely the city.
In this magnificent palace that we first saw we have to put.
Run, run more, which I do not think we ever.
NOTE: [1] Sorry oh reader!
was about to commit the irreverence to call this poem.
SECOND CANTO Soon found themselves near a palace of marble, so great and beautiful that even the same mysterious genius, that led to our friend, he was preoccupied with such magnificence.
Revelry could be heard there as dance or feast, and amazing music.
Flags floated on the minarets and rooftops, and windows reason people looked happy and busy. "Inside, my friend - said the pen, - Colemon this balcony is wide open." They did so, found inside a large room in which there were even a hundred people vast sitting around table, full of rich delicacies and adorned with flowers, all set sovereign art and magnificence.
Was equal to the number of men to women, and if between had those of different ages, they were all young and beautiful.
The servants wore very rich costumes, and endless harmonious musicians played sonatas on top of a large rostrum.
The guests were lying on cushions covered in colorful tapestries adorned them with flowers and dressed so lightly and gracefully, her beauty could not fail to appear embossed with ornaments so indiscreet.
The laughter, voices and music, impressing the hearing, the aroma of flowers and the smell snack foods and spirits, injuring the nose; the liveliness of the eyes, the variety of colors, affecting vision, produced in that place a fascination that would put the kibosh on the strength of all the hermits of the Thebaid
