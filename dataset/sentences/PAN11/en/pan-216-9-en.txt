He felt immense pain, as if his whole body had lost the shelter of the wrapper, leaving the meat exposed to air alive.
Wanted to follow his path, but on his head rose the coast forming a concave wall é unapproachable.
Unable to get out.
His body would not float to a beach inhabited.
The only ones who were going to meet his death crabs were huge boulders traced the search for food in the surf, the seagulls that dropped vertically, with wings outstretched, from the top of the cliff.
He felt at once all its weaknesses, all his misery, while the blood still staining purple the tiny lakes of the rocks.
Three months later, on arriving at Barcelona, ??he found his mother as he had seen during His agony in the Portuguese coast ...
During his stay in the hospital wrote several times to Dona Cristina with a cheerful tone and confident, claiming important occupations in Lisbon.
At his entrance, the good lady left her eternal work of lace, pale, hands trembling and glassy eyes.
Should know the whole truth, and if you do not know, is the instinct warned Ulysses seeing mother ailing, emaciated, vacillating between arrogance and brokenness physical, as well as the brave as they left the torture chamber. - Oh, my son ...
If I wanted to be a sailor, could be, but respectable vessels, the service of a great company, following a certain career ladders, not rolling capriciously by all the seas, mixing with international banditry offered ports to enhance the crew.
And Odysseus, to the astonishment of Dona Cristina, took that decision.
The good lady was not alone.
A niece lived with her, as if her daughter.
The sailor had to dig in depths of his memory to remember a little girl of four years who was to crawl through the beach in the village of his mother while he, with a severity of man, having heard the old Secretary of the Municipality of bygone glories of the Catalan sea.
She was the daughter of a Blanes - the only poor family - who commanded the ships of their relatives and died of yellow fever by Central American port.
Ferragut could not explained how the creature reptile sand, with an eternal green pearl hanging from their noses, was that very young slender, pale-brown rice, which held its massive hair similar to an ebony hull with two smaller spirals to the ears.
Her eyes seemed to be changing sea inks: black a few hours, others blue, green and deep when reflected sunlight like a golden point.
He was attracted by its simplicity, by the grace of his words and shy smiles.
It was something of irresistible new this ruedamundo that had known only of laughter coppery bestial, Asian yellow cat or gestures of the great European ports, to the first words ask to drink and sing about the knees of the host, putting his cap as a testimony of love.
He had been the subject of their conversations Dona Cristina when both entertained the monotonous hours knitting lace the use of people.
Ulysses passing to her room, saw his portraits of the time was simply added to board an ocean liner.
Stolen tape had undoubtedly the rooms of her aunt.
I admired that first adventure since long before meeting him.
One afternoon, he told the sailor to the two women how he had saved on the coast of Portugal.
The mother heard him turning his eyes, trembling hands to move the bobbin of lace.
Suddenly we heard a scream.
Tape was, I could not listen anymore.
And Ulysses thanked his tears, their cries seizure, his eyes wide with an expression of terror.
Ferragut's mother worried about the future of this poor niece.
His only salvation was marriage, and the good lady had set his sights on a relative who went beyond forty, requiring the input of these youth to refresh your bachelor life mature.
It was the wisest of the family.
Cristina admired him because he could not read without the aid of glasses and drank in the conversation because Latin words, as well as clerics.
He taught rhetoric and Latin at the Institute of Manresa, and spoke of being moved one day to Barcelona, ??glorious end an illustrious career.
I tell you want to tape, and will be a lucky girl to marry this man so wise, so serious.
Listening, Ulysses began to think what might break a bone, a professor of marine rhetoric without incurring liability.
One day, Film searched the house and spent a thimble mat that served as many years.
Of soon ceased to rummage, blushed and looked down.
His eyes had met the fleeting glance of his cousin.
In the fourth of Ulysses were tapes, skeins wire, an old fan, deposited on paper and books, by the same mysterious ebb he had drawn his portraits of her mother's bedroom of his cousin.
The Marine liked to stay home.
He spent long hours meditating with his elbows on the table, but at the same time attentive to a whisper of light steps that sonar could at any moment in the hall immediately.
All I knew: straight and spherical trigonometry, cosmography, the laws of winds and storms, the latest discoveries ocean.
And later, when tape was the room to the bedroom of his aunt to bring a pious book, stumbled into the hallway with Ulysses.
Not know, had trembled for their existence.
Then a hungry mouth slammed in his two kisses aggressive. "Here, and takes !...» Ferragut repented when he saw his cousin trembling against the wall, pale death, watery eyes. - I hurt.
Almost to his knees, begging his forgiveness, clenched his fists as if to hit, punishing their audacity.
But she would not let him go ... "No, no moaning !...» And while this protest, his arms closed in a ring around the neck of Ulysses.
His head leaned forward, seeking the shelter of his shoulder.
A moderately moist mouth joined at the mouth of the ocean, while it's beard was wet with a mist of tears.
When, weeks later, Cristina Dona heard the request of his son, his first move was a protest.
A mother hears with benevolence advance any claim on a daughter but it is ambitious and demanding when it comes to a child.
She had dreamed of something brighter.
Also, I was prepared for what he had seen in his childhood, to be the wife of a Marine ...
Then, Ferragut, who could not live idle, returned to sea, but as first officer of an ocean liner that made regular trips to South America.
For him, this amounted to be used in a floating office, visiting the same ports, invariably repeating equal work.
Fixed his eye tape on the calendar as the wife of an employee's fixed on the clock.
He was certain that after two months, he would appear again coming across the land, charged exotic gifts, like a husband who returns from the office with a bouquet purchased the street.
Returning from the first two trips went to wait on the dock, looked around her gold lace cap and blue coat with passengers on ships that were moving decks with the joy of coming to Europe.
On the next trip, Dona Cristina forced her to stay home, fearing that the excitement agglomerations and jeopardize its next port motherhood.
Then, in each of its arrivals, Ferragut saw a new child, but always the same: first, a wrapper of batiste and lace held by a nurse Sunday best, then - when he was captain Transatlantic - a little boy with skirts, chubby, round head covered with silky lint, tending to it's arms and finally, a boy who began to go to school and seeing his father grabbed his hard right hand, admiring it with deep eyes, as though he saw in his person the realization of all the forces of the universe.
Don Pedro the professor continued to visit the home of Dona Cristina, although less frequently.
The certainty of its importance is not allowed to doubt that she would have accepted with joy.
Despite this conviction, could not contain aggressiveness at times ironic, that is vented classic inventing nicknames.
The young wife of Odysseus, bent over her lace work, Penelope was awaiting the return of errant husband.
Cristina accepted this nickname, for knowing vaguely that it was a good queen customs.
But the day the professor, by logical deduction, called Telemachus to Tape son, Grandma protested. - His name is Stephen, like his grandfather ...
Telemachus That is the name of theater.
In one of his trips took Ulysses a scale of a few hours at the port of Valencia to see his godfather.
From time to time received letters from the poet, growing shorter and sad, shaky letters that betrayed its decline.
Upon entering the office felt the same impression of the sleepers of the legends, who believe waking up after a few hours of sleep and stayed dozens of years.
Everything was like in its infancy: the busts of the great poets at the height of the libraries, crowns in their glass cages, jewelry and statues won by force of consonants in their windows and pedestals, the books of brilliant back to forming tight battalions along shelves.
But the whiteness of the bust had taken a chocolate color, the bronzes were red with rust, was green gold, crowns are leafless.
It seemed there was rained ash on the immobility of things.
People offered the same aspect of neglect and decay.
Ulysses met the poet skinny and yellow, deep in an armchair, his beard white luenga, one eye almost closed and Another huge open.
Upon seeing the ocean, broad chest, strong man, tan, Labarta is began to mourn a child hiccups, as if crying on the misery of human illusions, on the deceptive brevity of life that needs the waves of constant renewal.
More work still cost Ferragut recognize a lady that was small and cramped with the poet.
His skeleton hung flaccid fat tissues, like rags of past luxury.
The head was small, her face wrinkling had the wintry apples, plums, of all fruits that contract and mummified, losing their liquid. "Doña Pepa !...» The tuteaban old couple now in the presence of Ulysses, with the quiet amorality of those who are close to death and forget the fears and scruples of a life that is crumbling behind him.
The ocean seen in this physical misery the sad end of an absurd diet, happy and childish candy serve as the basis of nutrition, the major rice-dish daily watermelon and melon filling in between meals, ice cream served in cups enormous, spreading the perfume of honeyed snow.
They both spoke sigh of illnesses, who judged incomprehensible, attributing to ignorance of doctors.
Consumption was suddenly attacking the people of the countries abundant.
His life was smelted in a blast of liquid sugar ...
And yet guessed Ferragut the disobedience of the old couple to the disciplines of the regime, its concealment Child tricks to please their own fruits and syrups, the charm of its existence.
The captain had to return to Grao, where he waited his transatlantic soon to sail for South America.
The poet cried again, kissing his godson.
I would not see more to this giant that seemed to repel their weak hugs with the bellows of his breath. - Odysseus, my son ...
Valencia always thinking ...
Make for it all you can ...
What he vowed all the poet, not understanding what was expected of him Valencia, ocean simple wandering the seas.
Ferragut felt like to laugh and to mourn when receiving a kiss from his mouth wrinkled, whose hair had become spikes.
It was a kiss that recalls old beauty in contact with a handsome, a barren woman kiss caressing the child might have. - The unfortunate Carmelo! ...
He spoke of the decline of his poet with pity of a strong and healthy.
Is terrified to think about the years he could survive his master.
A year later, the captain found in Port Said, at the back of the Philippines, a letter his godfather.
Doña Pepa had died, and Labarta, shaking his tearful stupor of its doldrums, the long goodbye with a song.
Ulysses spent the eyes of the newspaper clipping was within the letter containing the last verses of the poet.
After that, it was undoubtedly his approaching end.
He had no opportunity to see him again: he died while traveling.
Upon landing in Barcelona his mother gave him a letter written almost in agony. "Valencia, my son always Valencia!" And after repeating several times this recommendation, let him know it was his heir.
The books, statues, all the glorious memories Labarta, went to Barcelona for decorate the house of the sailor.
Telemachus could entertain the small breaking the old crowns troubadour, tearing pictures of volumes, with the unconsciousness of a spirited child who his father is far away and was exposed to two ladies who adore him.
Furthermore, the poet left his godson an old house in Valencia, more land and a certain amount in marketable securities.
Total: thirty thousand dollars.
The other guardian of his childhood, the strong Triton, remained insensitive to the passage of time.
Ferragut met him several times, on arriving at Barcelona, ??installed in your home, in dull hostility Dona Cristina, dedicating to Ribbon and her son a part of the care that was previously only Ulysses.
Steven wanted the little house knew the great-grandparents. - Did I leave it? ...
The doctor wandered bewildered through the port of Barcelona ...
Too much noise, too much movement.
He walked proudly beside Odysseus, making the adventures of his years of ocean tramp and cosmopolitan.
Saw in him the greatest Ferragut: sea man his grandparents, but with capacity; adventurous of all the oceans as he had been but with a place on the bridge, coated conferring absolute command responsibility and danger.
To re-embark Ulysses Triton retreating to their domains. - Next time - said to console to leave without the child of his nephew
