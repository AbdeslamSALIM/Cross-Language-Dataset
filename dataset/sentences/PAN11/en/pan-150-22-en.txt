Except for the slight mention they deserve to Leon Pinelo and Nicolas Antonio, and that reference to what he said the Dominican, Betancourt's book resumes not until today, said two or three times, not distinction, by Prescott in his Conquest of Peru, among the materials that served to reconstruct the past or fantasizing that vast monarchy.
But the title under which makes his short quotations, showing that the manuscript he had at hand is that of Fray Gregorio original or copy, but a transfer of existing in the same codex L j 5 library Escorial of keeping anonymous the second part of the Chronicle of Peru Cieza de Leon, and that the famous North-American historian probably would receive another shipment of that second part, endorsed by the person who took the roles of Lord Kingsborough to Juan de Sarmiento, and sent to London by Mr.

At least, as the summer I found myself 1875 in a thick bound volume many years ago and all its pages - and I presume that would find the same luck that brought the copy to Kingsborough - consisted only of the principles and the first eighteen chapters, the last incomplete.
And that's not the worst, but in my opinion, this fragment, although substantial, is only now hearing the Narrative of the Incas.
The silence of bibliophiles and the Dominican chroniclers, on the one hand and another on any results of my efforts in search of the MS., held and used Brother Gregorio, and surely the convent Legaria where he died, are ominous signs.

I will not deny that in these things as good Spanish, am guilty of impatience, but what if I had Betanzos to wait for ever?, which could well happen.
Moreover, what makes them remains of his treatise, I think that really mattered and that is highly useful for studying Peruvian antiquities, and not only by the news that they only intended, and for the invaluable fact been picked up and learned all the data they contain since the early years of the Conquest until 1551, but especially for its style, that makes none
