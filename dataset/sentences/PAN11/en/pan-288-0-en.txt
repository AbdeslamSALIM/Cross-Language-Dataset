Thus mused Poldy, forging and disrupting fantastic cases.
It was like a child that entertains in keeping up with care and good balance and complicated high house of cards, then knocks him for fun and games raising others.
In short, Poldy not know what to expect or why their minds.
No statement itself what Castles raised by it was the most liked.
V Poldy sought solitude then more than ever.
There was such abundance of frogs, lizards, frogs, toads and other vermin, which was the land of promise that bird to mosquito, which, by their large size and the extraordinary length their wings, covered in extreme shiny and black feathers, knowing that was left male.
Poldy he was always seen as just did not understand their language, not asked if he was married, and in Spain we often ask the parrot, which respond to the question.
It was also a mystery to Poldy where the stork nesting.
He saw the shores of the lagoon.
The bird castañetazos greeted with loud, hopping and flapping wings, which open covering more than two feet.
It was one of a kind notabilísimo individual merit.
With this, nothing could be made clear.
The stork was very friendly and very gentle with the young Countess.
No grudge against him because would have taken the fabric of the verses.
Rubbed his head and neck from the garment the pretty lady, and seemed to like that she pass a hand through his long neck and wings, preening him.
These silent conference, which took place two or three times a week, lasted little and we can say that they were very entertaining.
