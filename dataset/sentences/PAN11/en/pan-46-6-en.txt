Up to the stage to hello, and sometimes, as required by her, there was one or two acts.
In these Sometimes the lady used to retire to the anteroom and chat with him closely in the shade discrete curtains.
When he got tired, or the scene singing a piece of hard, kept silence the young man turned his back and listened for a while.

However, his clear and beautiful eyes slipped a slight smile that the young man could not anticipate.
Encouraged with this success, always she brought her hair so far dissimulation and after long preparations and hesitations dared pose the lips on it.
That feeling was so vivid, so rich, that kept many days in the mouth and made him happy.
But one night, or because the lady was angry, or because he enjoyed in mortify a little detachment was treated fairly while was in the box, left him abandoned as she chatted pleasantly Pascuala with one of his young and aristocratic friends.

And he retired as usual to anteroom and began chatting with the friendliness and openness always.
But when she turned her back to hear the opera, was so upset and confused that not even dare to kiss your hair, but the hairstyle was low and better opportunity than ever.

And a quick glance out to make sure that there were watching, took their hands, and told his breath-fired cheeks: - Yes, I love you I love you more than you can imagine.
Come tomorrow at three in the house.
Clementina did not have the impressiveness of his adoring female.
The violent emotion I had just experienced together with the joy that these words evoked in her chest was disrupted thereby, they began to mourn as a child.
She then pushed into a corner and rose strongly, with its graceful figure covering the space left open the curtain.
His face shone with happiness sorcerer.

For she was a sweet resurrection of the impressions of adolescence matured suddenly transformed into happy reality.
Until then he had delusions have resembled each other so much that from the beginning carried inside a germ boredom.
Always remained at the bottom of the heart a feeling of defiance against relationships that are not brought him any strong feelings, even new pleasures.

That first breath of Venus to leave the sea foam that repeated the entire universe rang then in his soul and rocked gently.
His soul, he was silent and sad as Nature before the goddess of beauty sigh.
Very few men reach a similar said: have the first woman you love, arrive on time to pick the fruit flavored love.
For Raymond, this inclination shy adolescent yearning and melancholy full of anxieties, merged with the love of manhood, appetizing and sensual.
