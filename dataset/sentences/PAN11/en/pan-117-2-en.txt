One day she was fired also the only house that already attended. - Basilisa - said Mrs. - You can no longer bring water and scrub floors.
It is you killing and can not meet properly.
I need to find another assistant ...
but I'm not rich, you know ...
we have many expenses ... - Yes, ma'am, yes, I understand - said the humble and unhappy with forced smile .-- Too has done for me.
Left the house, its last refuge, his heart tightened and legs unsteady.
His son slept in the crib the sweet dream and serenity of the angels.
The poor fell to his knees and sobbed for a long time.
He lifted his head at last, and said silently watching the child: - No, not go to the hospice!
Multiple Wives, and even some lady too, had advised.
But the idea of ??leaving the son of her womb in the hands of women employees sordid and brutal horror had forever.
He fought bravely as he could, depriving it of necessary sustenance enough times to feed the child, which already had about three years.
He was the use of begging, but besides the horror that caused him, understood very well that his days were numbered.
And dying it, what would become of the creature?
He pondered a good room with dry eyes fixed on the child, repeating from time to time the same phrase: - No, not go to the hospice!
Rose suddenly animated by a fatal desire, kissed her son passionately until managed to wake him, envolviolo in a blanket and holding it at arms out of the house.
From the top of the worms, where Basilisa lived, could be seen arriving the wharf and fishing boats.
On the square, and the long street running from it to the church by the sea, also ran a lot of people.
Could not answer, he felt a lump in my throat. - Come to Daddy? "- Insisted the young.
He paused a moment to catch his breath. - Yes, let's see, rich mine - said after .-- Do not you want to go to heaven with him? - No, I with you.
And at the same time choked with tender arms and covered her face with kisses. - Why are you crying, Mom? - Asked surprised to feel on the lips bitterness of tears .-- Can not you got anything?
Take my horn ...
And he offered a lead that had cost Basilisa two quarters.
For Gil, who did not understand existence without messing with something, the greatest misfortune that could be weighed on a was human hands are empty.
The mother pressed her against his chest, laid on her rosy cheeks a shower of kisses and continued the race.
At a certain spot where the road is separated from the shore the sea and then, let them fall and took a veredita leading to it.
He put his son on the floor and kneeling then tearfully prayed a prayer tablets, not being addressed in the form, it should not listen to the Almighty.
It was almost dark.
The sea was still, dark, waiting impassively to tears of that unfortunate woman should come as so bitter to increase the flow of its waters.
Side of the creek there was the silhouette of the pier and three or four pataches that usually lie at anchor nearby.
The group of fishing boats, a little apart, moving and still ringing with the cries of women employed in opening the fish's belly, while the husband lay seriously as a tavern in the town.
Attended Basilisa a moment to those sounds so familiar.
She also hoped her husband at one time, stroking her with his eyes upon arrival, took from his hands the water binder, the case of rigging and the basket of supplies and took them home with joy.
Mariano coming soon later and sat at the fireside, with dancing between his paws to cute boy which had a few months.
The widow was a long time staring at the bank group, which appeared as a report and movable mass.
His son, sitting on the lawn, playing the trumpet jamming ground.
Where are we going? - Shouted the child.
The womb from which he now poured out not to break apart spring.
An old sailor, who was at that time among those rocks for fishing for octopus, heard noise and provided the first aid to the child.
Ran to the news soon flooded the place of people.
The case produced a deep impression.
Women wept and went to tender infant from hand to hand and caresses lavished a thousand cares.
Many offered to adopt and there was dispute over who had to take it.
Aware ladies of the village and moved, also wanted to pick up the orphan.
The fishermen's wives then gave to do so in the interest of the former.
It was therefore held by Ms Eloisa, Mrs.
Martin Houses, seconded by another six or eight ladies in no way wanted to give up participation as charitable work.
Gil's childhood (which was the name the orphan), if not happy, was not unhappy.
Their protective vigilance exercised over him a bit cheeky at times, a little humiliating too, but always loving and well intentioned.
Between them, although taking Ms main part Eloisa, paid for the upbringing and boarding in a couple's house craftsman who lived in the worms, near the house where the unfortunate widow lived.
When was too old for this, he was sent to school.
Showed signs of being a kid peaceful, quiet, sensitive, and began to learn their lessons well.
His seven or eight mothers were in charge ask the master for his behavior and application whenever you encountered on the street encouraging him to 'put you tighten the screws. "The teacher was responsible, in effect, tighten while reminding every moment, in front of his classmates, his orphan their misery and the absolute necessity of showing that he had humble and grateful to his beneficent.
This humility was the thing that never stopped singing to hear at the villa.
How he stumbled in the street and deigned to put his hand paternally on the head, they said: - Beware of being humble!
Be obedient and submissive to the ladies that you have collected for charity Do you understand? ...
And finally, his classmates were responsible generously was constantly warn an unhappy without parents, nurtured by love and that should be in the hospice and non- alternating with distinguished sons of shoemakers, masons, tailors and bakers fashioned, and leading other people no less worthy of respect.
Teníala humility in the heart of the drowned child and the suicide, if not had not it would be easy to ridicule and scorn inculcate their peers, or the parental spanking the teacher and their protective, because they all thought they were entitled to love, but to punish him too.
He understood that Protecting all should respect and affection, and is taxed.
Of course, in the depths of his heart felt preferences, that is irremediable.
Passionately loved Ms Eloisa.
This good lady, who was the one most needed, never scolded or punished, or even a word I said unpleasant tratábalo with extreme tenderness, caressed him as if he were his son and hid and excused his little antics.
When he was twelve years old, met in conclave ladies and deliberated about what should be done with the boy.
Desechose unanimously the idea of ??devoting to the office of his father.
They thought of several others, without being able to agree, until Ms Trinidad, the wife of D.
Remigio Flórez, a manufacturer of canned food, take a servant proposed messenger boy home.
They nodded almost all of this resolution, but Ms Eloisa, who was hurt, did this to her friends that the boy had shown aptitude for studies, and would a meritorious work to make him a priest.
The ladies have welcomed the idea enthusiastically.
Only Ms Trinidad, large dotted lady and friend to impose its will around the world, opposed strongly and withdrew from the meeting bland.
Pasáronse ladies without their help, and setting a monthly amount, would be paid to cleavage, sent the boy Lancia seminar, capital of the province where we are.
Gil was a model seminarian, applied, sweet, respectful, caring religious practices and showing great enthusiasm in them.
The ladies who had no reason to congratulate the resolution.
When I came to Peñascosa holiday, brought to each Rector's letter expressing his satisfaction with the conduct and progress of the fatherless.
In the two or three months I stayed there, they provided some services, reviewing the lessons to their children, assisting them in their prayers or serving as a clerk, etc.
Lived home of Ms Eloisa.
Every summer they would turn a little, the child became a man.
At last he three consecutive years to come, to take the last orders.
Decision time to become a priest.
When he appeared at last a day in costume Peñascosa priest, his presence caused deep emotion in the heart of their protection.
All mothers were considered him, and therefore entitled to mourn for joy and fell into his arms tenderly.
Certainly, these reliefs were once loving some bickering between them.
Because less loving and tolerant with the child had shown were most extreme now with the man.
It was a contest of beauties among them.
The rich, as Ms Eloisa and Mrs Theodora, was commissioned to buy the cup and ornaments more expensive: those who did not have such good fortune, as Ms Rita Ms Filomena and others, supplied the money with the skill of his hands embroidering the alb, stole and altar cloth, which caused admiration.
Fixed the church and took part in the adornment not only these women, but many of the people, their friends.
It was an event Peñascosa brand, both for the quality of the people who had paid for the race young priest, for the terrible circumstances that had led to such protection.
None was better right to do so, but all are believed to both, and this secret resentments rise again palabrillas and some unpleasant.
The pay he returned to the village and sang, his voice weak and trembling - Dominus vobiscum.
All the voices of the podium, tears and falls, accompanied by the roar answered body: - Et cum spiritu tuooooo. - What is white! - Said a young artisan's companion at his side. - Looks like a picture.
Narciso high-pitched voice, lowering and raising the tone and listened with pleasure, epistle. - Child, how repicotea the chaplain! - Repeated the craft. - You see, there is the daughter of the hunchback.
He was very kind accredited in the town that D.
Narcissus and the girl felt a mutual Osuna inclination, but only the spirits heterodox and thugs dared to say high voice.
Narcissus was indeed given much to live among the weaker sex to enter the fort.
So would Sarrió came about three years, more or less, was the idol of the ladies Cliff by his elegant appearance, which was contrast to the shabbiness of the most priests of the town, for his cheerful conversation, for his little jokes and, above all, his love to be always among them.
Was far from being beautiful or handsome, was a man of thirty-five, dry, dark, big feet and juanetudos and ugly teeth; but had managed to pass at once funny place.
Little joke goes, has little joke, a compliment to this, a chufleta to the other, non-shortened never to be in the middle of a large circle.
In contrast, D.
Directed the consciousness of most of them and authorizing the lecture them out of the confessional, sometimes harshly.
Almost all received submit your corrections with, even with pleasure, and if you temporarily revolted, was to demand forgiveness immediately.
With this, Don Narciso was the guest required in all Gaudeamus parties and fashionable society Peñascosa, ate voraciously, and this made boast, drank the same tenor, and when the desserts arrived, never failed to provide any coplita that was almost always dirty.
Narcissus, who because of his ministry not be authorized jokes concerning sex sex relationships are entitled to believe drop the most nasty about other miseries of the human body.
And ladies bizarre case!
the laughing and celebrating as if they were prodigious cleverness and wit.
Two years later to come to the villa had been a failure.
Down the stairs of a certain house he frequented much, he broke his leg.
They said the lady's husband, who owned the house had helped to drop, not entirely agree with the time and occasion of their visits; but instantly the good souls of Peñascosa rushed to quell the rumor sacrilegious.
And as proof of the indignation with which rejected the case, most major ladies the town was formed in nurses beside his bed, leaving not a moment alone day and night taking turns every few hours, as if the Blessed hiciesen guard.
No harder and never dealt fervent zeal the salvation of the beautiful half of mankind.
Not only addressed with particular care awareness of that best represented in Peñascosa, shepherding his sheep with love thus leaving some stone throwing which strayed as diligent pastor era, but by dint of many sleepless nights had been found a fraternity, established and in other parts of Spain and abroad, the brotherhood of the Daughters of Mary.
In this brotherhood not fall more than young singles.
Such privilege excited a vague defiance mixed of appetite in married women.
Creíanse humiliated with that exclusion.
Narciso advantage this shadow of rivalry to keep them more prone. - Oh, ladies, should not envy you the privilege!
She said in an ironic twang showing hostility secret that the chaplain was to all the husbands.
The ladies, upon whom the charms of fascination and those not exercising some, forced smile and mischievously as saying: "Ya, ya!" It was rumored that more in love with him.
Ms Marciala, the wife of the apothecary of the place, had gone to Sarrió to bring socks to be a priest passing time with her family.
Ms Filomena widow of a lieutenant, his only son was going to help to Mass every day.
No However, he had noticed in him a preference Obdulia, the daughter of Osuna, administrator Montesinos. - But it really did go like? - Asked the young artisan, listening to his companion expressed so clearly. - Girl, I do not know!
What I can say is that D.
Narcissus leaves the house, and many days of my window I see them run one after another in the garden of Montesinos playing tag ...
I said, 'Look, D.
do not be offended ...
but I, you and Obdulia watching them play in the garden, I have suspicions ...
Began to say: "For you and others like you lose credit and honor priests and religious decay! "I called bag of malice, that seemed I lie that such atrocities happen, and here and there ...
At first I wanted to eat, then went quieting ... "You're right, D.
After the letter Peñascosa pastor sang the Gospel.
His voice was rough without inflections.
Without looking completely distracted sang just the book, raising their young eyes and hard over the glasses to look at him, rather, to spray look to the son of the Pepaina, which was secretly pulling out the candles babas and pocketing.
Although one of the most shameless rascals of the town Parrot (which by that name was known this young man distinguished) was upset and tantico restless under the gaze of the clergy.
The thing with good reason.
Miguel Vigil, pastor Rocky, since 25 of this century was one of the worst men genius of Spain, and do not exaggerate if we say nothing of the globe.
Had at the time eighty-two years, was high, dry, sharp features, thick brows together, small and piercing eyes.
Still had great physical vigor, and what is even rarer, in his remaining hair barely noticed the gray.
The duration of the first civil war, left the flock and went to the Basque provinces to fight with weapons in hand for the cause of the Pretender.
He returned a few years.
Peñascosa parishioners had in it much like a shepherd a captain of robbers.
Nobody raised the rooster in the population.
The most difficult cases of consciousness used to resolve D.
Miguel in a flash with a half dozen punches or well-directed kicks.
Marcellin, the Cosme, tape was the daughter of Laureana the weaver and would not marry her.
Miguel is planted in the house of Cosimo, picked Marcelino by the ears, gave him three slaps turtleneck, and fifteen days, like it or not, had them married.
Ramon denied the confectioner, D.
Cipriano two thousand reales to it by had given no receipt.
The priest called for Ramon to his house, shut himself in a room with him, I took a stick and forced to sign a receipt.
Through these procedures theological D.
Miguel evangelical morality instilled among the souls entrusted to their care.
Were not you like the latest in worship.
Looked down on the clerics who sought introducing them and took care of the dress and grooming.
Tolerated them because they knew they were supported by the bishop and the higher clergy of the diocese, but laughed at them at all times in a manner rude, irritating, and I used them a few tricks malignant spoil any of those mystic revelry that put more effort.
We tried, for example, to hold a communion general girls with orchestral accompaniment.
The day was marked, D.
Miguel sent the church with a gang of carpenters who were placed to fix the platform with horrendous hammer, preventing concerted hear voices and instruments of music.
Other sometimes required the assiduous penitents D.
Narciso-examining Christian doctrine or While the singing in church banned after a month of rehearsals, or withdrawing from the altar cloths that they had embroidered aplanchado, or threw in some chapel where they had assume its real, etc., etc.
These acts of despotism earned the enmity habíanle of the Gallic clergy and female.
Miguel gave a farthing for such animosity.
The enjoyment of his life was not loved or admired, but do all the time and chance their will.
Furthermore, it could have all the defects they want their enemies, but nobody ever knew shadow bias towards weaker sex.
Positively despised women, believed that none was able to say or do anything with common sense.
Neither is believed to D.
Miguel was shown not obedient to his superiors.
The bishop had trouble an immense understanding with him.
If you sent an order, without giving it cures archived compliance, if I turned a visit, it would get in bed pretending to be sick to see him.
Concluded by ignore him and let him go with it.
Peñascosa did not confess but half a dozen veterans of the civil war.
Other parishioners were split between chaplains assigned to the parish for four-fifths of the women relied on burdens of their weaknesses to the irresistible D.
Miguel felt no despondency for this preference.
And yet, the small number of his penitents was assured that confessor prudent, discreet and delicate questions.
Pastor for the soul of thoughts crossed death and destruction.
The priest novel elevated the Sacred Host with trembling hands, amid a buzz of enthusiasm and worship.
The court, by releasing more guttural tremolo records, contributed mightily to do most solemn and moving the descent of the Son of God into the hands of man.
Gil felt shudder under the impression his body.
Ineffable joy rose from the bottom of his chest and squeezed her gently throat.
That bounty, infinite, that his God made him, and with such longing had expected, stirred up every fiber of his heart.
His eyes were veiled by the tears, and to bend the knee, before raising the cup of passion, was some seconds to rise and about to fall unconscious
