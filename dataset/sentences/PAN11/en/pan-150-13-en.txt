Although this area seems oblivious of this paper, it is not, and readers will be convinced this truth, knowing that from the archbishop and three bishops suffragan, to the last pastor all have a fixed salary or allowance, they charge, like any other employee of the Government, boxes of the national treasury, so if you were to try to their powers, jurisdiction and powers, surely this was not the most remarkable place for this purpose; but when nothing was going to say on these points, and only going to be considered some members who are in the distribution of public funds, no more appropriate occasion to discuss the matter at the end of the 2nd part of this report on all of it to the national treasury, and request the relevant economies, as indicated in other classes.
The only cathedral chapter in the Philippines there is in Manila, and has five dignities three dispensations, two meals and two half portions, chaplains chorus, & c., endowed with enough profession such perks, nothing more just to reform their allowances, bearing in mind for which it previously enjoyed in the days of the galleon of Acapulco, and knowing that emancipated the Americas, those allocations have been increased with little reason and justice.
This increase in annual allocation to the perks, I have understood is verified pretext loss or grief that they suffered from the lack of the amount of slip that they had in the Nao when it is completed, which they sold to trade, and thus had a bonus, but the same loss and grief suffered perpetual rejidores municipality of Manila, which quantities purchased by thick beds, and nor are they satisfied with the Government have their capitals, nor have they been compensated for their losses otherwise real and effective: in addition to the rejidores, had an equal right to ballot for widows and orphans of soldiers and others in need, and have not received any compensation for such loss, and perhaps their only source their livelihood, when the spoils had left them to maintain other Ausilio decency in them that would serve, with which he or increase for that reason is wrong, or whether it is fair, the same compensation is due to the rejidores, widows, orphans and other classes perceived the ballot Ausilio.
Prebendary have their fixed endowment, the intention being free, and also a part of products amounts that yield the Waqf that manages the council and the turban, and whose revenues distributed among individuals, according to the foundations: the intention to implement free masses for whom they are paid (who does not miss so lacking in a Catholic country like the Philippines) is another resource and not unimportant, because the alms of the masses is not small; and finally, the revenues earned from the products or Waqf, is the third resource or Ausilio that completes a fat income, which could well be some reform of the Exchequer, and reduce their allocation to what was, leveling with justice to all classes that had the ballot in Nao, loss all suffered, and was compensated only to the class who least needed: well, then, is strict justice that there be corresponding reduction in the allocation of those perks and were reduced to what it was before the loss of the galleon, or the primitive marking of income.
Pastors, so regular and secular, the only reform needed in relation to the provision they receive from the treasury, the only concept to which they are considered here, is that they level off and equally and be given a fixed rule on their stipends and allowances, taking into account the lucrative foot of the altar of some, as being all exclusively dedicated to serving Spiritual to the same ministry, there is enormous inequality in the enjoyment of assignment: the reason why in some provinces are paid in cash, other half in cash and half in kind (rice), and in other part in cash and two species, or vice-versa, with great variety in terms of everything, and if this measure in principle might be, as indeed can ensure it was very beneficial for pastors interested to help and stimulus that the Indians to promote agriculture, and the day is bad, because the kind to be Pastors receive, worth a double or more than their fair share, and was worth when setting these allocations, and this is without prejudice to the taxpayers for the state.
On this particular there have been several complaints and has even tried to level them more than once and set a fee determined by means of a General-rule for all provinces, although in some variation has been made, not all did the same, old prevail vices or abuses.
It is therefore necessary that the state allowance paid to parish priests alike in all the islands, and that nothing be paid in kind.
The Indians must be free in selling off as and when they see fit, any other rule, on unjust, can not but be burdensome to the treasury.
On the increase or decrease of stipends, nothing can be said with fixed data, or no fear of having mistakes that may be of importance: only warn that pastors who are assigned to missions, which is to form new towns, attracting and catechesis infidels to the Indians in various parts of the islands there, are poorly equipped, and were it not for the other relijiosos Ausilio and his friends or benefactors, hardly could survive, and all that still have to spend many days to prepare and cultivate a piece of land, forming a little rice planting provided bread for year, and hunt deer, to make jerky or salon, call in the country cover, and by this means eating some meat, they are many straits and not passing easy to remedy.
Also be said that the pastors of small towns suffering many hardships, because the foot of the altar anything they produce, and deserved, as well as those for missions, some consideration in pointing out their stipends, which could aumentárseles stooping to anything the Pastors of larger towns, or to move from 2000 taxes, but in these, although their expenses are more significant, having to maintain one, two or more coadjutor, but her foot altar is more fat, do not miss alms for Masses, and stipends up enough, the can rebajárseles somewhere to attend to the poor pastors and missionaries.
That conclude, this reform appears to be founded, and even just for the benefit of leveling the best way possible and without charge of the treasury, the distribution of property among the priests, because all devoted to that high and important ministry, nothing else just to give them the means more analogous to preserve decency and dignity of their state which corresponds with the most fair proportion as possible, may be as indicated, and so continue until the increase of population claiming to vary the method is established.
These are the basics that I can deliver on the administration and distribution of public finances in the Philippines and I am convinced that (even if poorly coordinated and not very full because the shortness of my lights do not give of himself otherwise, the narrowness with which I have proposed writing them does not support more digressions, and habérseme astray some interesting papers, prevent me from providing more data) have some important news that can be form some idea of ??the merit of those islands, and the Government take some measures reform the state of the Philippine Islands happiness demand for them, expanse and promotion of their income, and establish fair economies, housing is to increase employee and trying to reduce them to purely accurate and indispensable, if they have to make savings possible, if at all times should be sought in the current shortages and hardship for backwardness of the state, is more desirable, necessary and required all fair economy Jenera and rational.
Of the Waqf of the Islands.
Under this denomination there is inflow, that while some want to present it as something of great moment and importance, there are those who Propal be immense wealth, and although should despise those who try to reduce that capital alone is also wise to listen prevention with the exaggerations of others and phrases that make them.
These charitable works are small banks to borrow funds which come under the guarantees are agreed the that your business needs monetary Ausilio, given by neighbors to be be brothers of the respective corporations whose charge they are, under certain rules, regulations or statutes that make the respective obligations, and all are nothing more than a executors of the wills of the testators bequeathed them their funds for for appropriate uses were noted.
The Waqf of Manila or private testers foundations, form a set of capital for proper consideration.
Allocate funds for jiro, their products were taxed pension and charges for objects of divine worship and public welfare: therefore deserve every consideration of the Government, for the benefits that agriculture can bring them and industry of the Islands.
If the limited jiro and privileges of New Spain to Manila with no had been reduced to a merely passive transit trade or transport, these establishments to step to getting rich, they themselves had given to a trade that real wealth.
The enormous value of 200 to 500, and even more, by 100 who left the business in Acapulco Nao, most foreigners was for traders from India and China, whose effects surti almost all the cargo from the ships, another large part was for charitable works, because there were years that paid 50 per 100 of the amounts advanced by, so as to traders for Manila was so small a profit, which would prove a calculation that was done of the many millions of dollars that have been imported in the Philippines New Spain by Naos, and the low value corresponding to currency and has been to promote traders in Manila.
At the time of establishment of such foundations was not known other than the Acapulco trade, India and China, though divided into three Jiros, was a single negotiation, because most part of the stockpiles made Waqf money in these two markets, giving their resulted in New Spain, for having ceased completely so that trade with New Spain, ceased at the same time Jiros India and China, and been reduced to only those objects of consumption in the country.
This trade however, although not under the foot-profit before, may be revived when the affairs of Spain are settled with the republics of America be formally recognized their independence, or is opening trade agreements, but will never be what it was.
The founders of these charitable works preveyeron I could not come a day when to cease communication and trade in the Philippines with New Spain, and given their limited management rules to Jiros those three classes, as sudden cessation has left idle funds and nswers one thousand continjencias.
Some of these foundations can only have a small part them to award land to others (and is the most Gen.) do not is this allowed by statute or rules of the founders, and in this state of affairs is necessary stand that the government authority, so that the objects of the foundations have proper performance in the most possible to be obtained or a switching of Jiros, and using such funds for the benefit and promotion of agriculture, industry and factories the country, which had already received from them an incalculable increase if the big advantages and Acapulco trade profits would not have attracted so much attention of the founders toward that destination.
It should be also a political maxim of government to protect these establishments in the capital, which flows in the event of war or a revolution sudden extraordinary inside Islands can get out of trouble in the extreme of not having or with contributions the country, nor the customs revenue and income.
In all aspects, although very light, anyone know the importance of the provinces Philippines, its extent, wealth, and contains elements that if that country to aggrandize greatly: see also that the judicial system is mounted under foot the most anomalous complicated and even harmful, that nothing is easier than reducing the natural order must have, and that no proper farm economies, and unnecessary for salaries paid, for the grown and even exorbitant number of employees remaining in existence, have increased, and that if it is not prompt and effective remedy for this harm, that will country reduced to a state employee and nothing more; class in every nation should be reduced as possible, so abounding in arms and other labor-intensive production, agriculture, industry and trade, have the momentum and encouragement, and hence the full development of wealth and public prosperity, with the other known joys of a flourishing state.
Philippines with its beautiful and so fertile soil, which no other, and three and a half million inhabitants, gathers all the elements that may be deemed necessary to be a country of happiness and wealth.
More than three hundred years have passed since the immortal Legaspi set in this distant rejiones the banner of the cross, and those conquered for Spain Islands [23].
Time and is already more than enough to think about your happiness, that you remove the obstacles that are opposed to it, and nothing dubious or misleading evidence is patentice and then see those people, our brothers, we want prosperity as much as ours; or rather, which is said to their well-being as our own, and his loyalty purge, no denied until today, it seized the mother country to improve their lot and condition; as inevitably will happen by the special law will be given, without prejudice to its just claims are heard and addressed, to ensure that longs for the mother country and can work as much more expensive, to ensure the happiness of their provinces in the Philippines.
Finally, after what has been nswer both on and defects in the administration, justice as well as the farm in those possessions, and remedies that could certainly used to cut abuses, redress wrongs, and give impetus to the prosperity of the Islands still remains to add that if you like and you want happiness for those provinces in the good feel like their faith is peace, peace and public tranquility, taking into account that even has to pass some time [24] until the courts can deal with the work presented by the Government to make special laws for overseas, very useful, very convenient and beneficial would to refine those works, ask our bases overseas provinces what establish new arrangements have to be formulated, discussed and sanctioned.
People remarkable for its capacity, lights and talents, not least for their wealth, have Philippines and the beautiful West Indies as well be formed in each of these possessions a reunion of people choose for their talents, honorable history, and guarantees for their capital under the chairmanship of the governors generals captains, engaged and mail your payment deal to formulate and discuss the fundamental principles, principles or bases of the reforms more appropriate to guarantee their safety, property and improvements set the lights call century, and have to drive to the provinces to develop more healthy and fulfilled its prosperity.
These jobs running piece of cake for this method, as well as forward and much of that whether the Government should do, would greatly facilitate the early settlement of those laws.
The trade would speak in its field according to their needs, the magistrates in his manifest vices and flaws in, and remedies that could be used for more rapid and proper administration of justice, the tax authorities would do the same, and the reverend archbishops and bishops by the clergy would say about the need for spiritual covenant and media should be taken to its stability, better distribution and propagation of our faith, for in the Philippines there is still much to conquer in this part, the municipalities propose on its powers as convenient, not to mention that on weights and measures is to urjentísimo a law regulating such an interesting subject, as in the Philippines in pesos and some things rijen measures of Spain, in others those of China, and in others are adopted by the country, as in the measurement of land, and ultimately, by public interest in the important branches of agriculture and industry, homeowners who represent them, would ask provisions analogous to its stability and development.
Each in its present line ratios and estimated data reports of importance and consideration, and with little or no work would be found the Government with a wealth of news the safest to avoid errors or anything in such a venture interesting subject, and the overseas provinces in the Government's request, would see the better disposition and a desire to shape their happiness by means as simple as the most analogues for success, because of that reunion or advice of people chosen for the case was impossible for them to come other propositions that the only and alone in its class to improve rejeneracion the work of his politics, which is needed in the state of illustration that have and those countries
