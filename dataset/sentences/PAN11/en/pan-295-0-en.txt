Well, that means we will discover a hidden treasure...Look, who says that this old house that was once occupied by wealthy merchants it is not inside a partition wall or in a good pot from the bigwigs.
It may be that it is walled up.
All the same, it can be above, rather than below.
I assure you that when the floor was strong in the hallways and dining room, they swept through the mansion as if it would collapse, I believe I hear a little noise...
