Because you see, my friend, that this was an excellent scheme practiced with pupils, or a father to his children while they are under parental authority, but not to form villages encouragement that its inhabitants ahead in police culture, as has been at all times the king's will.
It could not concealed from his priests, nor the body of the religion which he ruled, but their particular purposes were first in all that ran, and thus preferred this method, separating it by the Indians of all he could out of their ignorance and depression.
With this scheme, and the Jesuit economy, it is no wonder that over one hundred and fifty years ago these people are well founded, might collect the funds they had at the time of estrangement, and in churches and in what is called Community Fund.
I for my part I admire what he had, in response to the fertility of this province and the many subordinate Indians, who, absolutely refused to have them dealing with the Spanish, did not know other authority than that of the Jesuits, and so did all they wanted from them.
As I said to you the best I could what time were these Indians of its former priests, tell you what they have been and are at present, the new government.
After they were expelled the Jesuit priests in charge of running these people so in spiritual and temporal, was established in the method of government they still remains, under the rules and ordinances that formed Excellency Don Francisco Bucareli Governor and Captain General of Buenos Aires, which, after some mutations, came to focus on the following terms: Governor was established with jurisdiction over thirty people, which equated to laws are the magistrates and mayors of Indian villages, but subordinate the government of Buenos Aires.
At the same time we established three subordinate lieutenancy the governor, but with the same jurisdiction as the lieutenants in their respective departments, holding them responsible, and the governor and the lieutenant, the result of the that each was responsible, as expressed in those ordinances.
For each town appointed a Spanish Administrator to manage their property, take care of their increases, the natural target, and in their tasks as spinning and distribution should given to community property, with an obligation to account for everything you require, with several other charges, which include the ordinances and orders issued subsequent to those whom he pay 300 pesos per year and maintenance.
Also got two brothers in every town with a degree of cure and companion, so that take care of the direction of souls and divine worship, forbidding any mixture in temporal affairs, pointing to cure synod 300 pesos and 250 pesos to mate, and on either the people they are provided with food.
This assignment will be lowered to two religious, pointing to each 200 pesos by royal decree of October 5, 1778.
In the same ordinances are prevented in every village to continue the appointment of a magistrate Indian, two mayors, four aldermen, a sheriff, two mayors of brotherhood and Butler, with other offices for the church, such as a clerk, three singers and two prosecutors, those caring for the ministries of their own destiny, and choices the Governor confirms peoples.
The appointment of magistrates played under the regulations, the governor of Buenos Aires, and every magistrate should not be longer than three years, but these are not observed points, as the governor of Misiones appoints magistrates, and they take over in class in perpetuity, so that only defect they are deprived of employment, and so there is still magistrates in the towns they were in time of the Jesuits.
It may be that this practice has been followed because it is not easy to find people who can play many Indians the office of magistrates, but, for any reason that has been followed, should be held perjudicial√≠simo abuse the Indians, it deprives others of the hope of achieving this work, with creditors to him with their application and good procedures.
What is perhaps not implemented because they do not expect any reward, and leads the Indians corregidores to become despotic, and to oppress the other, certain that his job has no end, it would not happen if they knew that they would last only three years, and if they do not last was quite another in the town capable of being mayor, no problem had to re-propose, after having given the defenses that may be of three years of employment.
All Indian men and women were allowed subject to the community, as they were in time their previous treatments, considering them unable to make ends meet otherwise, the government and direction of the community was placed in the mayor and council, aided and directed Spanish manager, and subjects in a whole or lieutenant governor who corresponded the immediate command, giving rules in the Ordinance for the better management of assets and advancement, as well as to banish from the natural harshness and gloom they had been educated, instilling ideas and sound policies that excites them the desire for happiness did not know, and they are inviting their fertility land, with many wise and rules set out therein.
For the remaining of the fruits and effects and benefits set out in these towns expended to estimate that most advantageous to the people, established a Manager general in the city of Buenos Aires, giving fair and very useful rule for which, if the fruits and effects in one hand, the estimate did not lose, as would be distributed in many, and which hand it produces the people as necessary, should pay actual taxes according to the standards, at a rate of one peso for each tributary, and whole tithes to the church that are regulated at 100 pesos each village.
Although from the beginning it was learned that what had most influenced the inability to These Indians were the subjects have had them to the community and not having inspired other ideas that submission and obedience, and treat them as children of the family children, not able to illustrate their understanding of course learned to work for them, try and trade with each other with their fruits and effects, the less ability cahoots with the most experienced and industrious, and to check all those ways and means practiced among civilized people, processing and trading, so not only among themselves but also outsiders, that is what is the growth and happiness of the peoples and nations; can not, as I say, let them know of course these advantages, seemed the most appropriate then leaving them subject to the same community, as they had been, until with time be made more capable.
But, as the main reason that had reduced disability was subject to the community, surviving it, there was still always the impediment them out of this miserable state, and this has been experienced, even though it has worked very little progress has been made in particular.
The government established in the terms is explained briefly, were placed at Initially, for administrators, which men came across the lot.
Were over they of so little skill as the Indians, and as even the experts were inexperienced in that operation, and had no one to imitate or consultation, is maintained as much inaction.
At the same time the Indians, unused to move anything without being sent and even required, and administrators little or nothing available, they either did nothing, so that only hastened to send floods bring mitas stays livestock, to what managers did not object because they did not know how they should handle what you were responsible, nor had the courage to oppose the Indians, or even knew what they were doing.
Thus in a few years away, and ate what he had in the villages and farms, without thinking work or replace what they ate.
This is followed by the great smallpox epidemic caused the desolation of the people, who were not Indians or hacienda.
For this were removed all those useless managers, replacing them with other more skill and better behavior, it was to force Indians to work, putting more emphasis on the restoration of the rooms, and, finally, all means were adopted which seemed leading, and they effectively managed, if not all people, in more Relocating a mediocrity that promises some relief to their natural, and more overtaking in the future.
This delay followed them to the people for not having verified that the same is prevented ordinances, and each year more timely Candelaria is held at a Board general, composed of the governor, the lieutenant, the magistrates and administrators of all peoples, so that she examined the books of agreements that should have all them, and the provisions agreed weekly by councils and administrators, their effects and consequences, each proposing it considers useful to the people, agreeing and determining what the Board itself will seem more convenient, which should be annual statements to be submitted to the Government of Buenos Aires, with the necessary reports and proposals for the benefit of the peoples they had to fit.
But this Board so essential and convenient to the people, has not been tested even once, the ground that have impeded ignored, and only presented my idea is the difficulty of coupling all by the distance of the most remote villages.
But taking over some administrators for only attend some function and will leave their village to another, distant perhaps more leagues than there are from the farthest to Candelaria, will not be found difficulty in all attended the meeting.
But even given this plea if it considers as sufficient, easily be smoothed by other methods which would have a the same effect and was the deputy in each district formed a board of their particular jurisdiction and their result one or two administrators and many other magistrates of satisfaction would switch to Candelaria, where all lieutenants together with its partners, and it turns out their boards, formed the general with the governor, thus avoiding the drawbacks followed to attend all, and certainly would have the same effect as if it held as is prevented in the ordinances.
If the Board had taken effect, would probably not delays experienced by those people who were in the beginning, and things had arranged in a better position than they are, then, taking from each what he had best success, be made with knowledge of rules most appropriate for the future, there be known merit and application of each, and throw away all those who through their incompetence or other reasons would lead to, and work with greater consistency and accuracy.
As to the principles of caring nothing, and then had to be implemented only to people placements of cattle, were neglected other objects that handle the ordinances, and required the attention of all good government.
It has neglected the repair and increased buildings and main house called schools, and individuals of Indians, so that people have been ruined and some threaten to ruin the churches.
The yerbales grown along with the villages have been left almost lose, doing nothing them out as much profit that they could, without caring to replace with new plants which were losing or older, to apply the few people who had been to other work, that in the same year shows the utility.
Nor was careful to introduce the toilet in people and homes of these people, nor to be treated with honesty, neglecting also supply necessary for even the subsistence, because to address the restoration of the rooms was necessary to abandon all else.
As experience unveiled the inability of the Indians and their propensity to spend it all and not work, it was necessary that the orders of the government wide powers to managers, subordinates in a way the magistrates and councils, so that Indians forcing others to work and restrain spending.
With these measures, in which always has tried wherever possible to save the spirit of the ordinance, has been finally to establish the practice of government that this is observed, which in many ways deviates significantly from the ordinances, but the need has given rise to it.
Although the ordinance states that the direction of the people has to be borne by the mayor and council, and the administrator is only one director to advise and persuade them best, and that nothing should be done without being prepared and agreed by the council, does not happen So administrators are the ones with all the superiority, serving magistrates and councils only implementing the provisions given by the administrator without They find disgust in practice as the manager tells them, nor to assent to any treatment which the administrator place, signing a few papers were put front and consenting willingly and without consideration in everything that the administrator wants to make them and their people.
And although precise circumstance that all the deals that make the managers has with your permission to authorize the governor or lieutenant to those concerned the immediate command and can not always find the quality of what you buy, which is usually won cattle or horses, can not tell if the quality is actually offered to him in proposal, and serves to commission another to witness the delivery, for either he has to be interested party, or can be easily bribed, and the Indians, which concerned should be the most zealous, are the most seek to hide their own prejudices, that must be in good faith by the administrator, but it is half of countering fraud if he is an evil conscience.
To which you can add the permission or acquiescence the immediate superior, if that happened at some time, going to share with administrators, could easily destroy the interests of the Indians, and they gladly would sign the documents proving their legitimate investment flows, although they knew and know who became party utilities.
As the administrator, as it is in these circumstances, the upper town, He alone determines everything has to be done, he is presented with the mayor and council as subjects, receiving orders from him and him realize the performance and results.
For his report and his motion gives the government jobs, because, as the occupation of these are more in the tasks that the administration of justice, which the administrator proposed for mayor, the same is named, and so are the other jobs and occupations of the people.
The labors of the people are reduced to pruning, plowing and hoeing cotton fields, picking cotton, reseed when they have lost many plants, or plant them again when you get older or need.
These jobs are run by Indians (the plowing, planting and pruning), but the hoeing and picking cotton is made with the Indian boys and girls.
The fields wheat, corn and all kinds of vegetables are verified in the same line that the cultivation of cotton.
Yerbales When the people are in season, are engaged in profit of the grass, as in everything else, each which may or reach their forces, and so in other tasks under agriculture, which is intended for half the time, and the other half to come to their particular fields, and provide their livelihood.
But although regularly said that the Indians left them half the time for their particular work, as the community curtailed many days, so just be left with the third part for them.
Indian women regularly engaged in spinning for the community, which are dealt two work week, or three when the need calls.
In each task are given ten ounces cotton to bring three of thread, and try not otherwise occupied, but in the chances of tents and the like, intended for them, if not all, the most robust and are not pregnant or parenting, and hoeing will not be exercised in spinning.
Indian crafts, such as linen weavers, carpenters, rosarieros and others, always remain more out of habit than useful work in their offices on time they must do for the community, and the remainder going to their farms, which must have them, otherwise it could not exist.
Only more weavers remain in their offices, which is not allowed to depart until the conclusion of the piece started, and then given five yards of cloth and one or two weeks off, to go to their farms, and then return to their occupation.
A people who have 300 Indians working, and corresponding number of Indian boys and girls, with an administrator of conduct, you can regulate the harvest of a good year in the following fruits: 800 pounds of cotton, as many of grass, 100 bushels of wheat, 200 of all other species of grain, including corn, 50 pounds of snuff, as many groups, and 15,000 yards of linen.
