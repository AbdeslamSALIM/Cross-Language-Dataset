Cordoba is a vast labyrinth of very narrow streets, winding, entangled, sad, empty, paved with pebbles and bordered by a picturesque houses and studded with balconies and trellises, and other truncated or dismantled, and a maze of squares paltry and irregular, churches and convents, thick walls and courtyards of desolate, surrounded by gardens and orchards, and farms debris.
A beautiful public park, a plaza with pretension to elegance, some modern houses and one or two newspapers, - behold what in CÃ³rdoba gives some idea of ??modern life.
