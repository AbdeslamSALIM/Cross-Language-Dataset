Roma tried to dissuade Deste purpose, saying that could happen sometimes Where necessary the company and to undertake to defend, and that a person alone could not do large animals.
But, even they said, Andrew wanted to be a thief just and leading, with the intention to depart from the squad for their money and buy something that could say that he had stolen, and on this so the least I could load on his conscience.
Using, then, in this industry, less than a month he brought more advantage to the company that they brought drawn four of the robbers della; of that precious little is idling, watching his so cute and tender lover thief so clear, but with all this, I was fearful of any Unfortunately, he did not want her to see him in shame for all the treasures of Venice, bound to that good will have you the many services and gifts that made him his Andrés.
Just over a month were in terms of Toledo, where they made their August, but was for the month of September, and from there went into Extremadura, being land rich and hot.
Andrew spent with Precious honest, discreet and love conversations, and she soon little was falling in love with the discretion and good treatment of his mistress, and he, likewise, could grow their own love, was growing: such was the honesty, discretion and beauty His Precious.
A wherever he went, he took the money and the runner and bets jumping more than anyone, played bowling and the ball extremely, pulling the bar very strong and unique skill, and finally, in a short time his fame flew across Extremadura and there was no place where no one spoke of the gallant provision of gypsy Andres Caballero and their thanks and skills, and the pair ran Desta fame of the beauty of Gitanilla, and there was no town, no place or village where the parties are called to rejoice votive yours, or for other special festivities.
So he went on the horde rich, prosperous and happy.
Were # mind the Roma to go to Seville, # but said Preciosa's grandmother that she could not go because the years had made a mockery in Seville to a gorrero called Triguillo, well known in it which made him get into a vat of water to the neck, naked meat, and head a crown of cypress, awaiting the stroke of midnight out of the barrel to dig and remove a great treasure that she had made him believe he was some part of your home.
He said he heard the good gorrero matins touch, not to lose the situation is so hastily got out of the jar, which gave her and him on the floor, and hit and bruised hooves meats, derramóse water, and he was swimming in it, and cried out that filling.
Came his wife and their neighbors with lights, and found him swimmer doing effects, blowing and dragging his belly on the floor, and shaking hands and legs with great haste, saying in a loud voice: "Help, gentlemen, I'm drowning" that it was fear, really thought she was drowning.
Closed with him, carried him forth of that danger, he came to, was the fun of the gypsy, and all that, dug in the indicated more than one state in deep, despite all those who told him mine was a lie; and if not reverse it a neighbor, who played as the foundation of his house, he would with both his on the floor, if you stop digging everything he wanted.
SUPOS this story throughout the city, and even the boys pointed their fingers and had his credulity and my lie.
This was the old woman, and this gave an excuse for not going to Seville.
Left, then, Extremadura and came into the Channel, and were walking slowly to the kingdom Murcia.
In all villages and places that had passed ball challenges, fencing, running, jumping, throwing the bar and other feats of strength, dexterity and lightness, Andrés all out winner. # A # He woke up the horde, and went to stay in a place of jurisdiction of Murcia, three leagues from the city, where he succeeded Andrew unfortunate that put him in the verge of losing life, and was that, having been in that place some cups and silver items bonds, as was his custom, Preciosa and her grandmother, and two other gitanillas Cristina, and Andrew, were housed in an inn of a rich widow whom he had a daughter, age ten seventeen or eighteen years, more brash than beautiful, and more by token, called Juana Carducha.
This, having seen dancing to the Roma people, took the devil, and proposed to take Andrew for a husband # # if he wished, but all his relatives were weighed; and thus, sought to tell her situation and found it in a corral, where Andrew had entered require two donkeys.
The officer turned to him, and with haste, not to be seen, said: - Andrew - he already knew his name ---, I'm rich girl, that my mother has another child but to me, and this restaurant is his, and amen desto, has many hawthorns, and two pairs of houses.
Make me seemed good: if I want a wife, you are, answer me quickly, and if you discreet, stay, and we'll see what a life.
Andrew was amazed by the decision of the Carducha, and with the speed that she asked him said - Lady girl, I'm bespoken to marry, and Roma did not get married but Roma: God save the mercy that I wanted to do, who I am not worthy.
It was not on two fingers of the dead fall aceda Carducha response to Andrew, who replicate if he saw entering the corral other Roma.
Run went out and forlorn, and gladly take revenge if I could.
Andrew, as a shrewd, determined to land medium, and deviate from the time that the Devil offered him, and thus called on all gypsies that night was from that place.
They always obey him, put him then for work, and collecting their bail that afternoon, they left.
The Carducha ordered Andrew to be by force, and which could not level, and so, industry, sagacity, and his bad intentions secret that taught him, placed among the jewels of Andrew she knew by his, a rich coral and two patens of silver, with his other jumps, and had barely left the inn, when he cried out, saying that the gypsies had stolen her jewelry, a justice whose voices came and all the townspeople.
Gypsies halted, and all swore that nothing had been stolen and that they would patent All the sacks and recovered from their wigwams.
Desto was much vexed the old woman, fearing that in that election did not manifest the charms of the Precious and dressed Andrew, it with great care and caution kept, but the good of the remediated Carducha very soon all because the second envelope that looked said he asked what was the that gipsy great dancer, she had seen entering her apartment twice, and it could be that the carry.
Andrew understood that he said it, and laughing, said: - Lady Maiden, this is my bedroom and this is my ass, if you halláredes in her or him what I needed, I would pay to sevenfold, subjected to the punishment outside the law to thieves.
A silent throughout Andrés, suspense and imaginative, and not just fall into the betrayal of the Carducha.
In this, he became a brave soldier, nephew of the mayor and without further raised his hand, and gave him a blow, such that he was returning from his reverie and made him agree not was Andrew Knight, but Don Juan and a gentleman, and attacking the soldiers quickly secured and more anger, he pulled his own sword from its scabbard, and sheathed in the body, leading to He died on the ground. [Illustration: ...
Confusion grew, grew the yells, and turn to faint Preciosa Andres, stopped attending to his defense, finally both loaded on Andrew, who seized and shackled him with two very thick strings.
Well I would like the Mayor then hang him if I were in his hand; but had to refer to Murcia, being of his JURISDICTION.
Not taken until the next day and there was Andrew spent many martyrs and insults, which the indignant mayor and his ministers, and every place you did.
Mayor caught all over Roma and Roma as he could, because the more fled.
Finally, with the summary of the case and with a large cafile Gypsies, entered the mayor and his ministers with a lot of other armed men in Murcia, among them was precious and poor Andrew, wrap chains, on a male, and wives and piedeamigo.
Murcia went all to see the prisoners, who already knew about death soldier.
But the beauty of that day was so precious, so that anyone watching who did not blessing, and came the news of her beauty to the ears of the magistrate, out of curiosity to see the magistrate made her husband commanded that the gypsies did not enter prison and all the others did, and Andrew put him in a narrow cell, whose darkly and lack Beautiful light of you were treated that well thought out of there but not for burial.
Precious took his grandmother to the magistrate saw her and saw her and said: - No wonder the praise of beautiful.
Took in this precious hands of the Magistrate, and besándoselas many times, they are bathed with tears and said: - Lady, the gypsy who is in prison is guilty because he was provoked, called him a thief, and it is not, they gave him a slap in his face, which is such that it is discovered the goodness of your mood.
He has to be my husband, and fair and honest impediments have been hampered so far not yet given us habemos hands.
If money were necessary to achieve the forgiveness of all our wigwams were sold at public auction, and will even more than they ask.
My lady, if you know what love is, and you Did you have some time, and now you have your husband, Dole's me, tender and honestly I love mine.
He has no guilt; but if so, unemployment is worth to me, and if this can not be, at least, entertain the litigation in that they seek and look for possible means of remedy, which may be that the sin of malice not send him the health of grace heaven.
While this happened, the old woman was considered large, many different things, and after of any such suspension and imagination, said: - Wait for me your worships, gentlemen, a little, that I will make these tears become laughter, but to me it costs me my life.
And so, with a slight step out of where I was, leaving the audience confused with what said he.
While, therefore, that she came back, never let the tears and Precious pleas they entertain the cause of her husband, intending to warn his father, who came to hear it.
Roma turned to a small box under his arm, and said to Corregidor with his wife and she should retire to a room, he had great things to say in secret.
The magistrate, believing that some theft of Gypsies would discover, for suitable to have him in the suit of the prisoner, when she retired with her and with his wife in their chamber, where the gypsy, kneeling on his knees before the two, he said, - If the good news that I wish you, gentlemen, do not attain good news we deserve forgiveness a great sin of mine, I am here for taking his punishment you please give me, but before I confess you tell me, gentlemen, first, if you know these gems.
And discovering a cofrecico where they came from the Preciosa, was put in the hands of the magistrate, and opening it, saw those childish charms, but they could not fall mean.
Had respect unto also the magistrate, but neither gave the following account: only said: - These are some small creature ornaments. - That is true - said Gypsy -, and what creature are you saying that is written the folded paper.
He opened with haste the magistrate, and he read that said, "the girl was called Dona Costanza de Azevedo and Meneses, his mother, Dona Guiomar de Meneses, and his father, Don Fernando de Azevedo, sir the habit of Calatrava.
Desparecíla day of the Ascension, at eight o'clock, one thousand and five hundred and ninety-five.
He brought the girl made these leaps in this Chest are kept. " The magistrate had hardly heard the reasons for the paper, he recognized the trinkets, they are put in their mouths and giving endless kisses, she fell unconscious.
She went to the magistrate, rather than ask the gypsy by her daughter, and having regained consciousness, said: - Women's good angel before Roma, where is the owner, say, the creature which was these pendants? - Where to, ma'am? "- Said the Gypsy -.
In your home you have: that gypsy I got tears in their eyes is his owner, and is no doubt your daughter, that I Madrid theft of your house on the day and time that the paper says.
Hearing this, the troubled lady, let go of the slippers, and desalted and running out into the room where Precious had left and found her surrounded by her maids and servants, still crying attacked her, and without saying anything, with great haste undid his chest and looked if he had a sign small, like a lunar white, he was born, and found him already great, that over time had increased.
Then with the same promptness, his shoes and discovered a foot of snow and ivory, made around, and saw in him what he wanted, which was that the two last fingers of the wedging of the right foot with one another by a bit of flesh, which, when girl, had never wanted to cut, for not giving grief.
The chest, fingers, bounds, on the appointed day of the robbery, the confession of the gypsy, and the shock and joy had received any parent when they saw her, in all truth confirmed in the soul of the magistrate be precious daughter, and so, taking her in his arms, turned to her where the Corregidor and Roma were.
Precious was confused, not knowing what EFET had done with it such proceedings, and more seeing lead in the arms of the magistrate, and gave him a kiss up to one hundred.
Arrived, finally, with the precious cargo Dona Guiomar to the presence of her husband, and transferred his arms to the magistrate, said: - Acorn, sir, for your daughter Costanza, that this is no doubt: no doubt it, sir, no mode, the signal of the fingers together and the chest I've seen, and more, that is it for me saying the soul from the moment that my eyes saw. - No doubt - said the magistrate, holding in his arms Preciosa -; that they EFET mine have gone through that for yours, and more, so many punctuations together, how could happen, if not for a miracle?
Everyone was walking home absorbed, asking each other what could be, and all gave well away from the target, that had to imagine who the Gitanilla was the daughter of their masters
