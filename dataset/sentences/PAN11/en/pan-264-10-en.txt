Honda with its sublime debris, broken tombs of ancient opulence - their jumpers and noisy river, foaming cataracts, - its tall palm trees woven into floating pavilions, - its lush evergreen trees that bathe in the waves and abundant curly hair, - her steep hills and amphitheaters, of eternal solitude, and whose high plains of emerald grasses swaying in the summer the sturdy hurricanes - Honda, Queen dethroned shadow his distant splendor appeared to my eyes with his blue blanket and covered ruins, stray sadder and more beautiful than ever.
