Siéntome, and humbled when I think that there are countries in the world in which I walked vulgar sadness and shed tears as unmanly.
I remember one day I wept sincerely, with bitterness, like a child who tears do not make blush, the edge of a sea that has witnessed miracles, not divine but human.
He was alone, foot in the sand, sitting on a rock among many who were bronze rings which in other times had been moored ships.
Nobody on the beach was not abandoned by history, or in the sea on which there seemed to pass even a candle.
A white bird flew between heaven and drawing its water moved over the sky blue plumage and playing it on the calm waters.
Was only to represent the same hour, in one place, the smallness and greatness of a living man.
He threw the name of Magdalena, shouting with all my strength to repeat what the loud rocky shore and then a sob choked my voice, and filled the heart of confusion I wondered if the men of two thousand years ago, so brave, so strong, had loved as much as us.
Although he had been told that my absence would last many months, I returned after a few weeks.
Nothing in the world would have made me extend my trip one more day.
Magdalena I thought even four or five hundred miles of it when one night I went into a lounge where he was sure he would find.
Very few had been informed of my absence.
It disappears just as easily in our large Paris, that any man would have time to go round the world before anyone had noticed his departure.
Magdalena greeted as if he had seen the day before.
At first glance understood returning to her totally exhausted, hungry to see her and the intact heart. - I have troubled you a lot - he said.
It seemed as though my back instead of causing fear of it empty, on the contrary, a concern more bitter than all others.
Was reapplied in their task crusher.
The means used to "cure" (was the only word that was used to define a company in which it was, indeed, their salvation and me) all were bad when they emanated directly from their support.
Thereafter wanted intervene alone in that struggle of which she was the cause. - I'll undo what I did - I said a proud day challenge led to madness.
All his blood had left her cold.
She felt that its action it contained fire, and insisted on extinguish them hour after hour watching my most secret thoughts.
For that would have been necessary multiply infinitely repeated visits and too often.
Then was when I figured out ways to see me home.
Got this one frightful audacity that only allowed women to risk their honor and to act with unquestionable innocence.
The site chosen was always the desert, though somewhat distant from home.
And lest you imagine that such shipments would profit Dangerous frequent occasions when the Earl of Nièvre was absent.
No, when he was in Paris, at the risk to find, lost, came at the appointed time and almost always so in control of herself, as decisive as if everything had been sacrificed.
I was enveloped in that vast and dazzling look I wanted to probe my conscience and to recognize in the bottom of my heart shaped storms or resigned from the previous day.
His first sentence was a question: "How will you you? " How is that you?
meant: "Are you more reasonable?" At times I replied bravely with a semimentira, which never reached to deceive, but awoke in his mind curiosities and concerns of another kind.
He was leaning on my arm and walked under the trees, silent intervals or by speaking with apparent calm two friends who have come across.
She discovered during those hours of searing insight, revealed to me - like so many wonders, - treasures of disinterest, of dedication, foresight remedies almost equal to the depths of his charity.
Ordered my life badly dressed, or rather in complete disarray, no devoted as soon as to toil more hype, as the excesses of the greater inertia.
Censored my cowardice, my fainting was indignant and accused me of invective I pleased generously, because he claimed that they saw the concerns of an evil spirit balanced and more perplexed than fair.
Had I been able to conceive a bit milder ambitions led to the actual value she instilled, they had developed in my mind with flames of fire. - I see you happy - I said .-- If you knew with what fervor I want!
Ordinarily hesitate at the word future that we both hurt to augury ay!
The vague and replaced with chimeric as the last hope they have left nothing to expect or even have to wait.
When I was going to have to miss that mission almost every day, she met with the enthusiasm of a doctor who is sacrificed, the next day asking me as if it were an excuse of a failure.
He had come not knowing whether to accept the terrible sweetness of relief.
I felt myself slipping into such perfidy that was because I do not discern to what extent was guilty or unhappy.
I was not in a position to ignore that there is no value to withstand certain tests, more invincible virtue undermined at every turn is at serious risk and that of all diseases which sought to cure was the most contagious.
Having suddenly absent Count Nièvre, Magdalena me know that our rides should be suspended.
The resumed after her husband returned with more determination and greater enthusiasm.
The perpetual me, qui feci adsum me - me, cause I'm just - again under all forms in paroxysms of generosity that filled me with shame and happiness.
Thus he came to the steepest point of an attempt to which no woman has heroic been achieved without falling down.
Still remained some time and not lose heart fearlessly too, as a being possessing supernatural resources to whom the vertigo was deprived the sense of danger and excess retained on the brink of a sudden his paralyzing reason.
At that moment I realized I was exhausted forces.
Did not confess anything to betray weakness.
Recognized helpless and discouraged was put it all to chance, and chance caused her fear as the most uncertain of all auxiliaries, the most treacherous, perhaps the most threatening.
Filing exhausted, was open up his heart with both hands and show the evil that he had done me.
He did not throw or a wail of anguish.
She stood, was horribly pale, hesitated as frightened by an evil penetrated to the bottom of the soul. - Oh, relax you, the day that this happened !...-- added. - The day that happened ...-- she repeated.
And her voice failed and began to mourn.
I saw her alight from her carriage so changed, so miserable I was shocked. - What do you have? - I said running to meet him, so I felt close to fainting.
He recovered somewhat, thanks to a prodigious effort, he could not hide, and he replied only: - I am very tired.
Then I was struck by a horrible remorse. - I'm miserable - I exclaimed, - cored and honest feelings.
I knew not save, it comes you to me and I lose.
Magdalena, I do not need you, I do not want any more help or anything else ...
Do not want to help, so dearly bought at the expense of a friendship that I have too heavy and that would eventually kill you.
My relief will emanate from myself, my misery I concern myself, and whatever the end of them and not extend to anyone other than me.
I heard at first unanswered, such as reduced to that state of morbid dejection child or fragility that makes us unable to understand the harshness of certain ideas and making a decision. - Let us part - I said - completely.
Paris disengage us abundantly without that we put between us many miles away.
The first word you pronounce warning me that I need you again to find.
Otherwise ... - Otherwise ...-- murmured slowly emerging from its torpor.
He spent a few seconds to look at the bottom of his soul that phrase for both enclosing the threat of a final goodbye.
At first it seemed as if they do not give readily understandable. - It's true - he continued, - I am a rather weak point of support, right?
And noticing that I was awaiting a response drowning anxiety, made the unusual gesture of patients killed by the pain, who is tormented by talking about serious matters and said: - Why, then, you have come to propose the impossible?
I can think of a word of advice be given.
You know better than me what chance there is in this game ...
The one you take will be the only reasonable: the esteem in which I give and friendship that you profess I can not doubt.
I left her bewildered and resigned, of course, to certain ends separate us forever when neither wished.
Managed only looked at my behavior ensure a continuous separation, soft, which could perhaps lead us to establish among us warmer agreements and pacify all without too much sacrifice.
I stopped threatening to that sentence of oblivion, desperately tired to be honest, and that smile would have mercy, if she had had to turn a bit of calm on the day I proposed as a means.
Just relieved paper special confidant and savior, was suddenly transformed.
His genius, his continent, the sweetness of her look, the perfect equality of its composite nature and malleable gold steel, ie, forgiveness, and true virtue, natural that strong without harshness, patient, together, always in the balance of a lake sheltered from the wind, that ingenious friend to find sources of comfort, that exquisite phrase inexhaustible mouth, everything changed.
I saw one appear to be new, bizarre, incoherent, inexplicable and fleeting, sour, sad, hurtful and somber, as if he had been surrounded by perils, just as I sacrificed wholeheartedly devoted to his life and pave it aside into the shade of a concern.
Devoured immediately, passed his hand the eyes with a gesture of resignation and boredom and the like would have wiped made with a nasty stain.
For all blushed as if he had been caught in contemplation of a bad idea.
I noticed that her sister approached more closely than ever, that too often left leaning on the arm of her father, who adored her, but he did not have the same interests that she or the mores of high society.
One day I went to his house, and my visits were rare, he said: - Will you see Mr.
Called, did inform Monsieur Nièvre and between us.
He was extraordinarily clever during that visit, the first perhaps he had made attitude of ceremony.
The Lord of Nièvre was more flexible, without leaving some reserve, warned that more evident as it was becoming more systematic.
Almost alone held the weight of a conversation that every moment threatened to run out and leave us with an open mouth.
Thanks to that effort of skill and comedy will we represented reached the end without fail, and there was no margin for any incident that became too shocking.
Summed up to me this use of his nights of the week, but without my presence, course. - You come with me tonight? - She asked her husband. - I ask one thing I think not having denied ever - said Mr quite Nièvre chill.
I went to the door of his office, leaning on the arm of her husband, an upright, confident at the solid support.
I greeted her warmly responding exactly to the tone but its cold farewell. - Poor, dear woman - I thought of it while I was away .-- Dear awareness that have given rise to many fears!
And one of those reactions that disgrace in an instant the best impulses, I remembered those statues resting on a support that holds them in balance and inevitably fall if they are missing that point of support.
XIV Augustine then informed me the realization of a project that this honest heart caressed since long time, and you will recall that it was announced.
I continued seeing Augustine, not lost moments, he was wanted by the opposite, and you was available to me every time - and were common - they felt the need to immerse healthier waters.
I could not give me better advice, nor was it possible that gives me solace more effective.
He never spoke to me - although my selfish grief of all sweating through my words - but their way of life itself was an edifying example many lessons.
When I was very tired, very discouraged, very humbled by some new cowardice, was to him and watched his life as it's going to take the idea of ??attending physical force to an assault on fighters.
Success was not even that hard and rewarded laborious value, rather than vile favors, but at least he could confess his fainting and the difficulties that opposed him in those fights were not as active of those who make up flush to the face.
I knew one day I was not alone.
Augustine took me the novelty - that in many ways assumed the gravity of a secret - in nursing a long night spent at the head of my bed.
I remember it was late winter, the nights were still long and cold, and hassle of return to their home as Later he decided to wait for the day in my room.
At midnight came to interrupt Oliverio.
It came from a dance brought in dresses like the smell of luxury, clusters of women and pleasure, and in his face, a little folding of the vigil, wearing festive glow and some pale, some excitement that he payed infinitely seductive elegance
