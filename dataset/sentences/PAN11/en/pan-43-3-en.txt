It enshrines the same Tío Creeds were informed that a house at Bethlehem had been caught a board Carlist prisoners and all those who were.
If the political interest of the gatherings corderiles was in the news, its refreshing depended on the grace and daring of Johnny James with its language said more than half if I had all full, and you recite fables or romances, already been dispatched to taste with frasecillas and observations of his own, was die laughing the whole family, except when he was by getting angry, pouting and throwing at the head his brother's shoe, book, candle, ink or other deadly projectile.
The store had been pierced by Lamb to another dealer, friend and relative, and This trade was completely removed.
Its capital, if not great, solid as more so, assured him sound modest incomes.
Had vast expansion and improvement projects in Cigarrales, and did not expect it to clarify the time to move there with all family.
In May boy was so improved that he thought his leg was now time to end his hesitations.
They had concluded to eat in peace and grace.
Benigno, leaving Alelí fell asleep on the couch in the dining room and do what Crucita himself in his room, sent the boys to school, and his fourth Sola, brought with it a conversation in which we must not lose the point or comma. - Dear Alone - he said - I have to give you explanations about an event that will surprise and maybe (and this is what I most regret) will hurt his pride in you.
Sola expressed very great surprise. - The fact is that, having resolved since I was in the House all the difficulties opposed to our marriage, I have postponed several times since that time an event so flattering to me.
As you might suspect that these delays meant something reluctantly, coldness or little desire to be her husband, and as nothing could be further from the true that the suspicion of you, I have to explain to daughter, I have to reveal certain thoughts intimate and certain little things ....
darémosle this name, which is the one you block ...
has been some doubt that I was assaulted, some fear that our marriage did you make it miserable rather than happy, as I wish. - Unfortunately - Sola said, getting that idea as an insult. - Oh!
These scruples and fears do not concern anything that might undermine the extraordinary merits of which I chose for a wife; are pure thing and mine alone.
It is time to speak with complete frankness, and not conceal any idea however painful it is for me.
Well, there is a person, a man, daughter mine, that you appreciate how much it's worth, who knows you from childhood, which has been protected, he loves, he loves, a man that maybe, why not?
Sola dear, my dear, I seem to have put his finger on an old wound that heart no par, made to endure and suffer as any ....
In his face you see ....
She had been pale as if he had to face a mask of wax, and looked at his apron, whose tip was between the toes. - This pale - said D.
Benigno moved - does not in any way that you have to repent anything, it is not about fault, indicates that I have aroused a feeling that slept, Is not it?
Sola's pallor vanished like a veil is torn revealing the clarity that conceals and so, by how similar the sharp pull back a curtain, as was kindled in her a vivid blush.
Leaning to mourn, whispered these words: - It's true, yes sir.
You are kinder than the angels.
What you say, was killed and buried in my heart for ever DNR. - I know, I know - no less upset Lamb said that her friend -.
At this time that has passed since I came to the farm, you can say no I lived but to think about this and make comparisons.
Yes, I have lived comparing me, dear daughter, lived tormented by a comparative analysis of the qualities that I have and which meets the man whom you know better than me, being that he is extraordinarily than me. - Oh!
no, a hundred times no - Sola said forcefully -.
Quite the contrary. - Non-violent nature, my daughter nonviolent nor logic.
Benigno shook his head in sad gesture. - Non-violent nature, darling, nonviolent logic - repeated -.
I concede that no I totally dislike it, but you, that feels and runs very well, you can tell if there nothing in the person and the soul of an old man can compete with the youth, his face joyful and expressive of a healthy man in the prime of his affections, his strength, his whole life. - Depending on how you look, depending on how you look - Sola said taken out of compassion for his friend and eager to give all the advantages. - Oh! - Said D.
Benigno smiling - even though you strive to give me flowers, do not get I enfatúe me or I obceque to the point of not seeing clearly what I am.
Old age has its pre-eminence, has its beauties, but these eminences and these beauties are not of great value if we try.
I know well, or I do not I take even a ounce of what really weight placed on the balance of marriage, I do not think I lack some qualities that would make me appreciate and respect and even love of a young woman, but the Compared to other shows me my age, who are not considered for the case loose, I revealed my ailments, which have started right now as a warning, a warning that God me through nature.
In short, my dear, if you try any strange any upstart that this time is present, or by thought I would you may prefer to me, but alas!
this is an old friendship, affection old and old it on you ....
You have shown me, telling me with the accent noble and fair, "is true, is true." - True - Sola said - and now, it is not in my heart or even a fund of the secrets that have kept it for so very long, I will confess to you ....
In front of a priest before God Himself would not be sincere, you believe me ....
If not previously mentioned this was because I wanted to see it as something dead and buried.
Thought that the more you shut up and think least, the greater the forgetting, and I dared not confess, for fear that the confession was reborn and torment me again.
Who would not see it up close, believe he was on his knees. - Much of what you have so eagerly silent, for their commitment to hush and more land on a feeling miserable - Lamb said - he showed me. - There will be told you that I picked up my father's death, putting the defense of his mother, and looking at me as a sister.
If boasted of its benefits did well, because these were great at that time. - Do not brag.
Go ahead. - I would also say that I watched as a sister and served as a slave.
Benigno smiled. - But you - he said - he wanted to since then? ... - I am ashamed to say - said Sola - snubbed by the role I played, but making a confession, I do not hide anything.
I wanted to, yes, very much. - How? - Everything you love a person - she said, bowing his head, which weighed, no doubt, by an extraordinary agglomeration of memories.
Cordero felt a lump in his throat.
Swallowing needed something to remove that obstacle and power say - And always the same? - I always wanted the same thing and thought only of him, all the time, asleep and awake. - And when I was away? - I wanted more. - And when he returned? - More.
It was something greater than myself, a kind of sickness or misfortune that God sent me. - Did not you tried to get rid of this torment, thinking of another? - In another man! - Sola said as horrified -.
What I felt that torment me I needed to live, like air and light. - You never showed her actions and words the very large crowd that had? - Oh!
and giving me a reason that suddenly seemed to him as loving I loved him. - Oh!
Benigno, clenching his fist threateningly - for life ....
you despise If you come to me then and tell me what's wrong, as he tells me now, I swear to you that right this man and lame, and I say, 'Look here, sir ...».
One could not help but laugh a little, and said: - I did not hurt you more than to be my worst enemy.
I took it with little tenacity ....
I realize now that was very extreme and I myself heating up the imagination night and day, or when adding fuel to a fire that is afraid to see off.
Since there was no whom I could tell such things, I would count myself.
I consoled me saying nonsense and resigned, as the many misfortunes that I had since childhood and always me Private everything else I wanted, I got used to a lot of patience, a lot.
It's a comfort a little sad that the patient, but using it much, for loving one concludes and become familiar with it ....
to my happiness, yes sir, joy in my way, because what would be relieved if our media had not ever take itself that the outsiders do not want to give! ...
I think that the days were like veils to be running slowly, one on another, and these veils fell upon my memory, and gradually died down and obscuring what was in it.
After some time I began to see ...
and the mist away; and occupations, all I thought was discontinued to make room for other things.
Sometimes lost abruptly lost ground, I mean, that because of some dream, some conversation that reminded me of things past, or anything, my simplicity, again to feel atormentadísima, and it seemed to have him front and hear you, always so loving, always so good, but always brother! ...
because they were such as relapse a disease ...
I was triumphant at last, and if I could avail myself of an odd expression .... - So, tell you that odd expression, darling gravedigger. - Well I will say that lately I walked on the huge mound that I had missed penalties on those buried ....
Sometimes it was not safe, because I felt that was moving under my feet the earth ...
Parallel I wonder. - As in these and other things, I came to know a person who told me much interest, much consideration ....
I did not know how to pay, and said: "It is unfortunate for me not to have something valuable to offer this generous man. " How far was then assume that my generous man, my second father had wanted to take its benefits in a way that made me more to gratitude!
I worked at home, would have liked multiply the obligations to enslave more.
I realized that my friend had found this poor some merit, and was not happy with me to be his maidservant, nor his pupil, nor his daughter wanted to take his generosity to such an extent ....
Gratitude filled my heart, what joy causes me to thank and to pay, even with little! ...
I then accepted the favors of my protector, and I thought I should do everything possible deserve the immense good that the man wanted me.
My good protector took possession of my soul in a sweet and slow.
I got to get used to your company so that if I was missing, faltaríame main thing in life.
The idea of ??being his wife stuck on me, took root, and then I promised him without scruple and with clear conscience.
What best owner could wish that this man can not be beaten, for whom I felt gratitude well a love so great, so great I do not know how to express it?
Benigno did the impossible to prevent the tears out of their eyes and he looked the bed, while meeting with his whole soul to which Sola said, and stretched muscles of his face, and finally to tears wanting to put docks make sympathetic laughter.
Finally, emotion overcame her dignity and her hand to her eyes. - I acknowledge with pleasure, with great gusto - said talking to embarrassment, but no tears - that you accept my offerings has made loyalty ...
acknowledge that you, answer yes to my prayers, threw the last handful of earth on a sad past, offered me their love and I devoted his whole person, their future ...
then changed things are suddenly introduced to you one on whom had fallen so dearly earth .... - No - Sola said strongly, rising -.
When appeared, I no longer belonged to me.
I feel so bound by my word before and after that visit, and should not, nor do I want ...
and I repeat, go back. - It is possible that the presence of this man what would you indifferent. - Indifferent not, but who has fought so hard and so has expired, could not in any way compromise victory.
I'm the same now as when I first went to Cigarrales to pass best days of my life ....
No doubt about it you will be my offense.
I whole body and soul of this orphan looked lonely and abandoned and had the incomparable generosity of wanting to make his wife.
Sola firm attitude, energy and loyalty in his face was painted like adequate expression of his own beautiful soul had overcome the good Cordero of admiration, gratitude, enthusiasm and love. - One word - he said - one question I want to do.
A little word nothing more.
We are two, two men, one young and full of life and health, excellent presence, Clear, rich, honest, with many items that will enhance the imagination of both learned to love a child, the other old, sick, heavy .... - Heavy no - cried single protest in the heat. - Well, let's take it from heavy ...
sick, ugly .... - In men there is no ugliness. - Sick - Lamb continued counting on his fingers - homely, short-sighted, honest yes, like the first, a good heart ....
They both want to marry such a Sola, and this seems to comedy.
A word to the lady is going to decide the issue, Which of the two I want a husband?
who have brush to paint this ray of truth shone supreme in the eyes Sola, the gesture of heroin with which his hand on his chest and eyes raised to heaven, beautiful for the truth, so sublime self-sacrifice was at the bottom of that truth, and who could express his accent when he spoke these words: - As God is my heavenly father, so I really want to marry the man!
Benigno had not embraced ever.
That day the first embraced, and that embrace was worth a thousand. -X- The father had Alelí, historian forgetful and senile, that night was D.
Benign for six hours straight without leaving your seat, staring at the tips of foot, and fist on the cheek, and this was added, the duration of his ecstasy, musing or drowsiness, that attitude that leaving joints had marked in red cheeks of his face, and elbow had left a very deep hole in the bearing arm of the chair.
But our good criterion allows us to blindly support this version, and thus reduce three to six hours of talks Alelí, which, as Herodotus was much inclined to exaggerate and proportions to what he saw.
It would be better still, reduce to one hour only within perplexity that our dear Lord, and we will.
In his spirit can only say that once looked very happy as very sad.
Early next day, after a dream or deep or long, rose, and dispatching hurried breakfast, and went straight out looking for a guy who lived on the street Duke of Alba, along with D.
He was unlucky day for Botero, because the individual who had sought out earlier than usual, leaving that to servants who did not wait in all day. - Barástolis Barástolis and more!
who Benigno looked so hard was not far from home.
If Lamb instead of going back to the Merced and Calle Carretas with the intention of finding him, had San Millán and continued to Street Studios, would have found insurance.
Was compared a door of that street, staring at a man in a large pot, a coffee table brass covered in a huge pot of dough and on a hook.
In the cauldron that was huge, bellied black and a medium yellow sea boiled with bubbles that appeared drops of amber dancing on a gold surface.
