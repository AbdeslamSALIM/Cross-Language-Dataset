Consciousness is not just a torch.
If I thought like you there is a God conscious creator of all beings, we send a "kissing hand" praising him for having been a child so kind and lovely as my wife and thanking her for having reserved for me particular application.
Unfortunately I can not represent that God received in his bathrobe and slippers my greeting cards.
I rather think she and I are victims of logic.
My wife was born with nails to tear.
I was born with a soft heart on purpose to be torn.
It would be a contradiction she does not scratch and I was not scratched. - And yet you've loved this woman with all her heart! - Ah, yes - the gentleman said, closing his eyes and passing his hand across his forehead naked .-- The I loved you ...
For a moment I was comparable to the immortals of Olympus.
Happiness sang within my soul the most beautiful song ever accompanied her divine games.
The sea was mumbling there only for gold mirror images that crossed my mind ...
No man was hunted by the species with more caution, more exquisite attention ...
But you are a formal person and can not think such nonsense.
