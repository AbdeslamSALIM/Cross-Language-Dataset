Since money is the object of worship, French society, and especially Paris, is prey profit, gain easy, immediate, whether or not moral.
The source of wealth is work: out of it is searched Paris and acquired with the Auxiliary to offer, now the Prostitution now vice.
Men, women, are inattentive in a confused maelstrom in search of money, and a vertigo pushes them a thirst consumes hydropic gold.
So are many other peoples of Europe, next to a Stormy dislocations which must necessarily bring agio of the bags.
The feudalism of money now weighs about people, more terrible even than the Middle Ages, the oppressed in the name of certain principles, even ridiculous, had something noble and great in the way, that of our days is miserable and awkward, no slogan or shield more than money it is their religion, politics, morals, its coat of arms, everything: money, and nothing but money.
Oppress him companies are imposing the law to governments, make it impossible liberty: a dozen Jewish bankers lend money to all Christian governments of Europe, giving the law to all bags, enhance and stimulate the ambition of money to any price purchased.
The Gold Rush silt up the sources of public morality, and enslave the peoples because a corrupt people can not get to be free: replaced God with money given to public worship everywhere and particularly in their temples-bags.
The revolution, the day on which to account, to demolish their foundation stock, and make impossible the reign of gold, most miserable of all.
Returning to Paris, from which an almost involuntary digression me separately in the capital of France, where it receives more worship than anywhere else in the world money, there are sanctimonious all means to acquire it, that burning desire to live there hearts, there is absolutely necessary to purchase money and that not enough is considered a man without talent Is horrible!
The French company running hastily to an abyss.
A government to fertilize the sources of public morality with good laws and examples, to kill the agio, which ennobled the work, to preach the sanctity of the modest August fortunes of the people, nobly acquired by the sweat of front may stop the catastrophe that threatens us.
A free government knows, involved, examine everything, there is transparency to all acts, the discussion and publicity absolutely free kill those secret miseries that make life speculators, with a free government, are touting and demonize all concussions, freedom occupies the minds in higher things, to make citizens live in an area of noble aspirations, sentiments large.
By studying the statistics is that corruption spreads Paris quickly, and the manner of a foul leprosy, threatens to consume the body social.
In Paris there is scarcely family, and without this society is not possible: the hotels and restaurants are those that meet the most part to the inhabitants of the capital at the lunch: a large part of the population of Paris throughout the year come out of his house, and homeless, sanctuary of the conditions, dissolved on the street.
Impossible, impossible to education of children, which perfect at home, hearth and home; impossible the conditions that are born, grow, develop and live within home, and only there, impossible to family, who live dispersed on the street, and the family is impossible, impossible is also society, and this is what happens in Paris, this is what I I've seen, these are the social mores of the capital France, which many witness without stopping to deduct consequences, that is what they see all foreigners.
Meditate well on its significance, that is important, I infer that and pointed.
In Paris are easily bought and sold conditions are traffics in everything, and the one universal religion is that devoted to money.
Recorded daily processes scandalous disconsolate philosopher able to create less in the perfectibility of the human race, to succeed each other bankruptcies that lay in desolation and frighten families the observer, the suicides are repeated with a tremendous often puts scare in the soul: the courts deal almost without respite in knowing that condemns any defamatory matters moral, it is unsound, and all these acts just enunciate pass into the light of day and recorded in statistics: who will be able to deal with actions that not judged in secret scenes that rend the soul every day within families?
If we study the statistics of the moral life of Paris is the dismal and terrible figures are increased each year: the broken marriages, suicides, new homes game, the great fortunes plummet, the terrifying miseries that appear, the court processes that twice, homes of correction that are filled, in a word data are published every year concerning the moral status Paris society, are enough to discourage the spirit and almost prostrate faith in progress.
La Magdalena, which I deal elsewhere slightly, is a very pretty art building, which has four elegant facades, with their respective order of columns each Corinthian, is a slender, graceful monument, which resembles a Greek temple, a lyceum, a gymnasium.
The interior corresponds to announcing his gallant bearing out, and participates Christian also taste some of its facade.
In the table altar appears Napoleon, whom we had no news that had been canonized, it is also true that we have seen in Milan, capping one of the elegant needle its magnificent cathedral.
Notre-Dame, which also speak in another place, is a imposing and majestic temple, where they currently barbarian repairs unsightly venerable appearance.
Also the church of Saint Sulpice is worth seeing.
The church of San Esteban del Monte, whose magnificent interior surprises with its architectural elegance and taste and severe style, has lately been the scene of a great crime that ended in sent a shockwave through Paris.
Inside the church is the murderer Verge buried a knife in the heart of the venerable Archbishop of Paris Archbishop Sibour.
Saint Germain l'Auxerrois deserve the traveler's check, his elegant construction, but somewhat flattened shape, its different styles forming a bizarre, its inner beauty are regarded as one very good and make San Germain one of the most beautiful churches in Paris.
San Vicente de Paul, with its elegant and airy porch columns, its two towers and the main body so handsome, also called the attention of looking for art and taste monumental: the interior is severe and religious.
La Sainte Chapelle, playing with the Palace of Justice, is a prodigy of art: graceful shapes and eastern purity lines, architectural severity.
The slight and graceful tower that rises like a crown, would be doubly beautiful if modern, which aim to decorate everything, they had not disfigured by making it a subject of hardware, many are those that have gilded dress.
However, the traveler can not be dispensed to visit the temple is magnificent and venerable.
I waive its history here because that is not my object in this place.
Santa Clotilde, located across the Seine, is a true Jewel: observing his youth, written in its construction, the feel a sense of wonder.
In our century up so fast, and this time when construction to be good must require little time, has risen in Santa Clotilde a Gothic church pure, without mixture of tastes and styles.
It is a beautiful church worthy of being seen: recently be completed and submitted for public worship.
Before his elegant facade lies a spacious plaza planted gardens, which embellish the picture.
The real Paris monument which today is the Louvre, joined as is already the Tuileries.
It seems incredible that in this century how quickly light up without ever stopping in works long term, have been verified in such a short period colossal works of the Louvre.
And has joined with the Tuileries, and form a whole without rival, Place du Carrousel great, wonderfully admirable, is perhaps the most impressive in Europe: the art, which dispenses with on frequency in modern buildings, bright incredible majestic works of the Louvre: Good Italian and French architects who have directed the work, have built a glorious temple for art forms, architectural taste, good traditions preserved, the severity of styles, luxurious construction, air imposing breathing, the whole and details surprise and admiration.
Worthy of praise is the consistency with which the present chief magistrate of France has taken and ended so gigantic works.
To advise visitors to Paris to stop frequently front of the Louvre, there is much to consider, there is much to admire.
Also worth a special visit and stopped the rich museums that adorn the interior, including painting and sculpture.
The latter, well ordered and quite rich, containing among other marvels of Greek statues of the Gladiator and Venus, which will astound the mind and make Greece artistic apologia: impossible thing more admirable, are models are timeless works are marvels of art.
The museum of paintings, where the different schools shine know, claims many visits of anyone who loves the noble art of Raphael and Murillo.
Richest school that holds in the galleries of the Louvre is the Flemish, with Pleiades inspired brilliant artists, with animated paintings.
The Italian school, powerfully splendid, also looks at the Louvre with all its pomp in the square room, the richest of all, read at the foot of canvas without rival, the illustrious headings of Raphael, Titian, Rubens, Paul Veronese, Tintoretto, Leonardo de Vinci, Murillo, in the midst of those children of genius, two immortal Virgin proclaims the strength of Spanish school, which also shines with all its brave splendor in the halls of the Louvre.
The French school, richer there than in any other museum It also has the major works of his inspired teachers: in short, those who visit Paris, you can not dispense in any way to see the Louvre.
The theaters of Paris, studied with detention, grieve deeply the mind: public morality ever goes wrong stop: it is extremely difficult to attend to the representation of a comedy in which there is a woman who deceives her husband is a detail almost indispensable.
True, the playwright who lives in Paris, which studies of society and translates it into the scene, is not to all times to portray noble types ...
but anyway forms of dialogue, the Spanish public, the English public, not acceptable ever.
In Spain, otherwise understand the theater, will certainly because our family is different.
This therefore makes the theater moral question: if we speak of the halls and orchestras nothing good can point, absolutely nothing around Paris there is a great theater, not one, orchestras can be heard only the Opera, which is great, and the Italians and Opera-Comique, the rest are provincial orchestras.
Forms of dialogue, a little casual and free also contribute to the impression of disgust that produce cited in the mind of comedy you're used to a dramatic literature and moral dignity, without being fanatical or superstitious, always respects the moral maxims taught comforting, offers noble types, and does not offend the modesty never mothers or daughters.
The study more comforting than I have done in Paris has been the daily reading of the section containing losses newspapers.
The soul rests and rejoices as I read read ads daily that poor people do to have found gold bracelets, bank notes, precious jewels, and what is more even, purses and wallets with respectable amounts in cash: they publish to becomes aware of their own and pass to pick them up.
The Paris public lighting leaves much to be desired and is very far from corresponding to the greatness of the capital.
The choice persuaded of the truth of this assertion, which is passed a Paris Sunday after one night, or any other day of the week.
There are more lanterns in the shops in Street: this happens on the same boulevard, as soon as closed shops and hotels that have lighting, street Paris offered a bit dark because of bluff to bluff there a great distance, and the light comes with great difficulty.
The Richelieu Street, Vivienne, Montmartre and a hundred, have, after twelve o'clock at night, a questionable light and opaque; this is the truth.
The face of Paris change every day, beautiful; the six years ago visited the monuments and streets, is Today many reforms and innovations, which can scarcely recognize.
Apart from the colossal works of the Louvre, the imagination can not understand have been executed in such a short term, the Rue de Rivoli, majestic and proud, is to increase the admiration of the traveler.
In all areas of the big business, have been demolished hundreds of houses miserable rise on the ruins of palaces and elegant today buildings.
The Boulevard Sebastopol, work in any other country that had lasted eight or ten years, is nearing completion at all, beautifying more and more Paris.
The Bois de Boulogne, Champs Elysees, all neighborhoods have changed in appearance: the Paris of the year 40 completely disappears to give place to a new city.
The proposed study in Paris has more resources than anywhere in the world, and helpful observation theaters and useful, has, in addition to their libraries, newspapers, theaters and academies, have, say, the boulevard, a thousand book chapters of deep learning, is the quarters of the workers, of the aristocracy, the trade, the unfortunate, the curious rag-picker, statistics, high and low the stock market, fluctuations in European politics, the flight newspapers, the tumultuous roar of their orchestras and ebullient delights: the terrible loneliness of misfortune and misery, the great fortunes from the side of the heroic and misfortunes suffered the scorching volcanic rages pleasure hectic everywhere and screaming without respite to not out of tune you hear the voice of the disaffected: contrasts tremendous, the ruins and misery, glory and money: the most perfect quiet, always ready to become angry storm, the dark uncertain future and present: belief and faith to the side of skepticism and ridicule: how big mixed with the small, all contrasts, enfin, everyone.
No study more profitable, none more useful than teaching that is acquired by studying the city monster called Paris.
Among the delightful walks in Paris, stands out in the first complete the Bois de Boulogne, the most remarkable recreational site any capital that Europe can offer.
Its leafy streets of felled trees with more art finish, lakes and waterfalls, meadows delicious, their artistic gardens and woodlands make up a set so happy and smiling, so beautiful and elegant than any painter less sensitive may not absorbed and delighted to behold, its proportions, his paintings, lights and shadows, its poetry, enfin.
Within flaunts his prodigious extension with the luxury of a spring inside, the superb Pré Catelan, deliciosísimo recreational site that brings together the richest and most varied collection of flowers in Europe.
The night parties there are in the middle the burning of lights that shine, look like a fairy tale: their orchestras and theaters, among which is the first place the call of the flowers, for being so in reality its canals and bridges, the hillocks and waterfalls, make it a lovely garden.
At the Bois de Boulogne come in numbers fabulous most elegant carriages of Paris, and the crowd pleased walks and spreads among his greatness.
In the Bois de Boulogne are also several other gardens, there restaurants, Swiss houses, cafes, etc., etc.
Beside the great cascade extends the plain of Longchamps, where they horse racing site.
The bus lines that run through Paris in all directions spend thirty, all have a great number of carriages and a great service to the public in addition to encourage capital with their movement and life.
The rate of prices is the most comfortable imaginable, for three salaries in the imperial and six in bus, it runs along a line, usually consists of a large distance across Paris from one end to another.
Square cars, ruled since last August by a new fee, also offer service on its well understood few amenities may like: their number is large, its stations located throughout the capital, so the traveler finds as soon as a coach want his service.
Among privately owned cars, the lines bus, car companies plaza, cars & vehicles of all species, the number of carriages that circulates through the Paris inside the fabulous amounts of one hundred seventy thousand.
According to the new rate can now be a carriage minutes, having no obligation to pay as before one hour but the time spent, each carriage has a fixed clock indicate when it is taken.
Around the huge metropolis are also worthy of be visited by more than one concept.
Apart from the care and taste that is cultivated countryside, brighten and beautify their terms the many happy people displayed by all parties.
Because communications are so easy, thanks to the railroads, a foreigner who wishes to study and learn around Paris can get your order in a few days.
In the same street station San Lazaro is a railway line to visit Passy Auteuil, to Batignolles, Courcelles, Porte Maillot Bois de Boulogne.
Heading abroad to road North iron, you can also see in half an hour three delightful towns, among which stands out for its beauty Enghien, with its tranquil lake, which surround all handsome houses field.
At any point that the traveler is directed, and any that is the direction of their trips, is assured find cafes, hotels and restaurants in abundance.
Since both has been promoted in recent years the work of the railways of France, Paris is in communication instant with all the capitals of Europe, so arrive in large numbers daily travelers of all around the world come to visit.
The number of foreigners pouring in from all parts of the land rises to a figure truly amazing, and in Paris, modern Babylon, Oyens speak all languages ??and are all the costumes.
The prisons of Paris a few years ago left much to be want, have greatly improved their system and organization, and today, although they can serve as models, certainly worth a visit arrested when trying to learn compared.
The stations of the railway lines, buildings have to me more important than any other public facilities, for its high significance in the holy crusade of the ideas that transmit them to the towns, making them know each other, are veritable palaces in Paris.
