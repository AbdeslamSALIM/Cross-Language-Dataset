The story is relatively modern, for, as my friend, have yet to discover legends and stories in Proto-Iberian, oldest and most venerable Egyptian poem Pentaur about a feat or Rans Sesostris II, and that the poems found by our known Mr.
Layard diplomat in the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh archaic poems and eight centuries BC, and translated most of the sacred language of the Akkadians, then so dead like Latin with us now.
And this should not wonder, because according Roisel at The Atlantis, all culture comes from these, before been in Chaldea, Assyria, in Egypt or at any point of the East.
It is unfortunate that we still have no documents of the Golden Age or Golden Age of Atlantic Parisian literature of place some eight thousand years, or the emanation of that bética culture, implemented by the banks of the Guadalquivir turdetanos.
The document found, deciphered, explained and commented by Don Juan Fresco is relatively time fresh, as it were of yesterday morning.
Iberian and indigenous culture had declined and Spain were full of even Phoenician and Greek colonies.
Those had already founded Zazinto Sagunto, and for over a century they founded the Tyre to Malaga, Abdera, Hispalis and Gades.
It was for the years 1000, BC vulgar, on more or less.
II Vescio was an important city of the Confederation of Turduli.
At the time we mean, the vescianos already had the same quality as the day their descendants have been dictation bermejinos valid: almost all were blond and some candles.
Stood out among all as fair as well as handsome and dashing, elegant and noble young man Mutileder.

You can almost ensure that his only fault was being poor.
Mutileder, lost his father and mother, had no urban land and rustic, lived as love staying with his uncles, and Vescio did not know what used to make a living.
Was a man, as they say, without a job or benefit.
And was bordering on twenty-four, and tired of this life, and longing to see the world, called blessing to his uncles, who were accompanied by some the money, and also taking weapons and horse, Vescio left to seek adventure and how to improve the condition.
As Mutileder presence was so beautiful, and it was also nice and happy, everywhere was very pleasing.
The bells sugetos of fancy and he was invited to dances and parties and the funniest ladies and haughty eyes put her love, but he was good, prudish and simpleton, and took out anything useful from this.
The money they gave him his uncles was consumed, and no new money came to replace him.
Thus, stopping in different populations, for example, Igábron, passing then Síngilis today Genil, entering the land of the turdetanos, and also stopping Ventipo, came to a place of Bastulos Aratispi was then called, and I suspect he be the Alora of our time, as famous for their games plains.
There was Mutileder a cousin who was a sun of beauty, with eighteen years of age, and fairer than he, if fits.
