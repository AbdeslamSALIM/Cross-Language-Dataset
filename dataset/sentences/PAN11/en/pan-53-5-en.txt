Propúsose, as always, be spiritual, and said: - Did you see what ventrisca run?
The girl was silent. - Nothing matters now - continued - because they are all collected fruits, but if there fallen before, not even leave us a chestnut or a grain of corn, heh, heh!
He felt happy Garnet issue this idea, judging by the expression of joy that shone in his eyes. - But here it's cold, eh? ...
Is it because your eyes are two calofer ...
Yet again rushed the floor radiators without being able to top the company.
To cover his impotence feigned a fit of coughing.
His face became purple interesting resemblance with that of a hanged man.
The beauty, who was staring into the void, turned his head to his devotee, he looked for a moment with an expression vague, distracted, as if he saw it.
Rose suddenly and walked away without saying a word to sit in front.
The Indian kept the same smile stereotyped in the face, the petrified face of a satyr.
But look back to the group I had just left, seeing a lot of laughing eyes fixed on him, was suddenly serious and sulky. - Which party has the Maroon among the pretty girls! - Paco Gomez said it already .-- I said the other day. "You no need of having to go to America rich women the world.
You have the fortune in the face. " - Look, condecito, now you must go and sit by his side.
She will not get up then - said Manuel Antonio. - Yes, yes, you must go, Luis - Maria Josefa supported .-- We will see a curious thing, to decide whether or not in love with you.
His voice went off and trembling. - Do you? - Asked the count, looking at her. - Yes, you go - the lady replied with perfect composure and, avoiding his gaze. - As you allow me to disobey.
I do not want to expose myself to a snub. - Never mind the slights to a lover! ...
Because you, more to say, is in love Fernanda ...
He knows the league. - The league will be, because, which is about a jot - Manuel Antonio said.
And Mary and Joseph and Emily Paco Mateo Gomez confirmed the species with laughter.
Indeed, Luis hid it well, but as for greater efforts to so, there is always a loose end, a crack through which light comes, she had guessed long ago that the Count, in the depths of his heart, kept fond memories Fernanda. - Address you: a few days ago he came to say Moro had two false teeth.
He almost hits ... - Not really, not so much - said the count, smiling ashamed .-- I expressed myself with some vividness it always annoyed me injustice. - Oh!
The exaltation in these cases are suspect.
You can say this girl has a brave champion willing to break lances for it.
The lady rushed the joke.
Not get enough of pressing the count, as if to let convicted Fernanda your love.
Despite the benevolent smile animated her face, there were certain odd inflection that no more than a single person could see at that time.
But the quadrille was over, and the group with multiple partners increased significantly they were relatives.
They went some others came, after all, the lady of the house found surrounded by new people.
Bailose another waltz and a quadrille.
The twelve sounded at last the great clock of the cathedral.
It was not very polite, but no one was angry.
On the contrary, is always received with jubilation, as a funny joke.
After everyone went to shake hands, the Grandee, Formosa middle of a group room.
Amalia, in the middle of it, kissing goodbye to her friends dearly.
She was pale and his eyes feverish looks uncertain goodbye.
To shake hands with the Count turned his head away, feigning distraction shook vigorously three or four times to pep talks.
Well I needed the poor gentleman.
I was so haggard and trembling that Amalia thought he would fall unconscious.
In a tightly-knit gatherings came out into the hallways and down the grand staircase of stone dirty and wet.
The curiosity excited soon to a lady to lift the cloth that covered the basket.
Immediately the cry uttered familiar, you released so many centuries ago and the daughter Pharaoh saw floating on the river's famous Moses basket. - A child!
Moment of amazement and curiosity in the circles.
All rush, everyone wants look at the same time the foundling.
For a moment no doubt that the child was there intentionally exposed.
Paco Gomez picked up the basket, and it was completely uncovered Showcasing his friends sleeping infant.
Burst a storm of cheers. - Angelito! - Who could have been the infamous Poor ?...--¡ of my soul - What hearts hyena My God - look how beautiful it is - Will there have long been exposed? - We'll be numb the creature .-- Paco, you let me touch it.
The basket was shooting from hand to hand.
The ladies, much interested, quivering with emotion, depositing tender kisses on the cheeks of the newborn, so that instantly got wake.
From that pile of pink flesh out a low moan that vibrated with pity at all hearts.
Some women shed tears. - Subámoslo, for now, to warm up a bit. - Yes, yes, subámoslo!
And again the resonant group launched into the courtyard and the staircase of the mansion Quiñones bearing in triumph the mysterious basket.
Amalia middle of the room was still and pale when the doors opened again.
Peter had been transferred to her bedroom and by Manin and another servant.
The lady looked at him a moment and said with marked coldness: - Perhaps some poor man will have left to pick it up right away. - No, no, we recorded the portal.
The street is deserted ...
The creature of all this began to scream, shaking his fists clenched uncertain movement, like two rosebuds.
The compassion of the women burst into exclamations again passionate.
They all wanted to kiss and warm against her breast.
Finally, Maria Josefa achieved seize him, pulled him out of the basket and wrapping it with cloth that had been covered, what tenderly stroked.
A paper had fallen from the clothes of the creature to remove and had fallen to the ground.
Manuel Antonio picked it up. - You see, Amalia?
Here is the mother of the lamb.
The paper said in big characters, drawn apparently by rough hand: "The unfortunate mother of this child entrusted to the charity of Mr.
And the tone in which they squandered these words was not difficult to detect some disappointment.
They had become accustomed to the idea that man was. - What mystery is this? - Asked Manuel Antonio, while a curious smirk wandered down her face. - Mystery?
None - Amalia said with some displeasure .-- What is clear is poor you want to keep it to your daughter. - However, here there is a something strange.
In fact, she had been covered with miserable rags and a tattered, dirty blanket. - Slowly, Amalia, slowly - Saleta said his voice clear, calm .-- I have collected in the doorway of my house many years ago, I found myself in Madrid, a child who had been involved in very rough diapers.
After some time we found out he was the son of a very high person I can not name.
All eyes turned in surprise to the judge Galician. - A very high person, that's - continued after a pause, with the same composure .-- Well impertinent easy it was, by the way, guess posting a little attention on the features of his face, Bourbon entirely.
The amazement of the bystanders was profound.
They looked at each other with a smile mocking as usual, Saleta seemed not to notice. - Atiza! - Valero said .-- Open uzté an umbrella, D.
Zante! - The child died two months - continued unperturbed Saleta .-- Surely when we took him to the cemetery the procession joined a car that no one knew to whom it belonged.
I knew him because he had seen in the royal stables, but I kept quiet. - It ezcampa! - Valero murmured. - Well, Saleta, and you tell us that day.
At night these things espeluznan - said the Sierra fag winking at the others .-- The thing to think now, Amalia, is to be done with this child.
The lady shrugged with indifference. - Phs ...
Tomorrow we will look for a nurse who wants to have it at home ...
because it, indeed, is a disorder. - If you do not want to have it at home, I'll be glad of it, Amalia - said Maria Josefa, who was walking a little way and lulling the child to silence. - I have not said he wanted - he said the lady hastily .-- will pick up that girl, because I have obligation than anyone, because trust me ...
But as you understand, to make I need to count on my husband.
The gatherings adopted these words in a whisper.
Manin appeared just asking from D.
Peter what the noise meant.
Immediately stated that it would of his house, ordering a servant to the dawn was in search of mother.
As soon as the child was brought milk and tea in a bottle teat, it is wrapped with more and better clothes.
Loving the circles witnessed with interest these operations.
The women uttered cries of enthusiasm, they were razed to tears to see the eagerness Mamosa with the girl sucking the nipple of the bottle.
So I got fed up, took leave everyone Again, not without deposit before each a kiss on the cheeks of the poor little foundling.
The Count de Onís lips had realized all this time.
Was withdrawn in third or fourth row, with eyes of shock following the care lavished on the creature.
And slyly tried to leave without further farewell, but Amalia stopped him with boasts of daring that left him stunned. - What is it, count, does not want you to kiss my ward? - Yo! ...
And pale and trembling, approached and placed his lips on the front of the creature, while the lady looked at him with provocative and triumphant smile.
This was the third night the Count de Onís could hardly close my eyes.
Nothing more natural in the previous two were agitated, feverish, but now, why?
Despite its robust figure and graceful, the count had a nervous system too impressionable.
His father, Colonel House, was a man focused, sensitive, delicate susceptibility that made him a martyr in the past years of his life.
Everyone Lancia recalled in an interesting and moving episode closed that chivalrous life.
The colonel commanding the defense forces of a plaza in Peru when the insurrection the American colonies.
The place was taken by the insurgents of an insidiously and surprise.
An evil colonel complained to the Madrid government as guilty of treason, asserting that it was in collusion and bribed by the enemy.
Too precipitation without impartial consideration of the facts and without regard to the brilliant record of Comte de Onis, the king was deprived of his job in the army and all the crosses and decorations owned.
Under the weight of this horrible injustice, military honor was stunned.
His companions pulled the gun at the time of threat to his life.
Accompanied by his faithful assistant and a cousin traveled from Madrid, where he had come to defend themselves, Lancia, where he waited his wife and young son.
Family life was a sedative for the terrible open sore in the heart of the soldier.
But that brave, so often had defied death, had not the courage to endure the stares and curiosity of his neighbors.
Instead of rebelling against the injustice he had done, instead of trying to convince his countrymen of his innocence, which would have cost not much work, because everyone felt his character and know their value, full of shame, as if it were really criminal, fled the eyes of the people, retreated to his house, and just walking in the garden behind it extended, high-fenced wall and damaged.
The palace of the Counts de Onís deserves special mention in this story.
It was a building very old, the oldest in the city together with some remains of the original basilica were still standing.
He had not saved anything from the horrific fire in the century XIV destroyed the population.
Few narrow windows cut by stone columns, distributed haphazardly in the front, a smooth wall of stone, blackened by the years, some square holes near the ceiling, by way of loopholes and a large semicircular door reinforced with large steel nails.
The inside was huge and had more joy.
The yard wide, wider than the street.
The trees in the garden put my branches for them, serving fresh shade to temper its rays.
The whole of this ancient mystery mansion offering unique charm and fitted for lacienses imagination, especially for children, only people who remain, in our prosaic age, fantasy awake.
Its facade, if such name can be given to that smooth wall with small holes lying bulk, overlooking the street of Mercy, one of the most central of the city.
One of the windows, perhaps the widest, Locksmith Street barreled, and she looked the cathedral in the distance.
Here is buried or imprisoned former Colonel House, were sufficient without the prayers of his wife and the few relatives who frequented his deal to make him desist from that decision.
His idleness was of value to the house.
He arranged the garden, put some viewpoints in the rear, furnished several rooms, paved patio, etc..
The dark old house, without losing its ancient and mysterious aspect, the inside was transformed into a pleasant home.
But military dishonor consumed, dried in it like a tree without light and water.
A deep melancholy undermined his body, he wrinkled skin, bleached her hair, weakened his legs and put his hands trembling.
At fifty-eight years old accounted be seventy.
Inside the house is not felt.
Walked through the corridors like a ghost.
Day was spent and no one will hear the voice metal.
A sweet, sad smile on his lips constantly wandering.
Did not seek the caresses of her son, but when I stumbled through the halls casually held his head lovingly kissed it, murmuring some tender words in his ear and suddenly and abruptly moved away, sometimes with tears in his eyes.
I thought it was a great misfortune for that little boy, blond and beautiful as a cherub being born son of a disgraced father.
The unhappy he apologized, his eyes, of having fathered.
By the year 1829, four after arriving in America, the colonel was a real spectrum
