Abstract: Daily, several news agencies publish thousands of articles concerning many events of all types (political, economic, cultural, etc.).
The decision-makers find themselves in front of a great number of events, a few of which concern them.
The automatic treatment of such events becomes increasingly necessary.
Thus, we propose a machine learning-based approach that allows annotating news articles to generate an automatic summary of the events.
