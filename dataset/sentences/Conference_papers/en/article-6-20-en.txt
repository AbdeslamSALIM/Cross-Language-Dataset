Then, 4 relational data tables have been obtained from the 4 feature data tables through a dissimilarity measure derived from the affinity coefficient (Barcelar-Nicolau (2000)).
We assume that each individual is described by one set-valued variable (“presentation”, etc.) which has mj modalities (or categories) {1, . . . ,m}.
An individual ei is described by xi = (ni1, . . . , nim) where nij is the frequency of modality j.
The dissimilarity between a pair of individuals ei and ei' is given by:
