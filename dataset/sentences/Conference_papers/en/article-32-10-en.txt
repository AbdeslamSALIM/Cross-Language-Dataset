The scope of local features is either the NP or the EDU that contains this NP.
Some of these features rely on an ontology that models a calendar (time, days, etc.) that was inspired from SUMO and COSMO3 which are top-level-ontologies.
We have five features at the NP level that test if the NP contains: a lexicalization of a concept that belongs to the ontology, a comparative, a superlative, a disjunction or a conjunction.
We have ten features at the EDU level: (1) the left context of the NP is a lexicalization of a concept that belongs to our ontology.
