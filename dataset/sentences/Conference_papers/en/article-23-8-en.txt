In order to consolidate the lexical network, we adopt a strategy based on a simple (if not simplistic) inference mechanism to propose new relations from those existing.
Inferred relations are submitted either to contributors for voting or to expert for direct validation/invalidation.
However, a non negligible part of them are found to bewrong and understanding why is both relevant and useful.
The explanation process can be viewed as reconciliation between the inference engine and the validator who is guided through a dialog to explain why he found the considered relation incorrect.
