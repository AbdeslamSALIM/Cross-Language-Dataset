Conclusion We created a list of French prepositions for parsing applications by comparing various lexicons and dictionaries.
Manual filtering was used to eliminate obsolete or rare prepositions, as well as a number of errors.
The resulting lexicon contains more than 250 French prepositions, among which 49 are simple prepositions.
