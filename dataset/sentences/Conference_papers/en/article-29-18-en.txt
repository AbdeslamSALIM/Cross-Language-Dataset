For the annotation, we used the Yawat (Germann, 2008) tool originally designed for the alignment of parallel texts at the word and phrase level.
We adapted the tool's annotation scheme for our multi-level annotation.
The annotation was performed by four trained annotators3 on 200 pairs of modification segments taken from a filtered version the WiCoPaCo corpus.
As punctuation modifications are frequent, only modification segments with a Levenshtein edit distance of at least 4 were considered for annotation.
