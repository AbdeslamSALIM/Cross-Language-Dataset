In figures 2 and 3, we report scatter plots for the study of the evolution (from train set to test set) of confidence values of extracted rules.
We also compare the values of the MODL criterion.
As expected, for all data sets, we observe that confidence is unstable from train to test: indeed, a highly confident rule in train may have low confidence in test (see the points far from the identity line).
