The approach we propose is based on a triangulation method involving the semantic transitivity with a blocking mechanism to avoid proposing dubious relations.
Inferred relations are then proposed to contributors to be validated or rejected.
In cas of invalidation, a reconciliation strategy is implemented to identify the cause of the erroneous inference : an exception, an error in the premises, or a confusion caused by polysemy.
