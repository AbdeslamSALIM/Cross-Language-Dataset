Organization of the rhetorical frames in rhetorical relations In this section we explain how to build the rhetorical frames formed by markers (releasing indicators and complementary indexes) and classify them according to the rhetorical relations.
Thus we have, in a rhetorical relation, a list of linguistic patterns made of a set of linguistic units of which the categories are sometimes heterogeneous (nouns, verbs, connectors, word tools, etc.) but which always fulfill the same discursive semantic functions.
