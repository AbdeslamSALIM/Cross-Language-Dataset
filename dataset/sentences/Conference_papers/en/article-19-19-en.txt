In the algorithm of (Ert√∂z et al., 2001), an element can be associated to a cluster when the strength of its link with one of the elements of this cluster is higher than a given threshold.
This condition is stricter in our case as it concerns the average strength of the links between the unclassified cooccurrent and those of the cluster.
