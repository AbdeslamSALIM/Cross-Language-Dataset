The JDM lexical network is constructed through a set of on-line associative games.
In these games, players are appealed to contribute on lexical and semantic relations between terms or verbal expressions which are presented in the network by the arcs interconnecting nodes in a graph.
The informations in the JDM network are gathered by an unnegotiated crowd agreement (classical contributive systems rely on a negotiated crowd agreement).
