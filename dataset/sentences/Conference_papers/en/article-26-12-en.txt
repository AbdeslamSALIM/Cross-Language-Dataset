Functionally, a feature can be mapped to a CSP variable, and a feature structure can be seen as a binding of values to an aggregate of feature variables.
A feature value can be a constant from a specific domain (for instance an enumeration as {Singular, Plural}, or an integer as {1(st), 2(nd), 3(rd)}).
A feature value can also be a (set of, list of) feature structure(s) (as Agreement in figure 1).
Hence standard finite domain CSP variables cannot be used to model features, and a notion of relations, or set variables must be used (as in [11, 17, 5]).
