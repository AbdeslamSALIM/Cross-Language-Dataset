Methontology [Fernandez et al., 1997, Corcho et al., 2005] is one of the most known methodologies for ontology construction.
It is a general, domain independent methodology, which defines the main activities of the ontology construction process and specifies the steps for performing them.
The most important activity is the conceptualization, where informal knowledge is converted into semi-formal specifications which enable the identification of the main ontology components.
