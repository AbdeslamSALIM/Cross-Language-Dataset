ant : NN(x1) - > social : JJ(x1) insect : NN(x1)live : VB(e1,x1,x3) in : IN(e1,x2) organized : JJ(x2)colony : NN(x2) There is 3 sets : x1 = {social, insect}, x2 = {organised, colony} and e1 = {live}.
This last and in make it possible to organise the sets as a hierarchy.
The vector of each one of these sets is calculated making the vectorial sum of the item which carry most of the meaning of this set (verbs, VB; nouns, NN) and half of the ones of the dependents (adverbs, RB; adjectives, JJ).
