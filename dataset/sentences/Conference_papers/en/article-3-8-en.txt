Comparison between two proximity indices It is easy to see that on the same data set, two proximity measures ui and u j generally lead to different proximity matrices.
But can we say that these two proximity measures are different?
Many articles have been devoted to this issue.
We can find in [Lerman, 1967] a proposal which says that two proximity measures u i and u j are equivalent if the preorders induced by each of the measures on all pairs of objects are identical.
