A Polarized Unification Grammar (PUG) is defined by a finite family T of types of objects, a set of maps attached to the objects of each type, a system (P,.) of polarities, a subset N of P of neutral polarities, and a finite subset of elementary polarized structures, whose objects are described by T; one elementary structure is marked as the initial one and must be used exactly once.
