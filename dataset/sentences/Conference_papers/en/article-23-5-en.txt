A highly lexicalized lexico-semantic network can contain concepts but also plain words (and multi-word expressions) as entry points (nodes) along with word senses.
The idea itself of word senses in the lexicographic tradition may be debatable in the case of resources for semantic analysis, and we generally prefer to consider word usages.
By words usages we mean refinement of a given word with is clearly identified by locutors but might not be always separated form other word usages of the same entry.
A word usage put the emphasis on how and which context the term is actually used by locutors.
