Conclusion In this paper, we have presented a way to improve the integrity of an acception base through well known semantic relations like synonymy, antonymy, hyperonymy and holonymy.
We have presented the values semantics relations (VSR) which can be comparated to the probability that a relation exists between two items or acceptions.
