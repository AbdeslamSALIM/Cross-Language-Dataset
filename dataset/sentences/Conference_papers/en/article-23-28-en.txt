The transitive inference on isa is the less productive which might seems surprising at first glance.
In fact, the isa relation is already quite populated in the network, and as such, fewer new relations can be inferred.
The agent semantic role (the agent-1 relation) is by far themost productive, with 30 more propositions than what currently exists in the lexical network.
