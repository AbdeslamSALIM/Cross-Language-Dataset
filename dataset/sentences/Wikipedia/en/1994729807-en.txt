Preeminent among these is Tawûsê Melek (frequently known as "Melek Tawus" in English publications), the Peacock Angel.
They believe that God first created Tawûsê Melek from his own illumination (Ronahî '') and the other six archangels were created later.
Yazidis hold that God created Tawûsê Melek on this day, and celebrate it as New Year's day.
Like the Ahl-e Haqq, the Yazidis use the metaphor of a change of garment to describe the process, which they call kiras guhorîn in Kurdish (changing the garment).
These may also reflect ancient Iranian preoccupations, as apparently do taboos concerning bodily refuse, hair, and menstrual blood.Too much contact with non-Yazidis is also considered polluting.
Dead are buried in conical tombs immediately after death and buried with hands crossed.Yazidi are dominantly monogamous but chiefs may be polygynous, having more than one wife.
