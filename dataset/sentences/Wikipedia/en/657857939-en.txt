The addition of tie beams above the crossing led to a false ceiling being installed below the lantern stage of the tower.Significant changes to the cathedral were made by the architect James Wyatt in 1790, including replacement of the original rood screen and demolition of the bell tower which stood about 320 feet (100 metres) north west of the main building.
