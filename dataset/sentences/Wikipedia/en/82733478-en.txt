Zone, two separate entrance ramps are used for heels and faces.HistoryFormation of the CompanyThe concept of TNA Wrestling started on a fishing trip between Bob Ryder, Jeff Jarrett, and Jerry Jarrett, where they were contemplating their futures in the business of wrestling.
His first goal was to get former World Championship Wrestling people, such as Jeremy Borash, into the project.
This was a completely different sell."Almost just as difficult was selling the weekly pay-per-view concept to the pay-per-view companies.
Until the introduction of the syndicated show, TNA Xplosion, in late 2002, TNA's weekly show was provided over pay-per-view to act as their main source of revenue, in place of monthly pay-per-view events used by other promotions.
Although the weekly TNA shows were priced at much less than the monthly WWE events, they achieved low buy rates.
TNA held its first three-hour monthly pay-per-view, Victory Road, on November 7 2004.''TNA Impact!'' , where TNA currently holds most of its televised shows]] TNA began airing TNA Impact! (official typeset "TNA iMPACT!") on June 4 2004 on Fox Sports Net and it soon replaced the weekly pay-per-views as their primary broadcast while the monthly events became the main source of revenue.
