Jim Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.
The show's success prompted Fox to expand its schedule to a new night (Thursday) and put it head-to-head against the number one ranked The Cosby Show which ultimately hurt the ratings of The Simpsons.
In 2004, The Simpsons replaced The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action) in the United States.
