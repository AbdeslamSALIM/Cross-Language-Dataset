The algorithm is designed to be fast to implement but is not usually optimal because it performs only limited analysis of the data.Description of the algorithmThe compressor algorithm builds a string translation table from the text being compressed.
This special case can be dealt with because the decompressor knows that the extension character is the previously-encountered character.Welch, T.
Others who distinguish between the algorithm and the code prefer calling the algorithm LZ and the code written by Welch as LZW.See alsoLZWLLZ77 and LZ78Lempel-Ziv-Markov algorithm (LZMA), used in 7-ZipLempel-Ziv-Storer-Szymanski (LZSS)DEFLATE, used in the ZIP file formatBurrows-Wheeler transformLZJB Used in the ZFS ("Zettabyte File System").ReferencesExternal links&quot;A technique for high-performance data compression&quot; - The original paper by WelchUnited States Patent 4,558,302 URL Retrieved on Saturday, June 03, 2006&quot;LZW Data Compression&quot;, by Mark Nelson (DDJ Article with source code)Sad day...
