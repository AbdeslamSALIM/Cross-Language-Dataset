He is sometimes confused with Karl Ludwig Hencke, another German astronomer.BiographyEncke studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the University of Göttingen under Carl Friedrich Gauss; but he enlisted in the Hanseatic Legion for the campaign of 1813–1814, and became lieutenant of artillery in the Prussian army in 1815.
In this year Encke married Amalie Becker (1787–1879), daughter of a bookseller.
They had three sons and two daughters.Eight masterly treatises on its movements were published by him in the Berlin Abhandlungen (1829–1859).
He still was director of the Berlin observatory until his death on 26 August 1865 in Spandau.
