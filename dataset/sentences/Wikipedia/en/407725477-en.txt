The other candidates to the throne were Guttorm Ingesson, the 11-year-old illegitimate son of King Inge Bårdsson; Knut Haakonson, legitimate son of earl Haakon the Crazy, who resided in Västergötland, Sweden, with his mother Kristin; earl Skule, who based his claim on being the closest living relative - a legitimate brother - of king Inge; and Sigurd Ribbung, who was at the time a captive of earl Skule.
