Patrick Graham, Supplement Series, no. 343 England: Sheffield Academic Press, 2001, pp. 300-306)The identifications of the biblical Mesha, king of Moab, and of the biblical Omri, king of the northern kingdom of Israel, in the Mesha stele are generally accepted by the scholarly community, especially because what is said about them in the narrative of the Mesha stele agrees well with the narrative in the biblical books of Kings and Chronicles.The identification of David in the Mesha stele, however, remains controversial.
