For example, in 1567, when Maxient Poitevin was mayor, king Henry III came for a visit, and, although some townspeople grumbled about the licentious behaviour of his entourage, Henry smoothed things over with a warm speech acknowledging their allegiance and thanking them for it.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;In this era, the mayor of Poitiers was preceded by sergeants wherever he went, consulted deliberative bodies, carried out their decisions, "heard civil and criminal suits in first instance", tried to insure that the food supply would be adequate, visited markets.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;In the 1500s, Poitiers impressed visitors because of its large size, and important features, including "royal courts, university, prolific printing shops, wealthy religious institutions, cathedral, numerous parishes, markets, impressive domestic architecture, extensive fortifications, and château."&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;AttractionsBaptistère Saint-Jean (4th Century) — the second oldest church in FrancePalace of Poitiers — the seat of the Dukes of AquitaineChurch Notre-Dame la Grande — oldest Roman church of EuropeCathédrale Saint-Pierre (12th Century)Musée Sainte-CroixÉglise St-Hilaire-le-Grand (11th Century)Hypogée des Dunes (underground chapel)Parc du Futuroscope (European Park of the Moving Image, some 10 km north of Poitiers; theme is visual communication technology in ultramodern buildings)DemographyTransportPoitiers has a railway station on the TGV route between Paris and Bordeaux.
