The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem.
So The barn is big is included in the subset, but not " The barn is big is true", nor problematic sentences such as "This sentence is false".Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences.
