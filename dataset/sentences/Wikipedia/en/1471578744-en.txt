Soon after, he joined with manufacturer George Powell to form the Powell-Peralta skate gear company.
With the financial backing of Powell-Peralta, Peralta formed the seminal Bones Brigade, a skate team comprised of some the best skaters at the time, many of whom revolutionized modern skateboarding.

His still-lingering love of the board manifested itself in the film, Dogtown and Z-Boys, a documentary film regarding the legendary skateboard team known as the Z-Boys, and Riding Giants, a 2004 documentary of the history of modern big wave surfing and tow-in surfing.
Dogtown won an award at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival.
