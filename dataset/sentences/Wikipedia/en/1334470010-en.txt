The Thermal Design Power (TDP) (sometimes called Thermal Design Point) represents the maximum amount of power the cooling system in a computer is required to dissipate.
For processors without integrated heat spreaders such as mobile processors, the thermal design power is referred to as the junction temperature (Tj).See alsoCPU power dissipationExternal linksSilentPCReview article on TDPCategory:Computer engineeringcs:TDP de:Thermal Design Power es:Thermal Design Power fr:Thermal Design Power it:Thermal Design Power nl:Thermal Design Power pl:Thermal Design Power ja:熱設計電力 ko:열 설계 전력 ru:TDP sv:Thermal Design Power tr:Isıl Tasarım Enerjisi zh:TDP
