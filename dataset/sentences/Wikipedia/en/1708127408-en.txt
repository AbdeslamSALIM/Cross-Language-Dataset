In 1592 he was married to Giovanna Baciadonna, daughter of the count of Galerrata.The houses of Spinola and Doria were rivals for authority within the republic.
In 1602 he and his brother Federico entered into a contract with the Spanish government--a condotta on the old Italian model.
Ambrogio Spinola undertook to raise 1000 men for land service, and Federico to form a squadron of galleys for service on the coast.Several of Federico's galleys were destroyed by English war-ships on his way up channel.
Ambrogio Spinola marched overland to Flanders in 1602 with the men he had raised at his own expense.
The ruinous remains of the place fell into his hands on September 22, 1604.The archduke Albert and the infanta Clara Eugenia, daughter of Philip II, who then governed Flanders and had set their hearts on taking Ostend, were delighted at his success, and it won him a high reputation among the soldiers of the time.
The wars of the Low Countries consisted at that time almost wholly of sieges, and Spinola made himself famous by the number of places he took in spite of the efforts of Maurice of Nassau to save them.In 1606 he again went to Spain.
