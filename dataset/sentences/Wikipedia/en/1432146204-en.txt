Groves range in size from 1,240&nbsp;ha (3,100 acres) with 20,000 mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees.
Loose ground ash may also act as a cover to protect the fallen seeds from ultraviolet radiation damage.Due to fire suppression efforts and livestock grazing during the early and mid 20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today.
The other agent is the Douglas Squirrel (Tamiasciurus douglasi) that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones.
The tree found by Dowd, christened the 'Discovery Tree', was felled in 1853.The first scientific naming of the species was by John Lindley in 1853, who named it Wellingtonia gigantea, without realizing this was an invalid name under the botanical code as the name Wellingtonia had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (Wellingtonia arnottiana in the family Sabiaceae).
The following year, Joseph Decaisne transferred it to the same genus as the Coast Redwood, naming it Sequoia gigantea, but again this name was invalid, having been applied earlier (in 1847, by Endlicher) to the Coast Redwood.
In Denmark, where extreme winters can reach &minus;32 Â°C, the largest tree was 35 m (114.83 ft) tall and 1.7 m (5.58 ft) diameter in 1976 and is bigger today.
