Díaz ran local elections to pacify the people and run a government that they could argue was self-imposed.
He observed numerous conflicts between villagers and hacendados over the constant theft of village land, and in one instance, saw the hacendados torch an entire village.For many years, he campaigned steadfastly for the rights of the villagers, first establishing via ancient title deeds their claims to disputed land, and then pressing the recalcitrant governor of Morelos into action.
Zapata responded that, if the people could not win their rights now, when they were armed, they would have no chance once they were unarmed and helpless.
Pablo González, appointed by Carranza in 1916 to recover the State of Morelos from Zapata's control, hanged many peasants and destroyed property all over the state, with no effect since Zapata's forces continued to fight, even recovering the city of Cuernavaca by mid-1917.The Carranza regime ultimately put a bounty on Zapata's head, expecting disenfranchised Zapatistas to betray him.
There are controversies on the portrayal of Emiliano Zapata and his followers, on whether they were bandits or revolutionaries.
