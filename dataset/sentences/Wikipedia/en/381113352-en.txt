T cell epitopes presented by MHC class I molecules are typically peptides between 8 and 11 amino acids in lengths, whereas MHC class II molecules present longer peptides, and non-classical MHC molecules also present non-peptidic epitopes such as glycolipids.Epitopes can be mapped using protein microarrays, and with the ELISPOT or ELISA techniques.Genetic sequences coding for epitopes that are recognised by common antibodies can be fused to genes, thus aiding further molecular characterization of the gene product.
