Catamarca is a province of Argentina, located in the northwest of the country.
To the west it borders Chile.HistoryBefore the arrival of the Spanish conquest, most of today's Catamarca was inhabited by the Diaguitas indigenous people, including the fierce Calchaqu√≠ tribe.
Attracting immigrants with its spacious, fertile valleys and dry, agreeable weather, Catamarca was soon favored by immigrants from Lebanon and Iran, who found Catamarca reminiscent of the fertile, orchard-lined mountain valleys of the homes they left behind.One such family, the Saadis, became prominent in local commerce and politics (much as the Syrian Menems in neighboring La Rioja Province).
Catamarca is home to one of the largest copper gold mines in the world, Bajo de la Alumbrera which produces approximately 600,000 ounces of gold and 190,000 tonnes of copper annually.
