The Ericsson implementation primarily runs interpreted virtual machine code, but it also includes a native code compiler (supported on most but not all platforms), developed by the High Performance Erlang Project (HiPE)&lt;/ref&gt; at Uppsala University.
According to Bjarne Däcker, who headed the Computer Science Lab at the time, this duality is intentional.Erlang, the mathematician?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Functional languageCode looks like this:'''-module'''(fact). '''-export'''([fac/1]).fac(0) -&gt; 1; fac(N) -&gt; N * fac(N-1).Below is an implementation of a Quicksort algorithm.''%% quicksort:qsort(List)'' ''%% Sort a list of items'' '''-module'''(quicksort). '''-export'''([qsort/1]).qsort([]) -&gt; []; qsort([Pivot|Rest]) -&gt; qsort([ X || X &lt;- Rest, X &lt; Pivot]) ++ [Pivot] ++ qsort([ Y || Y &lt;- Rest, Y &gt;= Pivot]).The above example recursively invokes the function qsort until nothing remains to be sorted.
The expression [ X || X means “Choose all X where X is a member of Rest and X is less than Pivot”, resulting in a very easy way of handling lists.
