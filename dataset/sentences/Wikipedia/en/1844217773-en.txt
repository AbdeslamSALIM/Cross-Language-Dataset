In 1945, upon signing the UN Charter, Argentina stated that it reserved its right to sovereignty of the islands, as well as its right to recover them.
The military junta which had ruled Argentina since 1976 sought to maintain power by diverting public attention from the nation's poor economic performance.
After short but fierce naval and air battles, the British landed at San Carlos Water on 21 May, and a land campaign followed until the Argentine forces surrendered on 14 June.Following the war, the British increased their military presence on the islands, constructing RAF Mount Pleasant and increasing the military garrison.
