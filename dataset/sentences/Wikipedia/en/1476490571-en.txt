Meanwhile, the Lille Métropole, which also includes Roubaix, Tourcoing and numerous suburban communities, had a population of 1,091,438.
The original inhabitants of this region were the Gauls, such as the Menapians, the Morins, the Atrebates, and the Nervians, who were followed by Germanic peoples, the Saxons and the Frisians, and the Franks later.
In 1144 Saint Sauveur parish was formed, which would give its name to the modern-day quartier Saint-Sauveur.The counts of Flanders, Boulogne, and Hainaut came together with England and the Holy Roman Empire of Germany and declared war on France and Philip II of France, a war that ended with the French victory at Bouvines in 1214.
Infante Ferdinand, Count of Flanders was imprisoned and the county fell into dispute: it would be his wife, Jeanne, Countess of Flanders and Constantinople, who ruled the city.
On February 6th, 1236, she founded the Countess's Hospital (L'hospice de la comtesse), which remains one of the most beautiful buildings in Old Lille.
Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, was even more powerful than the King of France, and made Lille an administrative and financial capital.On February 17, 1454, one year after the taking of Constantinople by the Turks, Philip the Good organised a Patagruelian banquet at his Lille palace, the still-celebrated "Feast of the Pheasant".
There the Duke and his court undertook an oath to Christianity.In 1477, at the death of the last duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, Mary of Burgundy married a Hapsburg, Maximilian of Austria, who thus became Count of Flanders.
At the end of the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Spanish Flanders fell to his eldest son, and thus under the rule of Philip II of Spain, King of Spain.
They were removed four months later by a Catholic Wallon regiment, after which they tried several times between 1581 and 1582 to take the city of Lille, all in vain.
The city was known for its cotton, and the nearby towns of Roubaix and Tourcoing worked wool.In 1853, Alexandre Desrousseaux composed his famous lullaby Dors mon p'tit quinquin.
The départments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (with the exception of the coast, notably Dunkirk) were, for the most part, liberated in five days, from the 1st to 5th September 1944 by British, American, Canadian, and Polish troops.
Following this, the Lille resistance managed to retake part of the city before the British tanks arrived.
From the start of the 1980s, the city began to turn itself more towards the service sector.In 1983, the VAL, the world's first automated rapid transit underground network, was opened.
In 1993, a high-speed TGV train line was opened, connecting Paris with Lille in one hour.
IEP Sciences-Po Lille political studies institute was established in Lille in 1992.Ecole Centrale de Lille was established as Institut Industriel du Nord (IDN) in 1872 and is one of the five Centrale Graduate Schools of engineering in France.
