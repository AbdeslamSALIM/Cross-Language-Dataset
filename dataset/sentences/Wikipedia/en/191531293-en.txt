Official settlement began on 28 December 1836, when the state was proclaimed at The Old Gum Tree by Governor John Hindmarsh.
Thijssen named his discovery "Pieter Nuyts Land", after the highest ranking individual on board.
The coastline of South Australia was first mapped by Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin in 1802.
Baudin referred to the land as "Terre Napol√©on".In 1834, the British Parliament passed the South Australia Act 1834, which enabled the province of South Australia to be established.
The plan for the colony was that it would be the ideal embodiment of the best qualities of British society, that is, no religious discrimination or unemployment.Settlement of nine vessels and 636 people was temporarily made at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island, until the official site of the colony was selected where Adelaide is currently located.
