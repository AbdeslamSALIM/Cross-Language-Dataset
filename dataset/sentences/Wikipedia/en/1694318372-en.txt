Journeyman 6'3" guard Brad Davis, who played for the Anchorage Northern Knights of the Continental Basketball Association, was tracked down and signed by the Mavs in December.
The Mavericks improved to 28–54, getting out of the Midwest Division cellar as they finished above the Utah Jazz.===Rise to power (1982–85)===In 1982-83, the Mavericks were serious contenders for the first time.
At the All-Star break, they were 25–24 and had won 12 of their last 15 games.
They could not sustain this momentum, and finishing seven games behind the Denver Nuggets for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Western Conference.
Brad Davis was 10th in the NBA in assists with 7.2 per game, and shot .845 from the line, 6th in the league.Derek Harper was drafted by the Mavs with the 11th pick of the 1983 NBA Draft.
Mark Aguirre led the team in scoring again with 25.7 ppg, Sam Perkins made the All-Rookie team, and Rolando Blackman represented the Mavericks in the 1985 NBA All-Star Game.
The Mavericks were left undermanned, demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38–44 record.
It was their first losing season since 1982–83—which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.===The Brief return (1989–90)===The Mavericks returned to the playoffs in 1989-90 with a 47–35 record, but it was another season of off-court chaos.
The players they managed to acquire—Rodney McCray, Fat Lever and Alex English—were all in the twilight of their careers.
On November 9 it was announced that Fat Lever would have season-ending surgery on his right knee, and that very night, Tarpley suffered a knee injury of his own which ended his season.
But that particular statistic is more indicative of the Mavs' desperation to get points from somewhere than of how well they did as a team.The Mavs finished 26–56, fifth in the Midwest Division and 33 games out of first place.
But they had acquired some of the pieces that would help them start to turn things around in years to come.In the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season, the Mavericks finished with a lowly 19–31 record, but Michael Finley and Gary Trent put up solid numbers and led their team to their first winning home record (15–10) since 1989–90.
The Mavericks finished with a 60–22 record in the regular season, astonishing fans and critics with their sparkling offense.
The "Big Three" Nowitzki-Finley-Nash were a 100-point-game waiting to happen and led the Mavericks into the Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs.
However, with the series tied 1–1 Dirk Nowitzki, the team's leading scorer, suffered a knee injury in game three that kept him out of the rest of the series.
Although the loss of All-Star Steve Nash via free agency visibly hurt the Mavericks' offense, the new acquisitions strengthened the team defense.
The run-and-gun style of former times changed into a more balanced style of play.
They finished out the regular season with a record of 67–15, good enough to be tied for 6th place all-time, 1st in the league and the #1 seed in the Western Conference playoffs.
