The business magazine referred to him as a "founding father of international finance".&lt;/ref&gt;He was born Mayer Amschel Bauer on February 23, 1744 in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany to Moses Amschel Bauer.
He changed his name to Rothschild ( German for "Red Shield") from Bauer, the previous family name, in reference to the red shield that was the official house sign and thus logotype of the family business, a bank and pawnshop founded by his father Moses.BiographyMuch of the early Rothschild fortune and rise to prominence was built on business dealings with Wilhelm IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel).
Wilhelm had inherited what was purported to be among the largest fortunes in Europe and eventually came to depend substantially on Mayer for managing this fortune, particularly during and after the invasion and conquest of the area by Napoleon (Wilhelm went into exile for several years, leaving his fortune in Mayer's hands). &lt;/ref&gt;MarriageOn August 29, 1770 Mayer married Gutl√© Schnapper (1753-1849).
