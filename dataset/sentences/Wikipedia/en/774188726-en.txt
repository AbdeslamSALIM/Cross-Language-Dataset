Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the Milky Way galaxy and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger.
Since gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe, these relative velocities, called peculiar velocities, need to be accounted for in the application of Hubble's law.The Finger of God effect is one result of this phenomenon discovered in 1938 by Benjamin Kenneally.
A non-zero, time-dependent value of q simply requires integration of the Friedmann equations backwards from the present time to the time when the comoving horizon size was zero.It was long thought that q'' was positive, indicating that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction.
The phrase "expansion timescale" means "Hubble time".http://ybmessager.free.fr/docs/wiki-journey.htmlHubble lengthThe Hubble length is a unit of distance in cosmology, defined as c/H_0—the speed of light multiplied by the Hubble time.
Some cosmologists even use the term Hubble volume to refer to the volume of the observable universe, although this has a radius approximately 3 times larger.See alsoAge of the universeShape of the universeHyperbolic geometry (crinkly due to expansion)Euclidean geometry (flat due to a balance)Elliptic geometry (round due to gravity)Notes tags-- ReferencesHubble, E.P.., The Observational Approach to Cosmology (Oxford, 1937)External linksThe Hubble Key ProjectThe Hubble Diagram ProjectCategory:Large-scale structure of the cosmos Category:Physical cosmologybg:Закон на Хъбъл ca:Constant de Hubble cs:Hubbleova konstanta da:Hubbles lov de:Hubble-Konstante et:Hubble'i seadus es:Ley de Hubble fr:Loi de Hubble hr:Hubbleov zakon io:Konstanto di Hubble id:Hukum Hubble it:Legge di Hubble he:קבוע האבל lt:Hablo dėsnis hu:Hubble-törvény ml:ഹബ്ബിള്‍ നിയമം nl:Wet van Hubble ja:ハッブルの法則 no:Hubbles lov pl:Prawo Hubble'a pt:Lei de Hubble-Homason ru:Закон Хаббла sk:Hubblova konštanta sl:Hubblov čas sr:Hablov zakon fi:Hubblen laki sv:Hubbles lag uk:Закон Хаббла zh:哈柏定律
