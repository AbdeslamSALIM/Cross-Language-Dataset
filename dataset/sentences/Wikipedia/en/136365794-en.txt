Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace in 2007.
Guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to Foo Fighters' second cover of Pink Floyd's "Have a Cigar", which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2.
Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album.
In Your Honor was released in June 2005.
