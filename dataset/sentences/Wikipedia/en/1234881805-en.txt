Following the Moorish conquest of peninsular Spain, Minorca was annexed to the Caliphate of Córdoba in 903 and given the Arabicized name of Manûrqa.
In 1231, after Christian forces reconquered Majorca, Minorca became an independent Islamic state, albeit one tributary to King James I of Aragon.
Most of the Muslim inhabitants of the island were enslaved and sold in the slave markets of Ibiza, Valencia and Barcelona.
Until 1344 the island was part of the Kingdom of Majorca, also an Aragonese vassal state, which was itself annexed to Aragon, and subsequently to the unified kingdom of Spain.
During the Seven Years' War, however, the failure of a British naval squadron to lift a French siege of Minorca on 20 May 1756 later led to the court-martial and execution of Admiral John Byng.
Despite this defeat, British resistance persisted at Maó, but the garrison was forced to capitulate under honourable terms, including free passage back to Britain, on 29 June of that same year.
