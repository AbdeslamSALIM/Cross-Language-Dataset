For example, acoustics is distinguished from optics in that sound waves are related to a mechanical rather than an electromagnetic wave-like transfer / transformation of vibratory energy.
A relevant example is Young's principle of interference (Young, 1802, in Hunt, 1978: 132).
All waves can experience the following:Reflection - wave direction change from hitting a reflective surfaceRefraction - wave direction change from entering a new mediumDiffraction - bending of waves as they interact with obstacles in their path, most pronounced for wavelengths on the order of the diffracting object sizeInterference - superposition of two waves that come into contact with each other (collide)Dispersion - wave splitting up by frequencyRectilinear propagation - the movement of light waves in a straight linePolarization A wave is polarized, if it can only oscillate in one direction.
In this case, propagation is possible without a medium, through vacuum.
Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave.
