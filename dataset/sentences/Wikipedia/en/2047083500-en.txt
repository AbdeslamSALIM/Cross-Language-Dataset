The fundamental geometric meaning of a determinant is as the scale factor for volume when ''A is regarded as a linear transformation.
The parallelogram in the figure is obtained by multiplying matrix A (which stores the co-ordinates of our parallelogram) with each of the row vectors \begin 0 & 0 \end, \begin 1 & 0 \end, \begin 1 & 1 \end and \begin0 & 1\end in turn.
Abstract formulationAn n'' &times; ''n square matrix A'' may be thought of as the coordinate representation of a linear transformation of an ''n-dimensional vector space V.
Given any linear transformationA:V\to V\,we can define the determinant of A'' as the determinant of any matrix representation of ''A.
That is, we define det(''A) by the equationAv_1 \wedge Av_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge Av_n = (\det A)\,v_1 \wedge v_2 \wedge \cdots \wedge v_n.One can check that this definition agrees with the coordinate-dependent definition given above.Algorithmic implementationThe naive method of implementing an algorithm to compute the determinant is to use Laplace's formula for expansion by cofactors.
For example, using Gaussian elimination, you can reduce the matrix to upper triangular form, then multiply the main diagonal to get the determinant (this is essentially a special case of the LU decomposition as above), but a quick calculation will show that the bit size of intermediate values could potentially become exponential.
One could talk about when it is appropriate to round intermediate values, but an elegant way of calculating the determinant uses the Bareiss Algorithm, an exact-division method based on Sylvester's identity to give a run time of order n3 and bit complexity roughly the bit size of the original entries in the matrix times n.HistoryHistorically, determinants were considered before matrices.
After the first work by Seki in 1683, Laplace's formula was given by two independent groups of scholars: Tanaka, Iseki (算法発揮,Sampo-Hakki, published in 1690) and Seki, Takebe, Takebe (大成算経, taisei-sankei, written at least before 1710).
Of the text-books on the subject Spottiswoode's was the first.
