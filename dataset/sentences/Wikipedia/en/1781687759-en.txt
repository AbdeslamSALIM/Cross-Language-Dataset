The park receives massive annual precipitation which is essentially orographic in origin as moist westerlies moving inland from the Tasman hit Mount Taranaki and the adjacent Pouakai and Kaitake ranges and are thus forced to rise.
Notable among the geographical features of the park is its clear radial drainage pattern, which can be roughly discerned in the photo at left.External linksNASA Earth Observatory page on Egmont National Park (1)NASA Earth Observatory page on Egmont National Park (2)Department of Conservation information on Egmont National ParkMount Egmont as Wallpaper Category:National parks of New Zealand Category:Taranakizh-min-nan:Egmont Kok-ka Kong-hn̂g de:Egmont-Nationalpark es:Parque Nacional Egmont fr:Parc national d'Egmont he:הפארק הלאומי אגמונט nl:Nationaal park Egmont pl:Park Narodowy Egmont vi:Vườn quốc gia Egmont
