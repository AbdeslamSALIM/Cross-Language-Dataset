Alessandro Stradella (3 April, 1639 - February 25, 1682) was an Italian composer of the middle Baroque.
In 1667 he moved to Rome where he composed copiously, mostly sacred music, and began to live a dissolute life.
Unfortunately his numerous incautious affairs with women began to make him enemies among the powerful men of the city, and he had to leave Rome for good.In 1677 he went to Venice, where he was hired by a powerful nobleman as the music tutor to his mistress.
He also wrote 27 separate instrumental pieces, most for strings and basso continuo, and typically in the sonata da chiesa format.His colorful life and bloody death clearly made a good story for an opera of its own.
