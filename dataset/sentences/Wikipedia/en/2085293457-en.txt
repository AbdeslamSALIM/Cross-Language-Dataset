Spain's population density, at 89.6/kmÂ² (231/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution along the country is very unequal.
Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level.
