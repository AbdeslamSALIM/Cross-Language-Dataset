Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher dimensions are called Bézier surfaces, of which the Bézier triangle is a special case.Bézier curves were widely publicized in 1962 by the French engineer Pierre Bézier, who used them to design automobile bodies.
The polygon formed by connecting the Bézier points with lines, starting with P'''0 and finishing with '''Pn'', is called the ''Bézier polygon (or control polygon).
The numerator is a weighted Bernstein-form Bézier curve and the denominator is a weighted sum of Bernstein polynomials.Given n'' + 1 control points '''P'i, the rational Bézier curve can be described by:\mathbf(t) = \frac^n b_(t) \mathbf_w_i ^n b_(t) w_i or simply\mathbf(t) = \frac^n t^i (1-t)^\mathbf_w_i ^n t^i (1-t)^w_i .
