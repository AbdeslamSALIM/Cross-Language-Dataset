According to New Scientist, it takes about 140 litres of water to grow the coffee beans needed to produce one cup of coffee, and the coffee is often grown in countries where there is a water shortage, like Ethiopia."Earth: The parched planet" by Fred Pearce, New Scientist 25 Feb., 2006.Economics Brazil remains the largest coffee exporting nation, but in recent years Vietnam has become a major producer of robusta beans.
It is prepared by powdering the beans with a mortar and pestle, then adding the powder to water and bringing it to a boil in a pot called a cezve or, in Greek, a briki.
In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds held in a coffee filter made of paper or perforated metal, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while absorbing its oils and essences.
The water then passes downwards through the grounds due to gravity, repeating the process until shut off by an internal timer.&lt;/ref&gt; or, more commonly, a thermostat which turns off the heater when the entire pot reaches a certain temperature.
Japanese convenience stores and groceries also have a wide availability of bottled coffee drinks, which are typically lightly sweetened and pre-blended with milk.
It is described as having a flavor about as good as low-grade robusta coffee and costs about 10 cents a cup to produce.
Studies conducted on Adventists have shown a small but statistically significant association between coffee consumption and mortality from ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, all cardiovascular diseases combined, and all causes of death.
