For a slave to become a freedman (someone with status libertatis), he would have to be delivered "out of the hand" of the pater familias, hence the terms manumissio and emancipatio.
If a child was unwanted, under the Roman Republic the pater familias had the power to order the child put to death by exposure.He had the power to sell his children into slavery; Roman law provided, however, that if a child has been sold as a slave three times, he is no longer subject to the patria potestas.
The pater familias had the power to approve or reject marriages of his sons and daughters; however, an edict of the Emperor Caesar Augustus provided that the pater familias could not withhold that permission lightly.One should notice that the pater's children, the filii familias, could be other than biological offspring, such as brothers, nephews or adoptive sons and daughters.
