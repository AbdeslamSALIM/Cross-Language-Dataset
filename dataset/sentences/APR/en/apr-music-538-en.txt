at the risk of putting back some fans of flower kings, i was not thrilled with this album.
i remember the time when i bought this cd my disappointment and frustration.
not that this album is bad is all of this opus that does not take off it's still unfortunate for musicians known as roine stolt and tomas bodin.
without being partisan, not for months listened to this album by the time test time, the conclusion is always the same: it means, very average!
one has the impression that the flower kings we align its influences without conviction just as needy students who recites his lesson to the teacher without understanding its meaning.
apart from "world of adventures" or "big puzzle", the listener is entitled to some planeri like "voyage of the acolyte" by steve hackett or chorus recalling "dark side of the moon "with a tone very bottom.
the intro to" atomic prince / kaleidoscope "recalls the worst days of barclay james harvest," go west judas "is off-topic and" my cosmic lover "is a porridge sound fm indigestible (the chorus what horror!) is a pale remake of a prog album of the 70s is a trip to the "kingdom of faded blooms" that is invited!
