well, i loved drunstan, but there dageus a small animal side, dark, which attracts like a magnet and surpasses, for me, brother.
i'd like to fly with him ...
it is titanic battle for the love of drunstan and save him, he committed the irreparable and his sacrifice destroys slowly.
his lifeline, the light in the night is named chloe (which i found adorable).
even more magical, more passion, we learn which are the tuatha de danaan and their sovereign aoibheal.
we find the family of the two brothers with great pleasure (especially the father, silvan, a kind of merlin the magician).
i do not regret having paid "expensive" this book because it is truly sublime and virtually untraceable.
the emotional crescendo and towards the end we find ourselves as desperate as chloe ...
and then, appears as a fae's name adam black, you know the rest?
