obviously, the bar is set so high that it is difficult today to surprise the viewer as we are.
basically, this movie could try as much by the side of the space thriller that promised to be scary and terrifying than the distribution (angela bassett, too rare - unfortunately - james spader, ...).
this dvd seems to me as a useless piece of meat when it is vegetarian!
