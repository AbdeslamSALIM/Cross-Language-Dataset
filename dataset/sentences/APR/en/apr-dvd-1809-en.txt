a good "old" action film, the true distribution with a bright (r burton, r harris, r moore, h krueger ...) for lead roles only.
the story of a band of mercenaries gathered and controlled by r burton loaded by a western government to overthrow a dictatorship in africa.
everything works well until or through the play-economic policies to remove the dictator once again become an ally.
very good film in the genre.
