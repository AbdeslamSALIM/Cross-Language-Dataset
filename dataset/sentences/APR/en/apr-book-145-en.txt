this book is a true reflection on good and evil.
imagine that this book is an apology of violence or a novel of anticipation would be somewhat superficial.
the real issue is our society, the place of man in it and free will.
the novel can be summarized in one question: "between good act by conditioning company, and deliberately choose evil, what should we do?".
scathing criticism of a totalitarian society and exercise for the author - his work on language nadsat is remarkable - this book is to put in any hands.
the meaning of the book should nevertheless be understood.
see also the excellent adaptation by stanley kubrick, with a great set of malcolm mcdowell in the lead role.
