i can not really understand the success of this film.
okay there was good media coverage, but ...
i waited a little success falls (because they spoke no more than that, there is already limited beard before seeing the film).
i watched when i thought to be as objective as possible, having want to finally see this "masterpiece of french.
obviously, i did not expect to find the humor of "bronzes font du ski" or "from headnut" but then there i was + that far.
i am forced to squarely look at the film entirely .
it could ultimately put in place such films as "the corsican investigation" (which is still much more fun) but we still rank in that kind ...
in any case not in such great films, masterpieces such as titanic "my god!
the advertising of this film has pushed up too high, up to dethrone great movies. ...
