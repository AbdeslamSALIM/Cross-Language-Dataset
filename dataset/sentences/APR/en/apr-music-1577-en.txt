amazing to see one of the best albums of the last 20 years is so unknown in france.
yet "nothing'shocking" is at least as strong as "nevermind", "appetite for destruction" or "blood sugar sex magik" ...
an anthology album, may be the best hard rock of the 80s.
with this opus jane's addiction propelled alternative rock (at a time when that term really meant something) in the course of the great, indeed helped by the pixies and sonic youth coming out then also their best efforts.
from the opening intrumental ( "up the beach") where a first wall of guitar comes down upon this hypnotic bass line you understand that the sequel will be huge and can not repress a smile ...
also contains one of the most ballads performed by american rock radio, the sexy and ultra entrainant "jane says", to laughter again.
if there is another group that could have been called nirvana is good that one ...
