i find with this dvd ...
it is neither better nor worse than the quantities of good french comedies.
actors who have fun and whose good humor is infectious (kad is truly amazing) ...
a good way to talk about a region sometimes a bit forgotten ...
but anyway, then explain how the millions of viewers?
who can, objectively, that this film is better than, for example: the big mop, bronzes, visitors, father christmas is a trash ... ?
how this could have remained an honest commercial success he could be seen by nearly a 2-french?
this must be what is called a social phenomenon, a ripple effect ...
it was known that, for example, in the past with "the big blue" or "titanic" but i still seem, in retrospect, another class ...
but hey, do not ponder too much on mysteries of success and let us evaluate the film 2 and a half stars, if you want.
but to make it a cult film ...
