very disappointing this new album.
fan the first time (the soup grimace, bb sides), i loved no arms no chocolate.
especially in music that is poor.
very little arrangement is clear that it is stripped as indicated by the word label.
after 2 plays, there's that last bit where i hang (the winds) and 1 or 2 others.
for me it's an album is "going to fast" the positive side, the text is very good.
to find bb, i suggest instead of buying the album "no arms, no chocolate." bb has accustomed us better ...
