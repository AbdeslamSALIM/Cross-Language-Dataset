a film that combines stupp√©fiant hatred, drugs, murder and prison.
it is the law of the jungle, the proudest and most insane.
a film that shows us how the street life is pitiless and how difficult it is to survive when we are in a ghetto.
to conclude, the prison shows us facets of the same street life.
a film to see
