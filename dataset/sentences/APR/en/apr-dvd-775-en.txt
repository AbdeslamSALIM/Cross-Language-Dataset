the genius of framing carpenter explodes in this film (plans start describing the prison and headquarters facing him, no dialogue until the arrival of snake plissken is incredible), his sense of mythology (the anarchist hero unforgettable admirably embodied kurt russell) and the linear narrative are obvious, the band music is unforgettable (signed by the master).
it was a shock when i saw it when it was released and it remains for me a stumbling block that has laid the groundwork for action movies that would explode in the 80s with other die hard and pr√©dator ..
moreover, the technical and artistic quality of the dvd produced by canal is rather in the very good average, which is unfortunately not very common with carpenter's films.
