me, i like the belmondo who jumped from car to car, b√©bel frimeur and joking, the guy who played the fool, the nice guy that would love to be a buddy, but belmondo seriously, it suits me less.
especially here, we avoid not ridicule (although unintentional, actually).
the banquet scene alone is worth to linger.
thus, belmondo is gone (sad), friends, family gather to get a good food and incidentally his honor, they are all there and very tired.
and, then a singer at the time whose name escapes me starts to sing (also a singer), there in the banquet as if it were a marriage.
the scene is funny but completely shifted.
but the goal was not to laugh.
