tracks written by unknown blend nicely with those of voulzy.
nolwenn's voice and interpretation are sublime.
the text is to listen and digest.
i am particularly touched by "my angel" whose text me upside down with every listen.
i lost my father to cancer last year and the words spoken by nolwenn are those that i could not express but i felt so painfully ...
in summary, do not miss out on this artist and this record.
