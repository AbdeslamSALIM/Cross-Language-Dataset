the return of the great and legendary judas priest with rob halford on vocals.
if it picks up where we left off, that is to say, "painkiller", "angel of retribution" is a step backwards.
very melodic, glancing about 80 years, it is very far from achieving such intensity, if we except "demonizer" only under really heavy and now, finally.
otherwise, not bad, fans of old albums will surely met.
for others, they will find this album a bit corny and outdated after a few plays.
a "choice" rather surprising if one remembers the previous comeback with tim owens and the furious "jugulator" or halford's solo albums.
