put the words "no plane crashed into the pentagon" is a cruel insult to the address families that have lost their children, spouses, parents in the plane that crashed into the pentagon.
maybe the author will like to explain to the husband of barbara olsen, who called her husband before the plane touches the ground, and he described the hijackers, he had to make mistakes and misunderstand his wife.
unfortunately this book has the substance of aricle a review of scandal and omissions abound.
out of context, it is always easy to manipulate information.
the title is ironic: that's exactly what this book is a terrible deception.
