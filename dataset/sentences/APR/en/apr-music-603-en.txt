led by the energetic single "mista president", acclaimed by gilles peterson himself, this album is a tasty mix of african rhythms and soulful grooves at its copper and compact.
the canadian group invites us to dance in alternating tracks afro-beat funky (the blind leadind the blind, freedom no go die) and jazzy (mojuba, mugambi), afro-cuban (little havana) and west african rhythm (shake soukouss).
the orchestra finished his plea with a smooth resumption of a classic pharaoh sanders.
a must for 2007.
