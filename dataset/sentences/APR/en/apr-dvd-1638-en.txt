van damme is back and he was visibly bills and taxes to pay ...
do not expect a film the likes of "the mark of death" or "in hell," jcvd pills and offers us never the "impact point" promised in the title.
the scenario takes the form of "die hard", but john mcclane is in desperate need.
jcvd finds herself trapped in a train, to confront terrorists and a deadly virus.
face such a scenario, one could imagine a film's level of "under siege", but it is not.
the budget is obviously very small, the action scenes are rare and minimized.
jcvd leg up once or twice, but without much conviction. "derailed" is to be placed next to "the order" and "ultimate threat" ...
