i always drive with maiden.
because the fellows have the means to lay something we excel at every time, and they fail to next to nothing most of the time ...
my main regret is that half of the film consists of previews (sometimes even entire songs) from the other ...
of course, originally it was intended to be seen alone, but coupled with the concert, it is repetition!
some kind of monster, or even the "story" with the previous dvd's are much more interesting.
if we add to that the self-congratulation members worthy of a making of with tom cruise, you feel a bit cheated ...
still some good moments do not worry, we would have just wanted more.
the concert is about his great, good sound (well the mix of kevin shirley is still questionable but hey ...) and the image is beautiful.
the setlist is probably the best ever by the group and will probably remain so until their retirement.
the overall package is highly recommended for any one who takes the document as a nice bonus, not as a film in itself.
