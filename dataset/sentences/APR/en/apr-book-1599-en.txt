pj mcauley gives us here a good alternate history taking place in italy in the renaissance period.
there we bump into leonardo da vinci, machiavelli and other figures of this era.
both romance and adventure book about the relationship of art and power, "the conspirators of florence" is a success story that captivates the reader by suggesting that the world could become if the inventions of leonardo had a practical application since the 16th century.
my only regret is sometimes impersonal style of the author.
