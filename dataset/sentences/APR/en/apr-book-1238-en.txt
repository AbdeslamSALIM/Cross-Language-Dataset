interesting but i think there are better books.
the last 30 pages are not very exciting and i felt like reading a cookbook that gave aim to address all areas of life like a list without giving back.
both at the beginning, there are interesting elements on meditation, so after it becomes cumbersome to read.
i was more like reading a memoir of average student rather than reading the work of someone spiritually advanced.
there are passages that make me more effective in filling the blank pages as a real contribution to readers.
astonished ultimately be the only comment (yet) negative on the merits, i force myself in any case not read it!
