i confirm the opinion of my classmates. "frequency" is pure iq ...
with two new musicians in the band (drummer and keyboard), the english progueux able to improve their music when it was thought that impossible.
young talent instrumental qu'insufflent both newcomers allow veterans mike holmes and peter nicholls reinventing their group who has never sounded so modern.
but beware, not modern in the sense that we metallic or techno sound.
music iq is beautiful and fresh, the perfect voice (nicholls has rarely sung as well), making his remarkable and beautiful compositions.
and to think that in 1989, iq was split ...
which way done since "ever" (album of the reunion) in 1993!
no albums are alike, yet the sound iq is unmistakable!
the proof of great talent.
buy this album as a bonus dvd (which found a complete concert of the group in 2007) is offered.
