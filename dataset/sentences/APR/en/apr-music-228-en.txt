muse fan since début.
showbiz is a true marvel, a swab of music.
origin of symmetry album is the consécration.
absolution, not bad, but we feel that it starts to decrepit.
i was really disgusted by this album really poor, without interest, blank (black holes) and muse disappoints me lot with this album as mcdonalds.
fast-musik which feels incredibly warm and without surprises.
i have the impression that matthew bellamy exhausts his monstrous talent in what he does not feature at all.
i hope to find a group powerful words that give me the sensation as of yesterday ......
