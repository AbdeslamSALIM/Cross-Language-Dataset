i will not dwell on the undeniable visual qualities of this series.
the idea to build each episode around a character or two is also very interesting.
but i find it ironic that this series is prohibited for persons under 18 years while the main characters are under 18 years.
finally paradoxical, yes and no.
adults are not equal, whether teachers or parents who do not seem to realize that hatched their children.
all told, several times, this series brought me uneasy.
i can not believe, or rather, i did not believe that all 17 year olds lead such lives.
i found the episode with effy particularly stressful and unhealthy.
