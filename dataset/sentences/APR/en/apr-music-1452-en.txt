here is the opening drive of the 80 of genesis.
a priori, the 80s have a bad reputation for music.
the singer (peter gabriel) and guitarist (steve hackett), left long ago, no longer remain in the old ship already progressive that banks and rutherford to support phil collins.
indeed, it took full control of the group and sign the key pieces.
intros pompous ( "dodo"), dated synths and winded around a track ( "man in the corner") that seems misplaced a collins solo album.
having no fear of ridicule, genesis turns funky time for a "no reply at all," embellished (?) by the brass of earth, wind &amp; fire, a group which as everyone knows, is to funk what la vache qui rit cheese is.
and to say that genesis was the worst yet to come ...
