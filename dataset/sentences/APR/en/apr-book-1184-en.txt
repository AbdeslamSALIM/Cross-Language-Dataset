oscar will soon die, he knows, but no one speaks.
the ladies dressed in pink looking after him, but his favorite is an old lady he called grandma rose.
he loves it because she takes care of him the better.
and she, she helps to conquer death by telling of his adventures wrestler she was in her youth by offering to write god.
he writes every day to god.
one day, she proposes to do as a game each day will be for him ten years of his life.
