i had high hopes and expectations when i heard the formation of this very promising new group called "chickenfoot" i am a fan of the first hour of van halen, mr satch solo ansi that red hot!
but hey, give a second chance to chickenfoot!
yet sammy hagar pushes chansonette as his early days with montrose and van halen, anthony provides the bass, joe gratifies us a few games guitaristic and chad hit with the brass fire.
it's bland, syrupy and without panache.
what a waste when you know the quality of the four protagonists!
