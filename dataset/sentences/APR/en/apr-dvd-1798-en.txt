a promising film that was idling but without much interest.
a story that does not make sense, it is also more a science fiction film based on a probable ancient legend, but a detective novel.
the way of filming is not great, the images are too dark parade before our eyes without really giving us time to understand what is happening.
fortunately, the d√©mouement really is, an unexpected and the film served by two great players ...
