yes, a little indulgence.
indeed, when one looks at a "stallone" we know the risk we take and there is a first precaution is to disconnect his brain.
like how we can learn things by watching a "stallone") ...
so why only a rating of 2 stars?
well because "stallone" is not the best, far away (harlin and stallone had done better with cliffhanger) ...
firstly because usually the invraissemblances of "stallone" is more comic (again including rambo 3, which contains a lot of comic passages) and partly because the film is poorly fitted.
indeed, the entire movie is assembled as a long (too long) video clip: plans short, music all the time and some scenes of dialogue between ...
and a clip is good when it takes 5 minutes but two hours is too much, really too ...
this assembly was he wanted from the start?
where did renny harlin once in the editing room that, during a fit of lucidity, he realized that the script was really too bad and it was better to make a video?
mystery (thin, how long this terrible question is does it haunt me? "i knew i should not watch this film !)...
