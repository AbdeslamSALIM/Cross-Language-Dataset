as stated earlier another user, there are only 14 episodes in season 4, after the writers strike and we were punting (very stupid we are!) the cabinet to 40 euros!
this season is much better than the second and third season in terms of revelations, especially from the problem of rhythm, it becomes interesting only from the seventh episode!
fortunately, the last three episodes are excellent and make us want to see season 5.
it is unfortunate that after a superb first season, lost will be bogged down in too many episodes of unnecessary and boring (the entire second season and a big part of the third).
