indeed, it is a scandal (in my opinion).
this is a film that can be said that this is a cult movie, with all moviegoers awaiting the dvd release, which finally released commercially, but marred by a failure unacceptable (from my point of view ) because (it seems) a lack of pressing, missing more than 5 minutes of the film on dvd!
and everyone seems to give a damn!
the disc should have been withdrawn from sale (because the defect is found) or has been, and reprinted again should have been expected, but no!
dvd is sold (rather expensive) in the state and no reprint is announced ...
