the film is already very good but the bonuses are really interesting and almost none is needed (unlike most dvd collectors who are filling unnecessary).
achievement is very good (the atmosphere is very well made) and the script is worked [an aircraft engine that came from nowhere falls on the room of a teenager who sees parturb√© then a monstrous rabbit he predicted the end of world]: some parts are really funny [the fundamentalist evangelists are derided) and doubt about the mental health of donnie continues to the end: is he psychotic or happens really something? (as such donnie darko is really a fantastic movie).
bonuses include 20 deleted scenes including (where you learn more about franck) and the commentary track by film director and actor.
a dvd which finally operates at its true capabilities of this medium ...
