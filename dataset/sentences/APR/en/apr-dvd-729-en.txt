yes this dvd actually contains the entirety of cartoons of the pink panther, but all episodes have been made in 16:9 format.
this transformation results in large cuts in top to bottom of the screen!
these cuts are very obvious, the feet of people are systematically cut off and the tops of trees, houses and buildings.
whenever there is a billboard with some work of writing it misses the beginning.
eventually it becomes painful to watch and it spends its time watching the obvious cuts.
