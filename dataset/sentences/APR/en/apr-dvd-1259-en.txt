take a work ma-gis-tral series which consists of 7 volumes, choose the first two, read it through, summarize it in order to make a movie of 2 hours, add a pinch of special effects and tadaaaa!
is the work: a massacre!
i am inclined to think that those who made this movie did not understand, or like they have simplified what was not simplifiable well ....
