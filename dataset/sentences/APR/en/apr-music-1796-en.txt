when this disc came out, herv√© picart, "best", had praised.
i had bought then, trusting the good taste of the critic.
just pop songs with a bland affigeante, with phil collins even more vapid than usual, it said.
so i listened to it again "invisible touch" and my opinion has not changed.
i'm told that the album came out after was even worse, i do not know i've never listened, but it seems to me difficult to do worse than this bland soup
