original content by the voice is magical, unique ambience, but what damage it has suffered such a strong influence of country music.
upon first hearing this artist for me was international or rather without a country, merely part of a realistic and joyful humanity again became a single american singer, not to say texas with talent but certainly making me almost regret having bought this album.
