it is clear that the late peter ustinov has been very successful in the role of hercule poirot in films and tv movies of the 80s, including the excellent 'death on the nile'.
but it was far from the character created by agatha christie.
i had the opportunity to read some interviews with the actor.
he talks about his role as if it were a character shaekspearien with involvement, depth.
throughout the filming, he was impregnated by the identity of poirot to the point of feeling like no actor before him.
it feels good seeing the tv series, worthy of big-budget films as the scenes are true to the period (20-30 years), reconstituted whole streets, trains, planes, wide shots that have been cost a fortune ...
they appear here throughout the episodes, all of which are small wonders that you will enjoy tasting at the 5 o'clock tea.
question dvd, nothing wrong, and his dignified image of a home theater quality.
proof of its value in the small amateur detective, made a jump on the various fan sites of poirot, this series is respected.
