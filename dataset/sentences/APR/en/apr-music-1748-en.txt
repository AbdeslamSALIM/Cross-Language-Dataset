the group seemed well, the four singles that i listened really liked me so i took the initiative to buy this album and after?
if you are looking for pop rock rather buy cds or jonas brothers all american rejects or even killerpilze (if you like a little punk) their album has them so well that we believe are best of but not all songs are good but they are not best of!
