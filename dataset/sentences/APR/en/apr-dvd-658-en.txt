a beginning that recalls the atmosphere of mafia in contemporary american context, but a small grain of sand appears to compromise the life of the gangster joey gazelle played by paul walker: its tiny neighbor oleg (played by the young canadian cameron bright) has found its cache of weapons and removed a major piece of evidence: now racing against time, we must save the soldier walker!
pace is sustained, the crusaders drove undecided, the sense of history bluffing.
the film touches on a point long forgotten in action movies is that gangsters should leave as little trace as possible if they want to last, and not be an immediate investigation, no matter sulphate without compelling reason.
yet here, the hero must save his skin and his family, and is far from clear ...
a very good little film that confirms that paul walker is a sure value &amp; wayne kramer has done a good job as director.
secondary roles seem very credible, as the russian mafia brothers played respectively by the australian john noble (also appeared in the series 24 hours as russian ambassador ripou) ivan yugorsky playing, and very lit czech karel roden.
other roles are embodied by the 3rd level pros, they only intensified the impression of danger, violence and tension as if the heart was beating more than a few minutes there .
