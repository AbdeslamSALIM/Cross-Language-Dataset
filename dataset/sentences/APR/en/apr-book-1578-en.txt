zoe, the daughter of king igor, was vacationing on a boat.
when she's bored farm, she meets leo, the little sailor.
everything could go to the worlds best sailors, if barberage terrible pirate had decided to take the boat to the collision and kidnap the little princess.
it will do that if the king gives him a box of gold coins.
this has been the wicked pirate giving a box of parts ...
a book a little too easy for children of 7 years.
the illustrations are not very original and the end of the story is very disappointing.
this book will most likely appeal to children ages 4 / 5 years.
