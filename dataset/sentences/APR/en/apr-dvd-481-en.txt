this film is very good.
a magnificent and beautiful story.
at first there's humor during the meeting of sarah (nicole kidman) and drover (hugh jackman).
then the emotion takes over telling the story of the little boy went mestizo if you can tell by the police of the region to be brought to an island with his family.
so the adventure of a returnee from cows with sarh, the drover, the child and another.
obviously the love comes from the beautiful and sexy sarah drover etc. ..
very good movie, well shot with wonderful actors
