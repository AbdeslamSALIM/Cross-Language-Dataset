plunged me into a sleepless night for this novel so fascinating ....
but what a disappointment by reading this second part!
the supernatural is also taking over and the characters are somewhat smoothed.
this result disappoints me ...
by reading this series i have not found this suspense, this story so incredible but we convaonc it is possible and real.
