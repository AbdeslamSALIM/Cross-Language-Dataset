this film is pure entertainment genius, and he does not pretend to be something else.
from action to the breathtaking, beautiful digital effects, a very fine distribution (note a hugh jackman sexier than ever), not to mention a great soundtrack signed by alan silvestri.
for those who criticize and think - wrongly - that van helsing, dracula, frankenstein and other werewolf would be a good salad of hollywood studios, i urge them to reread a few pieces of literature.
these characters have always been related to different periods of their histories.
in short, this movie and soundtrack are excellent and not to be missed!
