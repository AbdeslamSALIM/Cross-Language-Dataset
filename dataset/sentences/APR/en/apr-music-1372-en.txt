i love guys who say "this album i found no one at first, but finally, after 2000 plays, i like ...".
in comparison, one can only get to the obvious: this album is shit canned!
the rule: always rely on first impressions, and for my part, i listened to this album 3 times, and it was a nameless suffering, suffering that evaporated as if by magic when i heard 'orion' or 'sanatarium ...
