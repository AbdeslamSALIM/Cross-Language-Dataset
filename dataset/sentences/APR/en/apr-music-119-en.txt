this album very criticized for lack of innovation, and waters (some dare by a "therefore") of brilliance sin again because of public expectations by quality.
it's an album that takes a ridiculous shot if one expects to revolutionize the rock by a sauce deep hypnotic melodies.
but where is the need, since it is already at the time he left (1994), and meedle, dark side, wish, animals and the wall have already made cartons.
i suggest, therefore, to consider in terms of its project work on the sound quality of play musicians, pleasant pop ballads, with the pink in the songwriting, which makes them sweet like sails cashmere.
some prefer to take what is good in this album, buy pulse, which includes the full dark side (that's a great album, replayed by the group 20 years after the release of the original) and which are "high hopes, keep talking," "coming back to life" and "a great day for freedom".
