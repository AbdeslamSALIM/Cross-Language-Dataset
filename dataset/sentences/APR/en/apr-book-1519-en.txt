the story of a girl a little paum√©e; lost between cocaine, his friends in the same "trip" she and her father, who left at the other end of the world that does not give it new.
one could compare this book to "hell" by lolita pille, but lower quality.
the style is tiresome to read, everything is narrative, there is very little dialogue.
go away and read on ...
