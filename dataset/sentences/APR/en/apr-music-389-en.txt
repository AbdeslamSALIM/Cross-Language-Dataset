a renowned artist, a very public and critical success (or both), should my eyes to avoid two pitfalls: resting on its laurels and not repeated a minimum or too stick to the modes of time and lose its originality.
in this second trap that fell dupieux quentin, aka mr oizo.
revealed in the late 90s by the mega-hit "flat beat" (remember the commercials for a famous brand of jeans and mascot flat eric - yellow puppet show worthy of bébête -) and album, mr oizo us here is a technology similar to that of the devotees of the "french touch 2.0", rather then dancefloor oriented.
the pieces are short (around 2-3 minutes) and quite similar.
all that was the charm and uniqueness of dupieux this techno lo-fi experimental his filthy, rough, has disappeared.
that remains his world shifted shown by the cover and song titles.
tout fout l'camp decidedly ....
