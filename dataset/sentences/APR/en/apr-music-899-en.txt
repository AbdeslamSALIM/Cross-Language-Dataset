unconditional george benson, i was surprised by this new album ...
nothing to do with what i have listened to so far.
it would have made me listen to this album by failing to tell me it was him, i would not have guessed ...
i do not see where he wanted to come ...
for my part, very bad george benson.
to avoid so for those seeking the virtuosity of george benson.
