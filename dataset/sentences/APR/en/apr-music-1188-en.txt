clearly this is not the best album of queens.
me, i was expecting something huge, especially after hearing the single "sick, sick, sick" in preview.
the sound is really rough, you'd listen to old audio cassette on a poor hi-fi.
we feel that there is a desire to create a new sound.
on some songs, it goes a little in every sense and in the end it goes wrong.
however, there are some very nice tracks: the most excellent "run, pig, run" or "turnin on the screw" and "river in the road".
you can always unwind by listening again to the killings of previous albums.
