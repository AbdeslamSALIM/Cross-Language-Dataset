in this latest book which follows "in the bare life" and "a season of machetes," jean hatzfeld is still and always speak the survivors of the genocide led by hutu.
antelopes, these are tutsis who have run like animals through the forest to escape death and they are rare ...
the peculiarity is that the killers are mostly out of prison.
they return to live in villages where they themselves have perpetrated these horrendous killings by machete ... (since the hutus and tutsis lived together in the same regions) and as the author says, this new cohabitation is a situation may be completely unprecedented in modern history.
the survivors have the temptation of silence (like all victims of genocide) and hatzfeld succeeded in giving evidence ...
without exaggeration, one can compare the work of hatzfeld that of primo levi to the difference (huge) that he has not lived the events he describes and the events which took place on another continent and another time.
