the first listening to this cd i was delighted, i found the flavor of the words of jacques lanzmann, and the beautiful orchestration of jacques dutronc.
ctte harmony between the text is music is a blessing, the message of rebellion is present, but without being cynical, the life of everyone there described.
i advise all those who are fond of dutronc to be run at acquiring the nearest record store or buy it on the website amazon.
fr, and those who are reluctant to both jacques discovered a cd full of hope and charm.
