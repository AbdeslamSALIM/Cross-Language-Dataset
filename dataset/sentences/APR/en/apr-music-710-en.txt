excuse me for this pun just missed it but is really a reflection of the album.
here i turn to "novices" who are tempted to think that other tracks are funky, and well no!
the two friends gaspard aug√© and xavier de rosnay, which according to some rumors are simply daft punk (they may want to become famous?) are not musically sounds so unfounded and too few melodies are similar.
