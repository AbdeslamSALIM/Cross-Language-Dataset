even fans of kevin costner had to be disappointed by this movie.
the cast is good (there is also paul newman, robin wright), but is there anything positive to say.
those who expect a beautiful film full of emotions will be disgusted.
and those who think it's a sentimental film is wrong: it is a romantic drama.
