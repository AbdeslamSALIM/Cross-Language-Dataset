i disagree with previous comments on this book.
kauffman make wonderful return to life, but do not explain this novel allangui, tired and tiresome, worn from the first 20 pages.
yes, she has helped to awaken the senses asleep by this terrible confinement.
no, it does not give him the right to inflict upon us, in 290 pages, moods and dull dull, laborious descriptions and sentences without appeal.
the chance of being a writer is clearly not given to everyone.
