after months of waiting finally here the new album from kelly clarkson is a pure perle.
plus personal, more rock, more mature this album is a real source of energy, good time of life with text sign of thanks kelly what we do share his moment of life through poignant text as sober, this song is sublime and compelling, his voice retains a powerful emotion enorme, irvine is a sad song but gently on her voice pleasures, and hole judas are very rock is super energetic, yeah is very naughty but super energique.
je keeps head sober remains my preferred, text is sublime'll throw a glance after months of waiting i am pleasantly surprised by this album, more mature, more rock, more energetic, more exciting (thanks to the pen kelly) i say a big bravo to miss that promises a bright future and once again this album is a success
