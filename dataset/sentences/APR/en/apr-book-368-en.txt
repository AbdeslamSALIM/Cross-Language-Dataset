my comment applies to the entire series: an intelligent script, very good, which thrives on the 5 volumes (previously 5 stars), but ....
served by a drawing static / rigid (-1 star) and reactions to stereotypical characters and personality of children age 10 (-2 stars).
this last point is even more evident in the series betelgeuse.
nevertheless, ke advises the purchase of this great classic comic strip, which is pleasant to read and reread (if one can forget the above points)
