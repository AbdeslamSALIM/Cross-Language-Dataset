of course we will talk to me about sgt's peppers, rubber soul, white album or abbey road (second in my ranking).
robert", "eleanor rigby", "for no one", "good day sunshine," "she said she said" and of course the fabulous "yellow submarine", remain in memories.
at that time (the same year as "aftermath" stones), the beatles were not only revolutionary in terms of music and art but very innovative for the cover of their album.
personally with "abbey road" is my beatles favorite.
remember "twist and shout" and return to good old chuck roll over bethoveen. (worse than the groovies).
