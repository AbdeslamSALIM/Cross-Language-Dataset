pushing the limits of good taste even further after listening keen v, i tried to listen to rapper booba hexagonal emigrated to states.
peu relationship between the two gives the first in the dance and beauferie and the second that we interese there in hip hop and gangsta rap, if it is a torture for the ears in both cases.
deja the cover is a monument of ridicule and gives a good idea of the content is booba full bottle in the imaging-based display of cash, rolex, big cars, girls submitted, misogyny, dope, weapons, settling of scores, lyrics anti cop, anti state and all the paraphernalia.
i often wonder who can buy the "records" of the true pathological liar bling bling, kids palms lack of benchmarks?
in any case i'm on to something even if i am no expert on these music: there must be intelligent and interesting stuff in rap and hip hop, but boobs and dirty company image.
rating: 0.9 / 20 (booba notes like him even his albums, pratiqe ca:)) (0.9 since the passage of the nickname pure cocaine is 90% ..)
