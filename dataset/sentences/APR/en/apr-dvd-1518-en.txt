at last reissued at a price attractive one of the best american films devoted to the korean war.
filmed a few years after the war ended, so from a distance much needed in this kind of subject, "coast 465" ( "men at war" in english, note that for once the french title is more powerful than the original too generic) tells us the bloody retreat of a small group of gis after the terrible attack against china which almost give the victory to north korea in 1951.
the director anthony mann directs a few "faces" of american cinema of the time (robert ryan, aldo ray, vic morrow ...) and despite the many action scenes, this connoisseur of the human spirit gives us also psychological anguish (fear, uncertainty, paranoia, heroism too ...) which agitate the soldiers lost in enemy territory.
in nb and only vf (pity that the original version is conspicuous by its absence), "coast 465" has lost none of its evocative power, which disappeared after hollywood films in the decades following us happily back in force with "the red line, "" saving private ryan, "" platoon "and others.
