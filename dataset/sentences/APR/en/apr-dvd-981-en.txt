audiard provides weld blier and gabin.
they size two roles tailored as would a london tailor for his britannic majesty.
the dialogue is only as was in fausto coppi isoard bobet on the galibier, merckx in the aubisque.
only front and others behind, far behind.
it provides the two leading roles in all the supporting roles (martine carol, frank villard and the phenomenal fran√ßoise rosay) in the role of the cave (mauritius biraud bibi said the ladies ).
shame, such a talent of such a cap.
