the beatles have invented album, against the songs.
because they totally mastered the art of the single, they could move in 1965 to the next step and bring the variety "pop" in the circle of music "serious" ...
or almost, because, of course, all this was slightly unconscious and rowdy!
yet the world was going to seize "rubber soul" and its formal coherence, and to see evidence (reassuring?) should not be afraid of these young people with long hair.
