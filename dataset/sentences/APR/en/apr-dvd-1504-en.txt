the first hour of the film is unnecessary.
peter jackson takes his time to the scene and introduces the characters, but we do not care a bit, that's the gorilla that looks at the film.
but the intro is excellent, and staged remarkable.
then when the gorilla arrives, no more boring a second.
the special effects are very effective, the action is quoiqu'invraisemblable fairly steady.
by cons, so you see the gorilla they got tired.
the scene of the building, when we see king kong in terms aircraft, and very well done for seeing the gorilla far, it is impressive.
but otherwise, the camera is always pointed at him close up, he loses his poise, he becomes a character banal and ordinary , though very hairy.
a film to see for a good time, but not to buy.
