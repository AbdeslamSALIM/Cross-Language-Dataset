the book is a compilation of comments on the couple's relationship to his clothes.
he wants fun and illustrated on a subject objectively atypical.
the fact remains that the sociological thesis of the author (even recognized by his peers) is not exciting.
the reading is tedious and a sense of circling rapidly invades the reader.
obviously, it is difficult to compare playing a sociological argument with a literary work but my humble decision to drive this book is extremely severe .
one of my worst reading.
