this magnificent film is worth seeing for the stunning interpretation of the 2 main actors.

this film is a marvel that deserves to be seen and appreciated for what it is: a masterpiece of french cinema.
with and] this movie is one of my favorite with michèle morgan.
as for gerard philippe, eternal, the role of an alcoholic doctor flayed alive, generous and self-destructive it is to steal.
both moving and authentic, it is here one of his greatest roles.
