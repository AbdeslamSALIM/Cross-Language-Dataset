i am one of those for whom pink floyd died departure of roger waters.
here, creativity and energy that emanated floyd is a distant memory.
here we seem to hear the studio version with the public at the beginning and end of the runway.
note for note.
it'sa bit like going to the factory.
there's even a song (money) where the drummer is not sync!
a counselor if you are looking for a compilation album.
