commando is the greatest masterpiece of a genre film whose headliners in the '80s were schwarzenegger, stallone and lundgreen.
this is the kind of films with big muscles, big guns and big explosions, which all share the same scenario: a man alone against hundreds of guys who want their skin, and is the guy alone, ex-beret green ex-navy seal former ranger, who kills everyone.
we must take the 90th degree, be ready to laugh very very bad replicas and ridiculous situations, kitsch entirely worthy of hot shots, and not too much formalize the complete lack of realism.
and it lasts just half past one, not enough to begin to tire.
it's very good then, but is reserved for expert users - attention to first-degree viewing!
