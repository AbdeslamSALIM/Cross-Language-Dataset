i forgot to buy the album of scorpions in the mid 80s, when the compositions are on the ultra-traditional and have forgotten the fabulous group of the 70s, the compositions huge, with a vocal tone of voice so special.
i do not share the enthusiasm of rock fans for the live show that too often the technical limitations of musicians, but here none of that.
while the rhythm (the weak point of scorpions) is very basic, but really c'st to find something to say, because the rest is truly staggering.
it's my favorite live for 20 years, if you do scorpions that through their production years 90/2000, rush you on this cd, you will take a big slap!
