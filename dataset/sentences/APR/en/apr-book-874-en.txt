i'm not one to criticize a book without having finished but there are these books ...
funnier still: he dares say that christ was recognized as the heir of the pharaohs.
how can we imagine for a moment that the egyptian priests were deported without the king of babylon might know (yes, yes, the king of babylon conquered egypt and deported the people but imagine that the priests were hidden and nobody knew who they were!)?
imagine how they would write the torah, the holy book as an enemy of egypt with the koran that vilifies the pharaoh of egypt and equates to the land of darkness?
simple logic would, on the contrary, they would have celebrated their lost homeland.
besides all scholars agree that the deportation to babylon was an opportunity for the jewish people lay down in their legends torah in order not to lose the memory of these adventures if deported them away forever of jerusalem.
in short: read two chapters and two good reasons to flee this book!
