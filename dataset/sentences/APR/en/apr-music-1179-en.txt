the first utopia was very (too) progressive for my taste: the songs were stretched to their maximum, making the process a bit artificial.
their second album, a live, was soon forgotten as soon as heard, a real failure.
and then came ra, with a new line-up, more welded, only 4 musicians, all very good singers, allowing them to vary the voice for the delight of the listener.
this disc is a perfect synthesis of old utopia, resolutely progressive group, and the future utopia, pop group rather hard limit fm.
neither one nor the other has my favor, but ra is a transition album and the mix of genres gives a new and fascinating results.
even long, the compsitions are no dead time from beginning to end.
the tempos are varied, with compositions inspired and full of humor (rare).
and the centerpiece, the glass singring &amp; guitar (19 minutes) leaves you speechless: a simple idea and a priori unattractive (a simplistic story that will serve as a pretext for a solo each instrument to represent the water - battery-, fire-guitar-, air-bass-, synth-earth) utopia gives us a demonstration of expertise and musicality.
