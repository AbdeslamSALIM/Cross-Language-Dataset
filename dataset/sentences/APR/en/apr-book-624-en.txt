having read glowing reviews, i expected to pass a "bad" moment full of suspense and cold sweats.
though courageous, i read in its entirety the first part, but from the onset of angeline, the spell was broken, sewn with white thread later.
i finished the diagonal and it was much too still.
a counselor if you are too happy or you want to pester!
