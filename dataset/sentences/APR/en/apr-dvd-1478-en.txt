more than a work of science fiction, this film is an uncompromising critic of the human race and the harm it is capable of being.
the evil it is capable, too, to round it.
in short, a poor image that confirms the news every day.
the work, well written and had a distant relationship with the book which it is drawn (by a french author), is distinguished by a realization dry quality interpretation and beautiful makeup.
note that a remake of this film was made in the 90s, lower quality and ultimately the impact different (but surprising).
