i was glad to read this volume after having eaten the other 6.
unfortunately, this is not one, characters are not found virtually no, they are cited to appear quickly and some for others.
mouse it is now too far, their feelings spread throughout the book with passages below the belt that does not offend but in the literary sense contribute nothing.
never mind i am on chronic in 6 volumes, it never made me not go.
