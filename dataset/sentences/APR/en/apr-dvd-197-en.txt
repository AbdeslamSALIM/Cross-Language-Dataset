j'aime pas trop ce genre movies, partly because of inconsistencies, partly because i do not understand the value of a supernatural love story.
the film also has its mythical erotic scene with the blow of pottery, as if by magic, the hands of lovers are all clean at the time spent in bed.
there are a lot of little things like this that prevent me from would not believe for a second the film, a film marshmallow that ignores all binding limits its starting premise, which offers no metaphor.
