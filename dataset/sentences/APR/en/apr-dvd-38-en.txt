here's a super turnip, an american teen movie appalling, humor and heartbreaking hints doubtful.
in the main role, zac efron, the fop the crap out of the century (high school musical), and new son-ideal goose that lays the golden egg producers, the perfect products to appeal to the working girls of 13 years and their mothers.
the film whose theme could give rise to amusing situations is rather heavy as can be, never funny, the worst thing for a comedy, and in addition it carries a sickening ideology, old-fashioned and puritanical (eg advocating abstinence before marriage, saying that homosexuals are disturbed etc.).
what good reason to flee as fast this turnip.
