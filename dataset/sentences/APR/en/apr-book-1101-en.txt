this book is quite disappointing!
where we expected a sort of "brief history of time" added the latest discoveries in theoretical physics with more patterns to better understand.
the book as a whole really lacks consistency, the text is quite difficult for the uninitiated and poor for others.
and the patterns are indeed very pretty but not very sensible!
