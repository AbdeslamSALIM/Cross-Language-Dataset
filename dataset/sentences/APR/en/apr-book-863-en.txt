i admit that normally i hate the police are linked to the policy of a country.
but the author manages to convey the political message so smooth and transparent with ease.
you learn to know china through the character of chen restrictive policies for the single child, the presence of poems, the different challenges facing the triad (mafia) who govern the country a little ...
we see the clash between two great powers: china and the united states.
this is an excellent thriller that combines the cocktail good plot, action, good characters, which makes it very very well.
in short, i really recommend this book.
