byrne and eno have made both separately and together, so essential a contribution to rock that could only salivate at the thought of a new collaboration between the heads and not talking, but researchers.
the surprise is great when you realize that "everything that happens will happen today" is a disc that recycles gently past discoveries of the two thieves, who are - they say they naively - just met to build on this disc: one finds this idea already widely used - and better than here - talking heads in a pagan gospel, based on a rise, a drop that would be less spiritual than sensual.
an idea on songs declined consistently mid-tempo, which to be attractive, are not as exciting as they should.
in short, here is a smart album (it's the least we could wait!), pleasant, even charming, but not all of a fact worthy of such a combination of talents.
