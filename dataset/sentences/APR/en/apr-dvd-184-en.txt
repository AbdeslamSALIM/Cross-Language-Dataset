finally an action movie western receiving efficiency asian!
and yes, this film is a melting pot of action movies, kung fu, sword, vampire, the survival horror ...
in short this film is condensed what is best in entertainment "violent".
but the scenery, the colors, the setting is magnificent scene, the film is visual.
the fights, choreographed by donnie yen (once upon a time 2) are magnificent, the gunfights boosted the sfx are really powerful, and its a real fury.
not a single dead time, the film captivated me from beginning to end.
it was even entitled to 3 / 4 of the film, an alien new generation.
short but good!
as sound and image, if perfection exists, it is!
