the first time i saw this film was the cinema.
i found it boring, and ridiculous situations.
but that was long ago (when i was a young teen).
a year ago, this film came with several others in a special promotion.
so i bought and reviewed.
this time i found the solution for parents to overcome their son to be amusing.
i could watch a hundred times that i do not tire.
plus it goes, the more i appreciate it.
so i think it's a film to see from a certain age.
when we can finally apreciate situations caucasus and the cynicism that follows.
of course, we laugh at the misfortune of others, namely tanguy.
