the writing of the barn is simple and beautiful.
and most characters have backgrounds steeped in violence.
but the barn does not allow its players to acclimatise to the carnage and brutality.
the descriptions of the murders are quite graphic and not a book for the faint-of-heart.
some scenes of haunting, nightmarish other.
in general, i am very printed by "the empire of the wolves" and began to seek some other titles of the author.
