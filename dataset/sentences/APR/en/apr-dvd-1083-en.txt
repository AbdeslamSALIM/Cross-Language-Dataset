harvey keitel at the top of peaks (next to de niro in "taxi driver" and christopher walken in "deer hunter") abel ferrara completely (...) really nervous and yet touching in the most beautiful scene of forgiveness ever seen screen (the level of "crossing guard" of sean penn with j.
nicholson) a film almost unbearable in its cruelty, but is interspersed with images / icons divine.
in short, a film that is hard to find his place in the pantheons prepared by libe, telerama and figaro and yet another that deserves to be included in any dvd library of cinephile.
is it for harvey keitel, virtually omnipresent throughout the film.
