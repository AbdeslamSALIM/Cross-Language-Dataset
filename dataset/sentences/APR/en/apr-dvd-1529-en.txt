nicloux no, it does not have a "universe shifted" to establish a "sticky atmosphere," show and thierry lhermitte marion cotillard (who reveals the two sides of his perfect anatomy, show that its new status of "oscar-winning" would deprive us now:)) naked as worms, the same grill lhermitte cigarette (thank you for anti-tobacco!), wandering like a lost soul or a gallery of characters - really - camped side by actors not operated at fair value (diefenthal in drag, in darroussin voyeur orgies box ...), brief while this does not make a good film if it is missing something essential : a well structured story.
it remains outside the film is slow, rough, and without artificial guideline.
