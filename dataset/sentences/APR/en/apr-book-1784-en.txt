the title inevitably challenges us ....
of exceptional intelligence to stupidity ...
an original idea very well described in the research of destruction of neurons, the funny and touching story of a man who suffers understand everything and who wants to succeed without intelligence, a book that goes into delirium delirium which it adheres without difficulty.
we savored this book fun until the madness beyond stupidity to the point that no longer understands ment forced the character ....
j i personally loved this book and i will have the preferred deleting some pages ....
however i can not wait to attack the second novel by the author ...
