this book is very comprehensive and well written.
however it is not for beginners in the computer field.
it is still a basic knowledge of it project steering and the agile methods.
the project stages are well developed and offers very good methods to implement in your business.
not really sorry for this work well done but that does not suit someone who wants to start the project steering computer.
