and not that this business strategy today is better: the sound of this cd is bad (only slightly better than the sound of devastation "where did our love go?" / "i hear a symphony" appeared in the same collection).
but everyone knows that the compilation of hits is the only right way to address the directory of the supremes, and therefore the thin audience attracted by the sole interest of the cd (making available old 33 t missing from catalog) will inevitably be disappointed by the proposed quality sound.
too bad, because for all their work diana ross and his accomplices deserve better than this botched cd.
