i believe that there are no words to talk about this film!
my first big shock cin√©matogrphique.
i believe that is the film that made me the film buff that i am now.
the image, grain, everything is there to help you return to the malaise.
it's a film to own at all costs as the work is beautiful!
the dvd includes a deleted scene (supposedly the credits at the beginning), some interesting docs.
but these bonuses are nothing compared with the film itself.
