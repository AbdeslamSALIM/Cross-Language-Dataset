frankly this second opus does not deserve a visit even if you loved the first.
the story is ridiculous, almost no winks at number 1, the soundtrack is virtually identical to that of the first and bonuses are nonexistent.
also missing a number of scenes found in zone 1.
at the risk of staying on your hunger, go your way soon.
cruel intentions 2 is a sequel which, like most of the action is light years away from its predecessor!
