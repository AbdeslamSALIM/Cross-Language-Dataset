when the album appeared in 1997 it was praised by critics.
but despite historical album sales disappoint fans.
critics turn their pens and criticize the album: nothing new, songs too long, less good titles, et cetera.
even if this opus is not in the first two is a huge cake.
a sound monumental, melodic style unique to oasis, titles unforgettable (stand by me, do not go away, all around the world).
a cd a notch below but excellent, whatever the pessimists.
