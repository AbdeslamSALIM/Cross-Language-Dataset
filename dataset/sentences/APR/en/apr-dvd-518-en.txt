on a platitude yours!
it may well be the daughter of gabin (director) and meet some talented actresses (frot, seigner, smet), when it wallows so on an ultra-frame and agreed to review is the absolute flop!
gregori derangère not transmit any emotion, he is content to be handsome, and others struggle in vain as they can, to no avail: yawn of boredom without difficulty guessing what will happen in the scene after.
flat, agreed, it does remain that beautiful landscapes and still confusing berléand natural.
