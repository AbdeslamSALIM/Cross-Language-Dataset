magic, there is no other word to describe this beautiful disney movie.
directed with care, this film brings together everything that appeals to young and older who have kept a core of children: beautiful landscapes, talking animals, countless creatures of all kinds, scenes of valor and battle (nothing to do with the lord of the rings!
the resemblance is but let's be honest, by far ...
however, i understand that some did not like because the film can be so very very childish in some dialogue and some scenes ...
but hey, to oblivion film critics demanding.
relax yourself, watch "the chronicles of narnia" and dream ...
