not his best known, nor its more fun!
planet waves is an album spleenien, desperate, poignant, absolutely avoid when heartache.
the songs are very beautiful and not neutral at all.
i think it coincides with his separation from sara (that of desire).
this album contains one of the most bitter song (dirge) and the love song the most ultimate ever written (wedding song).
in addition to the band's vote accompanying bob throughout the album and it's an understatement to say that alchemy is perfect and the quality far superior to that of "basement tapes" (i adore).
