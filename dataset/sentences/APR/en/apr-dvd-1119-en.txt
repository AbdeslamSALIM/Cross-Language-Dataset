oh it is bad government, oh yes we must pay attention to dictatorships, oh la la yes, it's really like deep message, especially one never ever seen this film.
really it was worth it to make a film like this.
well that is unfortunate is that there is little in this film, no suspense, no real story, just what kind of mask that is the philosophy of the counter.
and kill the noble end does not make a good film.
