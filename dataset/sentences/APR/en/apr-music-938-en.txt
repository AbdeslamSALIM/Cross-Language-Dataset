homogeneous compilation of several concerts spanning from 1984 to 1989, this disc is indispensable to me for brurier black, otherwise the album that features the best: absolutely botched version of "emepreur of tomato ketchup" is actually part of "worst songs" chosen by group members (as it says on the cover).
it is a "joyful mess" which does not seek necessarily to be perfect or necessarily "pretty." this music is hard, edgy, urgent, the words black, terrifying, but his sincerity and creativity sometimes sublime.
the brurier may be filthy, do not know maybe not sing, are a few coconuts, but they still wrote "sos" is one of the most beautiful songs i've heard.
as a bit of "casanova" from fellini movies.
because it also includes, in c√©outant this album, what decadence, what fiesta sense of the word could trigger the unique music and the militant group.
is it today, please, is there a group spokesperson of youth, who fights constantly with texts worthy and engaged while having a rich musical and theatrical like it?
is also the clowns, the circus, fire-eaters, etc..
are we not here at the circus, in a dream world, like that seen in the films of fellini, precisely? "carnival of agitated" makes us the perfect portrait.
