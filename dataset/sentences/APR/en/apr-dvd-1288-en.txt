they are like men in the final analysis, with the difference that it seems that the désaeuvrement grow these fantasies for women, as a way to build a business while it is rather hyperactivity which appears to produce flowering of fantasy in humans, as a work in entertainment or distraction of work.
at least that's the vision that gives us bunuel these fantasies where women meet men désaeuvrées and hyperactive.
by cons that we classify these women is a major bourgeois aberration.
belle de jour is the wife of a physician-hospital surgeon.
just a woman from the upper middle class who has the privilege of doing nothing.
that said, this woman will fall in love with a course of small strokes that will meet on the road, or in his living room sex.
hence the terrible tragedy that shows if any were needed that it is always the innocent who pay the bill for mistakes of man or woman.
the victim is always collateral.
and the woman will be justified in his fantasies, as her husband will become a vegetable.
this film is cruel towards women in general and women of the upper middle class in particular.
and cruelty is never a good guide for the viewer.
that is why today these women for more work, have professions to be human beings like everyone else, that is productive. [...]
