offered by a friend who seriously asked me my opinion, i failed to strangle me to laugh at breakfast reading that many periodic announced as the equivalent of the da vinci code (badly written as d ' elsewhere but keeps his readers ...) everything is!

nonexistent plot, dialogue written in elementary school and historical accuracy from wikipedia, the worse is that many media have praised the void which the author certainly takes advantage of the celebrity family to successfully publish an academic exercise has depth of a puddle!
