this is a summit of french song, a sort of hexagonal sinatra.
more songs i listen, the more i love them!
what a contrast with the horrors which we sanitized broken ears today!
aznavour, it is the talent, generosity, tenderness, sadness, pleasure to share the thousand petty emotions which, placed end to end, called life.
all his songs, if they are different, one lives in the same vibration, the same intensity, the same simplicity as well.
with words all animals, they often say great things, things that we do not always lend the moment the attention they deserve, but who return later surreptitiously, you trot in the head, which then you realize, in retrospect, the great poetry.
thank you, charles, for these moments of happiness!
