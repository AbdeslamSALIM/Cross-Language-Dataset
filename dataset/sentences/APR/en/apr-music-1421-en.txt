max cavalera (caloric for friends) confirmed with this second album of pseudo metal that is definitely ejected from metal.
the biggest mistake of his life leave sepultura, one of the best groups of trash with slayer and pantera.
bref, if you want a metal album quickly go your way and you turn instead to dying fetus, cryptopsy and cannibal corpse.
