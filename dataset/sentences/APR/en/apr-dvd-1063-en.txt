i was very disappointed by this movie.
fortunately bill muray is true to himself and saves a little movie playing his role very well.
actually both the concept and ideas as the atmosphere, this film had potential to be a jouissif and hilarious.
unfortunately, it is very soft and somewhat incisive humor ...
so, a little bored by it much, looking ...
