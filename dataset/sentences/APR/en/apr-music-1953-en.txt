big fan of queen, i also sought to discover the solitary work of its members.
the album of freddie mercury solo, though aging, still really good.
those of roger taylor are those who have most surprised by their quality and their divergence from the sound / style queen.
by cons, those of brian may remain mysterious to me.
it is a superb guitarist and a great composer (he composed the most beautiful pearls of the first queen album), but his two solo albums, especially this one, i was really disappointed by their overproduction, lack of inspiration on some securities or the redundancy of certain songs.
of course, there here and there of good tracks (with jeff beck guv'nor or cyborg) but i'm really stayed on my end ...
