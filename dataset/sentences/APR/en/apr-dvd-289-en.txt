the series includes 4 years after the end of season 4.
i think it's a good thing, it is unclear who is still with that, that's who.
this allows for some flashbacks to explain what we missed.
there are a lot of disruption but it is especially lucas, who has had the most change.
a shot of the castle for the little boy james haley and nathan is cute enough to eat and lia discovery of peyton is rafraichissente, brief i spent a great time watching this season.
in addition they leave for a super season 6!
