i had the opportunity to read this book while traveling in the desert ...
and i found all the answers to philosophical and spiritual questions that i asked myself.
how to follow its own path, and recognize it.
the stories in this collection are all wonderful, commentary and personal development that accompanies them very useful for any "seeker of truth" ...
