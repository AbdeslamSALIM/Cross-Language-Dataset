as the youngest, james, keeps animals at the camp, the three seniors, wyatt (henry fonda), ex-marshal of dodge city, morgan (ward bond) and virgil (tim holt), will make a trip to the nearby town tombstone, full of sound and fury.
wyatt then accepted the position of sheriff offered him in tombstone and his two brothers will be his assistant ...
this film is an adaptation of a true story, based on the biography of wyatt earp written by stuart lake.
in addition, these events and characters (earp, doc hollyday ...) of the mythical american west were the subject of numerous films including regulations at the ok corral by john sturges.
this opus is one of the darkest films of director of irish origin.
this work is a condensed twilight action which culminates often harsh violence but the plot is still littered with lyrical scenes.
thus, like the man who shot liberty valence, this film describes the passage of the wild west to civilization behind the birth of modernity.
note that the choice of henry fonda to interpret the character of wyatt earp is particularly appropriate as he exchanged clothes with the accuracy of the emblematic figures of american civilization (young mr.
lincoln or the grapes of wrath) under the benevolent tutelage of john ford.
personally, this ode to the human civilization remains one of the greatest westerns ever made.
