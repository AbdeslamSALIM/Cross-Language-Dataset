book for a teacher of literature very informative, but a beginning in literature this book is hard to read, it hangs too throughout the book.
it is difficult to read.
it tells a lot about the war, and even in those other places just referring to the war.
text fairly criticized for his anti-semitism and misogyny.
it happens during the period 14-18.
but to understand the whole metaphor of the book and its ambivalence should read it a dozen times.
not a very good book for a mere amateur.
