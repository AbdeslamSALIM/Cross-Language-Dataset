this friendly grisham novel makes us follow in parallel, first, the race for the inheritance of 6 children spoiled rotten with money from their multibillion-father, and, secondly, the search for funds of 'amazon of the 7th heiress surprised by a lawyer in late career.
we rub our hands in the opening lines, the early chapters are fascinating, then the story enters full swing (on the paraguay river!) and we take great pleasure in reading.
the mixture of adventure stories and legal thriller is very well proportioned.
and i just go well for the pantanal if i was not afraid of alligators and anacondas!
