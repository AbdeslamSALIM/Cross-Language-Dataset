a scenario of thread sewn enormous and heartbreaking poverty.
the dialogues are the same level of poverty and an incredible naivete.
i am still a fan of gene hackmann, but i find this ridiculous in his role of admiral moved by the loss of one man (see, let's be serious, it does not make an omelette without breaking eggs!).
again holywood is a war movie where only the americans are good soldiers, messy but ultimately endearing.
only positive point, the background of the war in former yugoslavia once muslims are not the villains, and apart from a demonization of the serbs (almost inevitable, it must be a terrible evil ready to kill american soldiers good ), this gives new depths not previously addressed in holywood.
do not look in the event of deadly boredom, or fault of brain!
