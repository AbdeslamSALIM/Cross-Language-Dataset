a new album by placebo is still one of the pop rock events of the year as the group has successfully established itself successfully over time on the scene.
armed with a new drummer, molko sign with battle for the sun a milestone in the career of his group.
as usual the first song sounds good and we found our old placebo in saying then that we will have an album of the same mold as the previous.
but that will not happen because the group has strayed miles away from what he could do before.
from the second track starts with a chorus sung in castilian, which oscillates between paradoxically both entertaining and irritating .
a title battle for the sun does not help with its five long minutes during which molko keeps repeating every word a half-dozen times over a light rhythm declined many times.
from the new single for what it's worth, listening itself is already painful blame an unpleasant feeling to hear a production of our national pertussis superbus.
the rest of the album continues then bury it a little more through a barrage of silly simplistic passages that are anything but inspired.
the desire to renew through new sounds is also a monstrous flop.
placebo tries even 8 bits is to say where they are made!
anyway, there's nothing left of the authors of without you i'm nothing if not that inimitable voice that unfortunately fails to save here would do any furniture.
more fishing, more than the ballads that take guts, only a profound sense of waste appears.
needless to rant more to explain one thing: brian molko has completely misled with this new album.
battle for the sun is a real divergence in beauty should be forgotten as quickly as possible ...
