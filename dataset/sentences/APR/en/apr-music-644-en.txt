the years are cruel, even more when the artist out of breath, still trying to persist for more ...
then of course, as the saying goes, better to be "has been" and have been, that never was, but we must admit that the twilight of a singer like johnny was something pathetic.
magazines people in the business section, the artist is no longer the little one for his talent ...
and forced to see that this album is not likely to reverse the trend.
so of course we received on the tv trays, and even libe dare not push grandpa in the nettles, but the album is as hollow as the critical are lenient.
we desperately seeking a breath of inspiration on this disc dull and passionless.
one sees that the old singer spent in his studio, brooding melody of a geriatric "old" distance.
