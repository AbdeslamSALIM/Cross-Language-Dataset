a drum solo emblematic.
coverage of lp and cd typical west-coast rock of the late '60s (1967, summer of love and light shows).
outset, the first listening, i knew it was the stew, the zero of overrated.
the drummer is miserable (see what baker and moon were able to do).
the guitarist and the organist are worthy of inclusion in an orchestra tour dario moreno and johnny hallyday's psychedelic years (arf, arf, arf.).
