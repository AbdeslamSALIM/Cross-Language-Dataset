copied pasted the first opus of "infernal affairs" with a cast that feels the petro-dollar, in short a shame!
i recommend you go back to the source and you turn on the trilogy "infernal affairs" which to my taste is much better if we do not defend the creativity, imagination scenarios as addictive as we remain there .........
