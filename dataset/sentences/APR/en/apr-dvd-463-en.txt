sorry, but i have not worked.
i know this is not good at speaking ill of scorsese, but there not.
first, we must cling to understand something in the first part of the film, as the pace is fast and elusive and convoluted narrative.
once each at his post, but the story begins very quickly, as character dicaprio, one wonders what expects the police to tighten nicholson.
no challenge, no suspence.
apart from a few scenes where either risk of being infiltrated grill, there is the "mob scenes" traditionally sadistic and violent in scorsese.
dialogues very fat, very rude not revolve around the sodomy .
what bothers me is the seductive and elegant appearance of this dropping in words and in deeds that fill probably a good number of spectators (male, mostly).
i want more responsible writer that scorsese himself, who did a creditable job.
and dicaprio is amazing in this register flayed trying to buy a pipe.
the film would nevertheless deserved to be shorter, clearer.
i had more emotion and pleasure ...
