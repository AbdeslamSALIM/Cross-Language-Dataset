karajan directs mozart has more than 600 times in his career, addressing itself to don giovanni's 70 years.
this is proof that he believed wolfy at the highest point.
but the requiem is a work inseparable from that of bach that mozart was known to 1782.
how then listen this version pompous and puffed up with pride (karajan star in the photo on his pocket is ridiculous already!) without changing the cd and immediately fall back on koopman, hogwood and others (harnoncourt?).
bohm has given the slow version of the most sublime catalog "romanticized," but that seems karajan empate!
