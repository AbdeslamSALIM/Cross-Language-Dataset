we find everything that makes the charm of the stones live, good music, an extraordinary scene, the lights crazy ....
now turn on the quality of blu-ray: bof, bof, bof ...
quality is very average for an edition on this platform: the blacks are not black but gray short if you buy it for video quality, keep your dvd.
shame on this group of us lay a blu-ray is as bad ....
side sound nothing to say, the tracks are dynamic.
