hex is a journey over a city plunged into the night or a snow-covered countryside.
the piano sober the loom takes you by the hand emotion born.
the strings, bass, drums and then build an architecture to be temple, mosque or cathedral, never crush him who contemplates it.
the voice appears, then goes away, leaving the field clear to percussion on the bottom of the wave synthetic soul.
hex is a journey that surprises you at every step.
silence is the permanent guest of the music that takes its time.
absent friend, big shot, fingerspit, eyes &amp; smiles, each piece has its own system, solar / lunar populated with stars and satellites moving.
up pendulum man, scintillating epilogue, as an infinite reverb, an ice palace opens onto a vast landscape and blank.
hex is a companion taciturn but brilliant sense - multiple, harmonious, frustrated - and meanings - where melancholy and comfort merge.
