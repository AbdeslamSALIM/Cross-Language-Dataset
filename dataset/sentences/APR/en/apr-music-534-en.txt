is the group that it is normal to hate: it's progressive, classic rock typical seventies, mixing influences médiévalo jazzo classico, mixtures of rock sauce elizabethan serial, voice polyphonic synth grandiloquent.
it reminds emerson lake and palmer more verbose, yes the time wakeman has just under fire, jethro tull after the period blues.
all a jumble that punks have cleared.
if he had to keep just this period of wandering rock, keep gentle giant with yes album not far off.
