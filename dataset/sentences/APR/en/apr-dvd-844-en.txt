a film as it makes very little is still taped to his seat from beginning to end.
a story that carries you throughout the movie and leaves you on cloud nine at the denouement.
morgan freeman and tim robbins are truly blameless actors, the film is captivating and full of hope.
the only little snag that i found it on the summary on the cover: "the innocent ..."
