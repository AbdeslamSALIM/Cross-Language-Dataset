i remember a time when bernie sang: "i am a newsletter that intoxicates and we slip into a ballot box" (la grande illusion) ...
times change and indeed the spite is gone ...
as for "the excuse of age"; existed before motörhead motörhead trust and is still if not more brutal than ever, with their last album ...
so, excuse me, but "the excuse of age ",...
so, an album / compilation well for those who do not know their first titles, (although it already existed) ...
