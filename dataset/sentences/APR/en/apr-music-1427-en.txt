the second album gun club, a group of legendary psychobilly scene in los angeles in company x, the cramps and some others i have bought time for his wallet, as striking and as haunting and original music contained inside.
a music mixing rock, punk, blues and folk, mad, violent, bare, and jeffrey lee pierce, lived, haggard, singing (not always fair but we do not care), whispers and screams as an animal at bay in the desert of death ...
many more savage than the first album, "fire of love" released the year before.
contrary to the latter that i discovered in the era of the compact disc, i used to listen to especially the first side of "miami", particularly impressive, a perfect sequence of wild and insane tracks (in the middle with a cover of creedence clearwater revival, which integrates seamlessly with all ).
animal, as this album dazzling and wild.
