admittedly, this is a book giving an overview, often piecemeal, the current standards and some samples of parts and mechanical components exist.
but we must keep in mind that this is not a catalog: amalgam totally wrong in that wallow frequently pupils / students / teachers (delete as appropriate).
the gdi is only present excerpts from catalogs of some manufacturers in some areas of engineering.
similarly, approaches to design are often incomplete and sometimes downright ridiculous.
i realize being a little maverick in issuing such a notice in this book, acclaimed by many generations, but i assume, as a teacher of mechanical myself.
most of my colleagues consider this book invaluable because they were told the same thing when they were themselves on the benches of the school.
if you have a choice, invest more in the "memotech - design and drawing" a work more expensive but much more seriously ...
