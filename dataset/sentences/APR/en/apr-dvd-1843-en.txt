this film, along with police story 1, a jewel in the career of uncle jackie.
the action scenes, although more than 20 years surpass easily the bourrinages holliwoodiens of today ' hui (do not get me wrong, i like them too ...
this is ought largely to the very quality organic scenes (no special effects, stunt ultra-experienced, and for the most part, willing to put their lives on the line to complete a scene, including jackie, ...).
so much for the next action.
the drama in revenche fishing a bit compared to a masterpiece as heat.
but here is the quality of this film: uncle jackie does not seek in any way to lay a masterpiece of dramatic, just a nervous desire movie with action scenes that kept the bill to michael bay and worked for enough people that one believes.
and there in revenche is able to 100%.
obviously, the film has a dramatic vein (the character that jackie can not help but knock the mustard when it rises to the nose and it has fallen on his family and himself), but this is not what you will remember most after seeing the film.
but as this contributes to the vein side nervous film is not completely useless (it also gives an opportunity for jackie to show the talents of actors who, if not those of deniro or depp are much higher those of the average action star.
in short, tidy transformers and other nonsense bay-sized and throw you on the first two police story (chinese with subtitles, please!).
pay no attention to the 'another comment: the editions that seven7 hk and we have laid eggs are perfect in every way (except the bonus: there are none).
as for changes in music and he did other place on the french version (with avoided anyway if you want to enjoy the comic aspect of the film).
