the film gives us a new perspective on the theory of jack the ripper.
the new angle here is the narration of the film.
we see everything from the streets, especially the district of whitechapel.
the beginning of the film depends on the perspective of prostitutes, it was only after some time that the detective abberline arrives.
this makes the film very evocative.
the atmosphere is so tense and mysterious throughout the film, with only a low luminosity (eg when abberline see mary kelly during the day), most of the film being cast in shadows and dark red tones.
the theory itself is interesting (even if the ripper appears to be one of the usual suspects), although it is hard to uncover the beginning (though ...).
what i also liked about the film (and i do not know how this is taken from the graphic novel, not having read) is that it also contains a story of impossible love before the context murder, which gives a whole story in which depp plays his role to perfection with a depth and emotional power that would otherwise be absent.
a film squarely bonus .........
see very slight in this edition: comments and deleted scenes.
