complicated as c: that's what i take from this film.
to further deceive the viewer, the screenwriter of the film wrote a story completely twisted which everyone betrays everyone ...
certainly, the complexity of history is characteristic of this type of film, mounted on a anarque great.
nevertheless a good movie scam is a film that confuses the viewer's mind while remaining consistent.
unfortunately, this is the first issue of cash: the scenario is not consistent.
take the test: after the movie finished, try to rewrite history with all the elements.
you will not get there everything is not explained, and many questions remain unresolved.
this means that the script was shoddy.
s as superficial: this movie is totally bling-bling.
and so much better in these times of economic crisis!
i think i saw once actors boirent anything but champagne.
unfortunately for him, this is not the recipe for a good film.
neither homer nor horrible, this movie is between the two: it is average.
the two stars are deserved, but that's all he deserves.
