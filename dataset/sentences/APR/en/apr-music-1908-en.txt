it is often said that the greatest interpreter of chopin was samson francois.
he probably wanted to distance itself from its brethren of the time "d√©sentimentalisant" music so expressive ...
the only thing i "enjoyed" is the first movement of the first concerto or i find inspiration but the orchestra is quite ugly and also some mazurkas while under the booklet supplied with the kit it says that it is the mazurkas which are the weak point of this package .. (sic) so i think that chopin is a revered man of his time, and now seems outdated while some of his colleagues were able to keep them vital and otherwise "magic" i think a horowitz, rubinstein and kempff in his rare forays into chopin (see decca).
a box only for fans of samson francois
