debut album from massive attack.
the group from bristol, from the collective wild bunch, posed with "blue lines" the basis for a novel to be called later trip-hop.
a record well ahead of its time, which subsequently influence the production label mo'wax, portishead, morcheeba and many more.
a set which also owes much to its vocalists, horace andy and shara nelson head, which already contained a worldwide hit, the incredible "unfinished sympathy".
it also noted the participation in this first trial of a young unknown: tricky.
massive attack drive the point home in 1998 with a third album to accents and much darker rock. "blue lines", meanwhile, has not taken a ride, and one gets the impression that he will never grow old.
