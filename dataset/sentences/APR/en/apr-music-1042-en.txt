the album begins with an extraordinary way 'coming up' in his 'buggles' we listen so still intact (but fully discoverable on the mercies of macca).
the rest is useless, frankly, with the exception of waterfalls, beautiful (found on the compi wingspan).
no, except that i think the album was surely a recreation after the end of the wings in 80, maybe a little 'traumatic' for paulo.
