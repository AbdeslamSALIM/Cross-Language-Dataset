i am very very far from packaged ....
with all due respect i have for manu chao, i found this last album quite "ordinary" and "flat" compared to the rest of his discography ...
it is for me more of a refresher than a real creation.
in short, what started to be annoying on "proxima estacion" over here by horripilate ...
for other bits "new" or the words are almost nonexistent, the song is hard as hell 2 minutes, or it is a bad old rock songs of the 80s ....
