i had the chance to see this movie along with dominique abel presenting his work.
it is a lovely man who has paid even a pot to people so that we can share with him the impression!
i must say that i found this great film!
it is a little gem of burlesque and emotion!
in short, i have been waiting a long time out of this dvd!
i hope you will share my excitement !!!!!
