shade and sun is a novel representative of the way of life of many europeans, borders no longer exist between both states (the family of erik winter, police commissioner, lives in sweden and spain) between people of the same city, same neighborhood.
told primarily from a police point of view, the gothenburg newspaper quickly becomes sad, wet and cold, the light has almost disappeared, and the hope of a better life too.
beyond the existential doubts of all, the novel takes the reader through fear of the unknown who lives next to each of us, crossing social networks, and the almost universal indifference in the face of horror.
