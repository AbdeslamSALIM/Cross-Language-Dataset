the previous album (hi) was not already great but there was at least one or two songs that floated.
i do not know exactly what you could expect from the collaboration sardou / fugain but the result is necessarily hopeless.
i do not know if the talent is still there, but obviously the motivation, she is gone (an impression reinforced by the speedy tour following the album).
we forget this album (it's pretty easy) and we will listen to old songs.
