fan of the first hour, i always loved the music of joe even in these attempts the most strange, "electro" in particular.
you will therefore understand as it is difficult to put only 2 stars to this disc.
the reason is simple, i'm not a fan of this type of experimental blues overloaded by the battery yet experienced manu katche, but if poorly matched to the music of joe.
snare invasive splash tower arm, the drummer get drunk by reducing the space of our guitarist (i'm drummer yet).
some pieces are all nice time, "cool 9", "luminous flesh giant," the intimate "sittin'round" or smooth and sumptuous "my world" played by a ballet jeff campitelli.
