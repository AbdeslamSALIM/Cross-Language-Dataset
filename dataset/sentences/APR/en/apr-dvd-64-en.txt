yes, there is nothing to do but when you have spent part of his adolescence to drool at the beautiful patrick swaize who turns his head to a good girl, you can not help wishing this movie in its dvd library ...
and then there's the pleasure of finding a great soundtrack filled with songs, rhythmic and rousing.
small sequence nostalgia ...
