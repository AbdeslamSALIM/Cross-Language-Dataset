film war poetry or poetry of war?
the actors are all absolutely excellent, directed with tact and restraint.
this is not a movie war games, such as apocalypse now, we travel in a world heavy and deadly, hopeless.
achilles, the brave, the faithful patroclus, hector the virtuous?
it's terrifying, it's wonderful duality of romance and death, the film is extraordinary, it gives a new dimension, a different face to this terrible war, this time black.
