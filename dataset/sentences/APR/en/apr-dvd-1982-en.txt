agreed scenario, but this is not the problem.
true story, but this is not the problem.
i do not even know the name of foreman who filmed it.
just blame him for having used robert carlyle, whose only talent is cleared.
in the same collection, preferring "commandos", a film that does not cheat.
but it is true that at that time (70s), series b was not contaminated by the cliches of tv series, and we knew how to exploit the charisma of actors like lee van cleef.
for all fans of genre film to avoid.
and if you like robert carlyle, return to ken loach, a true filmmaker.
if you like war movies, see fuller go back.
