this book is a juxtaposition of images of little brown bear who does not know what to do on his pot, he sings, he'll get his train, he read, he asks his mother a cake ...
finally he called his mother but as she does not go get it with the pot without spilling.
in style i advise tchoupi, much more successful from my point of view.
on the other hand the scope of the cake i really embarrassed myself because at the same time as the 'potty insist much on hygiene.
i find it incredible image of the mother who gives food to her baby on the potty, it is beyond me.
