what a shame to end as badly as interesting series.
a lot of repetition in these 2 books that represent the volume 5.
both first volumes are fascinating as these last 2 are appalling, badly written, the story does not move, we re-explain at least 3 times the same thing back on things past that we know by heart, short of the 2 last volumes were a huge disappointment.
i think the author should not be in a great mental shape to write these books if i do not hesitate ...
still not read the first 4 volumes that are magnificent.
