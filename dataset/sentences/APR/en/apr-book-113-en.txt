having read an excellent summary of this book, i was happy when i was finally able to get one, to finally open it and see what the review had found interesting.
it was double, taking first in the organization of the book and then its argument itself.
first, the shape is certainly beautiful, and many passages breathe the plume, the ideal ...
by location, we carried away by the quill of d.
however, it is the reader to discern what is the common thread.
but when i understood, for the very first pages, i had the impression of having been robbed by a sophist.
it is based not on reason but on the reader's feelings.
the fine words, fine examples unfortunately can not replace common sense.
the examples are not everything, especially if one is rather reluctant to be trapped by appearances.
what about the glaring omissions of parts of the story, however, have marked the european company (including all those moments when she is out to conquer the world)?
how to convince us to base our lives on the war, the panache and passion?
venner seems to advocate?
in his view, in fact, the christianism has been a source of perversion.
book a scholar but certainly quite useless for cultivation.
in short, for readers ... - if you're pagan, you think that europe is a united whole, a fortress to defend against invasions, and its ancient culture has been perverted by christianity and other forms of modernity, if you think you yourself are an unsung hero in a society that limits you, this book you may be interested. - if you are a christian instead, you consider that life is worth being lived for other things that make war and by his victories, to develop his ego if you think wisdom is widely present in the virtue (not violence), if you think overall you have a future if you have a minimum of intellectual honesty, for all these reasons, you may be disappointed.
