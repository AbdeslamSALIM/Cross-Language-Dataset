one of my worst musical!
what to say: on the form i have done, once again, by the rave reviews of applicants to the ent service.
in "hell freezes over" the sound was as perfect as mastering sdr was lousy (medium severe and extreme withdrawal, medium, high and sharp protruding extreme acute non-existent ...) it was enough to settle for stereo analog obtain a balanced listening, credible and coherent sound image stage.
no subwoofer or low medium, high medium-high invasiveness in short, a musical cartoon destroying every image and sound room effect.
recordings in dts copy exist yet diana krall - live in paris, sanseverino - live theater sebastopol, zazie - ze live, etc..
substance: so how come that all these strangers to the group? " saxophones, electric guitars, accordion - you name it and best - what interest?
why not indulge in often excellent dolby digital 5.1, absent from most dvds in dts disgusting?
instead of fiddling with the original stereo analog tape into a mixture grotesque and painful!
