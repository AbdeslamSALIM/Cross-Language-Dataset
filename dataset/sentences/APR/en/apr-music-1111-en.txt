dark album, it contains jewels such as the first track "anywhere out of the world" which sets the stage musical.
and what about the "summoning of the muse" and ambiance of a cathedral?
if you do not know dead can dance, but know a bit era, this album should interest you greatly.
and to think that this album has almost 22 years since it was released in ... 1987!
