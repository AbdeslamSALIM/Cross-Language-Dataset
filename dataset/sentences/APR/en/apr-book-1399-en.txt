you do not give up this book for a moment.
web mortem is a thriller like "campus-internet-dive in history 'and very successful in its kind.
the author very skillfully blending subjects not trivial as video games on the web, historical linguistics, genetics, while from the horror (ritual murder) to love (between the university and the young journalist) at humor (the assistant of the very ugly university), etc., at a rate of hell.
i finished the book at two o'clock in the morning and i jumped like crazy when the heater water has restarted!
