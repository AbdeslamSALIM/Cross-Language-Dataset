attention is an excellent disc (even if the first hearing may disconcert) which shows all the culture and musical talent of prince.
very experimental, but no less enjoyment (the first tracks are enough to convince fans of good music), this disc is to listen at least once in one go.
it y'a include a touch of spirituality and mysticism furthermore, when one joins or not.
but in both cases the disc is very valuable and amazing as the unit together is exciting.
the ideal complement to live cabinet "one nite alone," another witness splendours of one of the most prolific periods of prince.
