having been the first season, i have obviously been a little disappointed with is the second component.
not that the series itself, vincent d'onofrio in the role of inspector goren, allows really stand out.
i just think the package has undergone a scheme a bit too drastic in during its release in france: - the luxurious digipack packaging season 1 was replaced by slimcase - the english subtitles were missing them ausi ( vo film with english subtitles, there is nothing better to progress in english) - the bonus zone 1 have disappeared across the atlantic (surely a matter of budget).
it does not detract from series, but it is a shame to see all these cuts in our dvd.
