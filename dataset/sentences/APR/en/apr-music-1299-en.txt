the "requiem" by maurice duruflé (1902-1986) owes as much to that of faure for his resolute approach comforting even sweeter this missa pro defunctis (ending also in shades of ethereal "in paradisum"), as debussy and ravel for the rich harmonic language and opulent orchestration.
saved twelve years after the creation of the work in 1947, this version directed by the composer himself always needed as a clear reference recording.
the "pie jesu" sung by hélène bouvier is a great moment of emotion, the declamation of the "kyrie" is a torrent of enthusiasm, "hosanna" and "sanctus" are oceans of passion, whose neo gregorian-is delightfully decorated by philippe caillard chorale.
rejuvenated by the cd, the superb sound recording has not lost its heat.
polyphony a cappella of "four motets" and monody ascetic and the exhilarating "messe cum jubilo "(the creep of the majestic" sanctus! ") are provided here by the chorale stephane caillat, who created these works in 1961 and 1966.
a guarantee of authenticity marks this album, in many ways ideal for exploring the sacred music of this great french composer and organist.
