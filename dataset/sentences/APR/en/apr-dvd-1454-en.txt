de funès and bourvil the top of their form, it could only give a very, very good comedy where the jokes are connected to a hellish pace.
from the famous 2cv rugged laugh accomplice in the car in conclusion, the film sees himself always with great pleasure.
only drawback, the caricature that we give the italians unfortunately usual in french films.
we must emphasize the perfectionism of the 2 main actors, well known at de funès, to report also bourvil who has held himself to the scene where he falls from a ladder in his car scene that could be dangerous.
bourvil is indeed died of cancer probably resulted from a blow received in turn a scene from the movie "cracks".
and as hyperactivity de funès has certainly not helped the condition of his heart, can truly say that these 2 giants of laughter gave their lives for the cinema.
de funès, bourvil, great players like you have never seen again.
