the 6th chapter of the hellraiser saga is very disappointing.
despite an attempt mood darker and less fantastic than the previous episodes, hellseeker is well below the level of the first two films in the series.
the story is confused, and rather than disturb the viewer, it will eventually cause trouble.
the special effects and sound do not innovate in horror (and rumors fly trepanation already used in other legacy ...).
the protagonists do not have much depth and, unless already be familiar with the hellraiser universe, a neophyte viewer would have trouble understanding the emergence of cenobites.
pinhead has lost much of his charisma and his energy, and guardian of the keys to hell, he was relegated to a mere figurehead.
