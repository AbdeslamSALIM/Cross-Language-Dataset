given the expectations that we are entitled to have regard to a group like coldplay, who has proved his genius with parchutes and a rush of blood to the head (brilliantly passing the test of dangerous second album) it is clear that viva la vida feels marketing, full nose and left me in a complete misunderstanding.
the identity of the group to sound completely disappeared and boils down to "chris martin and his orchestra.
arrangements to be sentimental, a mix tailored to the broadcasting and supermarch√©diffusion.
violet hill and yes can not even save the honor.
i hope not because their talent could bring us much more than that.
it is time they got rid of all the sharks that they must turn around and whose greed looting the mystery which existed before.
rarely in music history a group has also experienced rapid popularity.
you must have broad shoulders to stay lucid in these conditions.
in 1973 for example, pink floyd gets help from alan parsons and together they make dark side of the moon, which is a true masterpiece.
i want to coldplay to make good meetings in the near future to meet with producers and arrangers who really understand their music and do not try to make them wear their costumes that do not fit.
