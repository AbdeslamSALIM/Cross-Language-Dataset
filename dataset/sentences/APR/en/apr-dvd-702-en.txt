i loved the last punisher.
yes it was less violent than the comic but i found it more realistic ...
finally as far as possible.
the punisher war zone is as if the previous did not exist (they reshoot the killing of the family of frank and reinvented the reasons for their death).
the actor not attract sympathy as the previous one because it seems mono-expressive.
