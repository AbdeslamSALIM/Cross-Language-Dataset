in 1997, dar williams seems unbridled creative vein.
mostly acoustic folk of his previous two discs, it evolves into a more "pop", like what she hears on the radio ( "what do you hear in these sounds").
this inspiration not shrinking from any form, at the risk of alienating an audience on the edge of devotion, not unlike the turn electric dylan in the 60s.
still, the music is always inspired, and this album is probably the one who gives the best stream, without increasing acidity - but delicious - a personal tone as "mortal city".
attaching and often brilliant, "end of the summer" closes with a cover of "better things" by the kinks, and it's happiness.
