one of the most famous works of sade sade where pure philosophy mingles with the most enthusiastic of debauchery.
for sure a great book for the strength of the prose and argument (although it is often lame) de sade, but somewhat annoying in the long run because of frequent orgies (and scenic!) who come to weaken the power of philosophical discourse of the marquis.
an immortal work, however, that you smile as the size of its quality of writing that its flights libidinaires as legendary as humorous, with a final pure delight the likes of sade by his wickedness fierce and exalted.
