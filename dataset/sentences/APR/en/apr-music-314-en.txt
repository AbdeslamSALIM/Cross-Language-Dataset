and unfortunately in my opinion (which, ultimately, may have very important ...) mike is like most of the artists (of all backgrounds and art ...) it "warms up" and puts the "taste day "which has already been done! ...
but this is not a cornerstone in his work and unfortunately unlike "tsode" and "tubular bells i, ii, iii or 2003 in 5.1" it does not make me shudder ....
