this film is exceptional in many ways, and at the same time proves quite confusing, making it even more interesting.
the splendor even supports images in the film of static shots that might in another case seem too long.
to this is added as the period music delivered with first.
some scenes without or with very little dialogue held with the music perfectly suited.
the subtle dialogues are served by extremely convincing actors.
i am, for example each time struck by the strong presence of marisa berenson, while light and expression, despite his lack of text.
but the most interesting film is the ambiguity that exists about the tone of the film.
some scenes from start smelling comedy and burlesque are used as a springboard for a dramatic story and a vision very cinique.
the opposition among some voluntary reviews of the voiceover and the images shown simultaneously adds to the feeling that not the movie but the company is described in a register false.
in fact, this film is not kind to the european society of the eighteenth century.
the apparent slowness of the script (the life of a man) can put even more emphasis on sudden events that change completely the fate of the hero.
i always feel a certain detachment from the director toward the life of this irish gentleman, as if the director would have been a mere witness of this life.
