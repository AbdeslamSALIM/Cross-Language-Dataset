korn, c group of neo par excellence, they have invented a style and they do not hide (follow the leader "follow the leader") and yeah, c thanks to them that there has been deftones, coal chamber, limp bizkit and many other groups.
this album is exellent, impossible to choose between him and the "life is peachy" (bought eyes closed).
c excellent musical level.
