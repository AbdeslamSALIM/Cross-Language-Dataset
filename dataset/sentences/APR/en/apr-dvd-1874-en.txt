the beginning of the film is mysterious and exciting: we have two young people who are pursued by a strange truck whose driver - who has little to humans (they would later appercevront) - "play" with the bodies of his victims ...
a little horror movie with no pretensions to become throughout the film much more interesting than it looks: the scenario is not necessarily predictable, the special effects are of good quality and climate strange and horrific.
note: the film contains a scene or g√©nialissime especially the main characters find themselves while they are pursued by the monster in front of the house of an old lady, raising dozens of cats (amazing shadows ...) .
