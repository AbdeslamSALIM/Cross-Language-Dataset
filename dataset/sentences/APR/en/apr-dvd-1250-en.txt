it is now several years that i watch these films through their first dvd editions (the 1999).
no more rotting macroblocking each plan and video noise in dark areas.
the picture is excellent, so clear that it was hard to believe that the film has more than 20 years.
we feel that the colors were a bit handled and they are a little more saturated, but it is hardly noticeable.
the sound is very clear, both in stereo 5.1.
the only small regret: the glaring lack of bonus.
but hey, if you have a large screen at home: go for it.
it's worth it just for the picture.
