originally from atlanta, tinsley ellis has developed his flamboyant style and eventually earn a place in the pantheon of great masters of the six-string electric.
very eclectic compositions are all of our musician.
the guitar does that wisely and enriched an effective rhythm.
from the ride mid-tempo "mystery to me" the most rock-blues guitar leaning against the gurgling "all rumors are true," tinley ellis proves he can play anything with ease and feeling.
a very good album.
