that is, except that this album is absolutely magnifique.
echoes is indescribable beauty: 23 minutes of ecstasy, share your mind completely elsewhere, you are transported to distant horizons.
my favorite part is the 15th to 19th min: an organ that repeats agreements implaccables then gradually reaches the cymbals to lead to the apocalypse.
in short, it's pink floyd
