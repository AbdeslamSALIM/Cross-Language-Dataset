jean pierre darroussin is perfect in the role of aldo, always smiling and always just one might almost have tears in their eyes!
we say that this guy is great so why deceive his wife does her husband with the boss (richard berry) of it?
this guy is horrible, no scruples and he turns over the aldo mates one by one!
but aldo wins a large sum in lotto and reverse of the medal is not far ...
here is a movie very funny and touching which there is almost nothing wrong.
but a word of the collector's edition.
why are there 2 dvds in this package for so little bonus?
while they are interesting but still a bit much on its end, it's a shame (note nevertheless the presence of some rom).
