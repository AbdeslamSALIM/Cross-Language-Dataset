i really regret having bought this rag!
a journalist can scrupulous and nauseous.
michael he pleaded guilty before his trial on hearsay as many journalists.
except that it continues in this direction despite the acquittal on all counts.
this reporter does not mourn his false trial starting.
there are even stories for michael guilty of acts even more vile and continue down to the dirt.
i understand that the family of doj filed a complaint against the journalist, and i hope too, that mj will be recognized as innocent of that which oppresses the poor pen.
if you want to know the truth, the whole truth about the trial of mj, i encourage you to read the book by journalist aphrodite jones too, who thought that mj was guilty, but is back on its decision and regret been influenced by the bad press his country.
that makes this book even more true.
