"ambient" was released in 1993, and we noticed a moby young and hairy on the wafer, which is quite hilarious!
except here, the music is calm, relaxing and planing.
the first track "my beautiful blue sky" is one of my favorites.
the rest is the future: all instrumental tracks, often short (1 min 30).
however, this album will not remain in the annals of music.
in short an album interesting, fairly equal throughout the titles, which i think deserves 3.5 stars.
