through the destinies of two couples living in kabul, the author demonstrates brilliantly the horrible inhumanity of the taliban regime.
there is something of the literature of the absurd in this book as living in kabul under the taliban, is first to die for love - the two couples are torn apart by dint of trying to return despite the circumstances -- before dying altogether.
the novel opens with the stoning of a prostitute, ends with the lynching of a man madly in love, and we inflict in the final few pages, the execution of a wife dying with admirable self-denial and the strange disappearance of a woman resigned to no longer live after he accidentally killed her husband.
one also wonders what to make of his disappearance: zunaira survive it, like the poor fool who has decided to leave kabul?
it seems in any case be the moral of the novel, supported by a style that move from poetry to mundane most brutal in the space of one sentence: to survive in kabul under the taliban, is to leave kabul. ..
