this book of astonishing and eclectic jodo is the best book on the tarot in my opinion.
it is equally suited to beginners, as false beginners (including myself) and insiders.
far meanings to memorize for each mystery, jodo dissects the symbolic drawing on the resources of mankind, drawing on everything that is sacred in the world.
his view is not confined to christian influence but turns turns to zen buddhism, judaism, islam.
his vision of the decimal numerology is very different from the fanciful theories of some juggling and add numbers to their liking.
clearly, "the way of the tarot" is the fruit of a life with the tarot, and what a life!
