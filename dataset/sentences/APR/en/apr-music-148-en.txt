the first album recorded by jeanne sherali live in nantes is very difficult to listen as his voice is pitched up and enforced.
by cons, in twelve times per year has been chastened voice, the melodies are superb compositions and superb quality .
so what a disappointment to listen to his latest album which is a distressing flatness, where enchaine pieces without realizing it: always the same haunting melody, only the lyrics change.
