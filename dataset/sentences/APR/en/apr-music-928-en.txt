the album missed charlie mingus where he reveals his sensitivity, his venerated teacher what were lester young, duke ellington, jelly roll morton, charlie parker, his commitment to the gospel, boogie woogie, new orleans, be bop, and where his bass at his powerful and so special is accompanied by excellent soloists (horace parlan, john handy, booker ervin ...) to fully service its mad music.
many of the themes on this disc have become classics of mingus.
