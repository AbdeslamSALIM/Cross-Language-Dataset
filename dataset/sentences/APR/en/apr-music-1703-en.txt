i love what these two young antibes, since i discovered their debut album.
in the second, it contains only electronic instrumentals, "noisy", sometimes charged, but still very melodic, often melancholic, sometimes very moving.
magnificent flights as with "in church" or "on a white lake, near a green mountain".
it's beautiful, it's flat, and i'll see what the bo hard to become a movie as their music suggests images ...
