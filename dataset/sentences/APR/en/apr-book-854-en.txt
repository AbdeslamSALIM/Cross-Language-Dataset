each character is encountered physical violence and verbal abuse on two young children (twins).
no character can tear us a sense of compassion, but only another sense: the disgust, because everyone is black with a bad back.
the children, they become monsters as history, they are empty of feeling.
they suffered and are suffering to animals and to end human violence.
i found these two children ....
scary scene from "cleft lip" and the dog leaves us speechless.
i found this book invaded by violence, sex, horror ...
the action of the war is absolutely not described (where the story takes place?
who are the saviors ?...) so, it's hard to position themselves in relation to the contents of the book, but we reacted in the wrong direction: that is to say a deep disgust.
the book contains all the violence can be sustained by a child in 166 pages which makes it indigestible.
i am really impatient to move on to another book to forget (what i do without any problem)
