a disturbing novel whose style simplissime has nothing to do with korsakov.
the portrait of the man who initially seems to us trivial and that it gradually discovers reminded me of other novels in which the father is the first map with the theme of loss or illness of a child.
the small monastery of peju example.
i can not say i liked this book, but it does not leave me indifferent.
i have not found the fottorino i love.
