but especially the dvd gives an overview of live performances of a group that has produced a huge number of concerts and has always wanted to give back to fans.
besides the dvd presentation is neat, with quality photos and full bonus.
the energy is there, you feel the united group, dave and martin were really fun to play.
the crowd explodes and it feels a whole bercy that moves and sings.
a legendary group home on his little screen, it is possible with this dvd! ;)
