the closet is a film that essentially connects homophobic stereotypes in relation to gays.
for the director of this film, it seems that the world is divided into two large bofs that break the shit out of tantous with baseball bats and men who are effeminate pink sweaters.
this film stinks of a pseudo-moralism two francs encouvre the worst prejudices.
