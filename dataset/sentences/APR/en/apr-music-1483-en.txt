just to return to the previous comment: the producer of the disc is the composer himself!
if omar rodriguez released so many records with the mars volta with his friends or his quintet with john frusciante is simply that it is inspired (and wants to enjoy as it is? !) for the rest, omar rodriguez is a great musician.
do not listen to discs of the mars volta as we listen to the rest of the current production.
i do not say it to my morning, 'if you do not like you're hicks ... "
