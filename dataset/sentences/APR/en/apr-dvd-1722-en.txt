for me spartacus is the best film of stanley kubrick point to the line followed closely by shining.
from the outset, the director chose to tell a story that revolves around the characters and not vice versa.
this enabled him to make a film much more intimate or emotional and human dimension takes precedence over the story itself.
the psychology of the characters is also very worked (something very rare in the peplum).
