ryan adams signs here his best album blending folk, blues and rock in the american tradition (something to please gentlemen neil young, dylan or tom petty !!!).
it is my opinion the greatest song-maker folk-rock of his generation and deserves to be more known!
in short, its melodies and its planing telecasters crunchy me completely convinced.
