1986 good year for the middle of the trash metal.
outputs of master of puppets by metallica and peace sells ...
but who's buying megadeth are successful.
but the grand prize in the group who will play faster, louder, it's slayer who will win with reign in blood.
so much so that cbs, the leading distributor of slayer, gets scared and refuses to get involved on reign in blood.
then rick rubin, head of def jam and many more known for his work with run dmc in particular that will grab the baby.
it will provide them with excellent production, technical level that offers slayer on this album.
there is nothing to throw in those 29 minutes of ultra-violence.
this is the way totue not in the habit of slayer.
if it must be remembered that song is of course the title song which closes the album, which is simply breathtaking, and always a great time in concert.
a stream at least once in their life history to better reflect the definition of thrash metal.
