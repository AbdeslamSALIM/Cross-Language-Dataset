thus distorting the words of scientists is a shame.
i thought crichton was documented a minimum before writing a book.
he said global warming would be as exaggerated as the chernobyl disaster, which would have (according to him) only 50 deaths (see interview in le figaro).
i understand a number of researchers, who saw their words distorted attacked mr crichton to justice.
the worst is that the federal government, failing to find scientific acredita their thesis went juqu'Ã  hear mr crichton parliament .
so that the endorsement of the american state: an author of science fiction! (while this country has the largest number of researchers in the world) you've definitely lost a writer with what you hold in this book.
i am sad to read some reviews on this site that crichton has succeeded in some embriguader in france.
i can only invite them to document a minimum on the subject by reading the great works of jean-marie pelt (earth heritage), nicolas hulot (titanic syndrome) or hubert reeves (mal de terre) - to name but a few-pages available from this site.
hopefully, this book makes a flop.
