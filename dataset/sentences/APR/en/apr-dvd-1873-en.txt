beowulf is a founding myth of civilization and the anglo-scandinavian saxonne.
i saw 2 other theatrical version of this myth that i find unpleasant, particularly the one with christopher lambert as the version in motion capture, it is good for the children on film stula gunnarson (a scandinavian, so i think he knows this myth) is by far the best version.
son film shot in iceland (viking land) enjoys beautiful scenery and it makes a significant visual splendor, not to mention a sense of authenticity important ..
the director does not seek to magnify the legend but rather to place it in a regular lower middle ages: vikings rebuilding homes, clothing, weapons, helmets and ship corresponding to archaeological discoveries (many in scandinavia) the hero and very human characters are sometimes trivial when they have drunk too much and practice a language little chastened.
beowulf is a hero in one piece but a man who seeks to understand what lies behind the repeated attacks of a "monster." beowulf is interpreted by the great gerard butler, still magnificent in the mythical roles (see attila leonidas 300), is a very believable hero and sometimes touching in its interrogations.
si you like humanized legends, beautiful scenery and authenticity, this film is vous.
hotel iceland is a country very difficult climate plan, i admire the courage of those who have work so that this film exists.
