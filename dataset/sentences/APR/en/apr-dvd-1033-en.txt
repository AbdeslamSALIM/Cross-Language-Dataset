the problem with pokemon is that the basic history and intérêt.
issus without a video game, pokémon have, and that everybody knows, very successful.
the tv series bringing the initiation of films (3 i believe it), we could expect that the quality would be at the rendezvous.
not much in terms of history but at least at the level of animation.
inhabited by the desire to produce quickly and well (or cheaply), the producers have marketed these films including this one, all appalling.
weird (nothing but the name is puzzling) and his gang of pokémon offers us, therefore, a pitiful spectacle which will attract the fans.
