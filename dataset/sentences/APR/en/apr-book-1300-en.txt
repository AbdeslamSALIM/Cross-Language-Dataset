it is already several weeks i tried to read this after a very ordinary first opus!
but then i really can not do it!
what's blabla dialogues endless, people no end and no flavor!
there eddings really disappointed me and i will be very difficult to come back!
it is still their great sagas that i still reread with much pleasure!
