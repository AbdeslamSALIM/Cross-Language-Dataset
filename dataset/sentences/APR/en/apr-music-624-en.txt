the themes, always in perfect harmony with the flashes of visual lynch, are varied and always so dark (cf.
les previous compositions for lynch badalamenti) and one finds oneself has the hum as they are heady.
a stream of urgency: the second track, simply entitled "mulholland drive", which sums up his own mind this movie yet so difficult to understand but which provides an extremely rare pleasure.
other songs listen very well and everyone reseve its share of surprises (especially the silence and other sounds, so dear to daivd lynch).
do not go especially next to the object of pure fantasy composer who will give you emotions to the extent of the film.
