dj caruso () performs a thriller really deserving.
taking lives is the kind of film "thriller" which would deserve much more attention from developers.
he is passing unnoticed in our hexagon, and yet he had enough for a nice score at the box office.
a fairly conventional thriller, certainly, but managed to hold its own game by its players and staging.
de plus, rather it is based on the psychology of both the murderer, but also our "investigators".
the film starts with the birth of our serial killer impregnated by a paul dano () that makes us shiver.
a short passage, but a cult scene.
subsequently, the staging confuses us for our happiness.
it is unclear where the film takes us, keeping us in suspense throughout.
is not it more important for a thriller?
rhythmic and dynamic film quite confusing in the end.
the duo ethaw hawk and angelina jolie made sparks, besides kiefer sutherland!
in short, a host of excellent actors who make us feel the ambiguity of their characters.
i really love this movie so i did not expect much.
