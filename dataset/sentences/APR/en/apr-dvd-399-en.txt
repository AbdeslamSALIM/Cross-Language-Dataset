then of course there is not in the second round of fight scenes as spectacular as in the first, the bride does not face ten young japanese furi, it focuses on these last three objectives and c ' is not bad.
i found both the first because for once we see black mamba in difficulty, it does not explode everything in its path, and three former colleagues are tough to eliminate.
this second part is slower, more emotional, but you'll mythical scenes, including the fight with elle driver short but intense.
basically, if you liked the first part and you're bound to uma thurman, go for it, you can not regret it.
