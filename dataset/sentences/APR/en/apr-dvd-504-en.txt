james gray film ends with this triptych about his family and the underworld.
his first opus little odessa described the return of a killer in his family with tim roth in the title role.
yards the second deals with the delicate release from prison of a man caught by his mafia family.
the three films explore the difficulties exist in the intimate group of the family when the path is chosen by one of its members is the opposite of the values it conveys.
this radical and violent confrontation collide individuals to better educate them or destroy them.
the construction of the story is similar on all three films: it must reach the point of no return - death - to change the way the main character.
it is a tragedy in the classical sense of the term based on the code of honor.
the characters have no choice but to follow the path which is paved.
photography mainly nocturnal shift to phoenix, then gives way to light.
but the assumption that light passes through the flood, the car chase, the climax of the film.
the interpretation is excellent, special mention for joaquin phoenix and subtlety to his game and the transformation that leaves cracks appear in its progressive character.
robert duvall is always so impeccable.
