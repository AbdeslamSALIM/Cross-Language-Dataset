half an hour to read this book, almost as interesting a half hour before any show like big brother.
do not doubt that the author delivers a book quickly, driven by the severity of his publishing contract ...
besides, with so few pages and a font as big, we did not ask what can justify such a high price ...
a book trade, then, for those who want to fatten a ruthless editor and an author without inspiration for this move here.
