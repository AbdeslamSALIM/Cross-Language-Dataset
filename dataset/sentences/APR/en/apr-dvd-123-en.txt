our brave officer remained deeply traumatized by the massacre perpetrated against the indians.
he proposes to go to japan to train the regular army of the emperor then in the making.
he will have to face a samurai lord played by sanada jiroyubi not a bad actor for that matter.
the idea may seem strange, but why not.
his morale in part through the expatriation then arranged a little surout after he was taken prisoner, he has ample time to discover this civilization and its rites in detail and especially the depth of soul of the samurai, other licensed butchers in another style, fans of hara-kiri and katana to the cutting blade and steel.
this film is not unpleasant to look at first, but the linear scenario is furthermore a heartbreaking poverty.
this clash of values tradionnal of medieval japan, the code of bushido, the way of the samurai and a new way of life which modern japan sucks, does not make much noise, or is paid every drop of blood, if not accident.
japan won the western lifestyle and especially its technology was developed at the same level as other nations in recent years and this smooth and very naturally, with loss journey without doubt a little of his soul, but this is another story ...
the music is not bad and the images are not bad either ...
good for the samurai armor.
an action film a little soothing, sometimes considerably, which will not mark the annals of the 7th art.
