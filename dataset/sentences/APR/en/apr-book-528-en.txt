written by the great grand nephew of stoker (that's for the family bond) and ian holt specialist vampire count, this would result by the authors aim to restore the original novel in the light of the many adaptations disrespectful of 'work.
paradoxically, this result is inspired by certain aspects of the film more than coppola's work stoker.
the authors intend to give a romantic dimension to vampire beginning a gradual deconstruction of the character of dracula.
