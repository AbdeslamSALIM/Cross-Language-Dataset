columbine talks about the cover and beautiful pictures, this is indeed the main strength of this cd!
moire is still one of the products derived from such musicals as pre teens before him garou, fiori, and now daniel levi or unbearable christophe mae.
what about the consumer product, already the voice bleating like mae is unbearable very quickly and how to sing in forcing everything we say or lara fabian celine dion, then the texts and music are flat and banal in short, a good sized and very soon forget!
