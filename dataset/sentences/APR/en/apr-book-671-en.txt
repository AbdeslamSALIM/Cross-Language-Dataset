the amelie nothomb i have read almost all actually.
not until then i had not bored much.
also to find a sensual pleasure he decides to kill on command.
from my point of view, it is treated as soporific.
no energy, amelie sleeping on its laurels and we sleep.
i struggled to finish the book.
yet it is written very large, the margins are so many avenues are broad and the book is much thicker.
as for the issue!
one end of a bad episode of a bad sci-fi second part evening can not match it.
i was tempted to throw this book in the trash.
that says it all.
