this album, which made me listen by accident, is a bland melange of bad funk, electro and syrupy soup, it was an uncomfortable feeling to sit for the same piece of listen from start to fin.
all beyonce, spice girls, and co (i am not a specialist in the career of justin (lol) but remember that it comes from a boy band: the distressing news kids on the block), that are commercial products properly calibrated, cute, knowing move and designed for pre teens.
in short, cd exlusively reserved for pillars of disco or those for which the star ac is the top quality music (again lol!).
