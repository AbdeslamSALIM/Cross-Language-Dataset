electric is part of these records underestimated many of rock history as we are indeed in the presence of a masterpiece: no song is bad, what is not so common, and better yet they all have devastating power.
the principle is simple and has already been proven, a riff of a diabolical efficiency, a simple rhythm and a sense of the perfect groove with vocals by ian asbury.
there has to listen peace frog or king contrary man to realize.
the presence of "old" is visible, you think of ac / dc or led zeppelin, and kim fowley with superb recovery born to be wild, but the group has its own identity and not just the "clone".
the production by rick rubin (beasty boys, red hot chili peppers, slayer ...) is for many.
regrettably perhaps a little lack of aggressiveness, but the disc remains a major work of the 80s and rock itself.
