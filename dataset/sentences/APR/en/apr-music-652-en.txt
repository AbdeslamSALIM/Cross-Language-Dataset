and i even found a harmony that i did not all need in albums taken one by one.
everything is good, atypical (as is arno): the duets, the choice of songs with a few forgotten nuggets, the words "not ordinary".
excellent purchase that i believe can avoid the non-fan to get all the records of his extensive career.
after all it is also here that here is a best-of!
