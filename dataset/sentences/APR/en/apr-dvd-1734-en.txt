we must first know that the image quality is a very mediocre one can see!
definition of poor quality, without subtlety or color shades, dragging, lack of fluidity.
the sound a bit better than the image is rough, poorly mixed (guitar often drowned and distant), and is making noises like no parasites on the stage of mechanical noise etc. ...
in short, it's not top either, and i do not know if we can really justify it by saying that it dates from 1978 ...
so we must say that we buy here is to take as a document on the neil young of the time.
however, if people know that this is not the finest of songwriters, we must admit that the american farmer redneck side is particularly evident in this show at the staging very heavy, where the link is made by the eruption of gnomes ridiculous dressed in a robe with oversized hood which leaves only the light from two lamps instead of eyes, and saw the lack of professionalism of people that are here, we see that they are amateur strengthen their blunder by the home side and artisanal young.
but it's certainly a choice on his part, not an inadvertent error.
as for the game scene and dress of crazy horse, it is worthy of musicians that i saw play in festnoz of the breton countryside at the same time: in jeans and sweetshirt, it swings about yourself without making a not.
in short, great art ...
but it's still a great pleasure to see performed on stage "cortez the killer", "like a hurricane" or the electric version of "hey hey, my my" ...
a book for fans of neil young so ...
