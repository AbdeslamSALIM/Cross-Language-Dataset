cornelius is a star power.
his first album has everything a masterpiece.
it includes the dimension of his music when we know the biography of corneille.
the latter deals with lightness and without lapsing into melodrama, the terrible war that occurred in rwanda (the artist was born in this country).
we love his lyrics reflected his smooth voice and his talent for songwriting.
just thinking about it, it still makes me shudder.
