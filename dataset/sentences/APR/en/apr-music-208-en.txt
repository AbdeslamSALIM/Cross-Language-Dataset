i will not dwell on the qualities of this incredible violinist soloist hallucinating everything is pushed to the perfection of the art (phrasing, precision, virtuosity, simplicity, stamp, etc.) ...
there is no rhetoric, the melodies are subordinated to the orchestral soloists and serve only to 'prove' and breaths between episodes concertants soloist.
it is in the blueprint is to the spirit of concerto!
but let there be no mistake!
in these other opus, locatelli demonstrated a melodic invention and orchestral rich (op. 4, 9, concerti grossi, etc.).
i think it is just what locatelli aspired far from being a work dydactique, l'arte del violino is highlighting and perspective of the technical capabilities of the soloist without orchestra phagocytose by or expressive too obvious.
without any comparison, i can not help but think of the last works of mozart (rondo's last piano cto, ave verum, clemence, etc.) that are in some respects, the stylistic blueprints, more radical, less rhetorical and in any case d 'expressive abrtraite.
