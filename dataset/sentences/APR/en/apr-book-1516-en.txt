violet, the second daughter of the band cherry, green is frustrating to know that she will not be part of the feast of satya nor will it ten days of vacation with his friends very close in part because the corbi√®res with his great-uncle, ernesto.
the desire is there yet, because she loves her tio ernesto, and the taste of childhood found in the heart of this remote village, deep in the country.
she spotted a guy in the black track in the streets of paris.
this would link with the famous secret of cherries ...
he released the single seductive sex appeal of louis garrel and anthony perkins combined.
the look, the mole, the dimple.
it's nothing that em --- or, as she says.
last part of the adventures of a quartet very endearing, with a personality that stands out over the books and stories are unique to each.
it is much more than that, and that's what makes this series and just beautiful.
and i do not think i am right in saying that she is the instigator of this project, four authors together around the same story be told without the fart and never be repeated.
so write four stories, with four friends and one secret.
the result is a success across the board, both in terms of literary quality as interest stories, format, four short stories to small price and charismatic characters, stories that intersect and weave delicately, without forgetting the red wire around the secrecy of cherries.
i had not expected so many good surprises in such little books!
