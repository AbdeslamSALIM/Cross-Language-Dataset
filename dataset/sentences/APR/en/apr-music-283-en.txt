terribly effective, the first listening of this album is easy and seamless.
a series of titles on current topics, treated in a neutral, very close to those singers who think they should give an opinion on everything.
calogero book of observations beautifully wrapped in melodies and searched very pleasant listening.
the songs (admittedly the most current say "securities") are really beautiful, just the voice, with a precision of swiss clockwork.
the cd in its box with the book is enjoyable, even if it does not come in boxes of cd collection!
the souls of true rocker embittered by the wretched current production are requested not to be mistaken for merchandise, it is useless to give a negative opinion on a free product that they are not really intended.
buy the cd, the burn may deprive us of the next ...
