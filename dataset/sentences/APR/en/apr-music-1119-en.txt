the debut album from stephen stills, who was not really a beginner, given his cv (buffalo springfield, csn &amp; y) is almost better than anything he could achieve before!
it covers all types here with delight, beginning with the gospel with the hymn "love the one you're with" (later by joe cocker, the isley brothers and many others), the ballad folk and blues ( "cherokee" and "black queen" two great moments magnified by the subtle skill of virtuoso acoustic guitar) and rock west coast.
note that it is accompanied by jimi hendrix in one of the final appearances of voodoo-child on "old times, good times," and eric "god" clapton on the next song, a "go back home" anthology !
for those who doubt the talent yet stills, see also manassas disk with equally gorgeous!
