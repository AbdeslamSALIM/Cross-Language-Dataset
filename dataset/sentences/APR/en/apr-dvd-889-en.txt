overnight a normal man gets to be obnoxious with all his family by telling them their truths, unless we have the explanation of his hateful attitude.
do not want to spoil the film i will say that this: three quarters are horrendous, dupontel plays the only way he seems to know (look furious, ground speed, abrupt gestures) and the outcome is never caught in the avalanche of anything evil beast from the rest of the film.
the ending theme was universally appreciated, but it owes its success to the fact that the screening rooms were left in the dark for a beautiful song reggiani.
as this process is impossible to make on dvd, it has hardly any interest in my opinion ...
