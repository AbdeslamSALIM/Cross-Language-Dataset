i'm totally a fan of amorphis, i have all their albums, and it is nice to see that the group, while remaining melodic comes from eclipse, to bring that voice death enormously to the world group!
elements folk, atmospheric, but also the more aggressive passages, the top level interpretation, the perfect production, but this album is a marvel indispensable!
