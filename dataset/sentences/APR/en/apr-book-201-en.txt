my girl of 2 years and i have not enjoyed this book too, unlike nursery rhymes in creole.
we did not find the songs of interest (language learning) or even appreciation of music (arias uninteresting, hardly memorable), and is a music teacher who speaks!
furthermore, the illustrations are quite dark the faces seem alarming.
i do not understand all the praise read in other reviews!
