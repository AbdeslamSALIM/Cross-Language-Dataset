not quite specialist shamanism, but not ignorant, i know a good book on the subject.
regarding this book, i stress that i put one star (can not put zero).
indeed, the tone is ugly, pseudo humor of the author removes all the magic that is expected to be discovered by reading about shamanism.
book rather light for girls who never leave their office and takes away their tailors to sleep.
