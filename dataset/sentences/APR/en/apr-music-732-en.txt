laugh a little with eve angeli!
to begin the tone jacket with this hilarious, no doubt a tribute to singing bawdy or a wink to her poses newlook?
i'm having a horror of sexist jokes and stereotypes about blondes, we must admit that eve does nothing for their cause.

(my evangelists: 2 small for fun "to look good we must stop to undermine" and "to bring back the sun i put sunglasses" (sic)).
be a good sport and give it still a good thing: his commitment animals (peta-spa)
