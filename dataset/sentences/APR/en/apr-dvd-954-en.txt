we've been out of this film an unprecedented hype, at the height of the money swallowed (what pun intended) for his achievement.
so that (almost) everyone went to see him and felt compelled to find formidable.
the recovery of the liner requires no criticism on the contrary, but the rest is soulless, tasteless, key players could not be more bland, transparents.
vraiment, this film is pseudo-romantic wish to namby-pamby.
why not be hired as a waitress amelie poulain on the ship: at least we would have both the presence and emotion that lack both the ship!
