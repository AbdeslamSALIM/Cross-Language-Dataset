schoendoerffer peter gives us in this film, the story of a mythical character of the indochina war: pierre guillaume nicknamed "the crab-drum".
the story is beautifully told through the exchange of naval officers during a cruise at sea: the indochinese arroyos in the algiers putsch, the commitment of the man the duty of military discipline.
everything this film is exceptional: the slow, plans remarkable, the game just really talented actors, the soundtrack.
to me, this is the best film schoendoerffer.
