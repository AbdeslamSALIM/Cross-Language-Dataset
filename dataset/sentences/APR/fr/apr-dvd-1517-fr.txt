Wayne avoided military service during World War Two, and it shows in the movie.
For example, Wayne repeatedly uses his rifle to gesture toward someone, a flagrant mistake that a recruit with one week of training would not make.
Appropriately, at the movie's end the sun sinks in the east as Wayne and a Vietnamese child gaze out to sea.
The movie's grasp of the war in Vietnam is as confused as its grasp of geography.
