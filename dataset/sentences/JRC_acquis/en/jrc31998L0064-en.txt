ANNEX PART A DETERMINATION OF AMINO ACIDS 1.
The filtered solution is adjusted to pH 2,20.
The amino acids are separated by ion exchange chromatography and determined by reaction with ninhydrin with photometric detection at 570 nm. 2.2.
Oxidation is performed at 0 °C with a performic acid/phenol mixture.
The oxidised or unoxidised sample is hydrolysed with hydrochloric acid (c = 6 mol/l) for 23 hours.
The hydrolysate is adjusted to pH 2,20.
The amino acids are separated by ion exchange chromatography and determined by reaction with ninhydrin using photometric detection at 570 nm (440 nm for proline). 3.

It does not cover the analysis of oil seeds and oleaginous fruit defined in Council Regulation 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966.
Procedure A The sample is extracted with light petroleum.
The residue is washed and dried and submitted to the determination according to Procedure A. 3.
The bromine value must be less than 1 and the residue on evaporation less than 2 mg/100 ml. 3.2.
Sodium sulfate, anhydrous. 3.3.
Procedure A (see point 8.1) Weigh 5 g of the sample to the nearest 1 mg, transfer it to an extraction thimble (4.2) and cover with a fat-free wad of cotton wool.
Place the thimble in an extractor (4.1) and extract for six hours with light petroleum (3.1).
Dry the residue maintaining the flask for one and a half hours in the drying oven (4.3).
Dry again for 30 minutes to ensure that the weight of the oils and fats remains constant (loss in weight between two successive weighings must be less than 1 mg). 5.2.
Procedure B Weigh 2,5 g of the sample to the nearest 1 mg (see point 8.2), place in a 400 ml beaker or a 300 ml conical flask and add 100 ml of hydrochloric acid (3.3) and fragments of pumice stone.
Place the double filter paper containing the residue on a watch glass and dry for one and a half hours in the air oven (4.3) 100 °C ± 3 °C.
Place the thimble in an extractor (4.1) and proceed as indicated in the second and third paragraphs of point 5.1. 6.
Repeatability The difference between the results of two parallel determinations carried out on the same sample by the same analyst should not exceed: - 0,2 % in absolute value, for contents of crude oils and fats lower than 5 %, - 4,0 % relative to the highest result for contents of 5 to 10 %, - 0,4 % in absolute value, for contents above 10 %. 8.
Extract with light petroleum (3.1) as indicated in point 5.1.
Make up the extract obtained to 500 ml with light petroleum (3.1) and mix.
Calculate the content of oils and fats as a percentage of the sample by using the following formula: (10 a + b) × 5 where: a = mass in grams of the residue after the first extraction (aliquot part of the extract), b = mass in grams of the residue after the second extraction. 8.2.
For products low in oils and fats the test sample may be increased to 5 g. 8.3.
Pre-extraction by Procedure A prior to hydrolysis and re-extraction by Procedure B is recommended if the crude oil/fat content is greater than 15 %.
PART C DETERMINATION OF OLAQUINDOX (2-[N-2'-(hydroxyethyl)carbamoyl]-3-methylquinoxaline-N1,N4-dioxyde) 1.
The lower limit of determination is 5 mg/kg. 2.
The content of olaquindox is determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an UV detector. 3.
Methanol, HPLC grade 3.3.
Water, HPLC grade 3.4.
Standard substance: pure olaquindox 2-[N-2'-(hydroxyethyl)carbamoyl]-3-methylquinoxaline-N1,N4-dioxyde, E 851. 3.5.1.
Olaquindox stock standard solution, 250 ìg/ml Weigh to the nearest 0,1 mg 50 mg of olaquindox (3.5) in a 200 ml graduated flask and add ca. 190 ml water.
Then place the flask for 20 min into an ultrasonic bath (4.1).
Olaquindox intermediate standard solution, 25 ìg/ml Transfer 10,0 ml of the stock standard solution (3.5.1) into a 100 ml graduated flask, make up to the mark with the mobile phase (3.4) and mix.
Calibration solutions: Into a series of 50 ml graduated flask transfer 1,0, 2,0, 5,0, 10,0, 15,0 and 20,0 ml of the intermediate standard solution (3.5.2).
These solutions correspond to 0,5, 1,0, 2,5, 5,0, 7,5 and 10,0 ìg of olaquindox per ml respectively.
These solutions must be prepared fresh each day. 4.
Ultrasonic bath 4.2.
Liquid chromatographic column, 250 mm × 4 mm, C18, 10 ìm packing, or equivalent 4.4.
Membrane filters, 0,45 ìm 5.
To fortify at a level of 50 mg/kg, transfer 10,0 ml of the stock standard solution (3.5.1) to a 250 ml conical flask and evaporate the solution to ca. 0,5 ml.
Extraction Weigh to the nearest 0,01 g, approximately 50 g of the sample.
Transfer to a 1 000 ml conical flask, add 100 ml of methanol (3.1) and place the flask for 5 minutes in the ultrasonic bath (4.1).
Add 410 ml water and leave in the ultrasonic bath for further 15 minutes.
Remove the flask from the ultrasonic bath, shake it for 30 minutes on the shaker (4.2) and filter through a folded filter.
Sample solution Inject the sample extract (5.2) several times using the same volume as taken for the calibration solutions and determine the mean peak height (area) of the olaquindox peaks. 6.
Calculation of the results From the mean height (area) of the olaquindox peaks of the sample solution determine the concentration of the sample solution in ìg/ml by reference to the calibration graph (5.3.2).
The olaquindox content w in mg/kg of the sample is given by the following formula: w = %gt%NUM%gt%c × 1 000 %gt%DEN%gt%m in which: c = olaquindox concentration of the sample extract (5.2) in ìg/ml m = mass of the test portion in g (5.2). 7.
Identity The identity of the analyte can be confirmed by co-chromatography, or by using a diode-array detector by which the spectra of the sample extract (5.2) and the calibration solution (3.5.3) containing 5,0 ìg/ml are compared. 7.1.1.
The peak width, at half of its height, must be within ± 10 % of the original width of the olaquindox peak of the unfortified sample extract. 7.1.2.
This criterion is met when the same maxima are present and when at all observed points the deviation between the spectra does not exceed 15 % of the absorbance of the spectrum of the peak apex.
Repeatability The difference between the results of two parallel determinations carried out on the same sample must not exceed 15 % relative to the higher result for olaquindox contents between 10 and 20 mg/kg. 7.3.
Recovery For a fortified blank sample the recovery should be at least 90 %. 8.
The results are given below: %gt%TABLE%gt% 9.
Observation Although the method has not been validated for feeds containing more than 100 mg/kg of olaquindox, it may be possible to obtain satisfactory results by taking a smaller sample weight and/or diluting the extract (5.2) to reach a concentration within the range of the calibration graph (5.3.2). (1) Where the oil or fat has to undergo subsequent quality tests, replace the fragments of pumice stone by glass beads.
