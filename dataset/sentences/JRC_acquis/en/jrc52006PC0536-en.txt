Council Directive amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include flusilazole as active substance /* COM/2006/0536 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.09.2006 COM(2006) 536 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include flusilazole as active substance (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Conclusions: The attached draft proposal for a Council Directive concerns the inclusion under strict conditions of flusilazole as active substance in the positive list (Annex I) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.
Individual plant protection products containing active substances are assessed and authorised by Member States under harmonised rules.
The draft Directive is not subject to the right of scrutiny of the European Parliament (Article 8 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC).
Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market[2], establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
For flusilazole the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier.
Ireland submitted the relevant assessment report and recommendations to the Commission on 30 April 1996 in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. 3.
It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing flusilazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5(1) (a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report, provided that adequate risk mitigation measures are applied.
It may be expected that plant protection products containing flusilazole satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5(1) (a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report and providing that the necessary risk mitigation measures are applied. 10.
Equally, the fact that the inclusion of this substance in Annex I expires on a particular date does not prevent the inclusion being renewed according to the procedures laid down in the Directive. 12.
Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing flusilazole to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied.
They shall apply those provisions from 1 July 2007.
Member States shall in accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing flusilazole as an active substance by 30 June 2007 .
By that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to that Directive relating to flusilazole are met, with the exception of those identified in part B of the entry concerning that active substance, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive in accordance with the conditions of Article 13. 2.
By derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing flusilazole, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles provided for in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to that Directive and taking into account part B of the entry in Annex I to that Directive concerning flusilazole.
Following that determination Member States shall for products containing flusilazole, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 30 June 2008.
Article 4 This Directive shall enter into force on 1 January 2007.
Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Member States must ensure that the authorisation holders report at the latest on 31 December of each year on incidences of operator health problems.
They shall ensure that the notifier at whose request flusilazole has been included in this Annex provide such studies to the Commission within 2 years of the adoption of the above test guidelines. | ‚Äù [1] OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
