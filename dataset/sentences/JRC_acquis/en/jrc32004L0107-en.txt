Mercury released into the atmosphere is capable of being transported over long distances. (10) The Commission intends to come forward in 2005 with a coherent strategy containing measures to protect human health and the environment from the release of mercury, based on a life-cycle approach, and taking into account production, use, waste treatment and emissions.
Article 3 Target values 1.
Member States shall take all necessary measures not entailing disproportionate costs to ensure that, as from 31 December 2012, concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene, used as a marker for the carcinogenic risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in ambient air, as assessed in accordance with Article 4, do not exceed the target values laid down in Annex I. 2.
Article 4 Assessment of ambient air concentrations and deposition rates 1.
A combination of measurements, including indicative measurements as referred to in Annex IV, Section I, and modelling techniques may be used to assess ambient air quality in zones and agglomerations where the levels over a representative period are between the upper and lower assessment thresholds, to be determined pursuant to Annex II, Section II. 4.
The upper and lower assessment thresholds for arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in ambient air shall be those laid down in Section I of Annex II.
The classification of each zone or agglomeration for the purposes of this Article shall be reviewed at least every five years in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section II of Annex II.
The criteria for determining the location of sampling points for the measurement of arsenic, cadmium, nickel and benzo(a)pyrene in ambient air in order to assess compliance with the target values shall be those listed in Sections I and II of Annex III.
Sections I, II and III of Annex III shall apply. 9.
Irrespective of concentration levels, one background sampling point shall be installed every 100000 km2 for the indicative measurement, in ambient air, of arsenic, cadmium, nickel, total gaseous mercury, benzo(a)pyrene and the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons referred to in paragraph 8 and of the total deposition of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel, benzo(a)pyrene and the other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons referred to in paragraph 8.
Sections I, II and III of Annex III shall apply. 10.
For zones and agglomerations within which information from fixed measurement stations is supplemented by information from other sources, such as emission inventories, indicative measurement methods and air quality modelling, the number of fixed measuring stations to be installed and the spatial resolution of other techniques shall be sufficient for the concentrations of air pollutants to be established in accordance with Section I of Annex III and Section I of Annex IV. 12.
Data quality objectives are laid down in Section I of Annex IV.
The reference methods for the sampling and analysis of arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air shall be as laid down in Sections I, II and III of Annex V.
Article 5 Transmission of information and reporting 1.
The information shall be transmitted for each calendar year, by no later than 30 September of the following year, and for the first time for the calendar year following 15 February 2007. 2.
The Commission shall ensure that all information submitted pursuant to paragraph 1 is promptly made available to the public by appropriate means, such as Internet, press and other easily accessible media. 4.
Article 6 Committee 1.
Article 7 Public information 1.
Information on any measures taken pursuant to Article 3 shall be made available to the organisations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. 3.
Article 8 Report and review 1.
The Commission shall, by 31 December 2010 at the latest, submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report based on: (a) the experience acquired in the application of this Directive, (b) in particular, the results of the most recent scientific research concerning the effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations, and on the environment as a whole, of exposure to arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and (c) technological developments including the progress achieved in methods of measuring and otherwise assessing concentrations of these pollutants in ambient air as well as their deposition. 2.
Article 9 Penalties Member States shall determine the penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all the measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.
Article 10 Implementation 1.
Article 11 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 12 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
