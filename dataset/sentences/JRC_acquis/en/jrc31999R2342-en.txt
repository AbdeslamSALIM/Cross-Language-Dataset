Commission Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 of 28 October 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal as regards premium schemes COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2342/1999 of 28 October 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal as regards premium schemes THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Articles 4(8), 5(5), 6(7), 7(5), 8(4), 9(4), 10(3), 11(5), 12(3), 13(5), 20, 23(3) and 50 thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 set up a new system of premiums to replace the system set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68(2).
In order to take account of the new arrangements, it is necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3886/92 of 23 December 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the premium schemes provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 on the common organisation of the market in beef and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1244/82 and (EEC) No 714/89(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1410/1999(4) and, on the occasion of the amendment, Regulation (EEC) No 3886/92 should be recast, in the interests of clarity; (2) the premium and other payment schemes referred to in Articles 3 to 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 should fall within the scope of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(5) (hereinafter referred to as %quot%the integrated system%quot%), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1036/1999(6).
As a result, this Regulation should be restricted to the horizontal regulation of outstanding matters within the framework of the said integrated system; (3) the objectives of the regional ceiling and of the stocking density dictate that the special premium may no longer be applied for in respect of the same age bracket for those animals affected by application of these two measures.
For the purposes of the deseasonalisation premium, these animals should be deemed to have qualified for the special premium; (4) Article 4(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 lays down that each male bovine animal should be covered, until slaughter or until export, by an animal passport within the meaning of Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 of 21 April 1997 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products(7) or an equivalent administrative document.
In order to take account of particular administrative and control conditions in the Member States, different forms of administrative document should be allowed; (5) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 lays down a retention period as a condition for granting the special premium.
In order to take account of the specific features of the form of granting at the time of slaughter, the age conditions for steers and the method of presentation of the carcase for adult bovine animals should be laid down; (7) the conditions for granting the deseasonalisation premium should be laid down, in accordance with the arrangements for granting the slaughter premium.
Member States should therefore be authorised to raise the minimum percentage of use of rights, which should not, however, exceed 90 %; (11) Articles 22 and 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain regulations(8) establish extensification programmes.
Provision should be made for the suspension, during the entire period of participation in the above programmes, of the use of rights to the suckler cow premium released in this way.
One of the objectives of the early retirement scheme laid down by Article 10 of that Regulation is to encourage the replacement of elderly farmers by farmers able to improve the economic viability of the remaining agricultural holdings.
Objective criteria should be established for the determination of the sum to be paid by the national reserve to the producer who has transferred his rights and the sum to be paid by the producer who receives equivalent rights from the national reserve; (16) Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 lays down, for Member States complying with the conditions in that Article, a special optional scheme to manage the granting of the suckler-cow premium for heifers.
The special arrangements for granting the premium should be specified.
The special arrangements for granting the premium should be specified.
For the sake of consistency with the general extensification payment scheme, and in order to establish the precise number of dairy cows eligible for the payment, a minimum retention period should be laid down for dairy cows; (22) the application of certain provisions of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits(10) would artificially extend retention periods which are expressed in terms of months by one or more days.
Specific provisions should therefore be laid down on this matter; (23) applications should normally be submitted in respect of the slaughter premium.
In the interests of simplification, the %quot%livestock%quot% aid application provided for in the integrated system should be taken to represent such an application, provided that it contains all the elements needed to justify payment of the premium and that the animal is slaughtered in the same Member State or in another Member State, or exported; (24) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 820/97, Member States should have a fully operational computerised database from 31 December 1999.
A standard type of carcase presentation should therefore be laid down, to which this maximum weight applies; (26) Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 lays down a retention period as a condition for granting the slaughter premium.
To facilitate the transmission and analysis of the data, a consistent format for submitting that data should be laid down; (33) in order to facilitate the change to the new scheme, transitional provisions are needed for the notification rules and the obligation to mark and identify animals; (34) the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 This Regulation lays down the detailed rules for the application of the premium schemes and other payment schemes laid down in Articles 3 to 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
