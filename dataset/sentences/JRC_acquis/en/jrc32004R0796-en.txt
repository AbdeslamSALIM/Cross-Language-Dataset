Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 april 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001(1), and in particular Articles 7(1), 10(3), 24(2), 34(2), 52(2), 145(b), (c), (d), (g), (j), (k), (l), (m), (n), (p), thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 introduced the single payment scheme as well as certain other direct payment schemes.
At the same time it merged several existing direct payment schemes.
Moreover, it establishes a principle according to which direct payments to a farmer who does not comply with certain conditions in the areas of public, animal and plant health, environment and animal welfare ( «cross-compliance» ) shall be subject to reductions or exclusions. (2) The direct payment schemes first introduced as a result of the reform of the common agricultural policy in 1992 and further developed under the Agenda 2000 measures have been subjected to an integrated administration and control system (hereinafter referred to as «integrated system» ).
Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 builds upon the basis of that integrated system and submits to it the management and control both of the direct payment schemes set up by it and the adherence to the cross-compliance obligations. (3) It is therefore appropriate to repeal Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 of 11 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92(2) and to base this Regulation on the principles as established by Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001. (4) For reasons of clarity, it is appropriate to provide for certain definitions. (5) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides, as part of the cross-compliance conditions, for certain obligations of the Member States on the one hand and individual farmers on the other hand, as regards the maintenance of permanent pasture.
It is necessary to clarify at which level the system should operate and the level of details of information that has to be available in the GIS. (8) Moreover, the introduction of an area payment for nuts in Chapter 4 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2203 leads to the need for the introduction of a new layer of information in the GIS.
Provision should be made for the basic elements of such a system.. (11) In order to contribute to the protection of the financial interest of the Community it should be foreseen that payments under Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 May only be made once the checks with regard to the eligibility criteria have been finalised. (12) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 leaves a choice for the Member States with regard to the application of certain of the aid schemes provided for therein.
Moreover, any specific information relating to production of hemp, durum wheat, rice, nuts, energy crops, starch potato and seeds should be requested together with the single application. (17) With a view to simplifying the application procedures and in accordance with Article 22(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, provision should, in this context, be made for Member States to provide the farmer as far as possible with pre-printed information. (18) For the sake of effective monitoring, each Member State should, furthermore, determine the minimum size of agricultural parcels that may be subject to an aid application. (19) It should, furthermore, be provided that areas are declared in the single application form for which no aid is being requested.
In accordance with Article 138 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, premiums under the bovine aid schemes may only be paid for animals that are properly identified and registered in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000.
In view of specific environmental needs, it is appropriate to provide some flexibility within the limits taken into account when the regional yields were fixed. (38) With regard to areas declared for the purpose of receiving aid under the Single Payment scheme, a differentiated approach should, however, be taken given the fact that such payments are no more connected to an obligation to produce. (39) Given the particularities of the aid scheme for seed in accordance with Article 99 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, special control provisions should be established. (40) The conditions for the use of remote sensing for on-the-spot checks should be laid down and provision should be made for physical checks to be carried out in cases where photo-interpretation does not lead to clear results. (41) Article 52 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for particular controls on the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content in the case where a farmer grows hemp on parcels declared for the purposes of the Single Payment scheme.
The details concerning such controls need to be established. (42) In the case where a Member State opts for the application of the various livestock aid schemes, where aid is being applied for under those aid schemes, the timing and the minimum content of on-the-spot checks should be specified.
In order to check effectively the correctness of declarations in aid applications and notifications to the computerised database for bovine animals it is essential to carry out a major part of such on-the-spot checks whilst animals still have to be kept on farm under the retention obligation. (43) In the case where a Member State opts for the application of the various aid schemes for bovine animals, the proper identification and registration of bovine animals being an eligibility condition pursuant to Article 138 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, it should be ensured that Community aid is granted only for bovines properly identified and registered.
Such checks should also be carried out in respect of bovine animals not yet claimed but which could be subject to an aid application in the future because such animals, due to the set-up of several of the bovine aid schemes, are, in many cases, only claimed for aid after they have already left the holding. (44) In the case where a Member State opts for the application of the slaughter premium, special provision should be made for checks to be carried out in slaughterhouses in order to check that animals claimed for aid are eligible and that the information contained in the computerised database is correct.
The Member States should be authorised to apply two different bases for selecting slaughterhouses for such checks. (45) In that case, as far as the slaughter premium granted after export of bovine animals is concerned, special provisions are necessary along with Community control provisions relating to export in general because of the differences in the control purposes. (46) The control provisions foreseen in relation to the livestock aid should also, where appropriate, apply as regards additional payments pursuant to Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. (47) Special control provisions have been established on the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003 of 23 June 2003 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the minimum level of controls to be carried out in the framework of the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals(4).
Such checks may be carried out in particular on the basis of the farmers accounting or other registers. (49) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 introduces cross compliance obligations for farmers receiving aid-payments under all direct payment schemes listed in Annex I to that Regulation.
The details for that system should be established. (50) The details concerning the question which authorities in the Member States carry out controls on cross compliance obligations should be established. (51) In certain cases it might be useful for the Member States to carry out administrative checks on cross compliance obligations.
Separate provisions should be made in cases of irregularities found with regard to eligibility criteria for the different aid schemes concerned. (56) The system of reductions and exclusions envisaged in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 with regard to cross compliance obligations however targets at a different aim, namely to set an incentive for farmers to respect the, already existing, legislation in the different fields of cross compliance. (57) Reductions and exclusions should be established having regard to the principle of proportionality and, in the case of eligibility criteria, the special problems linked to cases of force majeure as well as exceptional and natural circumstances.
Where, due to natural circumstances, a farmer is unable to fulfil the retention obligations under the sectoral rules, reductions and exclusions should not be applied. (63) In the case where a Member State opts for the application of the slaughter premium, due to the importance of slaughterhouses for the proper functioning of some of the bovine aid schemes, provision should also be made for cases where slaughterhouses, gross negligently or intentionally, issue false certificates or declarations. (64) As far as irregularities are concerned as regards the additional payments provided for in Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the Member States should provide for sanctions which should be equivalent to those provided for in relation to the area and livestock aid schemes unless this is inappropriate.
In this latter case the Member States should provide for suitable equivalent sanctions. (65) Reductions and sanctions should be established as regards dairy premium and additional payments in case a farmer who applies for aid is not complying with its obligation of producing milk. (66) With regard to cross compliance obligations, apart from grading reductions or exclusions in view of the principle of proportionality, it should be provided that as of a certain moment repeated infringements of the same cross compliance obligation should, after a prior warning to the farmer, be treated as an intentional non-compliance. (67) Reductions and exclusions with regard to eligibility criteria should, as a general rule, not apply where the farmer submitted factually correct information or where he can show otherwise that he is not at fault. (68) Farmers who give notice to the competent national authorities at any time of incorrect aid applications should not be subject to any reductions or exclusions irrespective of the reason of the incorrectness, provided that the farmer has not been informed of the competent authority's intention to carry out an on-the-spot check and the authority has not already informed the farmer of any irregularity in the application.
The same should apply in relation to incorrect data contained in the computerised database both in respect of claimed bovine animals for which such irregularities not only constitutes a non-respect of a cross compliance obligation but also a breach of an eligibility-criterion, and in respect of unclaimed bovine animals where such irregularities are relevant only under the cross compliance obligations. (69) The management of small amounts is a burdensome task for the competent authorities of the Member States.
The reductions and exclusions provided for under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to additional sanctions under any other provisions of Community or national law. (71) Where, as a consequence of force majeure or exceptional circumstances, a farmer is not able to fulfil the obligations provided for under the sectoral rules, he should not lose his right to the aid payment.
It should be specified which cases may, in particular, be recognized by the competent authorities as cases of exceptional circumstances. (72) In order to ensure uniform application of the principle of good faith throughout the Community, where amounts unduly paid are recovered, the conditions under which that principle may be invoked should be laid down without prejudice to the treatment of the expenditure concerned in the context of the clearance of accounts under Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(5). (73) Rules should be established laying down the consequences of transfers of entire holdings which are under certain obligations in accordance with the direct payment schemes subject to the integrated system. (74) As a general rule the Member States should take any further measures necessary to ensure a proper functioning of this Regulation.
The Member States should, moreover, inform the Commission of any measures they are taking with regard to the maintenance of land under permanent pasture. (76) Rules have to be established with regard to the basis for the calculation of the reductions to be applied under modulation in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the subsequent allocation key of the financial means thus becoming available, as well as the calculation of the additional amount of aid provided for in Article 12 of that Regulation in order to fix the rules to determine whether the threshold of EUR 5000 referred to in that Article has been reached. (77) The present Regulation should start to apply as of 1 January 2005 .
Article 6 Identification of agricultural parcels 1.The identification system for agricultural parcels referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall operate at reference parcel level such as cadastral parcel, or production block which shall ensure unique identification of each reference parcel.
Article 9 Control system as regards cross-compliance Member States shall establish a system guaranteeing an effective control on the respect of cross-compliance.
That system shall, in accordance with Chapter III of Title III of this Regulation, in particular provide for: (a) where the competent control authority is not the Paying Agency, the transfer of the necessary information concerning the farmers applying for direct payments from the Paying Agency to the specialised control bodies and/or, where applicable, via the coordinating body referred to in Article 23(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; (b) the methods to be applied for the selection of control samples; (c) indications with regard to the nature and extent of the checks to be carried out; (d) control reports containing in particular any detected non-compliance and an assessment of its severity, extent, permanence and repetition; (e) where the competent control authority is not the Paying Agency, the transfer of the control reports from the specialised control bodies either to the Paying Agency or the coordinating body referred to in Article 23(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or both; (f) the application of the system of reductions and exclusions by the Paying Agency.
A farmer who does not apply for aid under any of the area-related aid schemes but applies for aid under another aid scheme listed in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, shall submit a single application form if he has agricultural area as defined in Article 2, point (a) of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 at his disposal in which he shall list these areas in accordance with Article 14.
In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 144 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, it may be allowed to postpone the dates referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in certain zones where exceptional climatic conditions render the normal dates inapplicable.
When submitting the application-form, the farmer shall correct the pre-printed form if any amendments, in particular transfers of payment entitlements in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, have occurred.
However, the minimum size may not exceed 0,3 ha.
Such procedures may consist of a system according to which a farmer may apply for aid in respect of all animals which, at a date to be determined by the Member State, qualify for aid on the basis of the data contained in the computerised database for bovine animals.
CHAPTER III AID APPLICATION FOR THE DAIRY PREMIUM AND THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS Article 17 Requirements pertaining to aid applications for the dairy premium and additional payments Each milk producer applying for the dairy premium and additional payments provided for in Chapter 7 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall submit an aid application containing all information necessary to establish eligibility for the aid, and in particular: (a) the identity of the farmer; (b) a statement by the farmer that he is aware of the conditions pertaining to the aid in question.
Article 19 Adjustments of obvious errors Without prejudice to Articles 11 to 18, an aid application may be adjusted at any time after its submission, in cases of obvious errors recognised by the competent authority.
In that case, the reduction shall be applied on the amount payable for the aid concerned.
In the case where a Member State makes use of the possibilities provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 16(3), that Member State may provide that the notifications to the computerised database for bovine animals of an animal that has left the holding may substitute a withdrawal in writing.
Section II on-the-spot checks sub-Section I Common provisions Article 25 General principles 1.On-the-spot checks shall be unannounced.
Subject to the third subparagraph, in the following cases the Member States shall draw additional control samples of at least: (a) 5 % of all farmers applying for aid for starch potato provided for in Chapter 6 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; (b) 5 % per species of seed for which aid is claimed in accordance with Article 99 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003; (c) 50 % of all farmers applying for aid for nuts provided for in Chapter 4 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 in the case where a Member State makes use of the possibility not to introduce, in accordance with Article 6(3) of this Regulation, an additional layer of GIS information; With regard to all other Member States, in respect of the year 2005, 5 % of all farmers applying for aid for nuts provided for in Chapter 4 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 unless the additional layer of GIS information has already been introduced.
Sub-section II on-the-spot checks of the Single applications with regard to area-related aid schemes Article 29 Elements of the on-the-spot checks On-the-spot checks shall cover all the agricultural parcels for which aid is requested under aid schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, except those related to applications for seed aid in accordance with Article 99 of that Regulation.
In that case, Member States shall carry out on-the-spot checks either: (a) in at least 30 % of all slaughterhouses, selected on the basis of a risk analysis, in which case the controls shall cover a sample of 5 % of the total number of bovine animals which have been slaughtered in the slaughterhouse concerned during the 12 months prior to the on-the-spot check, or (b) in at least 20 % of the slaughterhouses which have been approved beforehand in accordance with particular criteria of reliability to be determined by the Member States and which are selected on the basis of a risk analysis, in which case the controls shall cover a sample of 2 % of the total number of bovine animals which have been slaughtered in the slaughterhouse concerned during the 12 months prior to the on-the-spot check.
Article 38 Special provisions as regards additional payments As regards the additional payments provided for in Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the Member State shall, where appropriate, apply the provisions of this Title.

Article 51 Reductions and exclusions in cases of overdeclaration 1.If, in respect of a crop group, the area declared for the purposes of any area-related aid schemes, except those for starch potato and seed in accordance with Articles 93 and 99 respectively of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, exceeds the area determined in accordance with Article 50(3) to (5) of this Regulation, the aid shall be calculated on the basis of the area determined reduced by twice the difference found if that difference is more than either 3 % or two hectares, but no more than 20 % of the area determined.
That amount shall be off-set against aid payments under any of the aid schemes referred to in Titles III and IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to which the farmer is entitled in the context of applications he lodges in the course of the three calendar years following the calendar year of the finding.
Article 53 Intentional overdeclaration Where differences between the area declared and the area determined in accordance with Article 50(3), (4)(b) and (5) result from irregularities committed intentionally, the aid to which the farmer would have been entitled pursuant to Article 50(3), (4)(b) and (5) shall not be granted for the calendar year in question under the aid scheme concerned.
That amount shall be off-set against aid payments under any of the aid schemes referred to in Titles III and IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to which the farmer is entitled in the context of applications he lodges in the course of the three calendar years following the calendar year of the finding.
Article 19 shall apply in relation to entries in, and notifications to, the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals.
If the percentage established in accordance with paragraph 3 is more than 20 %, the aid to which the farmer would have been entitled pursuant to Article 57(3) shall be refused under those schemes for the premium period concerned.
That amount shall be off-set against aid payments under the bovine aid schemes to which the farmer is entitled in the context of applications he lodges in the course of the three calendar years following the calendar year of the finding.
That amount shall be off-set against aid payments under the bovine aid schemes to which the farmer is entitled in the context of applications he lodges in the course of the three calendar years following the calendar year of the finding.
Article 61 Natural circumstances The reductions and exclusions provided for in Articles 59 and 60 shall not apply in cases where, owing to the impact of natural circumstances on the herd or flock, the farmer cannot meet his commitment to keep the animals in respect of which aid is claimed throughout the retention period, provided that he has informed the competent authority in writing within ten working days of finding any reduction in the number of animals.
Article 62 False certificates and declarations issued by slaughterhouses As regards the declarations or certificates issued by slaughterhouses in connection with the slaughter premium provided for in Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999, if it is found that the slaughterhouse gave a false certification or declaration as a result of serious negligence or intentionally, the Member State concerned shall apply appropriate national sanctions.
Article 63 Findings in relation to additional payments As regards the additional payments provided for in Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States shall provide for reductions and exclusions which shall, in substance, be equivalent to those provided for in this Title.
Where, in the case referred to in Article 30 of Regulation 2237/2003, the person concerned does not take up production by the deadline for the application, the individual reference quantity determined shall be deemed to be zero.

The maximum reduction shall, however, not exceed 15 % of the overall amount referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 69 Amendments and adjustments of entries in the computerised database for bovine animals In respect of claimed bovine animals, Article 68 shall apply from the time the aid application is submitted to errors and omissions in relation to entries in the computerised database for bovine animals.
PART III MODULATION Article 77 Basis for the calculation of the reduction The amount of reduction in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be calculated on the basis of the amounts of direct payments to which farmers are entitled before any reductions or exclusions are applied under this Regulation or, in the case of aid schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 but not falling under Titles III or IV of that Regulation, under the specific legislation applicable thereto.
Article 78 Allocation key The allocation key for the remaining amounts referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be compiled by taking the Member States shares in agricultural area and agricultural employment with a weight of 65 % and 35 %, respectively.
