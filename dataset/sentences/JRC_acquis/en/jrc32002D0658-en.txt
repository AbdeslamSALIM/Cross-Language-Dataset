Commission Decision 98/676/EC(3) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to the Directive. (2) The Netherlands received a similar application in March 1997 from Luxan BV concerning carvone.

This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 98/398/EC(5). (5) The United Kingdom received a similar application in January 1998 from Novartis Crop Protection UK Ltd (now Syngenta) concerning trifloxystrobin.
The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 12 December 2000 for benzoic acid, on 16 October 2000 for carvone, on 12 July 2000 for mepanipyrim, on 20 July 1999 for oxadiargyl, and on 19 September 2000 for trifloxystrobin. (8) It will not be possible to complete the evaluation of the dossiers within the timeframe set by the relevant decisions on completeness, because the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing after submission of the draft assessment reports by the respective rapporteur Member States. (9) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue.
