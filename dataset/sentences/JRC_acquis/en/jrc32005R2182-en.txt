When the total amount of aid claimed exceeds the fixed ceiling, the aid per farmer should be reduced proportionally. (2) Chapter 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 [2] provides for the conditions for receiving seed aid.
In order to avoid this situation a system of advances for seed aid should be introduced. (4) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 [3] defines the rules for the coupled support for cotton, olive oil and raw tobacco. (5) In particular, Chapter 10a of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility of direct aid being granted for the production of cotton.
It is therefore necessary to lay down detailed rules with regard to the granting of that aid. (6) Article10b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 states that, in order to be eligible for the aid per hectare, the farmer must sow the area under cotton with authorised varieties and grow the cotton on land authorised by the Member States.
The Member States’ fixing of the minimum planting density on these lands based on soil and climate conditions and specific regional features must be an objective criterion for establishing whether sowing has been conducted properly or not. (8) Exceeding the national base areas laid down for cotton in Article 110c(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall result in a reduction of the amount of aid to be paid for each eligible hectare.
For that same reason, where a producer belonging to an inter-branch organisation undertakes to supply the cotton he has produced, he can supply it only to the ginning undertaking belonging to that same organisation. (11) In accordance with Article 110e of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the inter-branch organisations may decide to differentiate the aid to which their members are entitled.
The differential scale must make provision for this by fixing the minimum amount of aid per eligible hectare where delivery does not take place. (15) In order to apply the scale, and with a view to simplification, all the parcels belonging to a single producer may be considered as being of the same parcel category producing the same quality cotton. (16) Once it has received the inter-branch organisation’s notification of the aid amounts payable to its producers, the paying agency must undertake the necessary checks and pay out the aid. (17) The scale must be approved by the Member State.
In order to inform the farmers in good time, the Member State must send them this information by a specific date. (19) As the Commission is responsible for monitoring the proper application of the provisions on applying for the specific cotton aid, the Member States should provide it in good time with that same information and with information on the inter-branch organisations. (20) The introduction of the cotton aid scheme provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 makes Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the cotton aid scheme [4] superfluous.
That Regulation should therefore be repealed. (21) Chapter 10b of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility of direct aid being granted for olive groves.
In order to facilitate administrative procedures, provision should be made for derogating measures both as regards the parcels with a minimum size to be determined by the Member States and the olive-growing parcels located within an administrative unit where the Member State has established an alternative system to the olive GIS. (25) For the purpose of paying the olive GIS-ha and in order to inform the farmers in good time, the Member States must first establish at the start of each year an indicative amount of aid per olive GIS-ha for each olive grove category.
In the case of France and Portugal, establishing the information on the parcels concerned must be postponed to a later date in order to take account of the areas planted with olive trees under the programmes approved under Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 of 20 July 1998 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats [5]. (27) In order to allow the Commission to check the correct application of the finalised provisions for paying olive grove aid, the Member States should regularly transmit information on the areas under olive trees qualifying for the aid and on the level of aid to be granted for each olive grove category. (28) Chapter 10c of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility of direct aid being granted for the production of tobacco.
It is therefore necessary to lay down detailed rules with regard to the granting of the aid. (29) For reasons of clarity, it is appropriate to provide for certain definitions. (30) Tobacco varieties should be classified in groups according to the curing method and production costs, taking account of the descriptions used in international trade. (31) Given their role as contracting partner, approval of first processing undertakings authorised to sign cultivation contracts is required.
In order to respect market structures, it should be laid down that a farmer may be a member of one producer association only. (35) Raw tobacco eligible for the aid should be of sound, fair and merchantable quality and free of certain characteristics which prevent normal marketing. (36) Given the particularities of the aid scheme, provision should be made for any disputes to be resolved through joint committees. (37) In order to be able to manage the financial envelope for raw tobacco appropriately, the Member States should fix an indicative aid amount by variety or variety groups early in the harvest year and a final aid amount after all deliveries have been made.
The final aid amount should not exceed the premium level of 2005. (38) To encourage improvement of the quality and value of tobacco production, Member States should be allowed to differentiate the aid amount fixed for each variety or variety group in relation to the quality of the tobacco delivered. (39) Aid should be paid for the quantity of leaf tobacco delivered by farmers to first processors, provided that the minimum quality requirements are fulfilled.
However, the payment of advances to producers of 50 % of the indicative aid amount due should be provided for on condition that an adequate security is lodged. (43) For administrative reasons, aid should, in each Member State, be granted only in respect of products produced on the territory of that Member State.
However, those producers who participated in the programme in 2002 and 2003 will continue to receive payments of the buy-back price until 2007 and 2008, respectively.
At present, the buy-back price is fixed as a percentage of the tobacco premium in a given harvest year.
The current tobacco premium system will no longer exist as from 1 January 2006, wherefore it is necessary to establish, as a transitional measure, a new basis for calculating the future quota buy-back price.
In the interest of continuity it is therefore appropriate to apply the premium level of 2005 as a basis for calculating the buy-back price. (45) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 as regards the premium scheme, production quotas and the specific aid to be granted to producer groups in the raw tobacco sector [6] may be repealed, following the abolition of the guarantee threshold and the premium system provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 [7].
Article 171ab Eligibility requirements Sowing the areas referred to in Article 110b(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be done by achieving a minimum plant density, to be fixed by the Member State on the basis of the soil and weather conditions and specific regional characteristics, where appropriate.
Article 171ad Calculating the amount of aid per eligible hectare 1.
Notwithstanding Article 171ag of this Regulation, in the case of Spain and Portugal, if the area under cotton eligible for the aid payment exceeds the national base area fixed in Article 110c(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the amount of aid laid down in paragraph 2 of that Article shall be multiplied by a reduction coefficient, obtained by dividing the base area by the eligible area. 2.
Notwithstanding Article 171ag of this Regulation, in the case of Greece, if the area under cotton eligible for the aid payment exceeds 300000 hectares, the amount of aid payable per hectare shall be obtained by multiplying EUR 594 by 300000 hectares, adding an additional amount multiplied by the area exceeding 300000 and then dividing that sum by the total area eligible.
The additional amount referred to in the first paragraph shall be: - EUR 342,85 if the eligible area exceeds 300000 but is equal to or less than 370000 hectares, - EUR 342,85 multiplied by a reduction coefficient equal to 70000 divided by the number of eligible hectares exceeding 300000, if the eligible area exceeds 370000 hectares.
Article 171ae Authorisation of inter-branch organisations Before 31 December each year, Member States shall authorise for the following year any inter-branch cotton-producing organisation that applies to plant cotton and which: (a) covers a total area of at least 10000 ha as established by the Member State and meeting the authorisation criteria laid down in Article 171a, and which includes at least one ginning undertaking; (b) conducts clearly identified measure geared in particular towards: - improving the commercial value of the unginned cotton produced, - improving the quality of unginned cotton meeting the ginner’s needs, - using environmentally-sensitive production methods; (c) has adopted internal operating rules, in particular on: - membership conditions and fees, in accordance with national and Community rules and regulations, - where appropriate, a scale differentiating the aid by parcel category, established in particular on the basis of the quality of the unginned cotton to be supplied.
For 2006, however, Member States shall authorise the inter-branch cotton-producing organisations by 28 February 2006.
Article 171af The producers’ obligations 1.
A producer shall not be a member of more than one inter-branch organisation. 2.
A producer who is a member of an inter-branch organisation shall deliver his cotton to a ginner belonging to that same organisation. 3.
Article 171ag Aid differentiation 1.
By including the increase provided for in Article 110f(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the scale referred to in Article 110e of that Regulation (hereinafter the scale) shall establish: (a) the aid amounts per eligible hectare that a member producer is eligible to receive based on the classification of his parcels in the established categories referred to in paragraph 2; (b) the method for each parcel category, in accordance with paragraph 2, of allocating the entire sum reserved for differentiating the aid.
For the purposes of applying point (a) the basic amount shall be at least equal to the non-differentiated part of the eligible aid per hectare laid down in Article 110c(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, adapted, if appropriate, in accordance with paragraph 3 of that Article.
In that case the minimum aid per eligible hectare that the member producer is to receive shall be at least equal to the non-differentiated part of the aid per eligible hectare laid down in Article 110c(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, adapted, if appropriate, in accordance with paragraph 3 of that Article. 2.
In order to apply the scale, all the parcels belonging to a single producer may be considered as being of the same average parcel category and producing the same quality cotton. 3.
Article 171ah Approval and amendment of the scale 1.
Before 31 January, approved inter-branch organisations shall notify the Member State concerned of amendments made to the scale for sowings in the current year.
Article 171ai Communications to the producers and Commission 1.
Before January 31 of the year in question, Member States shall notify cotton growers and the Commission of: (a) the approved varieties; however, varieties approved in accordance with Article 171aa after that date must be notified to the growers before 15 March in the same year; (b) the criteria for approving land; (c) the minimum cotton plant density referred to in Article 171ab; (d) the required agronomic practices. 2.
Where approval for a variety is withdrawn, the Member States shall inform the growers no later than 31 January for the purposes of the following year’s sowing season. 3.
The Member States shall identify the olive groves eligible for the aid laid down in Article 110g of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and shall classify them in a maximum of five categories on the basis of criteria chosen from among the following: (a) environmental criteria: (i) difficulty of access to the parcels; (ii) risk of physical degradation of the land; (iii) olive groves with special features: old trees, cultural value or value for the landscape, sloping land, traditional or rare varieties, or situated in protected natural areas; (b) social criteria: (i) areas with a heavy economic dependence on olive-growing; (ii) areas with a tradition of olive cultivation; (iii) areas with negative economic indicators; (iv) holdings at risk of abandoning olive groves; (v) the size of olive groves on a holding; (vi) areas with special features such a PDO or PGI production, organic or integrated farming. 2.
This information shall be recorded in the olive GIS. 3.

Article 171ba Calculation of areas 1.
The areas shall be declared in olive GIS-ha to two decimal places. 2.
Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the common methodology set out in Annex XXIV shall not apply when: (a) the olive-growing parcel is of a minimum size, to be determined by the Member State but not exceeding 0,1 hectare; (b) the olive-growing parcel is located in an administrative unit that does not appear in the olive-GIS’s graphical reference database.
Article 171bb Amount of aid 1.
The Member States shall establish before 31 January each year the indicative amount of aid per olive GIS-ha for each category of olive grove. 2.
The Member States shall fix, before 31 October of the year in question, the amount of aid per olive GIS-ha for each category of olive grove.
This amount shall be calculated by multiplying the indicative amount referred to in paragraph 1 by a coefficient which corresponds to the maximum amount of aid laid down in Article 110i(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, taking into account, where applicable, the reduction provided for in paragraph 4 of that Article, divided by the sum of the amounts produced by multiplying the indicative aid amount referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, laid down for each category, by the corresponding area. 3.
Member States may apply paragraphs 1 and 2 on a regional basis.
Article 171bc Establishing the basic data 1.
In the case of areas planted with olive trees under new plantation programmes in France and Portugal, approved by the Commission under Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 [9], and recorded in the olive GIS before 1 January 2007, the Member States shall establish the information referred to in paragraph 1, as at 1 January 2006 for parcels planted in 2005 and as at 1 January 2007 for parcels planted in 2006.

If replanting is delayed beyond the date of 20 June, the farmer shall inform the processor and the competent authority of the Member State thereof by registered letter before that date, giving the reason for the delay and giving details of any change of parcel. 5.
Article 171ce Conclusion and registration of contracts 1.
Cultivation contracts shall be concluded, except in cases of force majeure, by 30 April of the harvest year.
Member States may fix an earlier date. 2.
If the deadline for the conclusion of contracts referred to in paragraph 1 or for the submission of cultivation contracts provided for in paragraph 2 is exceeded by a maximum of 15 days, the aid to be paid shall be reduced by 20 %.
Article 171cf Contracts with a producer association 1.
That list shall be submitted for registration to the competent body no later than 15 May of the harvest year. 2.
Article 171ci Aid level In application of Article 110k(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States shall fix the indicative aid amount per kg by tobacco variety or group of varieties before 15 March of the harvest year.
For each variety or group of varieties, the aid level shall not exceed the premium amount by group of varieties fixed for the 2005 harvest by Council Regulation (EC) No 546/2002 [10].
The Member States shall fix the final aid amount per kg by tobacco variety or group of varieties within 15 working days following the day on which all tobacco for the harvest concerned has been delivered.

[10] OJ L 84, 28.3.2002, p. 4." -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX " ANNEX XXIV Common methodology for the calculation of the olive area in olive GIS-ha The common methodology is based on an algorithm [1] which derives the olive area from the position of olive trees using GIS-based automatic processing. 1.
P1 is the radius that originates from an eligible olive tree and defines a circle in which other eligible olive trees must fall to be considered as belonging to the same "olive-growing perimeter".
P1 is set at 20 metres, which corresponds to an agronomic maximum value in most regions.
In certain extensively cultivated regions, to be identified by the Member States, where average planting distances are more than 20 metres, the Member State may decide to fix P1 as twice the regional average planting distance.
Eligible olive trees belonging to olive groves with planting distances greater than P1 are regarded as eligible scattered olive trees.
The internal buffer is defined as the set of points whose distance from the network of lines is less than or equal to a value defined as the "width of internal buffer".
The mean planting distance among eligible olive trees is calculated using the following formula: Mean planting distance δ = AN where A = the area of the group of olive trees and N = the number of olive trees.
The mean planting distance will be calculated by means of successive iterations: - the first mean planting distance δ1 will be calculated using the area (A1) obtained applying only P3 (internal buffer), - a new area A2 will be then calculated using as external buffer δ2 = δ1/2, - An will be obtained in this way, when the difference between An-1 and An is no longer considered significant.
P4 thus becomes: P4 = max [2,5 m; 1/2 δn] where δ n = AN Stage 5: Determination of the surface area Stage 5a : Determination of the Voronoi polygon The external and internal buffers (P3 and P4) are combined to produce the final result.
The output is a graphic layer, from which the olive-growing perimeter and the olive-growing area must be recorded in the olive GIS database.
In this case, at the end of stage 5, the Member States may decide to incorporate into the olive-growing area islands of agricultural land greater than 100 m2 which have not produced any entitlement, during the reference period, to the direct payments listed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, with the exclusion of areas under permanent crops and forests.
If they decide to do this, this provision shall apply to all farmers in the Member State.
The same approach shall apply when calculating the number of eligible hectares under Article 44 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (Use of payment entitlements). 4.
The results of each stage of the algorithm must be recorded for each olive-growing parcel in the olive GIS. "" ANNEX XXV CLASSIFICATION OF TOBACCO VARIETIES as referred to in Article 171ca I.

Beaudesson method 1.
The moisture content is determined by weighing before and after drying, the balance being calibrated in such a way that the reading given by the 10 g quantity used corresponds directly to the moisture content value in %. 2.
Procedure A 10 g quantity is weighted out in a pan with a perforated base and then put into the drying column, where it is supported by a spiral ring.
The oven is turned on for five minutes, during which time the warm air causes the sample to dry at a temperature of about 100 oC.
Brabender method 1.
Homogenisation All the leaves selected are mixed together in a plastic bag and several kilograms of them are chopped up (cutting width 0,4 to 2 mm). 3.
The average moisture content must be a whole number given by rounding down for decimals between 0,01 and 0,49 and rounding up for decimals between 0,50 and 0,99.
