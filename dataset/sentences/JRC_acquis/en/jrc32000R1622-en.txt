A list should be drawn up of the varieties to which such derogations may apply. (7) Pursuant to Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 1493/1999 a list should be drawn up of quality liqueur wines produced in specified regions (quality liqueur wines psr) for which special rules of preparation are allowed.
To simplify administrative procedures, it must therefore be possible to make such notification, except for the first notification in the wine year, by updating records regularly verified by the competent authority. (16) Annex V(F)(1) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 lays down certain rules for the sweetening of wines.
The mixing of wines or grape musts from the same zone, but from different geographical areas within that zone, or from different vine varieties or harvest years should therefore also be regarded as coupage where the description of the resulting product mentions the geographical origin, wine variety or harvest year. (26) Article 42(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 in principle forbids the coupage of white table wine with red table wine but provides for a derogation for areas where that practice was traditional. (27) Under that derogation special detailed rules should be laid down for Spain in line with the structure of the wine-growing sector and consumer attitudes, which change slowly. (28) In order to restrict the coupage of white and red table wines to Spain, where it is necessary, it is vital to ensure that wine produced by this practice cannot be consumed outside that country. (29) The Member States should be allowed to authorise the use, for a limited time for experimental purposes, of oenological practices and processes not provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. (30) Under Article 46(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 methods of analysis must be adopted for establishing the composition of the products covered by Article 1 of that Regulation and rules must be laid down for establishing whether those products have undergone processes contrary to authorised oenological practices. (31) Annex VI(J)(1) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for an analytical test which is at least to measure the factors, among those listed in point (J)(3) of that Annex, enabling the quality wine psr concerned to be distinguished. (32) Uniform methods of analysis must be introduced to ensure that the particulars on documents relating to the products in question are accurate and comparable for verification purposes.
Since the methods described therein are valid, that Regulation should remain in force, with the exception of the usual methods which will ultimately no longer be described. (34) Under Article 80 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 measures may be adopted to facilitate the changeover to the arrangements provided for in this Regulation.
Notwithstanding Article 42(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, grapes of varieties listed in Annex I hereto may be used in the Community to prepare the products covered by that provision.
