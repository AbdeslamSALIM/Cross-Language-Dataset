Council Regulation (EC) No 769/2002 of 7 May 2002 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of coumarin originating in the People's Republic of China Council Regulation (EC) No 769/2002 of 7 May 2002 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of coumarin originating in the People's Republic of China THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 11(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
PRESENT INVESTIGATION 1.
Request for review (2) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry(3) of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of coumarin originating in the People's Republic of China (%quot%country concerned%quot% or %quot%the PRC%quot%), the Commission has received a request for review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (%quot%the basic Regulation%quot%). (3) The request was lodged on 4 January 2001 by the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) (%quot%the applicant%quot%) on behalf of the sole producer in the Community representing the totality of the Community production of coumarin. (4) The request for an expiry review was based on the grounds that injurious dumping of imports originating in the PRC would be likely to continue or to recur if measures were allowed to expire. 2.
Period of investigation (6) The investigation period (%quot%IP%quot%) for the examination of continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2000.
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of continuation or recurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 1996 up to the end of the IP (%quot%period under review%quot%). 4.
The standard quality coumarin marketed in the Community has a melting point varying between 68 째C and 70 째C which corresponds to 99 % purity. (13) The product concerned falls within CN code ex 2932 21 00. 2.
Accordingly, normal value was determined on the basis of information obtained in a market economy third country (the %quot%analogue country%quot%). (19) The United States had served as an analogue country in the original investigation.
The dumping margin found was substantial and just below the level found in the original investigation (around 50 %). (26) The investigation did not reveal any reason why this dumping would disappear if the measures were to be repealed.
The information shows that the Chinese production capacity is about 1900 tonnes (representing 40 % of the world wide capacity with seven producers, and 18 potential producers ready to re-enter in the markets.
This is much larger than the entire EC consumption of 700 tonnes. (30) Consequently, the enormous availability of unused production capacity (between 50 % and 60 % of production capacity) gives Chinese exporting producers a very high degree of flexibility in the production process.
The USA duties range from 31,02 % to 160,80 %. (33) This shows that there is pressure on Chinese exporting producers to find alternative export markets.
This is demonstrated by the low prices found for Chinese exports to other main third country markets. (38) In summary, it is most probable that imports to the Community from the PRC will resume in significant quantities and at significantly dumped prices, should measures be repealed.
These imports represented a minor part of the total sales volume by the producer in the Community.
Community consumption(5) (41) Community consumption was established on the basis of the sales volumes of the Community industry on the Community market as reported in the questionnaire reply, the import volumes into the Community from the country concerned and all other third countries, on the basis of Eurostat. (42) On this basis, the apparent consumption of coumarin increased by 92 % during the period under review.
The most significant increase took place between 1996 and 1997, i.e. + 82 %.
However, this should be seen in the light of large volumes of coumarin which were imported, mainly from the PRC, in 1994 and 1995, i.e.
In 1997, total import volumes went back to a level comparable with the one in 1993. 2.
A significant increase took place between 1996 and 1997.
The increase is due to an upgrade of the existing installation made in 1999. (48) Capacity utilisation increased by 56 % between 1996 and the IP.
It trebled between 1996 and the IP.
The sales increase was most remarkable between 1996 and 1997 even though the sales steadily increased between 1997 and the IP.
However, as already explained under recital 42, the demand on the Community market was particularly low in 1996, thus distorting the comparison.
Taking 1997 as a basis of comparison, the increase of the sales volume of the Community industry between 1997 and the IP is 41 %.
This increase was especially marked between 1996 and 1998 when market share gained 20 percentage points.
The fall was particularly marked between 1996 and 1997 and then between the 1999 and the IP. (53) This can be explained partly by the price level of the Chinese products which, as already mentioned under recital 45, remained below the average cif prices of all other imports during the period under review.
The productivity of the Community industry's workforce, measured as production volume per person employed, markedly increased during the same period, improving by more than 80 %.
Likelihood of recurrence of injury (63) With regard to the likely effect on the Community industry of the expiry of the measures in force, the following factors were considered, in line with the elements summarised in recitals 35 to 38. (64) There are clear indications that imports originating in the PRC will continue at dumped prices.
Indeed, the strong decrease of the Chinese exports to the Community market between 1995 and 1999 (363 tonnes) was only compensated by an increase of Chinese exports to other third countries of around 100 tonnes. (68) In addition, as the Community market and the US market stand for around 50 % of the world consumption of coumarin and given that the USA have imposed anti-dumping measures on imports of coumarin from the PRC, it is very likely that, should the measures be repealed, the Community market would be attractive for exporters from the PRC. (69) One importers' association argued that the existence of capacity in the PRC does not imply in itself likely recurrence of injury. (70) In relation to this particular point, it is recalled that this investigation should evaluate the likelihood of recurrence of dumping and injury in case the measures are removed.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 1.
Introduction (72) According to Article 21 of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether a prolongation of the existing anti-dumping measures would be against the interest of the Community as a whole.
Furthermore, the fact that the present investigation is a review, thus analysing a situation in which anti-dumping measures have already been in place, would allow the assessment of any undue negative impact on the parties concerned by the current anti-dumping measures. (74) On this basis it was examined whether, despite the conclusions on the likelihood of a recurrence of injurious dumping, compelling reasons existed which would lead to the conclusion that it is not in the Community interest to maintain measures in this particular case. 2.
Interest of the Community industry (75) It is considered that, should the anti-dumping measures imposed in the previous investigation be repealed, injurious dumping is likely to recur and that the situation of the Community industry, which improved during the period under review, would deteriorate. 3.
Interest of importers (76) From the 26 questionnaires sent, only one reply was received by the Commission services from an importers' association. (77) This association argued that the anti-dumping measures led to the exclusion of both the Chinese and other third country's producers from the Community market, thus leading to a dependence of the users on the sole Community producer. (78) First of all, it should be recalled that the coumarin world market is very concentrated with only a few producers the most important of whom, in terms of capacity, are located in China and in the Community.
In addition, it should be noted that, during the IP, around 25 % of all imports of coumarin was imported from countries other than China, notably from Japan and India, thus showing that alternative sources of supply continue to exist.
Interest of users (79) Questionnaires and/or information were received from five users (out of the 23 questionnaires sent). (80) One of these companies is clearly in favour of the continuation of the measures while another does not expect any change for its business should the measures be removed or maintained.
ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES (90) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the maintenance of the existing anti-dumping duty in respect of imports of coumarin originating in the PRC.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of coumarin falling within CN code ex 2932 21 00 (TARIC code 2932 21 00 10 ) originating in the People's Republic of China. 2.
The rate of the duty is set at EUR 3479 per tonne.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
