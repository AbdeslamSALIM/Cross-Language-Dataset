In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. (2) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 provides that, in so far as it is necessary to take account of the particular features of the production of certain spirituous beverages obtained from cereals, the criteria for granting export refunds may be adapted to this particular situation.
The first day of each fiscal distillation period may also be the operative event for the agricultural conversion rate pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98. (8) It is necessary for the purposes of this Regulation to record that the products have left the Community and in certain cases to identify their destination as well.
This Regulation lays down detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds for cereals exported in the form of spirit drinks as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and for which a compulsory ageing period of at least three years is part of the manufacturing process. 2.
Article 2 The refunds referred to in Article 1 may be granted for cereals meeting the conditions laid down in Article 23(2) of the Treaty and used in the production of the spirit drinks falling within CN codes 22083032, 22083038, 22083052, 22083058, 22083072, 22083078, 22083082 and 22083088 manufactured in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 [9].
Article 3 For the purposes of this Regulation: (a) %quot%given distillation period%quot% means a period corresponding to a distillation period agreed between the beneficiary and the customs authorities or other competent authorities for the purposes of checks on excise duty (fiscal period); (b) %quot%total quantities exported%quot% means the quantities of spirit drinks fulfilling the terms of Article 23(2) of the Treaty and exported to a destination for which the refund applies; (c) %quot%total quantities marketed%quot% means the quantities of spirit drinks fulfilling the terms of Article 23(2) of the Treaty which have been finally dispatched from production or storage facilities with a view to their sale for human consumption; (d) %quot%placed under control%quot% means the placing under a customs control procedure, or under an administrative procedure offering equivalent assurances, of cereals intended for the manufacture of the spirit drinks referred to in Article 2.
Article 5 The coefficient referred to in Article 4(1) shall be fixed before 1 July each year.
It shall apply from 1 October until 30 September of the following year.
The coefficient shall be fixed in accordance with information supplied by the Member States on the period 1 January to 31 December of the years preceding the year of fixing.
The rate of the refund applicable shall be that fixed in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005. 2.
Article 8 For the purposes of this Regulation, cereals may be replaced by malt.
In that case the coefficient for calculating the barley equivalent of malt shall be 1,30.
However, where the malt that is placed under control is green malt with a moisture content of between 43 % and 47 %, the coefficient for calculating the equivalent weight of malt with a moisture content of 7 % shall be 0,57.
Only distillers established in the Community shall be entitled to the refund. 2.
This declaration shall be certified by the authorities carrying out the placing under control. 4.
The weight of cereals to be taken into consideration for calculation of the payment shall be the net weight, if the moisture content is not more than 15 %.
If the moisture content of the cereals used is more than 15 % but not more than 16 %, the weight to be taken into consideration shall be the net weight reduced by 1 %.
If the moisture content of the cereals used is more than 16 % but not more than 17 %, the reduction shall be 2 %.
If the moisture content of the cereals used is more than 17 % the reduction shall be two percentage points for each percentage point of moisture above 15 %.
The weight of malt other than green malt, as referred to in Article 8, which is to be taken into consideration for calculation of the payment shall be the net weight, if the moisture is not more than 7 %.
If the moisture content of the malt used is more than 7 % but not more than 8 %, the weight to be taken into consideration shall be the net weight reduced by 1 %.
If the moisture content of the malt used is more than 8 % the reduction shall be two percentage points for each percentage point of moisture above 7 %.
The Community reference method for determining the moisture content of cereals and malt intended for production of the spirit drinks referred to in this Regulation shall be that shown in Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 [10].
The refund shall be paid by the Member State in which the declarations referred to in Article 9 are accepted. 2.
For the purposes of this Regulation, %quot%export%quot% means: (a) export within the meaning of Articles 161 and 162 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92; and (b) deliveries to destinations covered by Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. 4.
Products having been placed in a victualling warehouse approved pursuant to Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 shall also be considered to have been exported.
When products have been placed in such warehouses, Articles 40 to 43 of the abovementioned Regulation shall apply mutatis mutandis.
For a quantity of a spirit drink to be deemed to have been exported, the proof referred to in Article 13 must be submitted to the designated authorities within six months of the date on which the customs export formalities are completed. 2.
In that event, the proof of importation into a third country in respect of which the refund applies shall be the proof provided for in Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.
The Member States concerned shall provide the Commission with the following information before 16 July each year: (a) the quantities of cereals and malt fulfilling the terms of Article 23(2) of the Treaty and distilled in the period from 1 January to 31 December of the preceding year, broken down in accordance with the combined nomenclature; (b) the quantities of cereals and malt, broken down in accordance with the combined nomenclature, which were the subject of inward processing arrangements during the same period; (c) the quantities of spirit drinks covered by Article 2, broken down in accordance with the categories given in Article 19, including both quantities exported and quantities marketed during the same period; (d) the quantities of spirit drinks produced under inward processing arrangements and exported to third countries during the same period, broken down in accordance with the categories given in Article 19; (e) the quantities of spirit drinks in store on 31 December of the preceding year and the quantities produced during that period. 3.
