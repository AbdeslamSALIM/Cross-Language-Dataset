Measures in force (1) In January 1995, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 95/95 [2], imposed definitive anti dumping measures in the form of a specific duty on imports of furfuraldehyde originating in the People's Republic of China ("PRC").
The two producers represent 100 % of the Community production of furfuraldehyde.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: (a) Producer in the analogue country - Indunor SA, Buenos Aires, Argentina (b) Community producer - Furfural Espanol SA, Alcantarilla, Spain (c) Unrelated importer - International Furan Chemicals B.V., Rotterdam, Netherlands . (9) The investigation regarding the continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003 ("IP").
The examination of the trends relevant for the assessment of a likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of injury covered the period from 1 January 2000 up to the end of the IP ("period considered").
LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUATION OF DUMPING (13) In accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether dumping was currently taking place and, if so, whether or not the expiry of the measures would be likely to lead to a continuation of dumping. 1.
Preliminary remarks (14) Of the 24 Chinese exporting producers named in the complaint, none cooperated with the investigation and no information was submitted by any of these companies.
In this respect, it is noted that Eurostat shows only imports for inward processing during the IP. 2.
The investigation showed that Argentina has a competitive market for furfuraldehyde with around 72 % of the market supplied by local production and the rest by imports from third countries.
The production volume in Argentina constitutes more than 60 % of the volume of Chinese exports of the product concerned to the Community for inward processing.
The Argentinean market was therefore deemed sufficiently representative for the determination of normal value for the PRC. (18) It is therefore concluded, as in the original investigation, that Argentina constitutes an appropriate analogue country in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. 3.
Comparison (22) For the purposes of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, and in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made with regard to certain differences in transport and insurance, which affected prices and price comparability. 6.
It is reasonable to assume that a repeal of the measures would result in a resumption of exports from the PRC to the Community outside the inward processing arrangements.
Moreover, it is also noted that Chinese export prices under inward processing were undercutting the Community producers' prices by 44 % in the IP and that even if they did not undercut Community prices, they would still be dumped. 8.
During the IP, the two producers represented 100 % of the Community production of furfuraldehyde.
Community consumption Table 1 Community consumption | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Tonnes | 38699 | 45005 | 38007 | 41513 | Index | 100 | 116 | 98 | 107 | Y/Y trend | | 16 | – 16 | 9 | (32) Community consumption was based on the combined volume of sales made by the Community industry in the Community and imports from the PRC made under inward processing and imports from other third countries.
Between 2000 and the IP, Community consumption of furfuraldehyde increased by 9 %.
The production and sales of furfuryl alcohol increased in 2001, but decreased significantly in 2002 and, as a result, consumption of furfuraldehyde dropped accordingly.
In the IP, sales and production of furfuryl alcohol recovered as well as consumption of furfuraldehyde. 2.
Imports from the PRC (a) Volume, market share and prices (33) Based on information from Eurostat, imports from the PRC were made since 2001 only under inward processing arrangements.
This practice had already started in 2000, when around 75 % of Chinese imports were under inward processing.
The volumes imported from the PRC increased from 3198 tonnes to 5167 tonnes during the period considered, which is an increase of 61,6 % between 2000 and the IP.
The market share of these Chinese imports increased over the period considered from 8,2 % to 12,4 %.
The average price of the Chinese imports declined from EUR 648,68 per ton in 2000 to EUR 508,65 per ton in the IP, which is a decline of 21,6 % during the period considered.

Economic situation of the Community industry (a) Production Table 3 Community production | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index | 100 | 94 | 87 | 85 | Y/Y trend | | – 5,8 | – 7,3 | – 2,2 | (34) The Community industry's production decreased every year during the period considered, being 15 % lower in the IP than in 2000.
The biggest decline in the Community producer's market share was between 2000 and 2001.
The Community industry's sales of furfuraldehyde decreased as well in 2002.
As a result, the Community industry's market share decreased. (f) Stocks Table 9 Stocks | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index | 100 | 103 | 128 | 122 | Y/Y trend | | 3,5 | 23,3 | – 4,1 | (40) The above table shows that the stocks of the Community industry increased by 22 % during the period considered.
The other Community producer obtains furfuraldehyde as a by-product when producing pulp viscose, while the applicant uses almond shells as a principal raw material in the furfuraldehyde production.
The price of almond shells increased drastically between 2000 and 2002 (by 51 %), worsening significantly the profit margin of the applicant, while the raw material cost of the other Community producer increased only modestly.
The attempt to compensate the higher raw material costs by increased sales prices of furfuraldehyde resulted in reduced sales. (h) Cash flow Table 11 Cash flow | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index | 100 | 141 | 104 | 107 | Y/Y trend | | 41,1 | – 26,0 | 2,5 | (42) Cash flow followed a similar trend as profitability, increasing significantly between 2000 and 2001, but worsening in the following years.
The investments of the applicant fell by 80 % during the period considered.
The investigation showed that the operating return on investments deteriorated in line with the development of profitability during the period considered.
Table 13 Return on investments and ability to raise capital | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index | 100 | 207 | 38 | 34 | Y/Y trend | | 107,4 | – 81,7 | – 11,0 | (44) The return on investment figures in the table above shows only the development of the applicant.
Effect of other factors (a) Prices of raw materials (50) The considerable rise in the price of the raw material used by the applicant in 2001 and 2002 had naturally a negative impact on its profitability in these years.
one to two tonnes per year.
Imports from South Africa, the second biggest exporting country, decreased during the period considered by 11 %.
Production, production capacity and sales have decreased, as well as sales prices and the market share of the Community industry.
Investments, return on investment and employment have also decreased, whereas the stocks have increased, in particular between 2001 and 2002, in line with decreased sales and market share.
Under these circumstances, and in particular also the fact that imports from the PRC were made only under inward processing, a situation of continuation of injury caused by dumped imports could not be established.
LIKELIHOOD OF RECURRENCE OF INJURY (55) It is recalled that in recitals (29) and (30) it was concluded that the expiry of the measures would be likely to lead to a significant increase of dumped exports from the PRC to the Community. (56) Indeed, the volume of dumped imports under inward processing considerably increased during the period considered.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 1.
Preliminary remark (60) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation it was examined whether a prolongation of the existing anti-dumping measures would be against the interest of the Community as a whole.
Furthermore, the present investigation is an expiry review, thus analysing a situation in which anti-dumping measures are in place. (62) On this basis it was examined whether, despite the conclusion that there exists a likelihood of continuation of dumping and recurrence of injury, there are compelling reasons which would lead to the conclusion that it is not in the Community interest to maintain measures in this particular case. 2.
Interest of users (66) The Commission sent out questionnaires to 16 industrial users of furfuraldehyde.
The amount of duty applicable is EUR 352 per tonne. 3.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
