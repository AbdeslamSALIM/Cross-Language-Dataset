Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC. (5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1436/98 [3].
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.
Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit. (6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1411/1999 [4].
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.
Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit. (7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74 252) was provisionally authorised for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 937/2001 [5] and for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2188/2002 [6] and was authorised without a time-limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004 [7] and for turkey for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005 [8].
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied.
Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised for four years. (8) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation of the use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 529.94) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 526.94) for chickens for fattening and for turkeys for fattening.
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied.
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.
The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied.
Article 2 The preparations belonging to the group "Enzymes", as specified in Annex II, are authorised for use for four years as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.
Article 3 The preparations belonging to the group "Micro-organisms", as specified in Annex III, are authorised for use without a time-limit as additives in animal nutrition under the conditions laid down in that Annex.
