ANNEX %quot%ANNEX B TUBERCULOSIS 1.
IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENT The presence of Mycobacterium bovis (M.
Standards for tuberculin (bovine and avian) 2.1.1.
avium (as appropiate) grown in a liquid synthetic medium.
Identification of the product Inject a range of graded doses intradermally at different sites into suitably sensitised albino guinea-pigs, each weighing not less than 250 g.
After 24 h to 28 h, reactions appear in the form of oedematous swellings with erythema with or without necrosis at the points of injection.
pH: The pH is 6.5 to 7.5. 2.1.4.2.
Phenol: If the preparation to be examined contains phenol, its concentration is not more than 5 g/l. 2.1.4.3.
Toxicity: Use two guinea-pigs, each weighing not less than 250 g and which have not previously been treated with any material which will interfere with the test.
To test the potency, sensitise not fewer than nine albino guinea-pigs, each weighing 400 g to 600 g, by the deep intramuscular injection of 0,0001 mg of wet mass of living M.
bovis of strain AN5 suspended in 0.5 ml of a 9 g/l solution of sodium chloride R for bovine tuberculin, or a suitable dose of inactivated or live M.
Prepare dilutions of the preparation to be examined and of the reference preparation using isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (pH 6,5-7,5) containing 0,005 g/l of polysorbate 80 R.
Choose the doses such that the lesions produced have a diameter of not less than 8 mm and not more than 25 mm.
Inject each dose intradermally in a constant volume of 0,1 ml or 0,2 ml.
Measure the diameters of the lesions after 24 to 28 hours and calculate the result of the test using the usual statistical methods and assuming that the diameters of the lesions are directly proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the tuberculins.
The test is not valid unless the fiducial limits of error (P = 0,95) are not less than 50 % and not more then 200 % of the estimated potency.
The estimated potency is not less than 66 % and not more than 150 % of the stated potency for bovine tuberculin.
The estimated potency is not less than 75 % and not more than 133 % of the stated potency for avian tuberculin.
The stated potency is not less than 20000 IU/ml for both tuberculins (bovine and avian). 2.1.6.
Test procedures 2.2.1.
The dose of tuberculin injected shall be: - not less than 2000 IU of bovine tuberculin, - not less than 2000 IU of avian tuberculin. 2.2.3.
The volume of each injection dose shall not exceed 0,2 ml. 2.2.4.
When both avian and bovine tuberculins are injected in the same animal, the site for injection of avian tuberculins shall be about 10 cm from the crest of the neck and the site for the injection of bovine tuberculin about 12,5 cm lower on a line roughly parallel with the line of the shoulder or on different sides of the neck; in young animals in which there is not room to separate the sites sufficiently on one side of the neck, one injection shall be made on each side of the neck at identical sites in the centre of the middle third of the neck. 2.2.5.
The skin-fold thickness of each injection site shall be remeasured 72 hours (Â± 4 hours) after injection and recorded. 2.2.5.2.
Animals inconclusive to the single intradermal test shall be subjected to another test after a minimum of 42 days.
Animals inconclusive to the intradermal comparative test shall be subjected to another test after a minimum of 42 days.
Where animals are required by Community legislation to be subjected to an intradermal test prior to movement, the test shall be interpreted so that no animal which shows an increase in skin-fold thickness greater than 2 mm or the presence of clinical signs is entered into intra-Community trade. 2.2.5.3.5.
Tasks and responsibilities The State Institutes and Reference Laboratories included in paragraph 3.2 shall be responsible for the official testing of tuberculins or reagents included in paragraph 2 and 3 in their respective States to ensure each of these tuberculins or reagents are adequate in relation to the standards above referred. 4.2.
