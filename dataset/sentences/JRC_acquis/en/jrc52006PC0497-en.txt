Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 4.
Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the north-east Atlantic[7] has been substantially amended several times[8].
The data to be submitted shall be the nominal catches of each of the species listed in Annex I in each of the statistical fishing regions listed in Annex II and defined in Annex III. 2.
Article 3 Except where provisions adopted under the common fisheries policy dictate otherwise, a Member State shall be permitted to use sampling techniques to derive catch data for those parts of the fishing fleet for which the complete coverage of the data would involve the excessive application of administrative procedures.
Article 4 Member States shall fulfil their obligations to the Commission pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 by submitting the data on magnetic medium, the format of which is given in Annex IV. ê 1637/2001 Art. 2 Member States may submit data following that in the format detailed in Annex V. ê 3880/91 With the prior approval of Eurostat, Member States may submit data in a different form or on a different medium. ê 1882/2003 Art. 1 and Annex I pt. 4 (adapted) Article 5 1.
