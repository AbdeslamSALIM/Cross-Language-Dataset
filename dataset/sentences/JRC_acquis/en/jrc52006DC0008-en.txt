Report from the Commission based on Article 34 of the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (revised version) {SEC(2006)79} /* COM/2006/0008 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 24.1.2006 COM(2006)8 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION based on Article 34 of the Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (revised version) {SEC(2006)79} 1.
A second report, planned for June 2006, will update the evaluation for all the Member States in the light of the conclusions of the JHA Council of 2 June 2005.
A surrender procedure between the Member States that is now basically judicial 2.1.1.
However, only half complied with the time limit laid down (BE, DK, ES, IE, CY, LT, HU, PL, PT, SI, FI, SE, UK).
The delay, which lasted up to 16 months (IT), caused temporary difficulties.
Nevertheless, at 22 April 2005, the date of adoption of the Italian law, all the Member States had transposed the Framework Decision.
As regards the former aspect, some did so in accordance with the Framework Decision, once this had been adopted, in particular by ruling out the warrant's application to acts that occurred before a given date (Article 32: FR, IT, AT).
Others, however, wanted to make such a limitation without complying with the Framework Decision, whether with regard to procedure (Article 32: CZ, LU, SI), the substance of the limitation (CZ, LU) or even the effective date (CZ).
This is attested to, for example, by the fact that the large majority of Member States authorises direct contact between judicial authorities , at the different stages of the procedure (Articles 9(1), 15 and 23).
However, certain Member States have designated an executive body as the competent judicial authority for all aspects (Article 6: DK) or some (EE, LV, LT, FI, SE).
A more effective, faster procedure which respects fundamental guarantees 2.2.1.
All Member States have transposed the three mandatory grounds , with a few exceptions (Article 3(1): NL, UK) or deficiencies (Article 3(1): DK, IE; Article 3(2): IE, UK).
The additional ground of refusal based on ne bis in idem in relation to the International Criminal Court, which enables certain Member States to fill a gap in the Framework Decision, is not an issue here.
The same applies to the explicit grounds of refusal for violation of fundamental rights (Article 1(3)) or discrimination (recitals 12 and 13), which two thirds of the Member States have chosen to introduce expressly in various forms.
However legitimate they may be, even if they do exceed the Framework Decision (EL, IE, IT, CY), these grounds should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances within the Union.
This does not include those frequent cases where the person consents to his surrender, for which the average time taken is 13 days.
A difficulty in this respect is that the Framework Decision does not provide for making an Interpol alert equivalent to a request for provisional arrest, unlike an SIS alert (Article 9(3)).
Member States' requirements vary considerably in detail as to the time limits for the receipt of warrants following an arrest (from 2 to 40 days), translations (from a single language accepted to more than four) and means of authentification (from the requirement for the original only to a simple fax).
More specifically, some Member States impose requirements not provided for in the Framework Decision, such as the obligation to attach items or documents not stipulated on the form (Article 8(1): CZ, IT, MT) or to issue a separate warrant for each offence (IE).
Unlike the extradition procedure, the execution of the arrest warrant is subject to precise time limits (Articles 17 and 23).
However, in the event of an appeal, some Member States have not agreed to put a time limit on their higher courts (CZ, MT, PT, SK, UK), or have set a maximum period for the proceedings which could exceed the norm of 60 days (BE) or even the ceiling of 90 days in the event of final appeal (FR, IT).
Surrenders consented to in accordance with the fundamental guarantees for the individual Although more efficient and faster than the extradition procedure, the arrest warrant is still subject to full compliance with the guarantees for the individual.
Contrary to what certain Member States have done, the Council did not intend to make the general condition of respect for fundamental rights an explicit ground for refusal in the event of infringement.
A judicial authority is, of course, always entitled to refuse to execute an arrest warrant, if it finds that the proceedings have been vitiated by infringement of Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and the constitutional principles common to the Member States; in a system based on mutual trust, such a situation should remain exceptional.
There are still some shortcomings, however, in particular concerning procedural vagueness (Article 13: DK, LV, PL, PT ; Article 14: DK).
The Framework Decision is more precise as regards ne bis in idem .
Through its effectiveness, in particular in obtaining the surrender of nationals of other Member States, it makes it easier to decide to release individuals provisionally irrespective of where they reside in the European Union (Article 12). 3.
This overall success should not make one lose sight of the effort that is still required for certain Member States (in particular CZ, DK, EE, IE, IT, LU, MT, NL, SI, UK) to comply fully with the Framework Decision and for the Union to fill certain gaps in the system.
The Commission accordingly reserves the right to present proposals for amending the Framework Decision (Article 34(3)) in the light of further experience. [1] OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1.
