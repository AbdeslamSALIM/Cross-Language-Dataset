For the Commission Richard BURKE Member of the Commission (1)OJ No L 262, 27.9.1976, p. 169. (2)OJ No L 192, 31.7.1979, p. 35.
These products are defined in Article 2 of Council Directive 75/324/EEC of 20 May 1975 (1). 5.2.
First weigh exactly into the transfer bottle 5 to 10 g of 2-methoxyethanol.
If the degassing operation gives rise to foaming, use a transfer bottle into which an exactly-weighed quantity (5 to 10 g) of 2-methoxyethanol has previously been introduced with a syringe through the connector, - complete the removal of the volatile constituents without loss by shaking in a waterbath maintained at 40 ºC.
Formulas for the calculation are: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013988%quot%%gt% where: m1 = mass of aerosol taken into the transfer bottle; m2 = mass of residue after heating at 40 ºC; r = percentage of the particular substance in m2 (determined according to the appropriate method); R = percentage of the particular substance in the aerosol as received; Q = total mass of the particular substance in the aerosol dispenser; P = net mass of initial aerosol dispenser (basic sample). 5.4.2.
Standard alkaline buffer solution pH 9 718 at 25 ºC : 0 705 M sodium tetraborate decahydrate. 4.2.
If the pH is 12 or over a quantitative determination must be carried out. 5.
Standard 0 71 N hydrochloric acid 5.1.2.
Where the first point of inflection occurs at a pH below 7 the sample is free of sodium or potassium hydroxide.
The content of sodium and/or potassium hydroxides in the sample expressed as % m/m of sodium hydroxide is calculated using the formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013993%quot%%gt% The situation may arise in which, despite indications of the presence of a significant quantity of sodium and/or potassium hydroxides, the titration curve fails to show a distinct point of inflection.
In such a case the determination should be repeated in isopropanol. 5.2.

Weigh out 6 to 7 g of the sample into a 50-ml beaker, bring the pH to 3 with dilute hydrochloric acid (4.9) and wash into a separating funnel with 100 ml of distilled water.
Check that precipitation is complete by adding a few drops of calcium chloride solution (4.2), allow to cool to room temperature and then stir in 200 ml of ethanol (4.3) ; (5.10) leave to stand for 30 minutes. 6.6.
Wash the precipitate five times with a little ethanol (4.3) and then five time with a little diethyl ether (4.5) and dissolve the precipitate in 50 ml of hot sulphuric acid (4.8) by drawing the latter through the filter crucible under reduced pressure. 6.8.
CALCULATION The content of the sample expressed as oxalic acid percentage by mass is calculated from the formula %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013994%quot%%gt% in which: A is the consumption of 0 71 N potassium permanganate measured in accordance with 6.8; E is the test quantity of sample in grams (6.1); 4 750179 is the conversion factor for oxalic acid. 8.

Shake for half an hour with a mechanical shaker and centrifuge the closed tube for 15 minutes, at such a speed as to produce a clear separation of the phases.
Determine the area of the acetonitrile and chloroform peaks in the chromatograms obtained in accordance with section 6.3.5 and calculate the relative response fs with the aid of the following formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013997%quot%%gt% in which: fs = the relative response factor for chloroform; As = the area of the chloroform peak (6.3.5); Ai = the area of the acetonitrile peak (6.3.5); Ms = the quantity of chloroform in mg per 10 ml of the solution referred to in section 6.3.5 (= M1); Mi = the quantity of acetonitrile in mg per 10 ml of the solution referred to in section 6.3.5 (= 1/10 M).
Calculate the chloroform content in the toothpaste with the aid of the following formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013998%quot%%gt% in which: % X = the chloroform content of the toothpaste expressed by mass; As = the area of the chloroform peak (6.3.4); Ai = the area of the acetonitrile peak (6.3.4); Msx = the mass in mg of the sample referred to in section 6.3.1 (= 1 000.Mo) Mi = the quantity of acetonitrile in mg per 10 ml of the solution obtained in accordance with section 6.3.2 (1/10 M).
