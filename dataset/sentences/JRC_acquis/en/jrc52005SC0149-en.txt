Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Estonia, 2004-2008 /* SEC/2005/0149 final */ Brussels, 2.2.2005 SEC(2005) 149 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Estonia, 2004-2008 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that non-participating Member States, that is, those which have not adopted the single currency, have to submit convergence programmes to the Council and the Commission.
In accordance with Article 9 of this Regulation, the Council has to examine each convergence programme based on assessments prepared by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty (the Economic and Financial Committee).
The Member States that joined the EU on 1 May 2004 do not participate in the single currency, but are required to fulfil in due time the convergence criteria, including the one on the sustainability of the government financial position, in order to qualify for the adoption of the euro.
The Member States which joined the EU on 1 May 2004 committed themselves to submitting their convergence programmes by 15 May 2004 and a first update thereof towards the end of 2004.
The first convergence programme of Estonia, covering the period 2004-2008, was submitted on 1 May 2004 and assessed by the Council on 5 July 2004.
Estonia submitted an update of its convergence programme on 1 December 2004.
The programme complies with the “code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes”. - The macroeconomic scenario as presented in the programme envisages real GDP growth of 5.6% in 2004.
This is somewhat lower than the Commission services autumn 2004 forecast for the years 2004-2006, which projects growth rates of 5.9% in 2004, 6% in 2005 and 6.2% in 2006.
Although the programme projects a sustainable narrowing of the external deficit through structural improvements on the trade balance, present trends and less than reliable trade data plead in favour of caution. - On 28 June 2004, Estonia joined ERM II with a standard fluctuation band, while maintaining a unilateral commitment to the present currency board system.
The higher-than-projected budget surplus in 2004 is in line with the recommendation to avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies.
The macro-economic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth to pick up from 5.6% in 2004 to 6.0% on average over the rest of the programme period.
The debt ratio is estimated at 4.8% of GDP in 2004, well below the 60% of GDP Treaty reference value and indeed the lowest in the EU.
The programme projects the debt ratio to further decline by 1.9 percentage points over the programme period.
The higher-than-projected budget surplus in 2004 is in line with the recommendation to avoid pro-cyclical fiscal policies.
