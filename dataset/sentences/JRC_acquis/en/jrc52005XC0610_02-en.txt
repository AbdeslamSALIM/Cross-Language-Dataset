SUMMARY In January 2004 the Commission was informed of investments which possibly concerned illegal State aid by Shetland Leasing and Property Ltd (SLAP), a commercial limited company operating for profit which is wholly owned and funded by Charitable Trust, a trust fund of the Shetland Islands Council (SIC).
In 1999 SLAP invested in a company named Shetland Seafish Ltd.
By setting up of Shetland Seafish Ltd it was expected that profits would grow and that the new company by the end of 2002 would be generating profit.
Public investments are considered to be State aid in the sense of Article 87 of the EC-Treaty if the investments are investments which could not have been decided by a private investor under normal market conditions.
In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, all unlawful aid can be subject to recovery from the recipient.
TEXT OF LETTER "(1) The Commission wishes to inform the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that, having examined the information supplied by your authorities on the aid/measure referred to above, it has decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. 1.
All such interested parties will be invited to submit their comments within one month of the date of such publication."
