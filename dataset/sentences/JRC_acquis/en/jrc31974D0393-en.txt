Article 3 The main purpose of the consultations provided for in Article 2 shall be: (a) to ensure that the agreements, commitments and measures referred to in Article 1 are consistent with common policies and in particular the common commercial policy; (b) to facilitate the exchange of information and views in order to identify problems of common interest and, in view of these, to encourage coordination, where appropriate, of the activities of the Member States with regard to the third countries concerned; (c) to examine the advisability of unilateral measures which could be taken by the Community in the fields covered by Article 113 of the Treaty in order to promote cooperation projects.
The consultations provided for in Article 2 shall take place within a select committee composed of representatives of each Member State and of the Commission.
When, however, these consultations relate to arrangements, commitments and measures in the field of credit insurance, credit guarantees and financial credits, they shall take place within the Policy Coordination Group for Credit Insurance, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits set up by the Council Decision of 27 September 1960 (1).
Article 5 Articles 1, 2 and 3 shall apply without prejudice to any special Community rules or procedures already in existence.
Article 6 Member States shall ensure in an appropriate manner that cooperation agreements which they propose to conclude or renew with third countries are on no account invoked or interpreted as affecting the obligations devolving on them by virtue of the Treaties establishing the European Communities.
Article 7 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
