The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question. (2) In view of the information provided by the United Kingdom on the period 1 January to 31 December 2005, the average ageing period in 2005 was eight years for Scotch whisky. (3) The coefficients for the period from 1 October 2006 to 30 September 2007 should therefore be fixed accordingly. (4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area precludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
