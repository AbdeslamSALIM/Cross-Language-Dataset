The nominated rapporteur Member States, submitted a draft assessment report concerning the substance to the Commission on 19 April 2000 (trifloxystrobin), 14 May 1998 (carfentrazone-ethyl), 17 December 1999 (mesotrione), 14 May 1998 (fenamidone) and 20 February 1997 (isoxaflutole). (7) The draft assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.
The review was finalised on 15 April 2003 in the format of the Commission review reports for mesotrione, trifloxystrobin, carfentrazone-ethyl, fenamidone and isoxaflutole.

The Committee further concluded that no signs or symptoms of adverse effects are to be expected in humans at plasma tyrosine levels below 800 to 1000 nmol/ml. (11) For isoxaflutole the Scientific Committee was asked to comment on the toxicological and ecotoxicological effects of a degradation product of the active substance (RPA 203328); on statistical analyses of tumour incidence in the two-year rat study; and on the observation of developmental effects in laboratory animals.
