The Court examined the extent to which the Commission has set a strategy which leads to the most effective use of the aid relating to economic cooperation activities in Asia, and whether the Commission manages the implementation of this aid effectively (paragraphs 10-15).
Asia accounts for 56 % of the world’s population, and 25 % of world GNP.
EU cooperation with Asia started in 1976, at the same time as the cooperation with Latin America and the Mediterranean countries.
Up to 2004, EU cooperation in Asia totalled more than 7800 million euro, having increased in average terms from 50 million euro to 400 million euro per year. 3.
EU economic cooperation in Asia is governed by the Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/92 [2].
The Commission has two main budget lines/articles [3] covering cooperation in Asia: "financial and technical cooperation" (B7-3 0 0/19 10 01); and "political, economic and cultural cooperation" (B7-3 0 1/19 10 02) (see Table 1 below).
Between 2000 and 2004 the Commission committed 509 million euro under the latter budget article.
In reality the amounts committed for activities of an economic cooperation nature are actually higher as some projects funded under the general budget line, B7-3 0 0, are of an economic nature as well.

The Court of Auditors calculated that the bilateral economic cooperation projects in Asia approved for funding between 1995 and 2002 [5] totalled 343 million euro, (see Table 2) with projects of 37 million euro in the ASEAN region.

There are five different programmes covering the whole of Asia; the two dealing more explicitly with economic cooperation are Asia Invest and Asia IT %amp% C [6].
To a degree the Asia ProEco, Asia Link and Asia Urbs programmes also support economic cooperation. 8.
The Asia Invest programme began in 1997 with a Commission contribution [7] of 42 million euro over a five-year period, and has since entered a second phase of implementation from 2003 to 2007, with a contribution of 41 million euro.
The aim of the projects financed by the programme is to "foster direct business cooperation between economic operators in the EU and Asia, with a focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, and to support a dynamic private sector in Asia".

The concept of economic cooperation was formalised in the ALA Regulation (see paragraph 3).
Article 7 sets out the objective of helping the developing countries "build up their institutional capacity so as to create an environment more favourable to investment and development … making the most of the prospects opened up by the growth of international trade, including the European Single Market".
Article 8 sets out the three sectors in which the aid is to be spent.
The third is "support for undertakings by means of trade promotion, training and technical assistance schemes … establishing contacts between undertaking and by schemes to facilitate cooperation between them". 20.
The Commission’s overall strategy towards Asia is set out in its 1994 Communication to the Council "Towards a New Asia Strategy" [11], updated in 2001 in the Communication "Europe and Asia: A Strategic Framework for Enhanced Partnerships" [12]. 22.
The 2004 Budget was the first one to be adopted following the ABB approach.
In the case of the Preliminary Draft Budget for 2005 the activity statements were published in early 2004 [13].
Part 3 of the activity statement sets out the core objective of the activity as set out in the 2001 Communication — "to strengthen the EU’s political and economic presence across the region …" — together with six priorities.
The output indicators, in respect of the 2004 financial year (of which there are nine), mostly cover participation in meetings or committees, which may reflect the overriding political concerns and action, but again is not the main target or purpose of the expenditure.
The absence of specific operational strategies at both Commission and specific country level resulted in practice in an extremely wide and diverse range of projects over a wide geographical area (see paragraphs 39 and 50).
In order to conclude on this audit objective, the Court examined the extent to which the Commission’s management: - has set up an application procedure which encourages and facilitates applications; - ensures projects are decided and implemented in a timely manner; - monitors projects regularly and takes timely corrective action; - ensures that projects produce real results with a positive impact and are sustainable; and - undertakes appropriate evaluations. 37.
Bilateral projects 38.
Box 1 — Examples of projects and their objectives 1.
Bilateral projects are identified on a case-by-case basis, rather than through a standardised application procedure [15].
Box 2 — Delays before implementation 1.
Consequently, implementation only started in February 2001. 2.
In the case of the Small Projects Facility in China the Financing Agreement was signed in March 2001, the contract of the European Co-Director came into effect in June 2003 and the first call for proposal was launched in November 2003.
Box 3 — Delays during implementation 1.
In the EU-India Maritime Project the contract was signed in May 1999 and was extended until December 2003.
Due to an ineffective implementing agency, the Audio-visual project in Vietnam produced very little in the way of tangible results: only one workshop was held and there was only very limited promotion activity in Europe and Vietnam. 3.
At the time of the audit the actual number trained was 2315 engineers, managers, experts, technicians and pilots: 97 % of attendees rated the training activities as good, or very good. 2.
Box 6 — Inconsistent monitoring 1.
In six out of the 14 projects audited, the potential for sustainability was in doubt.
Box 7 — Sustainability 1.
Evaluations lacking 48.
Box 8 — Shortcomings in the evaluation of the projects 1.
Box 9 — Examples of Asia-wide projects 1.
An Asia IT %amp% C project that aimed to effectively disseminate advanced and tailored e-business devices that can foster relations between Indian and European operators in the textile sector. 2.
It is time-consuming — and therefore costly — and difficult for applicants to prepare, obtain and collate all the information needed, particularly if it has to be translated. 53.
Box 10 — Application procedure 1.
An Asia IT %amp% C project where the main applicant was a higher level educational institution in Vietnam which had the objective to evaluate existing European graduate level IT %amp% C e-learning courses in the context of developing significant local expertise in Vietnam described their experience.
Box 11 — Successful projects A project of 100000euro to strengthen the capacity of engineering consulting services in Vietnam to win and undertake more effective project preparation and site supervision work, trained 600 people in three separate training modules each lasting approximately two weeks. … and were well monitored … 58.
The regular monitoring systems put into place for Asia Invest and Asia IT %amp% C have worked very well.
Box 12 — Sustainability 1.
The output and impact indicators — which should form the basis for monitoring and assessing progress and impact — concentrate on process at a political level, rather than the output and results of the aid itself (see paragraphs 21-33). 63.
This lack of focus means that the impact of the economic cooperation is difficult to measure, the link with the main priority of strengthening mutual trade and investment is difficult to establish, and therefore there is only a limited basis for assuring whether the EU expenditure has been effective or given value for money (see paragraphs 34-35). 65.
Conclusions and recommendations on implementation 66.
Specific areas requiring attention included ensuring that the objectives of the different programmes and projects are clear and are realistic for the planned time-frame and that evaluations are carried out where appropriate, following a clear strategy and on a timely basis. 69.
The Commission’s monitoring systems were very effective (see paragraphs 50-59). 70.
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 14 July 2005.
Projects above EUR 1 million are approved by the ALA Committee, composed of representatives of the Member States. [16] The Commission’s Communication on Evaluation (SEC(2000) 1051). -------------------------------------------------- THE COMMISSION’S REPLIES EXECUTIVE SUMMARY IV.
V. (first indent) — The delays between the identification phase and the start of the projects, as well as those delays that were identified in projects under implementation, concern bilateral projects designed before the reform of EC external assistance.
As a result of this reform, including the establishment of EuropeAid (January 2001) and the devolution of aid management to the Commission Delegations, together with the New Financial Regulation (January 2003), project delays will be limited and contained.
Within this monitoring exercise economic cooperation projects in Asia have scored well in terms of potential for sustainability. (second indent) — The application procedures, derived from the financial regulations, are geared towards the highest level of transparency and fairness.
This will help to further improve sustainability. (third indent) — The ongoing revision of AIDCO Practical Guide to contractual procedures will simplify the application process for grants to the extent allowed by the Financial Regulation, as well as clarify the role of the delegations in the evaluation. (fourth indent) — The Results Orientated Monitoring (ROM) system, introduced since 2002, provides standardised monitoring information on projects and programmes.
With the reform of external assistance in 2000 and the introduction of CSP/RSP in conjunction with the strategic communications on Asia, the Commission reaffirmed that short and long-term strategic objectives of EC cooperation in Asia should remain focused, thereby reducing the abovementioned risks. 22.
See reply to paragraph 22. 25.
Also based on lessons learned the EC has since 2004 begun to reduce the scope of the Asia-wide programmes from five programmes to three. 26.
Applications involving more than one Asian country are encouraged in order to establish Asian cross-border business collaboration. 29.
Moreover, since 2002 the EC has introduced a system of quality support measures that strengthen the examination of project design at the identification and formulation stages.
The sustainability plans are now carefully looked at through this procedure.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 60.
Since the reform of EC external assistance, all aspects of Project Cycle Management (PCM) are fully institutionalised.
The majority of the projects audited by the Court were designed in the period before the reform of the EC external assistance. 67.
As a result of the reform of EC external assistance and with the entry into force of the new Financial Regulation in January 2003, project delays have since then been significantly limited and contained.
The sustainability plans are now carefully looked at through the Quality Support process.
Since devolution, the Delegations are actively involved in this systematic monitoring activity. --------------------------------------------------
