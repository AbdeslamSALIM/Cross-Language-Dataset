Article 49 of the TIR Convention envisages the application of greater facilities for the benefit of economic operators provided such facilities do not impede the application of the provisions of the Convention.
Annex A to the Istanbul Convention replaces the Customs Convention on the ATA carnet for the temporary admission of goods of 6 December 1961 (the ATA Convention) with regard to relations between countries which have accepted the Istanbul Convention and its Annex A.
Those restrictive conditions for goods which are not of Community origin should be modified in order to promote the use of the value-added method. (4) However, in order to avoid an abuse of the system it is desirable to provide that this method of duty relief may be refused if it is established that the sole object of the release for free circulation of the temporary export goods had been to benefit from this relief. (5) The identity and nationality of means of transport at departure is regarded as mandatory information that has to be entered in box 18 of a transit declaration.
It is necessary to complete that list, in order to take into account all the situations relating to the guarantee waivers. (10) As a consequence of the modification of the numerical codes of the transit guarantees, it is also necessary to adapt the corresponding data concerning the New Computerised Transit System. (11) Given that the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure provides that the numerical codes of the transit guarantees are to apply from 1 May 2004, the new codes should apply with effect from that date. (12) In view of the foregoing, Annexes 37 and 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2286/2003, should be amended.
It is necessary, however, to make similar amendments also to Annex 37 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2002 [6], and Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 881/2003 [7], since they both remain in force until 1 January 2006. (13) Article 531 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 defines the usual forms of handling which are allowed under the customs warehousing procedure.
The usual forms of handling which non-Community goods may undergo are exhaustively listed in Annex 72 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be granted only to persons who: (a) are established in the Community; (b) regularly receive goods that have been entered for the TIR procedure, or whose customs authorities know that they can meet the obligations under that procedure; (c) have not committed any serious or repeated offences against customs or tax legislation.
Article 373(2) shall apply mutatis mutandis.
Articles 374 and 375, Article 376(1) and (2), and Articles 377 and 378 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the procedure relating to the application referred to in paragraph 1. 4.
Article 407 shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to the procedure laid down in the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 454b 1.
Article 454c 1.
Points 9 to 15, 31, 32 and 33 of Article 1 shall apply with effect from 1 October 2005. 4.
Points 23, 25 and 26 of Article 1 shall apply with effect from 1 July 2005. 5.
Points 22, 27 and 29 of Article 1 shall apply with effect from 1 January 2006.
