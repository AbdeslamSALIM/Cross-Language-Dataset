2006/224/EC: Commission Decision of 6 October 2004 on State aid which Italy plans to grant to the agricultural undertaking Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl (notified under document number C(2004) 3639) Commission Decision of 6 October 2004 on State aid which Italy plans to grant to the agricultural undertaking Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl (notified under document number C(2004) 3639) (Only the Italian version is authentic) (2006/224/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having called on [1] interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provision cited above and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 8 February 2001, registered on 9 February 2001, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union notified the Commission of the measure indicated above in accordance with Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty. (2) By letters of 21 August 2001, registered on 24 August 2001, of 3 December, registered on 5 December 2001, and of 11 April 2002, registered on 17 April 2002, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union sent the Commission the further information requested from the Italian authorities by letters of 9 April 2001 and 27 September 2001 and via informal contacts. (3) By letter dated 5 June 2002, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the said aid. (4) The decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities [2].
The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid. (5) The Commission did not receive any comments from interested parties. (6) By letter dated 16 September 2002, registered on 17 September 2002, Italy sent the Commission further information on the planned aid.
The approving decision makes provision for converting the rescue aid into restructuring aid provided that within six months of the aid being authorised Italy submits a restructuring plan for the undertaking, in accordance with point 23 of the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (hereafter %quot%the Guidelines%quot%) [4].
This Decision therefore focuses on the restructuring aid. (8) In line with the restructuring plan, the rescue aid disbursed, amounting to ITL 900000000 (€ 464810), was converted into a subsidy in the form of a capital grant.
The total wine production of the Marche Region, which has a surface area of 23500 hectares, 13000 of which produce wine with a registered designation of origin, is ITL 147 billion.
With its 125 hectares of vineyards, Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl covers 0,53% of the total surface area in the region devoted to wine growing and 0,96% of that dedicated to wine with a registered designation of origin and it accounts for 0,38% of the region’s average production (data from the last three years). (11) The current trends in the wine sector are towards the consumption of better quality wine (the consumption of wine with a registered designation of origin is increasing and the consumption of table wine is decreasing [5].
The Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi wine, which has been judged one of the best Italian white wines, is, together with Rosso Conero, one of the most popular Marche Region wines in Italy and throughout the world.
Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl’s debt burden (13) According to the Italian authorities, Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl’s losses can be summed up as follows: Difference in economic performance 1995–2000 [7] | ITL 776432609 (€ 400994) | Difference in public aid for investments | ITL 179363240 (€ 92633) | Loss of gross production due to weather conditions 1998/1999 | ITL 165120000 (€ 85277) | Loss of gross production due to weather conditions 1999/2000 | ITL 194599000 (€ 100502) | Total losses | ITL 1315514849 (€ 679406) | D.
Indices | Index | Value | Viability indices | Operating losses | Losses during the last three-year period | Operating income/operational capital | Less than 3% in the last 5 financial years or a reduction in the last 5 financial years to a value of less than 3% in the last financial year (1,5% for cooperative societies) | Operating income/value of production | Reduction of 50% in the last 5 financial years with an annual rate of reduction of at least 5% and no more than 20% in the last financial year | Turnover/stocks | Reduction between 20 and 40% in the last 5 financial years with a rate of reduction of no more than 15% in the last financial year | Financial charges/turnover | Between 4 and 15% in the last 5 financial years | Financial and structural indices | Time to pay suppliers | Increase of 70% in the last 5 financial years with a rate of growth of at least 10% and no more than 30% in the last financial year | Operating income/financial costs | Reduction of 25-30% in the last 5 financial years with an annual rate of reduction of at least 3-4% and no more than 15% in the last financial year | Working capital-Stocks/Current liabilities | Less than 0,6 in the last 3 financial years or reduction in the last 5 financial years up to a value of less than 0,6 in the last financial year | Working capital/Current liabilities | Less than 0,8 in the last 3 financial years or reduction in the last 5 financial years up to a value of less than 0,8 in the last financial year | Permanent capital /tangible assets | Less than 0,6 in the last 3 financial years or reduction in the last 5 financial years up to a value of less than 0,6 in the last financial year | Short term bank debt/current liabilities | Not less than 0,35 and not more than 0,6 in the last 5 financial years, with an absolute increase in the last financial year of no more than 0,2 | Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl meets these requirements.
The planned action is as follows: a) renovating and restructuring 10 hectares of vineyard with a registered designation of origin, in accordance with a five-year investment programme, to be carried out in accordance with Community regulations (Regulations (EC) No 1493/1999 and No 1227/2000); b) establishing (in progress) 10,5 hectares of vineyard to produce wine with a registered designation of origin (2,5 hectares of Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi and 8,5 hectares of Rosso Conero); c) purchasing a grape harvesting machine at a cost of ITL 386900000 (€ 199820) in order, by mechanising certain harvesting operations, to reduce manpower costs by approximately ITL 184800000 (€ 95440) per year. (16) The costs of investments for the vineyard renovation and restructuring to be carried out in the five-year period covered by the plan are as follows: Description | Amount (in ITL) | Vineyard (10 hectares x ITL 45 million) | 450000000 | [Eligible investment (10 hectares x ITL 40 million)] | [400000000] | Investment aid (40% of ITL 400 million) | –160000000 | Remainder to be financed | 290000000 (€ 149773) | (17) The members of the cooperatives further increased the undertaking’s share capital by ITL 100 million (€ 51650).
In addition, the members granted the cooperative a loan of ITL 500 million (€ 258230). (18) The restructuring aid also covers the costs of consultancy and accompanying the restructuring plan, totalling ITL 120000000 (€ 61975).
The financial structure of the restructuring plan will therefore be as follows: A.Previous debt (as shown on the preceding table) | ITL –1315514849 | B.Charges borne by the members (reduced reimbursement of production from their land, plus the increase in share capital) | 534233484 | Net debt (A-B) | –781281365 | 50% contribution to the purchase of equipment | –193450000 | Plan accompaniment costs | –120000000 | Total | –1094731365 | F.
Use of the rescue aid Losses for the operating year 1996 | ITL 181878103 | Difference in public aid for investments | 179363240 | 50% contribution to the purchase of equipment | 193450000 | Plan accompaniment costs | 120000000 | Reduction in depreciation fund allocations (part) | 225308657 | Total | 900000000 | (19) Converting the ITL 900000000 (€ 464811) of rescue aid into a subsidy in the form of a capital grant will make it possible to reduce the aforementioned total debt by ITL 792000000 (€ 409034) and to cover, in part, the purchase of the grape harvesting machine and the costs of accompanying the restructuring plan. (20) To offset this, the cooperative has undertaken to reduce its own production capacity in the wine sector.
In particular, for the purposes of calculating real needs, the Commission doubted that the depreciation fund reserves which had not been set aside could be counted as losses and expressed doubts regarding the eligibility, in the context of a restructuring plan, of aid for investment in equipment in an area of production that was not in deficit. (24) Lastly, the Commission expressed some uncertainty regarding the restructuring plan accompaniment costs, since it could not be ruled out that the cooperative assigned to carrying out these tasks would receive indirect aid.
COMMENTS FROM ITALY (25) By letter dated 16 September 2002 Italy provided further information and clarifications. (26) Regarding the long-standing nature of the cooperative’s difficulties, Italy confirmed that Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl fulfilled the four criteria used by the Region, as approved in the context of State aid N 354/2000.
In 1998 and 1999 there were contingencies, of ITL 78 million and ITL 134 million, due to revenue from the production of agricultural products being less than estimated. (29) On restoring viability in spite of reducing production capacity, Italy stressed and confirmed that the requirement to reduce the undertaking’s wine production by 16% over a period of five years (keeping the maximum production within the limit of 1406,20 tonnes of grapes) did not entail a corresponding percentage reduction in the value of production inasmuch as changing the production mix to better quality grapes would bring about a much more minor reduction of the income from sales.
Specifically, the sum of ITL 120000000 covered the costs of analysing the financial situation and assets in the years 1994-1999, drawing up the restructuring plan, drawing up forecast accounts until 2005, the technical and administrative assistance required to implement the action detailed in the plan, monitoring of the action undertaken and evaluation of any corrective action.
The cooperative was declared to be in difficulty on basis of the following criteria: financial charges/turnover, turnover/stocks, working capital-stocks /current liabilities, short term bank debt/current liabilities. (41) Nonetheless, the rescue aid previously approved and the restructuring aid covered by this Decision are assessed and authorised in different ways and, in the case in point, rescue and restructuring are two parts of a single operation, even if they involve different processes (point 9 of the Guidelines).
With debts of ITL 1254832000 (€ 648070) in 2000, loss-making financial management (ITL 238951430 (€ 123408) in 2000) and a liquidity index of 0,555 in 2000, faced with a falling turnover, Cooperativa Agricola Moderna Scrl seems unable to restore viability through its own resources or those of its members, which have in fact already been used on several occasions (in the form of loans and reduced rates of reimbursement for the production from their land).
The improvement in viability must derive mainly from internal measures.
According to the calculation provided by Italy, the purchase of this item of equipment would entail annual savings of ITL 185000000 in vineyard management, which would generate 80% of the gross saleable production of the cooperative without any increase in production. (49) Italy has undertaken to reduce the cooperative’s wine production capacity by 16% over a period of 5 years.
Restoring the viability of the undertaking is not therefore compromised by the planned reduction in capacity. (50) Calculation of sales revenue without reduction in capacity: Grape | ha | t/ha | Production capacity Max/t | Price €/100 kg | Total value | Verdicchio Castelli Jesi | 0,62 | 14,00 | 8,7 | 42,09 | 3653,52 | Verdicchio Castelli Jesi | 99,00 | 14,00 | 1386,0 | 46,48 | 644228,34 | Verdicchio Superiore | 0,00 | 11,00 | 0,0 | 50,61 | 0,00 | Verdicchio Riserva | 0,00 | 11,00 | 0,0 | 61,97 | 0,00 | Verdicchio Passito | 0,00 | 11,00 | 0,0 | 103,29 | 0,0 | Rosso Conero DOC riserva | 2,22 | 14,00 | 31,1 | 87,80 | 27287,52 | Esino rosso | 8,96 | 15,00 | 134,4 | 33,31 | 44770,62 | Marche IGT bianco | 4,89 | 18,00 | 88,0 | 20,66 | 18183,41 | Marche IGT rosso | 1,44 | 18,00 | 25,9 | 22,21 | 5756,22 | TOTAL | 117,13 | 14,29 | 1674,1 | | 743879,62 | Total ITL | | | | | 1440351800 | (51) Calculation of sales revenue with the reduction in capacity: Grape | ha | t/ha | Production capacity Max/t | Price €/100 kg | Total value | Verdicchio Castelli Jesi | 0,62 | 12,32 | 7,6 | 42,09 | 3215,10 | Verdicchio Castelli Jesi | 59,00 | 12,60 | 743,4 | 46,48 | 345540,65 | Verdicchio Superiore | 20,00 | 10,45 | 209,0 | 50,61 | 105780,70 | Verdicchio Riserva | 15,00 | 10,45 | 156,8 | 61,97 | 97145,54 | Verdicchio Passito | 5,00 | 9,22 | 46,1 | 103,29 | 47607,00 | Rosso Conero DOC riserva | 9,18 | 12,60 | 115,7 | 87,80 | 101553,81 | Esino rosso | 2,00 | 12,60 | 25,2 | 33,31 | 8394,49 | Marche IGT bianco | 4,89 | 16,20 | 79,2 | 20,66 | 16365,07 | Marche IGT rosso | 1,44 | 16,20 | 23,3 | 22,21 | 5180,60 | TOTAL | 117,13 | 12,01 | 1406,3 | | 730782,97 | Difference | | | | | –1,76% | (52) Point 32 of the Guidelines stipulates that restructuring must involve the abandonment of activities which would remain structurally loss-making even after restructuring.
The methods for applying such a general principle to the agricultural sector are specified in Chapter 5 of the Guidelines.
Aid limited to the minimum necessary (55) According to point 40 of the Guidelines, the amount and intensity of the aid must be limited to the strict minimum needed to enable restructuring to be undertaken in the light of the existing financial resources of the company.
In order to generate the necessary resources, the members increased the share capital by ITL 100000000 in 2000 and gave the cooperative a loan of ITL 500000000.
