Belarus is violating the ILO Convention No 87 on Freedom of Association on various major points by impeding the right to freely establish trade union organisations, the right to organise, the free choice of trade union organisations and the obtaining of legal personality of these organisations.
The Government of Belarus is also violating Convention No 98 (1949) on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining through anti-union discrimination. (6) The information available thus provides sufficient grounds to conclude that these violations are serious and systematic and that withdrawal of Belarus√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122; access to the scheme of generalised preferences is justified.
The Commission shall monitor and evaluate the situation in Belarus with regard to ILO conventions Nos 87 and 98 for a period of six months from the publication date of an announcement on the monitoring and evaluation period in the Official Journal of the European Union. 2.
