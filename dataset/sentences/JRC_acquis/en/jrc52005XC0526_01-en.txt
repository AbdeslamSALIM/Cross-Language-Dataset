The purposes of the Strategy are to: - Provide a long-term line of action for the Commission with the goal of achieving a significant reduction of the level of IPR violations in third countries; - Describe, prioritise and coordinate the mechanisms available to the Commission services for achieving their goal [3]; - Inform right-holders and other entities concerned of the means and actions already available and to be implemented, and raise their awareness for the importance of their participation. - Enhance cooperation with right-holders and other private entities concerned, by seeking their input on the identification of priorities and establishing public-private partnerships in fields like technical assistance, information to the public, etc.
