FINANCIAL REGULATIONS The balance sheets and income and expenditure accounts were drawn up in accordance with the Financial Regulations applicable to the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th European Development Funds (EDFs) [1].
The relevant documents must be presented to the Court of Auditors as provided for in Articles 66, 67 and 68 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the 6th EDF, Articles 69, 70 and 71 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the 7th EDF, Articles 66, 67 and 68 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the 8th EDF and Articles 102 and 103 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the 9th EDF.
Article 102 (9th EDF) stipulates that, starting with the annual accounts for 2005, the Commission shall send the provisional accounts to the Court of Auditors by 31 March of the following year.
The Court of Auditors shall in turn make its observations on the accounts known to the Commission by 15 June (Article 103).
On the basis of these observations, the Commission approves the final accounts by 31 July and sends them to the European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors.
The accounts are then published in the Official Journal of the European Union by 31 October together with the statement of assurance given by the Court of Auditors in respect of the part of the EDF resources for which the Commission is responsible for financial management. 1.1.2.
ACCRUAL-BASED ACCOUNTS In accordance with the provisions of Articles 99 and 135(3) of the 9th EDF Financial Regulation, full accrual-based accounts have to be prepared for the first time for the 2005 financial year.
The accounting information provided by the present IT accounting system (OLAS) has been adjusted, where necessary, in order to provide figures which comply with accrual accounting principles.
These financial statements have been drafted in conformity with a new set of accounting rules and methods for the EDF.
The annual accounts for 2005 are presented as follows: - the financial statements, - the reports on financial implementation, - the financial statements and information supplied by the European Investment Bank (EIB). 1.1.3.
The general accounts allow for the preparation of the financial statements as they show all charges and income for the financial year and are designed to establish the financial position in the form of a balance sheet at 31 December.
Article 98 of the 9th Financial Regulation sets out the accounting principles to be applied in drawing up the financial statements, as follows: - going concern basis, - prudence, - consistent accounting methods, - comparability of information, - materiality, - no netting, - reality over appearance, - accrual-based accounting.
In accordance with the provisions of Articles 99 and 135(3) of the 9th EDF Financial Regulation, the financial statements for 2005 have been prepared on a different basis to that of 2004, i.e.
Therefore adjustments were made to the balance sheet as of 31 December 2004 so as to arrive at the opening, accrual-compliant, balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 (for example, the inclusion of prefinancing amounts). 1.2.
Year-end balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into euros on the basis of the exchange rates applying on 31 December 2005: Euro exchange rate at 31 December 2005 — GBP 0,6853 1.4.

The total amounts due to the states concerned (including accrued interest for 2005 — see note 2 and Table 2 above) are shown in Table 6.
This total amount concerns the 8th EDF, with the exception of EUR 8,63 million allocated to Burundi and EUR 53,83 million allocated to Sudan which fall under the 7th EDF.
See also note 6. (9) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS In accordance with Article 129 of the 9th EDF Financial Regulation, the treasury is presented in the balance sheet of the 9th EDF.

The interest earned in this account is periodically transferred to the EDF main account to be used in accordance with Articles 1.3 and 9 of the Internal Agreement. (9.5) Funds en route Some replenishment sent before the year end were only registered by the beneficiary bank in 2006. (10) SUBSCRIBED FUNDS — FUND CAPITAL (A) This represents the total amount receivable from the Member States for the relevant EDF fund as laid down in each of the internal agreements between the Member States and the beneficiary African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT).
The initial allocation for the (current) 9th EDF, which originally totalled EUR 10555,15 million, has since been increased by an amount of EUR 105 million in 2004, which was released by the EIB in accordance with the provisions of Council Decision 2003/583/EC [3].
Contributions are still being called up from the 8th EDF, with the sole exception of the EUR 105 million in favour of the Democratic Republic of the Congo called in from the 9th Fund.
In an extraordinary meeting of the ACP Working Group at Council on 26 October 2004, Member Sates unanimously decided that the EIB should transfer an amount of EUR 100 million from its EDF treasury to the Commission's EDF treasury, with a consequent reduction of the overall amount of the contributions from Member States.
Following the same principle, in 2005 Member States decided on a second transfer of EUR 20 million from the EIB treasury to the Commission.
Details of amounts called up and received during the year are shown in Table 1 (see note 1). (13) CUMULATIVE RESERVES (D) Up to the 2004 financial year the economic outturn of each fund was not included in the balance sheet.

Commission Decision C(2001) 1578 fixed the allocations for regional programmes and intra-ACP cooperation under the Financial Protocol to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
Commission Decision C(2002) 2567 increased the envelope intended for intra-ACP cooperation by EUR 60 million, from the general reserves of the 6th and 7th EDFs, and also provided for the use of these additional funds pending the entry into force of the Financial Protocol to the 9th EDF, in accordance with the rules and procedures applicable to the original EDFs.
Lastly, Decision No 3/2002 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers of 23 December 2002 [8] took an amount of EUR 25 million from the unallocated resources of the 8th EDF (general reserve) and allocated it to regional cooperation under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
The EU Council Decision of 27 November 2001 (2001/822/EC) on the association of the overseas countries and territories (OCT) with the European Community entered into force on 2 December 2001.
The 9th EDF was set at EUR 13800 million, including EUR 13500 million allocated to the ACP States in accordance with the first Financial Protocol included in the Cotonou Agreement, EUR 175 million allocated to the OCT (provided for by the EU Council Decision on the association of the OCT) and EUR 125 million reserved for the European Commission to cover expenses in connection with implementing the 9th EDF resources (provided for in the internal agreement for the 9th EDF).
Of the total budget of EUR 13500 million for the ACP States, EUR 1000 million was released in 2004 and 2005 after examination by the EU Council, on the basis of a proposal from the European Commission: - EUR 250 million was released in accordance with Joint ACP-EU Council Decision 01/2004 of 7 May 2004 and allocated to the Intra-ACP Fund (natural resources) to finance the Water Facility operation, - EUR 18 million was released in accordance with Council Decision 10752/05 of 19 July 2005 and allocated to the envelope for long-term development support to cover the financing of the National Indicative Programme of Timor-Leste for the period 2006 and 2007, - EUR 482 million was released in accordance with ACP-EC Council of Ministers Decision No 6/2005 of 22 November 2005 and allocated to the envelope for long-term development support (EUR 352 million), the envelope for regional cooperation and integration (EUR 48 million) and the Investment Facility (EUR 82 million), in order to contribute to financing of the EU Energy Initiative (EUR 220 million), the International Commodity Risk Management Financing Facility (EUR 25 million), adaptation to the new EU feed and food sanitary and phytosanitary rules (EUR 30 million), strengthening the African Union (EUR 50 million), the %quot%Education for All%quot% Fast Track Initiative (EUR 63 million), tackling HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria (EUR 62 million), and the operating costs of the CDE/CTA (EUR 32 million), - EUR 250 million was released in accordance with ACP-EC Council of Ministers Decision No 7/2005 of 22 November 2005 and allocated to the envelope for long-term development support (EUR 185 million), the envelope for regional cooperation and integration (EUR 24 million) and the Investment Facility (EUR 41 million), also to finance the Water Facility operation.
The breakdown of 9th EDF allocations for ACP States, including the %quot%conditional billion%quot% and allocations managed directly by the European Investment Bank (EIB), is as follows: (EUR) | | 9th EDF allocation | Reduction/conditional billion | Unopened allocations (EIB-managed) | Reallocations between envelopes and the conditional billion | Open allocations OLAS (EC-managed) | Long-term development budget | 10000000000 | | (186850000) (interest rate subsidies) | -690000000 | 9123150000 | Regional budget | 1300000000 | | | 731000000 | 2031000000 | Investment Facility | 2200000000 | (122000000) [10] | (2037000000) | -41000000 | | Total | 13500000000 | (122000000) | (2222850000) | 0 | 11154150000 | The long-term development budget for ACP States has two components: The A allocation for macroeconomic support, sectoral policies, and programmes and projects supporting Community aid: this corresponds to the allocation for the NIPs and structural adjustment in previous EDFs.
The breakdown of 9th EDF allocations for the OCT, including those managed directly by the European Investment Bank (EIB), is as follows: (EUR) | | 9th EDF allocation | Unopened allocations (EIB-managed) | Open allocations (OLAS) | Long-term development budget | 127100000 | | 127100000 | C reserve | 17900000 | (1000000) (interest rate subsidies) | 16900000 | Regional budget | 8000000 | | 8000000 | Budget for studies and technical assistance | 2000000 | | 2000000 | Investment Facility | 20000000 | (20000000) | 0 | Total | 175000000 | (21000000) | 154000000 | The unallocated C reserve for OCTs is maintained to finance humanitarian aid, emergencies, refugee assistance and fluctuations in export earnings, and corresponds to the B allocation for the ACP countries.
An amount of EUR 0,46 million (EUR 0,09 million for 2005) is in fact shown as recovered in the income and expenditure accounts.
This discrepancy will no longer appear as from the 2007 financial year when the new ABAC accounting system comes on stream. 2.1.
