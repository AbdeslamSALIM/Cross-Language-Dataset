In order to allow for a gradual adaptation of the NCBs’ balance sheets and profit and loss accounts, the monetary income allocation for the financial years 2002 to 2007 has been adjusted to take into account the differences between the average value of banknotes in circulation of each NCB during the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 and the average value of banknotes that would have been allocated to them during that period in accordance with the ECB’s capital key.
This means that an adjustment procedure should be applied each time a Member State adopts the euro and should follow the same principles as the adjustment procedure for the financial years 2002 to 2007.
Where a Member State adopts the euro, the calculation of the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation under the first sub-paragraph shall be recorded in the books of the ECB and the NCBs with a value date of the cash change-over date.%quot% 3.
For the purposes of monetary income calculation, each NCB’s intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation shall be adjusted by a compensatory amount determined in accordance with the following formula: C = (K – A) × S where: C is the compensatory amount, K is the euro amount for each NCB that results from the application of the subscribed capital key to the average value of banknotes in circulation during the reference period, whereby the amount of banknotes in circulation denominated in the national currency of a Member State that adopts the euro shall be translated into euro at the daily foreign exchange reference rate during the reference period, A is the average euro value for each NCB of banknotes in circulation during the reference period, translated into euro at the daily foreign exchange reference rate during the reference period, Financial year | Coefficient | Cash change-over year | 1 | Cash change-over year plus one year | 0,8606735 | Cash change-over year plus two years | 0,7013472 | Cash change-over year plus three years | 0,5334835 | Cash change-over year plus four years | 0,3598237 | Cash change-over year plus five years | 0,1817225 | S 2.
If the value of euro banknotes that the Banque centrale du Luxembourg puts into circulation in 2002 exceeds the average value of its banknotes in circulation during the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2001 by 25 % or more, then for the Banque centrale du Luxembourg letter %quot%A%quot% in the formula set out in paragraph 1 shall be the value of banknotes put into circulation by the Banque centrale du Luxembourg in 2002 up to a maximum limit of EUR 2,2 billion.
