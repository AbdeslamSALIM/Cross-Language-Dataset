Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social committee and the Committee of the Regions on reviewing the interoperability of digital interactive television services pursuant to Communication COM(2004) 541 of 30 July 2004 /* COM/2006/0037 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 02.02.2006 COM(2006) 37 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS on reviewing the interoperability of digital interactive television services pursuant to Communication COM(2004) 541 of 30 July 2004 COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS on reviewing the interoperability of digital interactive television services pursuant to Communication COM(2004) 541 of 30 July 2004 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In July 2004, the Commission published a Communication setting out its position on the interoperability of digital interactive television services pursuant to Article 18(3) of Directive 2002/21/EC on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (‘the Framework directive’).
BACKGROUND In May 2005, the Commission published a Communication on accelerating the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting[1] proposing a target date of 2012 for Member States to make the transition to digital television and switch off analogue TV transmission.
The MHP Implementation Group The MHP Implementation Group set up as a result of the 2004 Communication held its first meeting in Brussels in November 2004.
The most extensive deployment of interactive set top boxes using the MHP standard has been in Italy.
The subsidy served to overcome the price differential between MHP products and cheaper products without interactive capabilities, and as a consequence the interactive decoder market has been dominated by MHP.
The very competitive market for set top boxes in Italy has driven down the price of MHP decoders to less than 100 €, but these reductions have not spilled over into other, less competitive markets where prices of MHP equipment remains relatively high.
The successful take-up of MHP in Italy lies in a combination of the following factors: 1) the voluntary agreement of Italian broadcasters to use MHP, 2) the introduction of the subsidy scheme for interactive decoders by the authorities, and 3) the definition of common implementation specifications.
Other standards for Interactive digital television The Commission signalled in the July 2004 Communication its intention to add two more interactive TV standards - namely MHEG-5[5] and WTVML[6] - to the List of standards that is published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 17 of the Framework Directive, conditional upon their adoption by ETSI.
PCF covers 80% of interactive television applications.
THE COMMISSION’S POSITION ON INTEROPERABILITY OF INTERACTIVE DIGITAL TV Article 18(3) of the Framework Directive allows the Commission, if adequate interoperability has not been achieved, to invoke the procedure in Art. 17 of the Directive, by which certain standards can be made mandatory.
CONCLUSION The Commission’s priorities are to: - Work with Member States to ensure the successful switchover to digital TV – as the facilitator for interactive digital services The Commission will follow up its Communication of May 2005 on switchover, and will be monitoring closely the progress in Member States.
This could be extended to international collaboration in implementation and production of digital TV. - Monitor use of proprietary technologies The use of proprietary technologies will remain subject to competition law review.

[5] MHEG-5 is part of an international standard developed by the Multimedia and Hypermedia Experts Group (MHEG).
There are estimated to be more than 5 million set-top boxes using MHEG-5. [6] WTVML is an extension of the Wireless Mark-up Language (WML) for TV.
There are estimated to be more than 7 million set top boxes using WTVML. [7] This involves seeking the opinion of Member States via the Communications Committee.
