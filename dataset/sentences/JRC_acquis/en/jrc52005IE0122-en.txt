The energy issue 2.

Geothermal energy 2.1 Technologies for tapping into and using thermal energy flows from the earth's interior, which is very hot, to the surface, are referred to as geothermal energy production.
Water (in liquid form or as steam) is used as the heat carrier. 2.1.1 However, the density of such thermal energy flows is very low, and temperatures rise only slowly as distance below the earth's surface increases, at an average rate of around 3oC per 100 m.
A greater amount of heat — 5 to 30 MWth — can be achieved in this way. 2.2.2.1 However, even these (water) temperatures are still insufficient to achieve the requisite thermodynamic efficiency (to transform heat energy to electricity), and in view of the temperatures required to reach boiling point within the turbine circuit. 2.2.2.2 For this reason, substances with a lower boiling point than water such as perfluorpentane (C5F12) are used for preference as the working fluid in turbine circuits.
