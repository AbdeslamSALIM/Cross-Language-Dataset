As a consequence of accelerated enterprise restructuring in the late 1990s, the unemployment rate increased from 13,7 % in 1994 to 18,2 % in 2004 while total employment decreased by two percentage points over the same period.
The macroeconomic scenario assumes that real GDP growth will average 5,6 % per year over the programme period and, starting with a negative output gap in 2005, implies a marked swing in cyclical conditions.
In its opinion of 17 February 2005 on the previous update of Slovakia's convergence programme covering the period 2004-2007, the Council invited Slovakia to "(i) seize every opportunity for an accelerated deficit reduction, including through the use of better-than-expected revenues and of savings on the expenditure side, in particular in 2005; (ii) make the medium-term expenditure ceilings more binding; (iii) be vigilant that second-round effects from the high inflation in 2004 do not affect the inflation convergence path envisaged in the programme". (4) The updated programme broadly follows the model structure and data provision requirements for stability and convergence programmes specified in the new code of conduct [2]. (5) The programme aims at reducing the deficit to below the 3 % of GDP reference value in 2007, in line with the Council recommendation under Article 104(7) from 5 July 2004.
The general government deficit (net of the pension reform costs) is projected to decrease from 4,1 % of GDP (including 0,8 % of GDP debt cancellations) in 2005 to 2,9 % in 2006, then decline sharply to 1,6 % of GDP in 2007 and reach 1,3 % of GDP in 2008.
The profile of the primary balance is similar, which is expected to improve from -2,3 % of GDP (-1,5 % of GDP excluding debt cancellations amounting to 0,8 % of GDP) in 2005 to 0,7 % in 2008.
The government expenditure-to-GDP ratio is expected to fall by 3,4 percentage points between 2005 and 2008 (by 2,6 percentage points excluding 0,8 % of GDP of debt cancellations in 2005).
General government revenues are estimated to remain broadly stable until 2007 and then decrease by 0,7 % of GDP in 2008.
The budgetary impact of the classification of the second-pillar funded pension scheme outside the general government sector (which has to be implemented by the time of the spring 2007 notification) is estimated at 0,8 %, 1,3 %, 1,4 % and 1,4 % of GDP in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively.
The programme sets the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position in structural terms at a deficit of 0,9 % of GDP and aims at achieving this position by 2010 (beyond the programme period).
In 2008 (the year following the correction of the excessive deficit), the pace of the adjustment towards the programme's MTO implied by the programme is not in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, which specifies that, for euro area and ERM II Member States, the annual improvement in the structural balance should be 0,5 % of GDP as a benchmark and that the adjustment should be higher in good economic times and could be lower in bad economic times.
In particular, in 2008 the improvement in the structural balance is only around 14 % of GDP, when cyclical conditions signal 'good times' [3]. (9) The debt ratio is estimated to have reached 33,7 % of GDP in 2005, which is well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value and 10,5 % points lower than envisaged in the previous update of the programme.
The level of debt is significantly under the 60 % reference value and should remain so under the assumption of unchanged policies for the coming two decades.
Slovakia is on track to correct its excessive deficit by the deadline set by the Council. (12) The National Reform Programme of Slovakia, submitted on 14 October 2005 in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, identifies the following challenges with significant implications for public finances: (i) information society; (ii) R%amp%D and innovations; and (iii) education and employment.
The 2006 budget as well as the 2006-2008 budgetary framework foresee significant increases in the expenditure on education and research and development and thus reflect priorities set in the National Reform Programme.
