The type-approval can be extended to vehicles from the same type or from a different type differing with regard to the following characteristics of Annex II, if the CO2 emissions measured by the technical service do not exceed the type-approval value by more than 4 % for vehicles of category M1 and 6 % for vehicles of category N1: - reference mass, - maximum authorised mass, - type of bodywork: for M1: saloon, hatchback, station wagon, coupĂŠ, convertible, multipurpose vehicle for N1: lorry, van, - overall gear ratios, - engine equipment and accessories. 11.2.
APPROVAL OF VEHICLES OF CATEGORY N1 WITHIN A FAMILY Vehicles of category N1 can be approved within a family as defined in 12.1 using one of the two alternative methods described in 12.2 and 12.3. 12.1.
Identical parameters are: - manufacturer and type as defined in Annex II, section I, point 0.2, - engine capacity, - emission control system type, - fuel system type as defined in Annex II, point 1.5.2. 12.1.2.
The following parameters have to be within the following limits: - transmission overall ratios (no more than 8 % higher than the lowest) as defined in Annex II, point 1.6.3, - reference mass (no more than 220 kg lighter than the heaviest), - frontal area (no more than 15 % smaller than the largest), - engine power (no more than 10 % less than the highest value). 12.2.
