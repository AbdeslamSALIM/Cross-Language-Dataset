Specification: (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) 4.1 Name: "Mela Alto Adige" or "Südtiroler Apfel" 4.2 Description: The protected geographical indication Mela Alto Adige/Sűdtiroler Apfel is reserved for fruit of the following varieties and clonal subvarieties from orchards located in the geographical area specified at 4.3 below: Braeburn, Elstar, Fuji, Gala, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Idared, Jonagold, Morgenduft, Red Delicious, Stayman Winesap.
A nursery list of the Bolzano Agricultural Association of 1856 mentions no fewer than 193 varieties of cultivable apple.
The most important historical work on fruit and vegetable growing in the Alto Adige of 1894 and 1904 by Karl Mader recognises almost 40 varieties as very widespread in the entire Alto Adige area.
The height of the orchards, from 200 to 1100 m above sea level, and the light, well aerated soils guarantee a strong fragrance and solid flesh and hence a high keeping quality.
The apple production chain at present involves 8000 growers, mainly associated in cooperatives, 2500 employees in the market preparation centres and 12000 fruit-pickers. 4.7 Inspection body: +++++ TABLE +++++ 4.8 Labelling: On the label, to be affixed to the packaging or the individual fruits, Mela Alto Adige or Südtiroler Apfel must appear in clear indelible letters readily distinguishable from all other text and be immediately followed by the words "Protected Geographical Indication".
