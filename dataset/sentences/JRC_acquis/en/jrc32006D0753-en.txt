2006/753/EC: Commission Decision of 3 November 2006 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable compact discs (CD+/-R) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia Commission Decision of 3 November 2006 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable compact discs (CD+/-R) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong and Malaysia (2006/753/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Communities [1] (%quot%the basic Regulation%quot%), and in particular Article 9 thereof, After consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: 1.
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporting producers were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the notice of initiation, basic information on their activities related to the product concerned during the investigation period ( 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005). (8) After examination of the information submitted and given the high number of exporting producers in the PRC and Hong Kong which indicated their willingness to cooperate, it was decided that sampling was required. (9) The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all other companies that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation.
Additionally, two exporters were included on the reserve list. (14) The sample selected for the Hong Kong exporting producers also consisted of four companies, representing over 90 % of the volume of exports to the Community from the cooperating exporting producers from Hong Kong.
Additionally, two companies were included on the reserve list. (15) The Commission received replies from the sampled exporters in China and Hong Kong as well as from the companies on the reserve list. (16) In accordance with Article 17(2) of the basic Regulation the Chinese and Hong Kong authorities were consulted on the samples and raised no objections. 1.4.
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2002 to the end of the investigation period (%quot%period considered%quot%). 1.5.
DUMPING (27) The investigation established a level of dumping of more than de minimis for each of co-operating exporting producers from the countries concerned.
Community Production (28) In the light of the definition of Community industry as set out in Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation, the output of the following Community manufacturers was considered for inclusion in the definition of the Community production at the initiation of the investigation: - Five complainant Community manufacturers: - CDA Datenträger Albrechts GmbH (%quot%CDA%quot%) - Computer Support Italcard s.r.l. (%quot%CSI%quot%) - Global Digital Disc GmbH %amp% Co KG (%quot%GDD%quot%) - Manufacturing Advanced Media S.A. (%quot%MAM-E%quot%) - TDK Recording Media Europe S.A. (%quot%TDK%quot%) - Two other Community producers who fully cooperated in the investigation, and who supported the proceeding: - BOC SA - Sony DADC Austria AG (%quot%Sony DADC%quot%) - Thirteen other manufacturers, as listed in the complaint, to whom questionnaires were sent but none of whom replied to the questionnaire. 3.1.1.
Company A (29) In the questionnaire response by company A, it appeared that company A, in addition to its own Community manufacturing, also had imported the product concerned from the countries concerned.
Company B (34) In the questionnaire response by company B, it appeared that company B, in addition to its own Community manufacturing, had also imported the product concerned during the period considered.
Company C (41) The Commission received a questionnaire from the Community producer company C as well as from company C-Rel, a distributor of CD-Rs located in Germany.
as from July 2005 onwards, on the basis of supplementary information requested from all Community producers for the period July 2005 to February 2006, company C-Rel has been found to have started to import significant (at a level equivalent to the production of company C in the IP) quantities of CD-Rs from third countries including significant volumes from the countries concerned. (43) In order to verify whether these imports were of a temporary nature, the Commission sent an additional request for supplementary information, this time for the period March 2006 to May 2006.
Several parties argued that, pursuant to Community practice, company D should be excluded from the definition of Community production. (46) In January 2006, the liquidator announced its intention to sell all the assets of company D, including all of its production lines.
Furthermore, no valid business plan had been presented to the Commission’s services that demonstrated that company D’s production lines were being installed at the premises of company E. (49) It is Community practice that manufacturers that definitively cease their production during or after the end of the IP should not be included in the definition of Community industry within the meaning of Article 4 of the basic Regulation.
CDA %amp% BOC SA (50) Subsequent to the publication of the notice of initiation, two further companies, CDA and BOC SA, informed the Commission that they had ceased their production within the Community for the foreseeable future. (51) Consequently, CDA and BOC SA were excluded from the definition of the Community industry and their production was excluded from the definition of Community production. 3.1.3.
Consequently, also the production of these four companies should be excluded from the definition of Community production. (56) To conclude, Community production of CD-Rs within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation has been defined as: - CD-Rs produced by the original 20 companies listed in recital (28), minus - the CD-Rs produced by the three companies which, as described in recitals (29) to (44) , have been excluded for reasons of imports, and - the output of the three cooperating companies which, as described in recitals (45) to (51) have been excluded as their production within the Community ceased, - the output of the four non-cooperating companies which, as described in recitals (52) to (55) have been excluded as their production within the Community ceased. (57) The total production of those remaining 10 producers, which constitute Community production within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the basic Regulation, has been estimated to be 168 Mio units during the IP. 3.2.
Preliminary remarks 3.3.1.1.
However, included in the same CN Code are also other recordable media products such as DVD-R, CD-Rom etc.
Moreover, imports under CN Code 85239000 are recorded in kilos, whereas CD-Rs are recorded by all interested parties as being produced and sold in units.
Further information on Community production was derived from the questionnaire responses from the companies which have been excluded from the definition of Community production, and also from data contained in the complaint. 3.3.2.
Consumption (64) Thus, the consumption in the Community was established on the basis of: - the total imports of the product concerned into the Community as reported by Eurostat and converted into units, - the total verified sales on the Community market by the Community industry, - the total sales on the Community market by other cooperating manufacturers in the Community, - the total estimated sales on the Community market by the other manufacturers in the Community in operation. (65) On this basis, Community consumption developed as follows: Consumption | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Mio Units | 3580 | 3738 | 3527 | 3488 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 104 | 99 | 97 | (66) Over the period considered consumption in the Community decreased by 3 %.
This Article provides that the effects of imports from two or more countries simultaneously subject to anti-dumping investigations shall be assessed cumulatively if it is determined that: - the margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation, - the volume of imports from each of the countries concerned is not negligible, - a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in the light of the conditions of competition between imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported product and the like Community product. (68) It was first found that the dumping margins established for each of the countries concerned was more than de minimis.
The volume of imports from each country concerned was also found to be above the threshold of 1 % market share set by Article 5(7) of the basic Regulation.
Import volumes and market shares from the countries concerned (69) On the basis of Eurostat statistics, the import volumes have developed as follows during the period considered: Mio Units | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Hong Kong | 146 | 250 | 262 | 274 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 171 | 179 | 188 | Market share | 4 % | 7 % | 7 % | 8 % | PRC | 480 | 930 | 1077 | 1128 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 194 | 224 | 235 | Market share | 13 % | 25 % | 30 % | 32 % | Malaysia | 148 | 324 | 312 | 277 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 219 | 210 | 188 | Market share | 4 % | 8 % | 9 % | 8 % | Countries concerned | 774 | 1504 | 1651 | 1679 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 194 | 213 | 217 | Market share | 21 % | 40 % | 46 % | 48 % | (70) The imports from the countries concerned as well as their market shares have steadily increased during the period considered.
Average prices and level of undercutting of imports from the countries concerned (71) The average price level and level of undercutting of the Community industry’s sales prices for the IP has thus been calculated on the basis of information gathered from co-operating exporters. | Average level of undercutting | Hong Kong | 69,7 % | PRC | 43,9 % | Malaysia | 0 % | (72) It follows from above that imports from Hong Kong and the PRC were found to undercut the Community industry’s sales prices by 69,7 % and 43,9 %, whereas for Malaysia no undercutting was found. 3.5.
Effects of the dumped imports from the countries concerned (75) It follows from recital (69) that the volume of imports from the PRC, Malaysia and Hong Kong has increased by 117 % during the period considered, representing an increase in market share from 21 % in 2002 to 48 % during the IP. (76) In recital (72), it was established that that the imports originating in the PRC and Hong Kong, have undercut the Community industry’s prices by 43,9 % and 69,7 % respectively, whereas for Malaysia no undercutting was found. (77) It was further concluded in recital (73) that the Community industry has suffered material injury and it appears that the injurious situation coincides in time with the increase in volumes of dumped imports from the countries concerned. (78) Given this coincidence in time between the increased imports at dumped prices and the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry, it can be concluded that the dumped imports have had a direct effect on this situation. 4.3.
Based on this allegation, the overall volume of imports from other third countries below has been obtained from Eurostat using the breakdown method referred to in recital (62) above: Mio Units | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Third country: India | 712 | 1143 | 1207 | 1124 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 160 | 169 | 158 | Market share | 20 % | 31 % | 34 % | 32 % | Third country: Taiwan | 1206 | 163 | 89 | 53 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 13 | 7 | 4 | Market share | 33 % | 4 % | 2 % | 1 % | Other third countries | 514 | 423 | 39 | 129 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 82 | 7 | 25 | Market share | 14 % | 11 % | 1 % | 4 % | Total third countries | 2432 | 1729 | 1335 | 1306 | Index: (2002 = 100) | 100 | 71 | 55 | 54 | Market share | 67 % | 46 % | 37 % | 37 % | (80) It follows from the above that the overall volumes of imports from other third countries have decreased from 67 % of Community consumption to 37 % of Community consumption, or by 30 percentage points.
India (84) It is recalled that an anti-dumping investigation on imports of CD-Rs from India was terminated in May 2003 due to the absence of dumping.
It is also recalled that following an anti-subsidy investigation, a countervailing duty of 7,3 % was imposed on imports of CD-Rs originating in India. (85) Nevertheless, imports from India increased considerably between 2002 and 2004, increasing their market share from 20 % to 34 %.
Decrease in overall consumption (87) It follows from recital (66) that consumption of CD-Rs has decreased by 7 % since 2003.
It can therefore be concluded that the overall decrease of consumption has contributed to the injury suffered by the Community Industry. 4.3.3.
Indeed, sales of CD-Rs, according to sales statistics from Community manufacturers, confirm the fact that sales to retailers/e-shops located in low-levy Member States are significant and appear to include significant border-trade. (91) Given that the Community industry is located in Member States with the highest levy, it has been alleged by some interested parties that the injury suffered by the Community industry has been caused by the negative effect on consumption that this levy has brought, assuming that the Community industry has not been able to compensate for this loss by gains in sales in other Member States. (92) It is noted that one of the complaining Community producers which was subsequently excluded from the definition thereof, in March 2005, has questioned the legality of these levies itself and indeed claimed that the levy has caused the sales price to %quot%collapse%quot%.
Thus, this confirms that the levies had an effect on the Community producers’ sales. (93) It follows from recital (65) that the consumption of CD-Rs in the Community has decreased by 3 % during the period considered.
The patent-holders are Sony Corporation, Taiyo Yuden and Royal Philips Electronics Corporations.
In addition to the Community industry, representatives of all the major sales brands on the market such as Verbatim, Maxell, Philips, TDK and Sony as well as some representative retailers such as Carrefour, Tesco, Metro-Group, including Media-Saturn, Fnac and El Corte Inglés have been heard.
All importers, distributors, whole-sellers or retailers have expressed opposition to any imposition of measures. (103) Following the imposition of anti-dumping measures on imports of CD-Rs originating in Taiwan (and of the imposition of countervailing measures on imports of CD-Rs originating in India), the Community industry, as constituted in this proceeding, had a market share of 2 %.
The argument was therefore rejected. (115) Moreover, while Article 21 of the basic Regulation indeed refers to the need to give special consideration to the need to remedy the trade distorting effects of injurious dumping and to restore effective competition, this particular provision has to be seen in the overall framework of the Community interest test as laid down in the aforementioned Article.
Article 2 The Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
