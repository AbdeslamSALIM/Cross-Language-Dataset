These amendments entered into force on 1 July 2002 in the framework of the SOLAS Convention (IMO Resolution (MSC.104 (73)).
The common position puts ships flying the flag of a Member State and those flying the flag of a third country on an equal footing when they are operated on a regular service or as cargo ships or passenger ships. - Safety management requirements The common position establishes a link between the scope and the provisions of the Code applicable to it. - Certification and verification The draft Regulation provided for two different articles (Articles 5 and 6).
The aim is to reduce administrative costs for small shipping companies and certain ships operating exclusively on domestic voyages by enabling them to be fully or partially exempted from certain provisions of the ISM Code (section 6, 7, 9, 11 and 12 of Part A), while safeguarding the principles of the Code.
The provisions will therefore apply to them two years after its entry into force. 4 CONCLUSIONS The Commission recognises that the common position alters neither the aims nor the spirit of the proposal and is therefore able to accept it.
