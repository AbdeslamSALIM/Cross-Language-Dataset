The operator or manager of the establishment must ensure for control purposes that in addition to the information required by Chapter IV the following information is visibly and legibly displayed on the packaging of the heat treated milk and milk-based products: - the nature of the heat treatment which the raw milk has undergone, - an information whereby the date of heat treatment may be established and, in the case of pasteurized milk, the temperature at which the product must be stored. 6.
The mark shall be legible, (¹) Council Directive 89/109/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 38).

In particular, the maximum temperature at which pasteurized milk may be kept until it leaves the establishment and during transport must be 6 oC.
Vehicles intended for the transport of heat-treated milk in small containers or churns must be so designed as to give the containers or churns adequate protection against all contamination and atmospheric influences and may not be used to transport animals. 5.
During transport, the temperature of pasteurized milk transported in tanks or packed in small containers and in churns must not exceed 6 oC.
In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 31 of this Directive, the Commission may establish additional conditions for the storage and transport of specific milk-based products.
