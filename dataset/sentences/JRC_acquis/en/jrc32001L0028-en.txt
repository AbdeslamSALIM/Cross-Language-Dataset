The United Kingdom acting as nominated rapporteur Member State, submitted a draft assessment report concerning the substance to the Commission on 15 October 1998. (5) That assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health.
The review was finalised on 19 October 2000 in the format of the Commission review report for KBR 2738 (fenhexamid).
If the review report has to be updated to take account of technical and scientific developments, the conditions for the inclusion of KBR 2738 (fenhexamid) in Annex I to the Directive will also need to be amended in accordance with the Directive. (6) The dossier and the information from the review were submitted to the Scientific Committee on Plants for opinion on 31 March 2000.
It is therefore appropriate to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be granted in accordance with the provisions of the said Directive. (8) After inclusion, a reasonable period is necessary to permit Member States to implement the provisions of the Directive on plant protection products containing KBR 2738 (fenhexamid) and in particular to review, within this period, existing provisional authorisations or to grant, by the end of this period at the latest, new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.
Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive, at the latest by 1 August 2001.
However for plant protection products containing KBR 2738 (fenhexamid) together with another active substance which is in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the period referred to in paragraph 1 is extended to the extent that a longer implementation period is provided for by the provisions laid down in the Directive amending Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC to include the substance in the Annex. 4.
Member States shall keep available the review report for KBR 2738 (fenhexamid) (except for confidential information within the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) for consultation by any interested parties or shall make it available to them on specific request.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on 1 June 2001.
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
