The establishment of the internal market in air transport has contributed to a large extent to speeding up this trend.
The Commission has always endeavoured to ensure that the establishment of the internal market in air transport is flanked by the development of common safety rules to ensure high, uniform standards in all Member States.
The long series of accidents in the summer of 2005 unfortunately demonstrated that it really is necessary to continue the efforts to improve the general level of air safety.
The approach adopted by the Commission with a view to extending the common rules, and in particular the division of responsibilities between the Agency and the competent national authorities, is set out in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal.
The single European sky, a work in progress Air traffic management and air navigation services are the subject of standards drawn up by the ICAO and Eurocontrol.
For example, ESARR 3 adopted by Eurocontrol in July 2000 should have been implemented before July 2003, but this was only the case in a few Member States, and is still not the case in 14 of them.
Airport safety, an obligation to be met Since 27 November 2003, Annex 14 to the Chicago Convention requires airport certification.
The Commission has proposed, for example, that aviation be included in the European emissions trading system. 1.1.4.
A uniform and efficient regulatory framework The Commission will therefore propose to extend the common rules to the safety of air navigation and airport operations.
This proposal is envisaged in the Work Programme for 2006 and will respect the principles for legislation which are described in the Work Programme.
The Agency will thus be responsible for drawing up all the safety and interoperability rules for the European aviation system and, once they have been adopted by the Commission, for monitoring application, in particular through inspections in the Member States and investigations in firms.
Air transport safety and efficiency would therefore be reinforced in the Community and in neighbouring countries. 1.2.3.
The long series of accidents in the summer of 2005 has demonstrated that it really is necessary to continue the efforts to increase the general level of air safety in Europe.
It has asked the Agency to undertake exploratory work on these subjects, starting in 2005, and has launched an impact study, the conclusions of which will provide the basis for a proposal for a Regulation to be forwarded to the European Parliament and the Council before the end of 2006.
Extending the responsibilities of the Agency, achieving the single sky and concluding air service agreements with third countries, which will be conducted jointly, will guarantee that European aviation policy has a coherent framework comparable to what exists in the United States.
