As a result, this Regulation should be restricted to the regulation of outstanding matters which have not been covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 of 11 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92(16) (hereinafter referred to as the %quot%integrated system%quot%), in particular those concerning the periods and conditions related to the applications for the premium and for the supplement to the premium as well as the duration of the retention period. (3) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 provides for the granting of a premium to goatmeat producers in certain areas of the Community.
Those measures entail the grant of a supplement to the premium of an amount, which has to be specified. (6) The criteria for eligibility for direct payments and, in particular the conditions required need to be clarified. (7) For the purpose of monitoring the system of granting of premiums and the sheepmeat and goatmeat market Member States should notify the Commission regularly on that matter. (8) With a view to implementing the system of individual limits as introduced by Articles 8 to 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001, the rules governing the determination of those limits and their communication to the producers should be specified. (9) Appropriate measures should also be taken to ensure that rights granted free of charge from the national reserve are used by the beneficiaries solely for the intended purposes. (10) Bearing in mind the regulating effect which the system of individual limits will have on the market, provision should be made for premium rights not used by their holder during a specific period to revert to the national reserve.
Member States should therefore be authorised to raise the minimum percentage of use of rights, which should not, however, exceed 90 %. (12) The uniform implementation of the provisions relating to the transfer and temporary leasing of rights entails the laying-down of certain administrative rules.
Such rules should also prevent infringement of the undertaking provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 to surrender, each time that rights are transferred without transfer of the holding, a certain percentage of such transferred rights to the national reserve.
