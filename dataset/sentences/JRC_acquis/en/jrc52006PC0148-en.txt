The investigation showed that there has been a change in the pattern of trade involving exports of tubes or pipe fittings from the People's Republic of China and the Philippines to the Community.
Request (3) On 23 June 2005, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of tube or pipe fittings originating in the PRC by means of the transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin via the Philippines.
Initiation (7) By Regulation (EC) No 1288/2005[5] (‘the initiating Regulation’), the Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of tube or pipe fittings originating in the PRC by imports of tube or pipe fittings consigned from the Philippines, whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not and, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, directed the customs authorities to register imports into the Community of tube or pipe fittings consigned from the Philippines, whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not, as from 6 August 2005. 4.
All parties were informed that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to findings being made on the basis of facts available. (9) No questionnaire replies were received from exporters/producers in the Philippines, even though the authorities of the Philippines had contacted several companies possibly involved in producing tube or pipe fittings.
Moreover, no questionnaire replies were received from exporters/producers in the PRC. (10) Two importers in the Community co-operated and submitted replies to the questionnaire. (11) Verification visits took place at the premises of the following companies: Importers - Valvorobica Industriale S.P.A., Italy, - General Commercial %amp% Industrial S.A., Greece. 5.
Investigation period (12) The investigation period covered the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 (‘the IP’).
General considerations/degree of cooperation (13) As mentioned in recital (9), no producer/exporter in the PRC or the Philippines cooperated in the investigation.
Accordingly, findings in respect of tube or pipe fittings consigned from the Philippines to the Community had partially to be based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation. 2.
Product concerned and like product (14) The product concerned by the alleged circumvention is, as defined in the original investigation, tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings) of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, currently classifiable within CN codes ex 7307 93 11 (TARIC code 7307 93 11*95), ex 7307 93 19 (TARIC code 7307 93 19*95), ex 7307 99 30 (TARIC code 7307 99 30*95) and ex 7307 99 90 (TARIC code 7307 99 90*95), originating in the PRC. (15) On the basis of the information available and the data supplied by the Philippine authorities and considering the change in the pattern of trade as described in the following section, it must be inferred, in the absence of any contrary evidence, that the tube or pipe fittings exported to the Community from the PRC and those consigned from the Philippines to the Community have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and have the same uses.
Change in the pattern of trade (16) Due to the non-cooperation of any Philippine company, the volume and the value of exports of the like product from the Philippines to the Community had to be established on the basis of the facts available pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Imports into the Community In tonnes | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Philippines | 0 | 3 | 700 | 2 445 | 2 941 | The PRC | 1 324 | 772 | 677 | 1 153 | 1 411 | Indonesia | 0 | 983 | 1 294 | 0 | 0 | Sri Lanka | 0 | 332 | 302 | 39 | 0 | Total EU imports | 17 422 | 15 111 | 16 085 | 16 050 | 18 900 | Source: Eurostat (17) As this table shows, imports of tube or pipe fittings from the Philippines into the Community increased from 0 tonnes in 2001 to almost 3 000 tonnes during the IP.
In 2003, however the imports from the Philippines increased significantly to 700 tonnes.
This complete halt of imports from Indonesia and Sri Lanka to the Community in 2004 coincided with the most substantial increase of imports from the Philippines. (18) At the same time, exports from the PRC to the Philippines remained at a low but stable level.
Exports from the PRC to the Philippines In tonnes | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Philippines | 466 | 604 | 402 | 643 | 694 | Source: Chinese Export Statistics (19) It must be noted, however, that the data used to establish the change in the pattern of trade, with special regard to those relating to exports from the PRC to the Philippines, should be seen in the light of the likelihood of false declarations of origin (see below in recital (22)) and might therefore not give a complete picture of the situation. (20) From the figures shown above, it is concluded that there has been a clear change in the pattern of trade which started after the conclusion of the original investigation and became apparent after the extension of the measures to imports of the like product from Indonesia and Sri Lanka.
It is therefore clear that the marked change in trade flows undermined the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in terms of the quantities imported into the Community market. (27) With regard to prices of the products consigned from the Philippines and in the absence of co-operation and of any contrary evidence, Eurostat data show that average export prices of imports from the Philippines during the IP were lower than the average export prices established for the PRC in the original investigation.
It has been established that prices of imports from the Philippines are around one third lower than those of imports originating in the PRC both during 2004 and the IP.
Detailed information can be found in the table below: EUR/kg | 2004 | IP | Philippines | 0,97 | 1,07 | PRC | 1,57 | 1,50 | Difference | - 38% | - 29% | (28) On the basis of the above, it is concluded that the change in trade flows, together with the substantial increase in imports made at very low prices from the Philippines have undermined the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in terms of both quantities and prices of the like product. 6.
Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for the like product (29) In order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the product concerned exported to the Community from the Philippines during the IP, export prices established on the basis of Eurostat data were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (30) In accordance with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, these export prices were compared with the normal value previously established for the like product.
The definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 on imports of tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11 (TARIC code 7307 93 11 99), ex 7307 93 19 (TARIC code 7307 93 19 99), ex 7307 99 30 (TARIC code 7307 99 30 98) and ex 7307 99 90 (TARIC code 7307 99 90 98) and originating in the People’s Republic of China is hereby extended to imports of tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11 (TARIC code 7307 93 11 95), ex 7307 93 19 (TARIC code 7307 93 19 95), ex 7307 99 30 (TARIC code 7307 99 30 95) and ex 7307 99 90 (TARIC code 7307 99 90 95) consigned from the Philippines, whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not. 2.
