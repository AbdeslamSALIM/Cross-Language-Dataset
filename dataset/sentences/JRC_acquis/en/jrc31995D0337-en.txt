Explanations to A1/A2: The information to be given under A1 and A2 should provide an overview of the number of all permitted discharges (directly into surface water or indirectly via sewer) for the industrial sectors/processes mentioned in Appendix 2.
Example for NB (a) and (b): %gt%TABLE%gt% Example for NB (c): The given emission standard is derived using the best technical means available, in accordance with Article 6 (1) of Directive 76/464/EEC.
Example for NB (d): Definition of emission standard (1) Applicable to the total quantity of mercury present in all mercury-containing water discharged from the site of the industrial plant. (2) Applicable to the mercury present in effluent discharged from the chlorine production unit. (3) The maximum permitted water consumption corresponds in principle to 10 m3/t permitted production capacity and the emission factor is 0,5 g/t (produced), derived from the best technical means available.
This procedure must provide for: - the taking each day of a sample representative of the discharge over a period of 24 hours and the measurement of the mercury concentration of that sample, and - the measurement of the total flow of the discharge over that period.
If values for actual emissions are available, they should be indicated in brackets.
If values for actual emissions are available, they should be indicated in brackets.
The question covers those emitters: - discharging more than 50 kg/a of one substance, and - which are subjected to national/regional emission standards or water protection programmes.
