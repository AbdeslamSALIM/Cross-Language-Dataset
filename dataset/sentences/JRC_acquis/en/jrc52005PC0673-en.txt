The Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal submitted by the Commission endorsed the extension of the scope to shipments of spent fuel for reprocessing (see point 5 below).
Similarly, the Advisory Committee to be set up under Article 16 corresponds to the Committee which already exists under Article 19 of Directive 92/3. 4.
CONSULTATIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES The representatives of the competent authorities in charge of the implementation of Directive 92/3 Euratom (Committee provided for in Article 19 of Directive 92/3) were consulted on the draft revision of the Directive at a meeting held on 18 October 2002.
The Group of Scientific Experts provided for in Article 31 Euratom was consulted on the revision of Directive 92/3 during its meeting on December 2002 and gave its support to it.
CONSULTATION OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE (EESC) The Commission submitted on 12th November 2004 to the EESC, for opinion, the Proposal for a Council Directive on the supervision and control of shipments of radioactive waste and spent fuel, adopted on the same day (COM(2004) 716 final).
Reshipments related to processing and reprocessing operations (Article 2) The provision in Article 14 of Directive 92/3 has now been moved to Article 2.
Article 4 (2) corresponds to Article 5 (1) of Directive 92/3. 6.5.
Transmission of the application to the competent authorities (Article 5) Article 5 (1) corresponds to Article 4 (1), paragraph 1, second sentence of Directive 92/3. 6.6.
Now, acknowledgement of receipt is requested within one month, and the period for notifying acceptance/refusal is extended to 4 months (3 months reply + 1 month extension on request).
Article 6 (4) corresponds to the provision of Article 16 of Directive 92/3, its wording having been adapted to the structure of the present proposal.
It is now clear that the consent procedure also applies to reshipments in cases where the initial shipment fails for the reasons detailed in Article 9 (see point 3.12 of the SLIM Report). 6.7.
Article 7 (3) reflects the idea that was already implicit in Article 5 (1) of Directive 92/3.
Article 7 (4) corresponds to Article 5 (2) of Directive 92/3.
Acknowledgement of receipt of the shipment (Article 8) This provision corresponds to Article 9 of Directive 92/3. 6.9.
Shipment failure (Article 9) This provision corresponds to Article 15 of Directive 92/3, but following points have been clarified: (a) the right of the Member State of origin, transit or destination to abort a shipment, in the conditions laid down in the same provision and (b) the obligation of the Member State of origin in connection with take-back responsibility of the holder.
In line with Article 27 of the Joint Convention, the possibility to make an alternative safe arrangement is given, for such cases where the taking-back is not justified from the radiological point of view.
Special rules for imports into the Community (Article 10) Article 10 of Directive 92/3 has been developed and identifies the different steps of the procedure. 6.11.
Special rules for exports out of the Community (Article 12) It elaborates on Article 12 of Directive 92/3 and identifies the different steps of the procedure.
The consent of the State of destination is required, as resulting from Article 27 of the Joint Convention. 6.13.
Prohibited exports (Article 13) It corresponds to Article 11 of Directive 92/3.
Use of a standard document (Article 14) Article 14(2) has been adapted from Article 20 of Directive 92/3.
Competent authorities (Article 15) It corresponds to Article 17 of Directive 92/3, but the reference to the automatic consent procedure has been deleted as a consequence of Article 6 (4). 6.16.
The appropriate Community control mechanisms apply, including, as the case might be, the opening of infringement procedures under Article 141 Euratom.
The recommendations meant in Article 16(3) are intended to develop a safe system of exchange of information in order to facilitate the respect of the procedure laid down in this Directive, while avoiding delays. 6.17.
A reference is made to the procedure to be followed (this Proposal does not contain any provision similar to Article 20 of Directive 92/3, but integrates such a reference in Articles 3, 12, 13 and 15). 6.18.
Advisory committee (Article 18) It corresponds to Article 19 of Directive 92/3. 6.19.
Article 9, paragraph 1, on shipment failure, and the equivalent provisions in Articles 10, 11 and 12.
Final provisions (Articles 20, 22 and 23) Standard texts. 6.21.
