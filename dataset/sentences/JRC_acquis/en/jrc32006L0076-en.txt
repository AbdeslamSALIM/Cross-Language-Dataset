These specifications completed and formally repealed the specifications of February 2005 that were taken into consideration when that Directive was adopted.
In the light of this conclusion, and of the special circumstances of this case, the Commission considers that it is justified to modify the specification for chlorothalonil. (4) Since Directive 2005/53/EC requires Member States to apply its Article 2 from 1 September 2006, the amended specification for chlorothalonil should also apply from this date, without prejudice to the other deadlines laid down by Article 3 of Directive 2005/53/EC.
They shall apply those provisions from 1 September 2006.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
