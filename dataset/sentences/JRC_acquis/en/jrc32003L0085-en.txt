Although foot-and-mouth disease has no public health importance, due to its exceptional economic importance, it is on the top of list A diseases of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). (3) Foot-and-mouth disease is a compulsorily notifiable disease and outbreaks must be notified by the Member State affected to the Commission and other Member States, in accordance with Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982, on the notification of animal diseases within the Community(5). (4) The Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease are laid down in Council Directive 85/511/EEC of 18 November 1985 introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease(6).
The Member States should ensure that this legislation is implemented in its entirety and make enough personnel and resources available to provide strict controls on the external borders. (8) In addition, the European Parliament's Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease found that, in practice, border inspections are failing to prevent significant quantities of meat and meat products from entering the Community illegally. (9) Under the conditions of the single market and the overall satisfactory health status of livestock herds, the exchange of animals and animal products has increased substantially and certain regions of the Community have densely populated livestock areas. (10) The foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in certain Member States in 2001 demonstrated that due to intensive movement of and trade in animals susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, an outbreak can quickly take on epizootic proportions, causing disturbances on a scale liable to reduce sharply the profitability of farming of animals of susceptible species and other parts of the rural economy and also requiring substantial financial resources to compensate farmers and the application of control measures. (11) During the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease crisis, the Commission reinforced the Community control measures for foot-and-mouth disease laid down in Directive 85/511/EEC by adopting protective measures in accordance with Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(10), and Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market(11). (12) In 2001, the Commission also adopted Decisions on the conditions for the use of emergency vaccination in accordance with Directive 85/511/EEC.
Those conditions were laid down taking account of the recommendations contained in the report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on the strategy for emergency vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease of 1999. (13) This Directive should take into account the report of expert groups from Member States on a review of Community legislation on foot-and-mouth disease of 1998, which reflects the experience gained by Member States during the classical swine fever epidemic in 1997, and the conclusions of the International Conference on the Prevention and Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease held in Brussels in December 2001. (14) The Resolution of 17 December 2002 of the European Parliament on the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in 2001 in the European Union(12), based on the conclusions of the Temporary Committee on Foot-and-Mouth Disease of the European Parliament should be taken into account in this Directive. (15) The recommendations in the Report of the Thirtieth Session of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease of the Food and Agriculture Organisation on minimum standards for laboratories working with foot-and-mouth virus in vitro and in vivo of 1993, should be taken into account. (16) This Directive should also take into account the changes made in the Animal Health Code and the Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines of the OIE (OIE Manual). (17) In order to ensure early detection of any possible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, legal provisions are necessary to oblige those in contact with animals of susceptible species to notify any suspect case to the competent authorities.
Where possible the processing of the carcasses of dead or killed animals should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption(16). (22) It is necessary to integrate public health and environment protection aspects in the event of a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, in particular by establishing close cooperation between the veterinary health and environment competent authorities.
Unnecessary risks from burning animal carcasses on pyres or burying them at mass burial sites should be avoided. (23) It is necessary to prevent any spread of the disease as soon as an outbreak occurs by carefully monitoring movements of animals and the use of products liable to be contaminated, and where appropriate, in particular in densely populated livestock areas, by emergency vaccination. (24) The action taken to control the foot-and-mouth diesease epidemics which struck certain Member States in 2001 has shown that international and Community rules and the ensuing practices have not taken sufficient account of the possibility offered by the use of emergency vaccination and subsequent tests to detect infected animals in a vaccinated population.
The use of disinfectants should be in compliance with Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(18). (28) Semen, ova and embryos collected from animals of susceptible species infected with the foot-and-mouth disease virus may contribute to the spread of the disease and should therefore be subject to restrictions in addition to those animal health conditions laid down for intra-Community trade in the following Directives: - Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of deep-frozen semen of domestic animals of the bovine species(19); - Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importations from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species(20); - Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC(21). (29) In the event of an outbreak it may be necessary to apply control measures not only to infected animals of susceptible species, but also to contaminated animals of species not susceptible to the disease which may be mechanical vectors for the virus.
In order to ease reference, the treatment of meat and meat products from animals of susceptible species, required to ensure the destruction of possible foot-and-mouth disease virus, is specified in the Annexes VII to IX of this Directive which are based on those Directives and comply with recommendations of the OIE. (32) The animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption are laid down in Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002(29). (33) Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products(30) provides for the treatment of milk from animals kept within the perimeters of surveillance zones established in accordance with Community control measures for foot-and-mouth disease.
In addition, the treatment for milk for human consumption provided for in that Directive exceeds the requirements of the code of the OIE on destruction of foot-and-mouth disease virus in milk and results in logistic problems in the disposal of substantial quantities of milk refused by dairy plants.
More detailed provisions on the collection and transport of milk from animals of susceptible species in areas subject to control measures for foot-and-mouth disease should be included in this Directive.
Directive 92/46/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. (34) With regard to products of animal origin account should be taken of Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(31).
Certain provisions of Directive 92/118/EEC have been included in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. (35) The application of the principle of regionalisation should allow the implementation of strict control measures, including emergency vaccination, in a defined part of the Community without endangering general Community interests.
Dairy and meat products from vaccinated animals may be placed on the market in accordance with the relevant Community legislation and this Directive in particular. (36) Directive 64/432/EEC provides for the definition of regions.
Commission Decision 2000/807/EC of 11 December 2000 laying down the codified form and the codes for the notification of animal diseases pursuant to Council Directive 82/894/EEC(32) specifies administrative areas in Member States related to disease control measures and disease notification. (37) To guard against emergencies, the Community has, in accordance with Council Decision 91/666/EEC of 11 December 1991 establishing Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(33), established reserves of inactivated foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen stored at designated premises, and the Community antigen and vaccine bank.
However, such provisions should apply without prejudice to agreements concluded between the third country concerned and the Community on access to the Community antigen and vaccine bank. (43) Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(36), applies in the event of the occurrence of foot-and-mouth disease and provides for Community aid to be granted to reference laboratories and antigen and vaccine banks.
Member States shall ensure that: (a) foot-and-mouth disease is listed by the competent authority as a compulsorily notifiable disease; (b) the owner and any person attending animals, accompanying animals during transport or looking after animals shall be obliged to notify without delay to the competent authority or the official veterinarian the presence or suspected presence of foot-and-mouth disease and keep animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease or animals suspected of being infected, away from places where other animals of susceptible species are at risk of being infected or contaminated with the foot-and-mouth disease virus; (c) veterinary practitioners, official veterinarians, senior staff of veterinary or other official or private laboratories and any person with a occupational relation to animals of susceptible species or products derived from such animals shall be obliged to notify without delay to the competent authority any knowledge of the presence or suspected presence of foot-and-mouth disease they have obtained prior to official intervention within the framework of this Directive. 2.
Without prejudice to existing Community legislation on notification of outbreaks of animal disease, the Member State on whose territory an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease or a primary case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild animals is confirmed shall give notification of the disease and provide information and written reports to the Commission and the other Member States in accordance with Annex II.
By way of derogation from the prohibition in point (a) of paragraph 1, the competent authority may in the event of difficulties in storing the milk on the holding either order that the milk shall be destroyed on the holding, or authorise the milk to be transported under veterinary supervision and only by means of transport suitably equipped to ensure no risk of spreading foot-and-mouth disease virus from the holding to the nearest possible place for disposal or treatment ensuring destruction of the foot-and-mouth disease virus. 3.

Article 13 Epidemiological inquiry 1.
Article 14 Additional measures in case of confirmation of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease 1.
The competent authority may order that, besides the animals of susceptible species, animals of species not susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease on the holding where an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has been confirmed shall also be killed and processed of in such a way as to avoid any risk of spreading the foot-and-mouth disease virus.
The competent authority may apply the measures provided for in Article 10(1)(a) on epidemiologically-linked production units or adjoining holdings, where epidemiological information or other evidence give reason to suspect a possible contamination of those holdings.
In this event, the measures regarding taking of samples and clinical examinations of animals shall be carried out at least as set out in point 2.1.1.1 of Annex III. 3.
The competent authority may apply the measures provided for in Articles 7 and 8.
Where an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is confirmed in one of the premises referred to in paragraph 1, the Member State concerned may decide to derogate from Article 10(1)(a), provided that basic Community interests, and in particular the animal health status of other Member States, are not endangered and that all necessary measures are in place to prevent any risk of spreading foot-and-mouth disease virus. 3.
The decision referred to in paragraph 2 shall immediately be notified to the Commission.
In the case of farm animal genetic resources, this notification shall include a reference to the list of premises established in accordance with Article 77(2)(f), by which the competent authority has identified these premises in advance as breeding nucleus of animals of susceptible species indispensable for the survival of a breed.
Article 16 Measures to be applied in slaughterhouses, border inspection posts and means of transportation 1.
