This Regulation has replaced the Brussels Convention of 1968 on the same matter, to which Denmark is a party.
In view of the situation outlined above, the Commission considered it to be in the Community interest to extend to Denmark the provisions of Regulations 44/2001 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, which is closely linked to Regulation 44/2001.
The Council decided on 8 May 2003 to exceptionally authorize the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Denmark with the view to make the provisions of Regulation 44/2001 as well as the provisions of Regulation 1348/2000 applicable to Denmark under international law. 2.
As a result, the parallel agreement contains, in particular, the following provisions: - appropriate rules on the role of the Court of Justice to ensure the uniform interpretation of the instrument applied by the parallel agreement between Denmark and the other Member States; - a mechanism to enable Denmark to accept future amendments by the Council to the basic instrument and the future implementing measures to be adopted under Article 202 of the EC Treaty; - a clause providing that the agreement is considered terminated if Denmark refuses to accept such future amendments and implementing measures; - rules specifying Denmark’s obligations in negotiations with third countries for agreements concerning matters covered by the parallel agreement; - the possibility of denouncing the parallel agreement by giving notice to the other Contracting Party. 3.
Article 2 The President of the Council is hereby authorised to designate the person empowered to make the notification provided for in Article 12(2) of the Agreement.
