Pleas in law and main arguments In Cases F-51/05 [1] and F-18/06 [2], the applicant has already challenged the Commission's giving her parental leave for the period from 1 November 2004 to 30 April 2005 and, then, by letter of 17 November 2005, fixing 8 November 2004 as the date when the parental leave started.
On 6 December 2005, the applicant made a request based on, among others things, Article 90(1) of the Staff Regulations and on the GPI in respect of parental leave.
On 22 December 2005, the Appointing Authority's declared that request inadmissible.
