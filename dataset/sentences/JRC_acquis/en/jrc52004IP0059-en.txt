noting the Council Joint Action of 12 July 2004 and the announcement by the European Council of an ESDP mission, code-named "Althea", to BiH, which will be the first European Union military mission on a relatively large scale with approximately 7000 military personnel in comparison to the smaller earlier missions "Concordia" (approx. 350 military personnel) in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and "Artemis" (approximately 1400 military personnel) in the Democratic Republic of Congo, B.
recalling United Nations Security Council Resolution 1551 (adopted on 9 July 2004), which reminds the parties that they have committed themselves to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in order to surrender for trial all persons indicted by the Tribunal, D.
noting the support of the United Nations Security Council for this mission [7], which will take over by the end of 2004 the majority of tasks hitherto carried out by the Stabilisation Force (SFOR) operation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), E.
noting that NATO will maintain a headquarters in Sarajevo with some 250 military and civilian staff whose primary role will be to continue NATO's dialogue with BiH on defence reform, sharing responsibilities with the EU for counter-terrorism activities and all matters regarding the search for indicted war criminals; underlining that the capture and bringing to justice of indicted war criminals is a test of the credibility of the international community, of NATO, and ultimately, of the European Union, and a prerequisite for further reconciliation, L.
Welcomes the decision of the EU to have recourse to NATO assets and capabilities for the "Althea" mission, thereby confirming the collaboration between the two organisations and implementing the agreement of December 2002 on EU access to NATO planning and command facilities ("Berlin Plus"); 8.
Recommends that the EU force should continue SFOR's recent practice of deploying a network of small military teams to live among the population in "host houses" in order to maintain its situation awareness and its deterrent presence despite a reduction in troop levels, from 12000 to 7000 in June 2004; 17.
Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Parliaments of the Member States and third countries, as well as to the parliaments and governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
