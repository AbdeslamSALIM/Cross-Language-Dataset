By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 7 April 2005, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to replace an existing derogation measure in relation to the calculation of the VAT due on fuel expenditure for business cars which are also partly used for private purposes.
However, in order to allow a smooth transition, this Decision will only be repealed on 30 April 2007 and, in any case, not later than the entry into force of the relevant national measures. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Decision 86/356/EEC of 21 July 1986 authorising the United Kingdom to apply flat-rate measures in respect of the non-deductible value added tax charged on fuel expenditure in company cars. | 140 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | 219 | Not relevant. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment The proposed Decision relates to simplification measures for the charging of VAT on fuel for business cars in the United Kingdom and has therefore a potential positive economic impact.
The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | 331 | This Decision concerns an authorisation granted to a Member State on its own request and does not constitute any obligation. | 332 | Given the limited scope of the derogation, the special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instruments: other. | 342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s).
Under Article 27 of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes, derogation from the common VAT rules is only possible on the authority of the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission.
A Council Decision is the only suitable instrument since it can be addressed to an individual Member State. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 409 | The proposal has no implications for the Community budget. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | 520 | Repeal of existing legislation The adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of existing legislation. | Review/revision/sunset clause | 533 | The proposal includes a sunset clause. | 1.
Article 2 The proportion of the tax referred to in Article 1 shall be expressed in fixed amounts, established on the basis of the CO2 emissions level of the type of vehicle, that reflect fuel consumption.
Article 3 The system set up on the basis of this Decision shall be optional for taxable persons.
Article 4 Council Decision 86/356 is repealed on 30 April 2007.
