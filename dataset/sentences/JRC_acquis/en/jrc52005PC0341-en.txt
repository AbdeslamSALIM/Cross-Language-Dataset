In the view of the Member States’ objections the Commission requested an opinion from the former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF), which was delivered on 5 March 2003.
Furthermore, the SCF, in its opinion “General view on the longterm effects of the intake of elevated levels of phytosterols from multiple dietary sources, with particular attention to the effects on β-carotene” of 26 September 2002 indicated that there was no evidence of additional benefits at intakes higher than 3 g/day but that high intakes might induce undesirable effects and that it was therefore prudent to avoid plant sterol intakes exceeding 3 g/day.
Annex 2 Specifications of phytosterols and phytostanols for the addition to foods and food ingredients Definition: Phytosterols and phytostanols are sterols and stanols that are extracted from plants and may be presented as free sterols and stanols or esterified with food grade fatty acids.
