At its 414th plenary session of 9 and 10 February 2005 (meeting of 9 February), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 132 votes to 1 with 3 abstentions. 1.
Introduction 1.1 Council Regulation (EC) No. 2501/2001 of 10 December 2001 [1] applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) will expire on 31 December 2005.
In July 2004, the Commission adopted guidelines [2] on the role of the GSP for the next ten-year period, from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2015.
A deadline of 31 December 2008 would be set for the completion of this process. 2.5.1 The conventions chosen are those with mechanisms, which can be used by the relevant international organisations to evaluate on a regular basis how effectively they have been implemented.
As only those countries that are competitive for all the products in a section would be graduated, small beneficiary countries would not be graduated solely on the basis of a few competitive products in a section. 2.7.1 Graduation would be applied to any beneficiary country in respect of products of a section when the average of Community imports from that country of products included in the section concerned exceeds 15 % of Community imports of the same products from all countries over a period of three consecutive years.
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that in this area the Commission has adopted a policy of festina lente. 3.13 The EESC welcomes the fact that the Commission has consulted widely, both in the EU and in the beneficiary countries, before formulating these proposals. 3.14 The EESC notes that the Commission would continue to be assisted in the administration of the GSP system by a General Preferences Committee, acting within the framework of the "Regulatory Committee" procedure. 4.
It therefore welcomes the fact that, in future, graduation would take place in the year following the third consecutive year which constitutes the reference period for any given country and sector. 4.4 The EESC supports the Commission's proposal to maintain regional cumulation within the meaning of Regulation (EEC) No. 2454/93 when a product used in further manufacture in a country belonging to a regional group originates in another country of the group which does not benefit from the arrangements applying to the final product, provided that both countries benefit from regional cumulation for that group.
It would point out that, in the past, these provisions have been the source of a considerable level of fraudulent manipulation. 4.5 The EESC reiterates its opinion [7] that the preferential rules of origin should be simplified, and the compliance burden on EU importers correspondingly reduced, by bringing them into line with the current rules of origin on non-preferential imports. 4.6 The EESC reiterates its call [8] for dialogue between the EU and the LDCs to improve the implementing rules for the special arrangements for LDCs in certain specific cases, especially by adapting the transition period. 4.7 The EESC welcomes the proposal to eliminate duties where preferential treatment results in an ad valorem duty of 1.0 % or less or a specific duty of EUR 2 or less.
The Commission may extend this period in accordance with Articles 3 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC, as has already been done in the case of Myanmar.
After the expiration of the three-month deadline, such countries would then have no incentive to ratify and effectively implement the international conventions set out in appendices 1 and 2.
The EESC would have considered it preferable to have left the door open for the admission of these countries at a later date provided that they had then met the criteria for inclusion. 4.10 The EESC pointed out [7] that the GSP system is one element of the EU's trade policy and that, as such, it must be compatible with the other elements of that policy.
Conclusions 5.1 The EESC has advocated that the existing system should be simplified and rendered more transparent and that the opportunity should be taken to harmonise, unify and streamline all the GSP rules and procedures.
It considers that the proposed scheme would be a material improvement in this respect and to this extent it endorses the Commission's proposals. 5.2 The EESC approves the fact that the number of beneficiary countries would be reduced but fears that the reduction might not be of sufficient proportions. 5.2.1 The EESC considers that the Generalised System of Preferences should be reserved for least developed countries and countries most in need, in order to ensure that they are the primary beneficiaries of the new GSP regime.
The graduation threshold for textile and clothing products should therefore be lowered to 10 percent [10]. 5.3 The EESC considers that the new SIA for promoting sustainable development will have little more impact on the behaviour of beneficiary nations than those which it replaces. 5.4 The EESC is concerned that the issue of fraud in the existing system does not appear to have been effectively addressed and considers that more could have been done in this respect. 5.5 The EESC is disappointed that detailed impact assessments on these proposals have not been published or apparently, in some cases, conducted.
