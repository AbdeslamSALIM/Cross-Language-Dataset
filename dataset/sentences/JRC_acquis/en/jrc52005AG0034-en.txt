Common Position (EC) No 34/2005 of 23 September 2005 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC Common Position (EC) No 34/2005 adopted by the Council on 23 September 2005 with a view to the adoption of a Directive 2005/…/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC (2005/C 275 E/02) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [2], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3], Whereas: (1) In the European Community there is a need for improved energy end-use efficiency, managed demand for energy and promotion of the production of renewable energy, as there is relatively limited scope for any other influence on energy supply and distribution conditions in the short to medium term, either through the building of new capacity or through the improvement of transmission and distribution.
Human activities attributed to the energy sector cause as much as 78 % of the Community greenhouse gas emissions.
This liberalisation has not led to significant competition in products and services which could have resulted in improved energy efficiency on the demand side. (8) In its Resolution of 7 December 1998 on energy efficiency in the European Community [7], the Council endorsed a target for the Community as a whole to improve energy intensity of final consumption by an additional one percentage point per annum up to the year 2010. (9) Member States should therefore adopt national indicative targets to promote energy end-use efficiency and to ensure the continued growth and viability of the market for energy services, and thus contribute to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy.
Therefore, even though Member States commit themselves to making efforts to achieve the target figure of 6 %, the national energy savings target is indicative in nature and entails no legally enforceable obligation for Member States to achieve it. (11) When striving for energy efficiency on the basis of technological, behavioural and/or economic changes, substantial negative environmental impact should be avoided, and social priorities should be respected. (12) Improved energy end-use efficiency can be achieved by increasing the availability of and demand for energy services or by other energy efficiency improvement measures. (13) In order to realise the energy savings potential in certain market segments where energy audits are generally not sold commercially, such as households, Member States should ensure the availability of energy audits. (14) The Council conclusions of 5 December 2000 list the promotion of energy services through the development of a Community strategy as a priority area for action to improve energy efficiency. (15) Energy distributors, distribution system operators and retail energy sales companies can improve energy efficiency in the European Community if the energy services they market include efficient end-use, such as indoor thermal comfort, domestic hot water, refrigeration, product manufacturing, illumination and motive power.
Article 2 Scope This Directive shall apply to: (a) providers of energy efficiency improvement measures, including energy distributors, distribution system operators and retail energy sales companies.
However, Member States may exclude small distributors, small distribution system operators and small retail energy sales companies from the application of Articles 6 and 13; (b) final customers.
Article 3 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: (a) "energy": all forms of commercially available energy, including electricity, natural gas (including liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas), any fuel for heating and cooling (including district heating and cooling), coal and lignite, peat, transport fuels (excluding aviation and maritime bunker fuels) and biomass as defined in Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market [11]; (b) "energy efficiency": a ratio between an output of performance, service, goods or energy, and an input of energy; (c) "energy efficiency improvement": an increase in energy end-use efficiency as a result of technological, behavioural and/or economic changes; (d) "energy savings": an amount of saved energy determined by measuring and/or estimating consumption before and after implementation of one or more energy efficiency improvement measures, whilst ensuring normalisation for external conditions that affect energy consumption; (e) "energy service": the physical benefit, utility or good derived from a combination of energy and energy efficient technology, which may include the operations, maintenance and control necessary to deliver the service, which is delivered on the basis of a contract and normally leads to verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement; (f) "energy efficiency mechanisms": general instruments used by governments or government bodies to create a supportive framework or incentives for market actors to provide and purchase energy services and other energy efficiency improvement measures; (g) "energy efficiency improvement programmes": activities that focus on groups of final customers and that normally lead to verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement; (h) "energy efficiency improvement measures": all actions that normally lead to verifiable and measurable or estimable energy efficiency improvement; (i) "energy service company" (ESCO): a natural or legal person that delivers energy services and/or other energy efficiency improvement measures in a user's facility or premises, and accepts some degree of financial risk in so doing.

In developing the harmonised calculation model in accordance with Article 15(2), the Committee shall aim to use, to the extent possible, data which are already routinely provided by Eurostat and/or the national statistical agencies.
A bottom-up calculation method means that energy savings obtained through the implementation of a specific energy efficiency improvement measure are measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), in Joules (J) or in kilogram oil equivalent (kgoe) and added together with energy savings results from other specific energy efficiency improvement measures.
The authorities or agencies referred to in Article 4(3) will ensure that double counting of energy savings, which results from a combination of energy efficiency improvement measures (including mechanisms), is avoided.
Some top-down calculations will be necessary to measure the impact of measures implemented after 1995 (and in certain cases 1991) that continue to have impact. 1.2.
The findings should be compared to a control group (non-participation group) if possible or, alternatively, normalised as described in point 1.2.
How to verify energy savings If deemed cost-effective and necessary, the energy savings obtained through a specific energy service or other energy efficiency improvement measure shall be verified by a third party.
The appropriate Member State authorities or agencies referred to in Article 4(3) may provide further instructions on this matter.

The European Parliament adopted its opinion at first reading on 7 June 2005 [4], approving 97 amendments.
On 23 September 2005 the Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251 of the EC Treaty.
Council rejected the following 60 amendments: 2, 4, 5 and 10 (which are linked) 6, 8, 9, 15, 18, 101, 20, 24-32, 34, 104, 107, 108, 38-41, 43-46, 51-55, 59-62, 65-68, 71, 72, 75, 77, 78, 81, 84, 85, 89, 91, 93-96, 109, of which amendments 4, 18, 20, 24-25, 53, 55, 59, 61-62, 67-68, 77, 81, 89, 91, 101 and 104 were not acceptable to the Commission.
Specific remarks (a) The main changes introduced by Council concern the targets in Articles 4 and 5: - Article 4: the common position contains an indicative target of 6 % for the sixth year of application of the Directive (Article 4(1) and recital 8a) instead of mandatory targets; Member States are obliged to take measures which will contribute towards achieving the indicative target (Article 4(1)) and shall fix themselves an intermediate indicative target for the third year of application (Article 4(2)). - Article 5: the common position no longer contains a separate, higher target for the public sector (Article 5(1)); nonetheless, the public sector must fulfil an exemplary role, take one or more energy efficiency improvement measures (legislative initiatives and/or voluntary agreements [6] or other schemes with an equivalent effect), and Member States shall monitor its performance in relation to the national indicative savings target.
The Council chose to make the target indicative (rather than mandatory as proposed by the Commission) and to have no specific target for the public sector, on the following grounds: - Member States felt it would be inappropriate to be taken to the Court of Justice merely on grounds of non-achievement of the prescribed level of savings: for example, if a Member State achieved "only" 5 % savings after six years, instead of the prescribed 6 %.
In addition, a Comitology procedure is now included (Article 16, in line with amendments 76 and 99): its main tasks will be to further develop the calculation methodology set out in the Annexes (including an assessment of the appropriate balance to be struck between "top-down" and "bottom-up" measurements) and to adapt it to technical developments.
Article 5(5) was deleted since it is unnecessary in view of the Commission's right of initiative. - Article 6 was restructured: points (b) and (c) were taken up in paragraph 1, whilst point (a) has been reformulated in paragraph 2.
This paragraph 2 offers Member States a choice between different obligations to be imposed on the companies covered by this Article. - Article 7: this Article was extremely far-reaching and potentially very costly to implement in its original form, since it made Member States responsible for ensuring that all energy efficiency measures would be offered to all customers.
This Article was adapted so that Member States have to ensure the availability of such schemes where necessary — effectively allowing Member States to take into account other relevant factors (for example, the level of maturity of the market in question, number of market players and demand) before developing these (costly) schemes. - In Article 10, a provision has been added which allows, in certain circumstances, schemes and tariff structures with a social aim. - Two paragraphs have been added to Article 12: - paragraph 2 ensures that other, less costly audit measures may be used in certain cases, - paragraph 3 specifies that premises certified under the "Buildings Directive" have fulfilled the audit requirements; furthermore, it allows audits resulting from schemes based on voluntary agreements. - Article 13 has been adapted to make it more flexible and less costly, and to avoid a disproportionate administrative burden. - The reporting requirements of Article 14 have been streamlined and amended: paragraph 1 enables the Commission to take account of existing calculation methods, paragraph 2 now foresees that Member States have to submit one interim report and one final report. - A new Article 15 has been added, which specifies the tasks, as well as the schedule therefore, of the Commission in the context of the Comitology procedure.
Once the Commission has completed this task, it should continue its work in order to assess whether the percentage of bottom-up calculations can be further increased, weighing the factors which are of relevance (Article 15(3)); if the Commission thus decides that the percentage of bottom-up calculations can indeed be increased, Member States must use this new methodology two years after the date of application. - In Article 18, a period of transposition of two years replaces the unrealistic deadline of 1 June 2006 proposed by the Commission.
In point 3, Council changed the date proposed by the Commission as cut-off date after which, as a general rule, measures may be taken into account in the calculation of annual savings, from 1991 to 1995.
In addition, changes were made to several of the examples listed. - In Annex IV, Council added details describing the top-down and bottom-up calculation methods (point 1.1), a list of harmonised lifetimes of energy efficiency improvement measures in bottom-up calculations (point 4) and provisions pertaining to multiplier effects and double counting (point 5).
