Done at Brussels, 19 November 1973.
For the Council The President Ib FREDERIKSEN (1)OJ No L 202, 6.9.1971, p. 1.
Definitions 1.1.
for measures which have to be used under a specified tractive force, an increase or decrease of 10 % in that force does not produce a variation in length exceeding the maximum permissible error. 3.
Graduation and numbering 4.1.
The graduation and numbering shall be clear, regular, indelible and carried out in such a way that they enable a sure, simple and unambiguous reading to be made. 4.2.
The value of the scale interval shall be in the form 1 × 10n, 2 × 10n or 5 × 10n metres, the power of %quot%n%quot% being a positive or negative whole number or zero.
It shall, at most, be equal to: - 1 cm on measures of a nominal length less than or equal to 2 mm, - 10 cm if the nominal length is over 2 m and less than 10 m, - 20 cm if the nominal length is over or equal to 10 m and less than 50 m, - 50 cm if the nominal length is over or equal to 50 m.
In that case, the thickness of the lines may be less in the areas of reduced scale-intervals than in the rest of the measure. 4.5.
When the numbering unit is other than the metre, the metre scale-marks may however be numbered in metres.
When the value of the interval of a scale with lines is in the form of 2 × 10n and not less than 2 centimetres, all the scale-marks shall be numbered. 4.7.
Nominal length 5.1.
The nominal length of the measures shall be one of the following values : 0 75 - 1 - 1 75 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 m, or a complete multiple of 5 metres. 5.2.
nominal length; 6.1.1.2.
indication of the class of accuracy : I, II or III; 6.1.1.4.
reference temperature if it is other than 20 ºC; 6.1.2.2.
The obligatory inscriptions, with the exception of the EEC pattern approval sign, and the location of advertising inscriptions shall appear on the model which is the subject of the EEC pattern approval. 7.
Maximum permissible errors 7.1.
The measures of length defined in this Directive shall be divided into three classes, designated I, II and III, according to their degree of accuracy.
In EEC initial verification of measures of length, the maximum permissible error, plus or minus on the nominal length or on the distance between any two scale marks of a measure of length, shall be expressed as a function of the length in question by a formula in the form (a + b L) millimetres in which: - L is the length in question, rounded up to the next whole metre above; - %quot%a%quot% and %quot%b%quot% are coefficients fixed for each class of accuracy according to the following table: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0004945%quot%%gt% 7.2.
In addition, for an end measure of length, or a composite measure, the maximum permissible error, plus or minus, on the length of the terminal interval bounded by a surface shall be increased: - by 0 71 mm for measures of class I; - by 0 72 mm for measures of class II; - by 0 73 mm for measures of class III. 7.4.
The maximum permissible error for measures in service shall be equal to twice the maximum permissible error in the initial verification fixed in paragraph 7.1. 7.5.
Measures of length for which a tractive force is indicated in item 9 below, shall undergo tests, sustained over the whole length under inspection, in practice without friction, on a horizontal plane and under the tractive force indicated on the measure. 8.
Verification marks Every measure of length shall be constructed in such a way that it is able to receive the verification marks laid down by the Council Directive of 26 July 1971, on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to common provisions, for both measuring instruments and methods of metrological control.
Nominal length between 0 75 and 50 metres.
The tractive force, of about 20 N, shall be indicated.
These measures shall belong to classes of accuracy I, II or III. 9.2.
Measures made in one piece, rigid or semi-rigid in metal or other material (for measurements not requiring particular care).
Nominal length between 0 75 and 5 metres.
These measures shall belong to accuracy class II. 9.3.
Folding measures made of metal or other material.
Nominal length between 0 75 and 5 metres.
Their jointing and their alignment in the open position shall be ensured by an effective device so constructed as not to cause an additional error at the joint exceeding 0 73 mm, for measures in classes of accuracy I and II and 0 75 mm for measures in class III.
These measures shall belong to classes of accuracy I, II or III. 9.4.
Nominal length of between 0.5 and 5 metres.
These measures shall belong to the classes of accuracy I or II. 9.4.2.
Nominal length : 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 or 200 metres.
The tractive force, of about 50 N, shall be shown on the measure.
These measures shall belong to classes of accuracy I or II. 9.4.3.
Nominal length between 5 and 100 metres.
The tractive force, of about 50 N, shall be shown on the measure.
These measures shall belong to classes of accuracy I or II. 9.4.4.
Nominal length between 5 and 50 metres.
These measures shall belong to the classes of accuracy I or II.
However, the maximum permissible error of the instrument in position for use with the sinker shall never be less than 0 76 mm. 9.5.
Measures of length made of metal in one piece for careful measurement: - rigid or semi-rigid (nominal length between 0 75 and 5 m) used particularly as dipsticks, - flexible (nominal length between 1 and 200 m).
The tractive force, of around 50 N, shall be shown on flexible measures.
These measures shall belong to classes of accuracy I or II.
