Article 3 For administrative purposes the code number assigned to the product group %quot%detergents for dishwashers%quot% shall be %quot%015%quot%.
Producers of products falling within the product group %quot%detergents for dishwashers%quot% which have already been awarded the eco-label before 1 January 2003 may continue to use that label until 31 May 2004.
In these cases the label may be used until 31 May 2004.
Article 6 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 29 November 2002.
For the Commission Margot Wallstr√∂m Member of the Commission (1) OJ L 237, 21.9.2000, p. 1. (2) OJ L 167, 2.7.1999, p. 38. (3) OJ L 56, 27.2.2002, p. 33.
The dosage recommended by the manufacturer to consumers for normally soiled dishes and 12 place settings is taken as a reference dosage under standard conditions, as laid down in the IKW washing performance test referred to in criterion 6.
Environmental scoring matrix The following five parameters are included in an environmental matrix and are aggregated and assessed as a whole, as presented below: - total chemicals, - critical dilution volume, toxicity (CDVtox), - phosphates (expressed as sodium tripolyphosphate - STPP), - aerobic non-biodegradable organics (aNBDO), - anaerobic non-biodegradable organics (anNBDO).
The CDVtox is summed for each ingredient (i), making the CDVtox for the product: CDVtox = [sum ] CDVtox (ingredient i) CDVtox shall be %amp%lt;= 200 l/wash.
Score (CDVtox) = (5 - (CDVtox/60)) x 8 Assessment and verification: The exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the Competent Body, together with the details of the CDVtox calculations and the related score.
The reference test for anaerobic degradability shall be ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent test method, with the requirement of 60 % ultimate degradability under anaerobic conditions.
The tests for ready biodegradability shall be as referred to in Directive 67/548/EEC, and its subsequent amendments, in particular the methods detailed in Annex V.C4, or their equivalent OECD 301 A-F test methods, or their equivalent ISO tests.
The pass levels shall be 70 % for the tests referred to in Annex V.C4-A and C4-B of Directive 67/548/EEC (and their equivalent OECD 301 A and E tests and ISO equivalents), and shall be 60 % for tests C4-C, D, E and F (and their equivalent OECD 301 B, C, D and F tests and ISO equivalents). (b) Anaerobic biodegradability Each surfactant used in the product shall be anaerobically biodegradable.
For surfactants which are not included in the DID list, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are anaerobically biodegradable shall be provided.
The reference test for anaerobic degradability shall be ISO 11734, Ecetoc No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent test method, with the requirement of 60 % ultimate degradability under anaerobic conditions.
Test methods simulating the conditions in a relevant anaerobic environment may also be used to document that 60 % ultimate degradability has been attained under anaerobic conditions (see Appendix IC). 3.
Washing performance The product shall have a satisfactory washing performance at the recommended dosage according to the standard test developed by IKW or the EN 50242 (modified as below).
Non-biodegradable organics (anaerobic): flow diagram to define correction factors (CF)(3) %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2003009EN.002401.TIF%quot%%gt% (1) OJ L 227, 8.9.1993, p. 9. (2) OJ L 84, 5.4.1993, p. 1. (3) The correction factors are to be established on the basis of the ingredient properties and applied to the dosage expressed in g/wash.
If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant (or a group of homologues) according to the DID-list, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (e.g., C12-15 A 1-3 EO sulphate (DID No 8) is anaerobically biodegradable, and a similar anaerobic biodegradability may also be assumed for C12-15 A 6 EO sulphate).
Testing at low dosages may be performed by use of OECD 308 (August 2000) or an equivalent method.
