Proposal for a Council Directive amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include fenarimol as active substance /* COM/2006/0538 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.9.2006 COM(2006) 538 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include fenarimol as active substance (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Conclusions: The attached draft proposal for a Council Directive concerns the inclusion under strict conditions of fenarimol as active substance in the positive list (Annex I) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.
Consequently, pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 91/414/EEC and in accordance with Article 5 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC, the Commission is required to submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken, the Council having three months in which to act by a qualified majority.
The draft Directive is not subject to the right of scrutiny of the European Parliament (Article 8 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC).
That list includes fenarimol. (2) For fenarimol the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier.
Equally, the fact that the inclusion of this substance in Annex I expires on a particular date does not prevent the inclusion being renewed according to the procedures laid down in the Directive. (12) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data.
Article 2 Member States shall adopt and publish by 30 June 2007 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.
They shall apply those provisions from 1 July 2007.
Member States shall in accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing fenarimol as an active substance by 30 June 2007.
By that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to that Directive relating to fenarimol are met, with the exception of those identified in part B of the entry concerning that active substance, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive in accordance with the conditions of Article 13. 2.
Following that determination Member States shall for products containing fenarimol, where necessary, amend or withdraw the authorisation by 30 June 2008.
Article 4 This Directive shall enter into force on 1 January 2007.
Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Member States must ensure that the authorisation holders report at the latest on 31 December of each year on incidences of operator health problems.
They shall ensure that the notifier at whose request fenarimol has been included in this Annex provide such studies to the Commission within 2 years of the adoption of the above test guidelines. | ” [1] OJ L 230, 19.8.1991, p. 1.
