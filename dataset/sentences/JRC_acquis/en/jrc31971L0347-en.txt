Article 5 The measuring instruments used for trading purposes to determine the EEC standard mass per storage volume of grain shall fulfil the requirements of Annex II.
Article 8 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
The capacity measure is in the form of an upright, circular cylinder ; its upper edge is ground flat along a plane perpendicular to its axis. 2.2.
Filling device 3.1.
Scraper device 4.1.
After filling and weighing the capacity measure, the excess grain on the scraper blade in the filling ring is collected in a container. 5.
Weighing device 5.1.
The capacity measure, filled with grain, is weighed on an equal arm balance of 50 kg capacity. 5.2.
The frame of the instrument is equipped with a plumb line at least 500 mm long, or with a spirit level.
The relative humidity of the ambient air shall not exceed 60 %.
The support 14a prevents deformation of the rails along which the rollers of the carriage 14 travel.
When the scraper blade 9 reaches its final position, use the lever 15 to withdraw the capacity measure 1 standing on the carriage 14, remove the measure from this carriage, place it on the scales and weigh its contents to within Â± 5 g.
The differences between the separate values given by P and their mean value may not exceed = 10 g. 2.1.2.
The maximum permissible error is = 10 g. 2.1.3.
The readings provided by the instrument can be altered by moving the regulation device 7 to a higher or lower position.
The regulating device 7 is moved and the check described in item 2.1 is repeated. 3.
