Transfers must not affect quotas' economic viability and must therefore not involve any breakdown of quantities. (3) Point C of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 provides that producers are to receive nothing by way of the variable part of the premium on batches fetching between the minimum price and the minimum price plus 40 % for each group of varieties of the producer group.
Where there is provision for a reduction in the threshold guarantee for a group of varieties in respect of the following harvest, the Commission may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92, authorise interested Member States to bring forward the allocation of quantities of up to 10 % of the guarantee threshold for the same group of varieties and that are available in the national reserve for the group of varieties concerned pursuant to the second indent of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
