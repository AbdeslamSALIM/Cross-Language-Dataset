This programme is ongoing and it has not been possible yet to complete decision making on a number of active substances. (3) As regards the 90 active substances covered by the first stage of the above programme of work, 67 have been the subject of a directive or a decision.
This leaves 23 active substances for which work continues.
As regards the 53 active substances covered by the second stage of the above programme of work, one has been the subject of a decision.
This leaves 52 active substances for which work continues.
Consequently, more time should be allocated to the assessment of the second stage substances than to those covered by the first stage which already have passed this part of the process. (4) The Commission√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s progress report of 26 July 2001 [4] explained why progress has not been as good as was originally anticipated.
The initial slowness, the technical complexity of certain dossiers, the necessity to obtain the opinion of independent scientific circles and other unforeseen factors, have eroded, in a number of cases, the time necessary for the decision-making and the implementing measures. (5) It is envisaged that all the substances covered by the first and second stage of the above review programme should be the subject of a specific act adopted before 31 December 2005 (for the first stage) or 30 September 2006 (for the second stage).
