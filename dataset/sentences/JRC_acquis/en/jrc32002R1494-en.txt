The provisions on the destruction of bovine embryos and ova from BSE cases and the BSE-related trade conditions for bovine embryos and ova should therefore be repealed. (11) It is necessary to clarify the rules on the removal and control of specified risk material. (12) In its opinion of 27 June 2002 on the Geographical BSE Risk of certain third countries, the SSC concluded that, in addition to previously evaluated countries, the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is highly unlikely in Iceland and in Vanuatu.

Annex III is replaced by the following: %quot%ANNEX III MONITORING SYSTEM CHAPTER A I.
Monitoring in bovine animals 1.
Monitoring in animals slaughtered for human consumption 2.1.
All bovine animals over 30 months of age: - subject to normal slaughter for human consumption, or - slaughtered in the context of a disease eradication campaign in accordance with Annex I, Chapter VI, point 28(c), to Directive 64/433/EEC, but showing no clinical signs of disease, shall be tested for BSE. 2.3.
The sample shall comprise at least 10000 animals per year. 3.
All bovine animals over 24 months of age which have died or been killed but which were not: - killed for destruction pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 716/96(2), - killed in the framework of an epidemic, such as foot-and-mouth disease, - slaughtered for human consumption, shall be tested for BSE. 3.2.
Member States may decide to derogate from the provisions of point 3.1 in remote areas with a low animal density, where no collection of dead animals is organised.
The derogation shall not cover more than 10 % of the bovine population in the Member State. 4.
Monitoring in animals purchased for destruction pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 716/96 4.1.
A random sample comprising at least 10000 animals annually of animals not covered by points 4.1 or 4.2 shall be tested for BSE. 5.
Where an animal slaughtered for human consumption has been selected for testing for BSE, the health marking provided for in Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC shall not be carried out on the carcass of that animal until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained. 6.2.
All parts of the body of an animal tested for BSE including the hide shall be retained under official control until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained, unless they are destroyed in accordance with Annex V, point 3 or 4. 6.4.
All parts of the body of an animal found positive to the rapid test including the hide shall be destroyed in accordance with Annex V, point 3 or 4, apart from material to be retained in conjunction with the records provided for in Chapter B, section III. 6.5.
Monitoring in ovine and caprine animals 1.
General Monitoring in ovine and caprine animals shall be carried out in accordance with the laboratory methods laid down in Annex X, Chapter C, point 3.2(b). 2.
The sampling shall be representative for each region and season.
Monitoring in animals not slaughtered for human consumption Animals over 18 months of age or which have more than two permanent incisors erupted through the gum which have died or been killed, but which were not: - killed in the framework of an epidemic, such as foot-and-mouth disease, - slaughtered for human consumption, shall be tested in accordance with the sample size indicated in the table.
The sampling shall be representative for each region and season.
The derogation shall not cover more than 10 % of the ovine and caprine population in the Member State. %gt%TABLE%gt% 4.
Monitoring in other animals In addition to the monitoring programmes set out in points 2 and 3, Member States may on a voluntary basis carry out monitoring in other animals, in particular: - animals used for dairy production, - animals originating from countries with indigenous TSEs, - animals which have consumed potentially contaminated feedingstuffs, - animals born or derived from TSE infected dams, - animals from flocks infected with TSE 5.
Where an animal slaughtered for human consumption has been selected for testing for TSE, the health marking provided for in Chapter XI of Annex I to Directive 64/433/EEC shall not be carried out on the carcass of that animal until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained. 5.2.
All parts of the body of a tested animal including the hide shall be retained under official control until a negative result to the rapid test has been obtained, unless they are destroyed in accordance with Annex V, point 3 or 4. 5.4.
All parts of the body of an animal found positive to the rapid test including the hide shall be destroyed in accordance with Annex V, point 3 or 4, apart from material to be retained in conjunction with the records provided for in Chapter B, Section III. 6.
TSE cases found in resistant genotypes (sheep of genotypes which encode alanin on both alleles at codon 136, arginin on both alleles at codon 154 and arginin on both alleles at codon 171) shall immediately be reported to the Commission.
This sub-sample shall represent at least one per cent of the total sample for each Member State, and shall not be less than 100 animals per Member State.
Monitoring in other animal species Member States may on a voluntary basis carry out monitoring for TSE in animal species other than bovine, ovine and caprine animals.
The estimated size of each subpopulation referred to in Chapter A, Section I, points 3 and 4. 5.
The number of bovine animals tested within each subpopulation referred to in Chapter A, Section I, point 2 to 5, the method for sample selection and the outcome of the tests. 6.
The number of ovine and caprine animals and flocks tested within each subpopulation referred to in Chapter A, Section II, points 2 to 4, the method for sample selection and the outcome of the tests. 8.
The investigating laboratory shall keep, for seven years, all records of testing, in particular laboratory workbooks and, where appropriate, paraffin blocks and photographs of Western blots. (1) OJ 121, 29.7.1964, p. 2012/64. (2) OJ L 99, 20.4.1996, p. 14.%quot% 2.
