Proposal for a Council Regulation imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain broad spectrum antibiotics originating in India /* COM/2005/0110 final */ Brussels, 4.4.2005 COM(2005) 110 final Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain broad spectrum antibiotics originating in India (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM On 8 October 2003, the Commission initiated upon substantiated request of two Community producers a combined expiry and interim review of the countervailing duty in force in respect of imports of certain broad spectrum antibiotics originating in India.
The review investigation confirmed (i) continuing subsidisation of the product concerned on a higher level than established in the original investigation, which (ii) continues to cause injury to the Community industry.
Previous investigation and existing measures (1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2164/98[2], imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain broad spectrum antibiotics, namely amoxicillin trihydrate, ampicillin trihydrate and cefalexin not put up in measured doses or in forms or packings for retail sale (‘the product concerned’) falling within CN codes ex 2941 10 10, ex 2941 10 20 and ex 2941 90 00 originating in India.
The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty ranging between 0% and 12% imposed on imports from individually named exporters with a residual duty rate of 14,6% imposed on imports from other exporters.
Request for a combined expiry and interim review (2) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry[3] of the definitive measures in force, the Commission received a request for the initiation of a combined expiry and interim review of Council Regulation (EC) No 2164/98 pursuant to Articles 18(2) and 19(2) of the basic Regulation, from related Community producers of the like product, Sandoz GmbH, Austria, and Sandoz Industrial Products S.A., Spain, (‘the applicants’).
Investigation period (6) The investigation covered the period from 1April 2002 to 31 March 2003 (‘the review investigation period’ or ‘IP’).
The examination of trends in the context of injury covered the period from 1 January 1999 up to the end of the review investigation period (‘the period considered’).
The written and oral comments submitted by the parties were considered and, where appropriate, taken into account. (8) In view of the apparently large number of exporting producers of the product concerned in India which were named in the request, the use of sampling techniques for the investigation of subsidisation was envisaged in accordance with Article 27 of the basic Regulation. (9) However, only a limited number of exporting producers made themselves known and provided the information requested for sampling.
Community producers DSM Anti-Infectives B.V., Delft (The Netherlands), which also replied to the Commission’s questionnaire on behalf of DSM Anti-Infectives Deretil S.A., Almeria, (Spain) and DSM Anti-Infectives Chemferm S.A., Santa Perpetua de Mogoda, (Spain).
Exporting producers in India KDL Biotech Ltd. (formerly Kopran Ltd.), Mumbai, Orchid Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals Ltd., Chennai, Nectar Lifesciences Ltd., Chandigarh, Nestor Pharmaceuticals Ltd., New Delhi, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., New Delhi, Torrent Gujarat Biotech Ltd., Ahmedabad, Surya Pharmaceutical Ltd., Chandigarh.
Thus, since all types form one product for the purpose of this proceeding, which is produced by the applicants, this argument has to be refuted. (15) The GOI and one exporting producer contended that the non-confidential questionnaire replies of the Community producers were not sufficiently detailed and not filed in accordance with Article 29 of the basic Regulation.
In any event, the file available for inspection by interested parties contains the non-confidential replies to the questionnaire of both co-operating Community producers, where confidential data have been provided in index form in order to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence.
Therefore, the non-confidential questionnaire replies of the Community producers are still considered in line with the provisions of Article 29 of the basic Regulation.
One Export and Import Policy document is relevant to the review investigation period of this case; i.e.
The Handbook of Procedure is also updated on a regular basis. (23) The Income Tax Schemes specified above under (e) are based on the Income Tax Act of 1961, which is amended yearly by the Finance Act. (24) The Export Credit Scheme specified above under (f) is based on sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, which allow the Reserve Bank of India (‘RBI’) to direct commercial banks in the field of export credits. 2.
In this case, these three schemes and the regional schemes investigated were not investigated during the original investigation. (28) However, the relevant provisions of the basic Regulation concerning interim and expiry reviews do not stipulate such a narrow approach in reviews.
supply of goods to an EOU or to a company situated in a special economic zone (‘SEZ’). (v) ARO: The ALS holder intending to source the inputs from indigenous sources, in lieu of direct import, has the option to source them against AROs.
The refund of taxes/duties is available both for indigenous inputs as well as imported inputs. (vi) Back to back inland letter of credit: This sub-scheme again covers indigenous supplies to an ALS holder.
The holder of an ALS can approach a bank for opening an inland letter of credit in favour of an indigenous supplier.
an actual consumption register (“appendix 18 register”). (33) In regard to the sub-schemes (i), (iii) and (iv) listed above under recital (31), both the import allowance and the export (including deemed export) obligation are fixed in volume and value by the GOI and are documented on the licence.
The export obligation must be fulfilled within a prescribed time frame after issuance of the licence (18 months with two possible extensions of 6 months each).
a financial contribution of the GOI which conferred a benefit upon the investigated exporters. (39) In addition, ALS physical exports, ALS for annual requirement and ALS for intermediate supply are clearly contingent in law upon export performance, and therefore deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation.
The GOI did not effectively apply its verification system or procedure to confirm whether and in what amounts inputs were consumed in the production of the exported product (Annex II(II)(4) of the basic Regulation and, in the case of substitution drawback schemes, Annex III(II)(2) of the basic Regulation).
Thus, it is confirmed that the SIONs themselves cannot be considered a verification system of actual consumption, because the design of those overly generous standard norms does not enable the GOI to verify with sufficient precision what amount of inputs were consumed in the export production.
In addition, the GOI did not carry out a further examination based on actual inputs involved, although this would normally need to be carried out in the absence of an effectively applied verification system (Annex II(II)(5) and Annex III(II)(3) to the basic Regulation), nor did it prove, that no excess remission took place.
In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, these subsidy amounts have been allocated over the export turnover generated by the product concerned during the review investigation period as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is contingent upon export performance and was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported. (47) Six companies benefited from this scheme during the review investigation period and obtained subsidies of between 22,0% and 25,8% (see table in recital (154) below). 2.
Therefore, there is no possibility for a retroactive amendment to the level of the benefit. (52) It was also found that in accordance with Indian accounting standards, DEPBS credits can be booked on an accrual basis as income in the commercial accounts, upon fulfilment of the export obligation. (53) Such credits can be used for payment of customs duties on subsequent imports of any goods unrestrictedly importable, except capital goods.
Goods imported against such credits can be sold on the domestic market (subject to sales tax) or used otherwise. (54) DEPBS credits are freely transferable and valid for a period of 12 months from the date of issue. (55) An application for DEPBS credits can cover up to 25 export transactions and, if electronically filed, an unlimited amount of export transactions.
They submitted that (i) contrary to the findings in recitals (53) and (59) materials imported under the DEPBS allegedly have to be used for export production and DEPBS credit can allegedly only be obtained if goods are exported which bear import duties on its input materials, (ii) the new calculation methodology for countervailable amounts (focus on the export transaction, see below under recital (61) to (62)) should not be used, because a benefit is allegedly only conferred upon usage of the credit and for the reason that the new approach discriminatorily departs from earlier EC-precedence, (iii) DEBPS should only be countervailed to the extent that such credits were obtained for the product concerned and (iv) a DEPBS-rate reduction which took place in February 2004 should be taken into consideration. (e) Conclusions on the DEPBS (57) The DEPBS provides subsidies within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) and Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
In addition, the DEPBS credit confers a benefit upon the exporter, because it improves its liquidity. (58) Furthermore, the DEPBS is contingent in law upon export performance, and therefore deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation. (59) This scheme cannot be considered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.
Moreover, there is no system or procedure in place to confirm which inputs are consumed in the production process of the exported product or whether an excess payment of import duties occurred within the meaning of item (i) of Annex I and Annexes II and III of the basic Regulation.
Furthermore, the disclosure comments have confirmed that at the moment of the export transaction made under this scheme an exporter has obtained an irrevocable entitlement for DEPBS credits.
In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation these subsidy amounts have been allocated over the total export turnover during the review investigation period as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is contingent upon export performance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.
Export Oriented Units Scheme (‘EOUS’)/Special Economic Zones Scheme (‘SEZS’) (a) Legal basis (67) The details of these schemes are contained in chapters 6 (EOUS) and 7 (SEZS) respectively of the EXIM-policy 02-07 and of the HOP I 02-07. (b) Eligibility (68) With the exception of pure trading companies, all enterprises which, in principle, undertake to export their entire production of goods or services may be set up under the SEZS or the EOUS.
SEZs are specifically delineated duty free enclaves and considered by the EXIM-policy 02-07 as foreign territory for the purpose of trade operations, duties and taxes. 14 SEZs already operate and another 13 SEZs have been approved by the Indian authorities for establishment. (70) EOUs on the other side, are geographically more flexible and can be established anywhere in India.
For instance, only an EOU can obtain a 50% reduction of duties payable upon domestic sales (DTA sales), whereas in an SEZ 100% of the duties are payable on such sales.
An EOU unit can sell up to 50% of its turnover domestically at such reduced rate. (75) Units operating under these schemes are bonded under the surveillance of customs officials in accordance with Section 65 of the Customs Act. (76) They are legally obliged to maintain, in a specified format, a proper account of all imports, of the consumption and utilisation of all imported materials and of the exports made.
These documents should be submitted periodically, as may be required, to the competent authorities (“quarterly and annual progress reports”). (77) However, “at no point in time [an EOU or a SEZ unit] shall be required to co-relate every import consignment with its exports, transfers to other units, sales in DTA or stocks”, paragraph 10.2 of appendix 14-I and paragraph 13.2 of appendix 14-II of the HOP I 02-07. (78) Domestic sales are dispatched and recorded on a self-certification basis.
Thus, it availed of all benefits as described in recital (73) above under (i) to (iv).
However, as the said income tax exemption falls under the more generally available income tax exemption scheme, the analysis thereof is set out in recitals (117) and (118) below. (d) Disclosure comments (81) Upon disclosure, one exporting producer submitted that the EOUS should, if at all, only be countervailed insofar as duties paid for domestic sales do not fully cover the amount of import duties exempted on input materials used for domestically sold production (“excess remission”).
It also claimed that the periodical assessment of the monthly sales tax returns by the GOI is sufficient to meet the verification standards set by the basic Regulation. (82) Furthermore it contended, that (i) for calculation purposes not the amount of raw materials imported during the review investigation period as set out in recital 19 of the annual progress report of this EOU should be taken, but the amount of raw materials consumed during this period as set out in recital 20 of this report and (ii) the allocation period concerning duties saved upon importation of capital goods should be based on the company specific depreciation period and not on the basis of an average depreciation period for all co-operating exporting producers.
Government revenue which would be due in the absence of this scheme is forgone, thus, in addition, conferring a benefit upon the EOU in the meaning of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, because it saved liquidity by not having to pay duties normally due and by obtaining a sales tax reimbursement. (84) The exemption from excise duty and its import duty equivalent (“additional customs duty”), however, do not lead to revenue forgone which is otherwise due.
They are contingent in law upon export performance, and therefore deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation.
The export objective of an EOU as set out in paragraph 6.1 of the EXIM-policy 02-07 is a conditio sine qua non to obtain the incentives. (86) Furthermore, these subsidies cannot, contrary to the submission made by one exporter, be considered as permissible duty drawback systems or substitution drawback systems within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.
The exporter objected to this analysis and argued that since capital goods are necessary for production, they cannot be per se excluded from any permitted duty drawback.
The argument is therefore rejected. (88) In addition, and also concerning the other benefits which are available under this scheme, despite careful consideration of the submissions made by the exporter, it was confirmed that the GOI has no effective verification system or procedure in place to confirm whether and in what amounts duty and or sales tax free procured inputs were consumed in the production of the exported product (Annex II(II)(4) of the basic Regulation and, in the case of substitution drawback schemes, Annex III(II)(2) of the basic Regulation). (89) An EOU is allowed to sell a significant amount of its production, up to 50% of its annual turnover, on the domestic market.
Fees necessarily incurred to obtain the subsidy were deducted in accordance with Article 7(1)(a) of the basic Regulation from this sum to arrive at the subsidy amount as nominator.
Fees necessarily incurred to obtain the subsidy were deducted in accordance with Article 7(1)(a) of the basic Regulation from this sum to arrive at the subsidy amount as nominator.
In accordance with Article 7(2) and 7(3) of the basic Regulation this subsidy amount has been allocated over the export turnover generated by the sector during the review investigation period as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is contingent upon export performance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.
Since April 2000 the scheme provides for a reduced import duty rate of 5% applicable to all capital goods imported under the scheme.
In order to meet the export obligation, the imported capital goods must be used to produce a certain amount of export goods during a certain period. (100) The EPCGS licence holder can also source the capital goods indigenously.
In addition, the duty reduction confers a benefit upon the exporter, because the duties saved upon importation improve its liquidity. (103) Furthermore, the EPCGS is contingent in law upon export performance, since such licences can not be obtained without a commitment to export.
Therefore it is deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation. (104) Eventually, this scheme can not be considered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.
The commercial interest rate during the review investigation period in India was considered appropriate for this purpose.
Fees necessarily incurred to obtain the subsidy were deducted in accordance with Article 7(1)(a) of the basic Regulation from this sum to arrive at the subsidy amount as nominator.
In accordance with Article 7(2) and 7(3) of the basic Regulation this subsidy amount has been allocated over the export turnover during the review investigation period as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is contingent upon export performance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.
Rate differences with regard to different banks are the result of the methodology of the RBI to set maximum lending rates for each commercial bank individually.
In addition, but for the RBI Master Circulars, commercial banks would not be obliged to pass through to borrowers of export financing any perhaps more advantageous interest rates for export credits in foreign currency.
Secondly, and despite the fact that the preferential credits under the ECS are granted by commercial banks, this benefit is a financial contribution by a government in the meaning of Article 2(1)(iv) of the basic Regulation.
The RBI directs private bodies, since the commercial banks are bound by the conditions, inter alia the maximum ceilings for interest rates on export credits mandated in the RBI Master Circulars and the RBI provisions that commercial banks have to provide a certain amount of their net bank credit towards export finance.
This direction obliges commercial banks to carry out functions mentioned in Article 2(1)(a)(i) of the basic Regulation, in this case loans in the form of preferential export financing.
Income Tax Schemes (a) Export Income Tax Exemption Scheme (‘EITES’) (i) Section 80HHC of the Income Tax Act 1961 (‘ITA’) (115) It was established that four of the investigated exporters received the benefit of a partial income tax exemption on profits derived from export sales during the review investigation period.
Consequently, 80HHC of the ITA will not confer any benefits on the applicant after 31 March 2004.
The artificial income tax base reduction under section 35(2AB) of the ITA constitutes a financial contribution by the GOI, since this decreases the GOI’s income tax revenue which would be otherwise due.
In addition, the income tax reduction confers a benefit upon the company, because it improves its liquidity. (124) The GOI argued and reiterated upon disclosure without substantiating it, that eligibility for ITIRAD is based on objective criteria and thus the scheme is not specific.
Eligibility for this scheme is not governed by objective criteria, which are neutral in the meaning of Article 3(2)(b) of the basic Regulation.
This restriction is not economic in nature and horizontal in application such as number of employees or size of enterprise. (125) In addition, the claim that expenditure incurred after 31 March 2005 is exempt from the scheme does not lead to its non-countervailability in the meaning of Article 15(1) of the basic Regulation.
Regional Schemes 1.
Industrial Incentive Schemes (‘IIS’) of the Governments of Gujarat and Punjab (127) The States of Gujarat and Punjab grant to eligible industrial enterprises, incentives in the form of exemption and/or deferment of sales and purchase tax in order to encourage the industrial development of economically backward areas within these States.
In addition, these incentives confer a benefit upon a company, because they improve its financial situation since taxes otherwise due are not paid. (134) Furthermore, the schemes are regionally specific in the meaning of Articles 3(2)(a) and 3(3) of the basic Regulation since they are only available to certain companies having invested within certain designated geographical areas within the jurisdiction of the States concerned.
However, and contrary to the disclosure submissions by two exporters in this respect as well, the scheme was not assessed as an export subsidy, within the meaning of Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation, with a direct focus on exports of the product concerned, but as otherwise specific (see recital (134)).
In addition, the GOI has provided no evidence that the general sales tax exemption for export sales covers purchase tax liabilities on input materials as well.
In fact, in the present case, the companies have also used the IIS to offset purchase tax liabilities. (136) The GOI further contended that the IIS, although admittedly limited to certain backward regions within the territories of Punjab and Gujarat, should not be considered as specific, because they allegedly do not favour certain enterprises within these specially designated regions.
However, the GOI admitted that not all kinds of production within those designated territories are eligible for the IIS.
In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, these amounts of subsidy (nominator) have then been allocated over total sales during the review investigation period as appropriate denominator, because the subsidy is not export contingent and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.
In addition, it confers a benefit upon the recipient company.
Although requested to do so, the company did not provide any information other than the Bombay Electricity Duty Act itself, which could have changed this analysis. (147) The GOI argued that since the scheme has not been countervailed in another case in 1999, because it was considered horizontal in application within a whole state, it should not be countervailed now.
It was established that one exporter under investigation, which is situated in Gujarat, used this scheme during the review investigation period.
Package Scheme of Incentives (‘PSI’) of the Government of Maharashtra (‘GOM’) (150) It was found that the exporting producers did not obtain any countervailable benefits under the PSI.
Consequently, the claim has to be disregarded.The amount of countervailable subsidies in accordance with the provisions of the basic Regulation, expressed ad valorem , for the investigated exporting producers ranges between 25,3 % and 35,1%. (154) Given the high level of co-operation, the subsidy rate for all non-co-operating companies is set at the level for the company with the highest individual rate, i.e. 35,1%.
Product concerned and like product | 2.482.053 | 3.240.481 | 3.254.464 | 3.801.666 | 3.745.549 | index | 100 | 131 | 131 | 153 | 151 | - (175) The GOI and one exporter submitted that the consumption details as set out above should have been disclosed in more detail, notably per Community producer and separating free and captive consumption.
Therefore, in view of Article 29 of the basic Regulation (“confidentiality”) it is not possible to disclose further details.
Concerning data for Community producers other than the Community industry it should be recalled that these producers did not co-operate with the investigation.
Imports of the product concerned into the Community 1.
Volume, price and market share of imports from India Imports (in kg) | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Product concerned | 36.800 | 47.400 | 72.100 | 101.800 | 95.200 | index | 100 | 129 | 196 | 277 | 259 | (177) The volume of imports of the product concerned increased significantly throughout the period considered.
Imports in the review investigation period were 159% greater than in 1999.
Average import price per kg in EUR | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Product concerned | 34,66 | 33,94 | 35,51 | 36,57 | 35,34 | index | 100 | 98 | 102 | 106 | 102 | (178) The average import price of the product concerned increased slightly with a peak in 2002 and subsequently fell back to the level before 2001.
EC market share | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Product concerned | 1,5% | 1,5% | 2,2% | 2,7% | 2,5% | index | 100 | 99 | 149 | 181 | 171 | (179) Indian imports’ market share on the Community market grew by 71% over the period considered.
Furthermore, this methodology has consistently been applied in all tables of this Regulation. 2.
Consequently, these price undercutting margins indicate continuous price pressure exerted by the Indian imports on the Community market despite the existence of measures.
Production, capacity and capacity utilisation 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index Production | 100 | 121 | 127 | 154 | 160 | Index Capacity | 100 | 117 | 123 | 148 | 157 | Index Capacity utilisation | 100 | 103 | 103 | 104 | 102 | (184) As a consequence of the steady increase in Community consumption, the Community industry's production of the like product increased continuously over the period considered.
ales volume, sales price, market share and growth (a) free market sales Free market sales in the Community | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index Volume | 100 | 170 | 162 | 192 | 180 | Index Average sales price | 100 | 94 | 94 | 94 | 95 | Index Market share | 100 | 130 | 123 | 125 | 120 | (188) Based on the favourable evolution of Community consumption, the volume of free market sales of the Community industry in the Community increased over the period considered.
The Community industry's free market sales volume showed a higher growth than the growth of Community consumption during the period considered.
However, between 2000 and the review investigation period, the increase of the Community industry’s free market sales volume was less than the increase of the Community consumption.
The large increase of the Community industry’s free market sales volume between 1999 and 2000 is mainly attributable to the taking over of another Community producer by the Community industry.
Nevertheless, the 80% increase of the free market sales volume of the Community industry in the Community during the period considered was less pronounced than the 159% increase of imports of the product concerned during the same period. (189) The GOI and four exporters pointed to the overall increase in sales of the Community industry as a positive sign and contended that it does not support an injury finding.
Prices remained practically stable at the lower level up to the end of the review investigation period although demand further grew. (192) The GOI and three exporters claimed that the price development should be considered as positive for the Community industry. (193) This claim cannot be accepted.
In fact, during the period considered the Community industry was at no time in the position to achieve non-injurious price levels. (194) The Community industry increased its market share by 30% from 1999 to 2000 to the detriment of the market shares held by the other Community producers and exporters from third countries other than India.
However, the Community industry’s market share fell from 2000 to the review investigation period when it reached its lowest level since 1999.
This period coincided with a strong acceleration in growth of the share of imports from India. (195) One exporter argued that the decrease in market share of the Community industry in 2001 and the IP would be insignificant in light of the increase in 2000 and it further pointed to its overall increase in market share over the period considered. (196) However, this submission cannot be accepted, because it is based on an isolated focus 1999 versus the IP, which moreover neglects the exceptional nature of the increase in the year 2000.
No explanation has been provided by this exporter why this obviously digressive development of the Community industry’s free market share after 2000 should not be considered as negative. (197) In this context, two other exporters argued that, given the more positive development on the captive market, this would be the result of a deliberate choice of the Community industry to opt for the more profitable formulations market. (198) This argument cannot be accepted as it ignores the increased stock which could have been sold to the free market. (b) captive sales Captive sales in the Community | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index Volume | 100 | 88 | 124 | 180 | 189 | Index Average sales price | 100 | 102 | 104 | 102 | 99 | Index Market share | 100 | 67 | 95 | 117 | 125 | (199) While the Community industry’s sales volume on the free market increased by 80% over the period considered, sales on the captive market increased by 89%.
In particular since 2001 an expansion on the Community industry’s captive market can be observed, whereas its situation on the free market remained practically unchanged.
Stocks Stocks | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index | 100 | 74 | 100 | 141 | 161 | (202) The Community industry's year-end stock levels in relation to production dropped by 26% from 1999 to 2000 but then sharply increased by more than 115% towards the end of the review investigation period.
This increase coincided in time with a doubling of the Indian imports over the same period. (203) The GOI and four exporters contended that the increase in stocks was not abnormally high, thus not showing injury.
In addition, it is pertinent that the Community industry was at no time during the period considered in a position to reach even half of the profit margin, which, according to the findings in the original investigation, it could reasonably have obtained in the absence of subsidised imports, i.e. 15%.
The development of the profitability and in particular its decline since 2002 is considered very important as it affects the level of financial resources available to the Community industry for investments in research and development that are necessary for further improvements to the production processes of existing products and the development of new products. (206) The GOI and four exporters submitted comments on the profitability analysis.
It was submitted that (i) the Community industry achieved reasonable profitability levels, (ii) that a non injurious profitability margin of 10% (see recital (260)), would be too high and instead 5% is sufficient, (iii) the profitability decline could be essentially attributed to the investment policy of the Community industry, (iv) the start up activities of one party qualify for self inflicted injury and (v) that the profitability development should have been disclosed for each Community producer. (207) It is reiterated that the Community industry was at no time during the period considered in a position to achieve reasonable profit margins as set out above.
Thus, the deterioration since 2002 only worsened an already unsatisfactory situation.
The Community industry has provided evidence that it can achieve for comparable bulk drugs profit figures of above 10%.
Finally, in view of Article 29 of the basic Regulation (“confidentiality”) it is not possible to disclose further details. (b) captive sales Profitability (Captive sales in the Community) | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index | 100 | 482 | 564 | 431 | 325 | (208) The profitability trends of captive sales follow the same line, although on a higher level, i.e.
The differences in profitability levels can mainly be attributed to the facts that (i) selling general and administrative costs (‘SG%amp%A’) for captive sales are lower, because they do not necessitate marketing costs, and (ii) to higher transfer prices as compared with prices on the free market.
Investments, return on investment, cash flow and the ability to raise capital 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index Investments | 0 | 100 | 300 | 1.123 | 351 | Index Return on investment | -100 | 160 | 286 | 161 | 91 | Index Cash flow | 100 | 186 | 71 | 160 | 33 | (209) After 1999 the Community industry continually made investments for the manufacture of the like product.
In particular in 2002, it strongly invested in new production techniques in order to remain competitive, improve environmental and security standards and increase production capacities. (210) From 1999 to 2001, i.e.
Price pressure exercised by competitors contributed to the unsatisfactory cash flow development as well. (212) The Community industry did not experience any significant difficulty to raise capital. (213) Upon disclosure it was submitted by the GOI and exporters that (i) the data above should have been disclosed separately for each Community producer separately, (ii) the ability to raise capital did not support an injury finding, (iii) that the cash flow allegedly cannot follow this trends in view of the trends for return on investments and profitability and should therefore be re-evaluated and (iv) without further substantiation the analysis would be insufficient. (214) In reply to these submissions it should be recalled that in accordance with Article 29 of the basic Regulation (“confidentiality”) the data cannot be disclosed separately for each Community producer.
Employment, productivity and wages 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Index Employment | 100 | 101 | 101 | 187 | 185 | Index Productivity | 100 | 120 | 127 | 83 | 86 | Index Wages | 100 | 103 | 106 | 185 | 178 | (215) Employment for the like product remained stable until 2001 but increased considerably in 2002 due to the setting up of a new production plant in the Community by one of the co-operating Community producers.
Magnitude of subsidy and recovery from past subsidisation (218) Given the volume and in particular the prices of the subsidised imports from India, the impact of the actual amount of subsidisation, which is significant, cannot be considered to be negligible. (219) In this context the GOI and three exporters submitted that the subsidy margins have been overstated. (220) However, as set out in recitals (153) and (154) above, the investigation has shown that the amount of countervailable subsidies expressed ad valorem for the investigated exporting producers ranges between 25,3 % and 35,1%.
Conclusion on the economic situation of the Community industry (222) Between 1999 and the review investigation period the volume of the subsidised imports of the product concerned increased significantly by 159% and their share of the Community market grew by 70%.
Imports from other countries to the Community market grew only by 7% during the period considered and their market share even decreased by 29%.
Since 2001 the trend in market share development for the Community industry is even digressive.
On a weighted average basis, price undercutting was in the review investigation period between 11,5% and 17,1%. (224) As a consequence of this price pressure exercised by subsidised Indian imports, the Community industry was at no time during the period considered in a position to reach non-injurious price levels.
However, only an acceptable level of profitability will allow the Community industry to remain viable in a sustainable way. (225) This negative tendency for the Community industry is further reflected in the picture displayed by the trends in return on investment and cash flow. (226) Regarding captive sales, the option for the Community industry to sell part of its production on the captive market provided it with the opportunity to maintain high levels of capacity utilisation.
Thus, it cannot change the conclusion that the captive sales did not contribute to the injury. (229) As a result, it was confirmed that, overall, the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation.
The Community industry was never in a position to achieve non injurious price levels during the period considered on the free market due to external price pressure, mainly from heavily subsidised Indian imports.
However, since then, Indian exporters not only have recovered their position, but in the review investigation period they even took over the lead as the largest exporter to the Community. (231) This growth in volume of the subsidised imports from India, in particular since 2002, coincided with the fact that in 2002, the profitability for the Community industry decreased as compared with 2001, i.e.
Moreover, as stated under recital (207), at no point in time was the Community industry in a position to reach non-injurious price levels.
To the contrary, again starting in 2002, the Community industry had to adjust prices downwards in order to defend its market share. (232) Upon disclosure, three exporters submitted that the Indian imports share on the Community market, 2,5% during the IP, and their volume in relation to total imports, 8,4% during the IP, both of which slightly decreased as compared with 2002, would be too small and marginal to have any injurious impact in particular in view of a bigger market share hold by the Community industry.
Furthermore, it was argued that an analysis expressed in relative terms would be misleading, because India started from a very low level, 1,5% market share and 3,7% import volume in 1999. (233) In reply to this submission it should be considered that both, India’s market share and its import volume during the IP, are well above the de minimis thresholds set in Articles 10(11) and 14(4) of the basic Regulation, thus can have a causal effect.
In fact, over the period considered the Indian prices set on average the price pressure benchmark in this case. (234) It was therefore confirmed that the subsidised imports from India had a considerable negative impact on the situation of the Community industry during the period considered, in particular in terms of profitability.
Impact of other factors 1.
Imports from other third countries Third country imports | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | IP | Volume (kg) | India | 36.800 | 47.400 | 72.100 | 101.800 | 95.200 | Index | 100 | 129 | 196 | 277 | 259 | Oman | 77.400 | 119.700 | 85.100 | 88.400 | 93.500 | Index | 100 | 155 | 110 | 114 | 121 | USA | 11.100 | 2.800 | 16.600 | 106.300 | 70.000 | Index | 100 | 25 | 149 | 932 | 631 | China | 0 | 3.900 | 21.800 | 75.600 | 63.000 | Index | 0 | 100 | 559 | 1938 | 1615 | South Korea | 19.800 | 75.300 | 40.200 | 54.500 | 45.000 | Index | 100 | 380 | 203 | 275 | 227 | Singapore | 0 | 4.600 | 128.300 | 62.700 | 37.700 | Index | 0 | 100 | 2789 | 1363 | 820 | average import price per kg (€) | India | 34,66 | 33,94 | 35,51 | 36,57 | 35,34 | Index | 100 | 98 | 102 | 106 | 102 | Oman | 36,10 | 36,21 | 39,30 | 39,15 | 38,34 | Index | 100 | 100 | 109 | 108 | 106 | USA | 74,87 | 115,35 | 108,90 | 101,40 | 48,74 | Index | 100 | 154 | 145 | 135 | 65 | China | 0,00 | 188,97 | 116,06 | 68,22 | 58,59 | Index | 0 | 100 | 61 | 36 | 31 | South Korea | 34,84 | 37,52 | 37,66 | 45,59 | 48,06 | Index | 100 | 108 | 108 | 131 | 138 | Singapore | 0,00 | 76,88 | 57,47 | 57,47 | 51,28 | Index | 0 | 100 | 75 | 75 | 67 | (235) Imports of the product under consideration from countries other than India increased by only 7% between 1999 and the review investigation period, i.e.
Amongst these countries, Oman, the USA, China, South Korea and Singapore are the main suppliers to the Community market.
Import prices of Oman are at comparable levels to the Community industry’s prices, but Oman’s increase in market share over the period considered was much less pronounced than that for the other third countries. (236) Following disclosure, it was submitted by the GOI and two exporters that the countervailing duty in place for Indian imports should have been taken into consideration when comparing average sales prices.
This would allegedly lead to practically similar Indian and Omani price levels.
Furthermore, it was submitted by another exporter that the volume decrease in Indian imports between 2002 and the review investigation period has not been properly taken into account in the analysis, that other third countries were the main suppliers and that average prices from South Korea and India were similar from 1999 to 2001. (237) With regard to the original countervailing duty in place, it should be noted that the vast majority of imports from India were either subject to a zero duty rate or to a duty rate which still leads to lower average landing prices than the average Omani price levels.
In addition, import prices from all other third countries as well were on average higher over the period considered than Indian price levels, again clearly identifying India as main source of price pressure.
Therefore, the small decrease in Indian imports between 2002 and the IP had no effect on the market, which eventually rewarded the Indian pricing policy.
The Community industry’s export prices were on average 10% to 15% higher than the sales prices in the Community.
Thus, the Community industry’s export activity could not contribute to its injurious situation. (240) In this context it was submitted by the GOI and one exporter that the Community industry in their questionnaire replies mentioned stiff competition due to Indian competitors on third country markets resulting for the Community industry in low prices and loss of market share in third countries, which prima facie would contradict above finding.
Thus, on the basis of this assessment of the Community industry there would be no injury on the Community market or no causal link with Indian imports. (241) In this respect, it is noted that given the worldwide growth of the market for such products, there is no contradiction between any decrease of export prices and loss of market share of the Community industry in third countries and the fact that the volume of such exports had actually increased and that their prices were higher than the Community industry’s prices for sales in the Community.
Therefore, although the export performance of the Community industry could have been better without a low priced subsidised Indian exports competition in third countries markets, there is no indication that, because of its export performance, the Community industry was not subject to injurious price competition on the Community market essentially caused by the low priced subsidised imports from India.
The drop in productivity per worker on a per kg basis after 2001 can be exclusively attributed to the start-up phase of a new production plant of one Community producer.
Consequently, no evidence was found that lack of competitiveness could have broken the causal link between imports from India and the injury suffered by the Community industry. 5.
Captive Use (243) As stated in recital (226) above, it is considered that the captive use did not contribute to the injurious situation.
To the contrary, without a captive market the injurious situation of the Community industry might even have been worse.
LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUATION OR RECURRENCE OF INJURY (244) In accordance with Article 18(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the expiry of the measures in force would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of injury. (245) As set out under recitals (161) to (243) above, it was established that during the review investigation period and despite the measures in force, the Community industry continued to sustain injury caused by the subsidised imports of the product concerned.
Furthermore, the investigation established that, despite domestic sales and exports to other countries, there is still significant spare capacity for the products under investigation in India, in particular with exporters which are subject to relatively high duty rates in the Community.
It was, therefore, considered reasonable to conclude that subsidised low priced imports from India would further increase and, consequently, injury would be likely to continue in the future, should the measures lapse. (246) Since the Community industry continues to suffer material injury due to the subsidised imports despite the existence of measures, it was not necessary to analyse further the likelihood of recurrence of injury.
COMMUNITY INTEREST I.
Finally, the importer did not indicate that the continuation of measures would have any impact on employment, since import activities are not labour intensive. (250) Although importers/traders may not be in favour of measures, it can be concluded on the basis of the information available, that such possible interest in allowing measures to expire does not outweigh the actual interest of the Community industry to continue redressing unfair and injurious Indian trading practices as summarised in recital (248).
Interest of up-stream suppliers (251) In order to assess the likely effect that the continuation of countervailing measures could have on the up-stream suppliers of the Community industry, questionnaires were sent to all such known suppliers.
These up-stream suppliers, which provide in particular glucose and dextrose to the Community industry, are in favour of the continuation of measures.
The Commission requested, amongst other information, their comments on whether the maintenance of the measures in force would be in the interest of the Community and how these measures would continue to affect them.
COUNTERVAILING MEASURES (258) In view of the conclusions reached with regard to continued subsidisation, injury and Community interest, it is considered appropriate to maintain countervailing measures on imports of the product concerned from India.
Injury elimination level (259) The necessary price increase to eliminate injury was determined on a per-company basis by comparing the weighted average import price of the product concerned with the non-injurious price of the like product sold by the Community industry on the Community market.
The price difference was expressed as a percentage of the CIF import value. (260) The non-injurious price has been obtained by taking the weighted average cost of production of the Community industry together with a profit margin of 10%.
A definitive countervailing duty is hereby imposed on imports of amoxicillin trihydrate, ampicillin trihydrate and cefalexin not put up in measured doses or in forms or packings for retail sale falling within CN codes ex 2941 10 10 (TARIC code 2941 10 10 10), ex 2941 10 20 (TARIC code 2941 10 20 10) and ex 2941 90 00 (TARIC code 2941 90 00 30) originating in India. 2.
