These beneficiary countries, like any other developing countries, shall submit a request for a definitive selection as beneficiary by 31 May 2005.
Exceptionally, the preferences under the Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 should therefore continue to apply until 30 June 2005 to the extent that they provide for a more favourable treatment of products than the new GSP regime.
Context Council Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 of 10 December 2001[1] applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences will expire on 31 December 2005.
In July 2004, the Commission adopted guidelines on the role of the GSP for the next ten-year period 2006 to 2015[2].
Interrelationship among these elements has been expressed, in particular, in multiple international conventions and instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993, the UN Agenda for Development of 1997, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of 1998, the UN Millenium Declaration of 2000 and the Johannesburg Declaration of Sustainable Development of 2002.
The additional preferences shall be granted to developing countries that have ratified and effectively implemented the 16 core conventions on human and labour rights and 7 of the conventions related to good governance and the protection of the environment.
Graduation should also play an important role in regulating trade flows for textile products and clothing, following the abolition of MFA quotas on 31 December 2004.
Exceptional transition period Due to the tsunami disaster, which occurred on 26 December 2004, the new GSP system should enter into force as quickly as possible.
It should apply from 1 April 2005 until 31 December 2008. (5) The scheme should consist of a general arrangement granted to all the beneficiary countries and territories and two special arrangements taking into account the various development needs of similar-situated developing countries. (6) The general arrangement should be granted to all beneficiary countries unless they are classified by the World Bank as a high-income country and if they are not sufficiently diversified in their exports. (7) The special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance is based on an integral concept of sustainable development as recognized by international conventions and instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of 1998, the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000 and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development of 2002.
Under this arrangement ad valorem tariffs are therefore suspended for the beneficiary countries, as well as specific duties (unless combined with an ad valorem duty). (8) Developing countries which already fulfil the criteria under the special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance at the time of entry into force of this Regulation should benefit from this arrangement as quickly as possible.
As far as ad valorem duties are concerned, the reduction should therefore be a flat rate of 3,5 percentage points of the most favoured nation (MFN) duty rate.
Where duties specify a minimum duty, that minimum duty should not apply. (14) Where preferential duty rates, calculated in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 of 10 December 2001 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004[9], provide for a more favourable treatment of products, they should continue to apply until 30 June 2005 so as to provide for a smooth transition to the new GSP regime. (15) Duties should be totally suspended where preferential treatment for an individual import declaration results in ad valorem duties of 1 % or less or in specific duties of EUR 2 or less as the cost of collecting such duties might be higher than the revenue gained. (16) For the sake of coherence of the Community commercial policy, a beneficiary country should not benefit from both the Community’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences and a free trade agreement, if that agreement covers at least all the preferences provided by the present scheme for that country. (17) Graduation should be based on criteria related to sections of the Common Customs Tariff.
The Community scheme of generalised tariff preferences (hereafter “the scheme”) shall apply from 1 April 2005 to 31 December 2008 in accordance with this Regulation. 2.
Article 2 The beneficiary countries of the arrangements referred to in Article 1(2) are listed in Annex I.

Common Customs Tariff specific duties other than minimum or maximum duties on products listed in Annex II as sensitive products shall be reduced by 30 %.
Where Common Customs Tariff duties on products listed in Annex II as sensitive products include ad valorem duties and specific duties, the specific duties shall not be reduced. 6.

Common Customs Tariff specific duties on products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be entirely suspended, except for products for which Common Customs Tariff duties also include ad valorem duties.
