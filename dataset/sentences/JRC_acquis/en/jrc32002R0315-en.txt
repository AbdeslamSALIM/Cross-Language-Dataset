However, it should be permitted that this definition be not used in the case of carcasses of young lambs weighing between 9 and 16 kilograms, so that market practices, whereby whole carcasses marketed with head and offals command a greater commercial value, can be taken into account. (5) In certain Member States prices relate to prices for live animals.
Member States whose sheep meat production exceeds 200 tonnes per year shall communicate to the Commission, each Thursday at the latest, the prices of fresh or chilled carcasses of lambs and ewes. 2.
The prices shall be those recorded in the quotation areas referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 of Member States that fulfil the requirements set out in paragraph 1.
In the case of lamb carcasses weighing up to 16 kilograms, and in accordance with normal commercial practice, prices may be recorded before evisceration and removal of the head.
However, where normal practice is to include head and offals with the carcass, for lambs weighing up to 28 kilograms liveweight the Member States may fix a higher coefficient.
Article 5 Regulation (EEC) No 1481/86 is hereby repealed.
Article 6 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
