ANNEX I STANDARDS OF GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE TO ENSURE SOUND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT OF ASSISTANCE GRANTED UNDER THE EUROPEAN REFUGEE FUND (ARTICLE 3) 1.
Intermediate organisations reporting to the responsible authority shall submit to that authority a list of approved projects for each national implementation programme, indicating for each project its full name and that of the recipients of the grant implementing it, the date on which the assistance was granted, the amounts committed and paid, the expenditure period concerned and the total amount of expenditure per measure.
PRINCIPLES The purpose of financial corrections is to restore a situation where 100 % of the expenditure declared for co-financing from the Fund is in line with the applicable national and Community rules and regulations.
Specifically quantified corrections for each individual project concerned are not always possible or practicable, however, or it may be disproportionate to cancel the entire expenditure in question.
If there are deficiencies in relation to ancillary elements as well as in key elements, corrections are only made at the rate applicable to the key elements. 2.4.
The rate of correction should be applied to that part of the expenditure placed at risk.
Any sum due to the Commission as a result of net corrections is to be paid together with interest under Article 19(3) of Decision 2000/596/EC and in accordance with Article 15(2) of this Decision. (1) OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 1. (2) See also section 2.3 (2 % correction).
