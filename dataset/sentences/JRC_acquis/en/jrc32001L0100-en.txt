It is now also appropriate to include within the scope of the low temperature test vehicles of category M1 with positive-ignition engines designed to carry more than six occupants and vehicles of category M1 with positive-ignition engines whose maximum mass exceeds 2500 kg, which were previously excluded. (4) Because of their emission characteristics, it is appropriate to exempt vehicles with positive-ignition engines that run only on gas fuel (LPG or NG) from the low temperature test.
Vehicles where the petrol system is fitted for emergency purposes or starting only and where the petrol tank cannot contain more than 15 litres of petrol, should be regarded as vehicles that can run only on a gaseous fuel. (5) It is appropriate to align the test for low temperature emissions with the test for emissions at a normal ambient temperature.
