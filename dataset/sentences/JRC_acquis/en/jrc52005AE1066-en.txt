Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality (COM(2005) 81 final — 2005/0017 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality" (COM(2005) 81 final — 2005/0017 (COD)) (2006/C 24/10) On 22 March 2005 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 420th plenary session, held on 28 and 29 September 2005 (meeting of 28 September 2005), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 166 votes to 5, with 7 abstentions. 1.
It agrees with the reasons set out in the recitals, which also explain that the Proposal conforms to Article 5 of the Treaty. 3.2 The EESC also agrees that working with the existing infrastructure — foundations and other bodies — is consistent with the Council's desire to avoid duplication.
Translations should therefore be worded to come as close as feasible to the original. 3.4 As far as the Institute's goals are concerned, the EESC thinks Article 2 should include a clear reference to promoting the principle of gender mainstreaming. 3.4.1 The EESC also considers that the Institute should be tasked with helping employers' and workers' organisations and other elements of organised civil society in their work on gender equality.
Brussels, 28 September 2005.
