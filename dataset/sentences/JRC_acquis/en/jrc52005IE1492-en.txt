In order to implement these measures, Commission Regulation No 1956/1991 was adopted [6]. 2.1.2 With the adoption of Council Regulations (EEC) 2080/93 [7] and 3699/93 [8], the financing of joint enterprises was integrated into the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG).
These principles were maintained by Council Regulation 2468/98 of 3 November 1998 [9] repealing Regulation 3699/93, and Council Regulation 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 [10], although it is worth noting that the latter simplified the concept of the joint enterprise, defining it as "a commercial enterprise with one or more partners who are nationals of the third country in which the vessel is registered" [11]. 2.2 Background 2.2.1 The Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy [12] acknowledged the excess capacity of the Community fleet, along with the globalisation of the fisheries sector and the legitimate aspiration of many developing countries to expand their own fishing industries.
Prior to this, there had been another specific report, the Study on joint enterprises in the context of structural aids in the fisheries sector, dated 16 June 2000.
These studies indicate that there are currently 300 joint enterprises accounting for over 600 vessels in all.
