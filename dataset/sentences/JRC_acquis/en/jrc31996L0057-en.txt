ANNEX I METHOD FOR CALCULATING THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION OF A REFRIGERATION APPLIANCE AND PROCEDURE FOR CHECKING CONFORMITY The electricity consumption of a refrigeration appliance (which may be expressed in kWh per 24 hours) is a function of the category of appliance to which it belongs (e.g. 1-star refrigerator, chest freezer, etc.), its volume and the energy efficiency of its construction, (thickness of insulation, compressor efficiency, etc.) and the difference between ambient temperature and the temperature inside the appliance.
If the electricity consumption of the appliance is greater than Emax plus 15 %, the electricity consumption of a further three appliances must be measured.
If the arithmetic mean of the electricity consumptions of these three appliances is less than or equal to Emax plus 10 %, the appliance is certified as conforming to the electricity consumption requirements of this Directive.
If the arithmetic mean exceeds Emax plus 10 %, the appliance must be judged not to conform to the electricity consumption requirements of this Directive.
ANNEX II CONFORMITY ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES (MODULE A) 1.
The various components of the 'CE` marking must have substantially the same vertical dimension, which may not be less than 5 mm.
