Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning misleading and comparative advertising (codified version) /* COM/2006/0222 final - COD 2006/0070 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 19.05.2006 COM(2006) 222 final 2006/0070(COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning misleading and comparative advertising (codified version) (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinsitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 4.
Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex II to the codified Directive. ê 97/55/EC Art. 1 pt. 1 2006/0070(COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning misleading and comparative advertising (Text with EEA relevance) ê 84/450/EEC (adapted) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article Ö 95 Õ thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[5], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[6], Whereas: ê 1.
In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. ê 84/450/EEC Recital 1 (adapted) 2.
Since advertising reaches beyond the frontiers of individual Member States, it has a direct effect on the Ö smooth Õ functioning of the Ö internal Õ market. ê 84/450/EEC Recital 2 (adapted) 3.
Misleading Ö and unlawful comparative Õ advertising can lead to distortion of competition within the Ö internal Õ market. ê 84/450/EEC Recital 3 (adapted) 4.
Advertising, whether or not it induces a contract, affects the economic welfare of consumers Ö and traders Õ. ê 84/450/EEC Recital 4 (adapted) 5.
The differences between the laws of the Member States Ö on advertising which misleads business Õ hinder the execution of advertising campaigns beyond national boundaries and thus affect the free circulation of goods and provision of services. ê 97/55/EC Recital 2 (adapted) 6.
Comparative advertising can also stimulate competition between suppliers of goods and services to the consumer’s advantage. ê 84/450/EEC Recital 7 (adapted) 7.
Minimum and objective criteria for determining whether Ö business to business Õ advertising is misleading should be established. ê 97/55/EC Recital 5 and 6 (adapted) 8.
Comparative advertising, when it compares material, relevant, verifiable and representative features and is not misleading, may be a legitimate means of informing consumers of their advantage. Ö It is desirable to provide a broad concept of comparative advertising to cover all modes of comparative advertising. Õ ê 97/55/EC Recital 7 9.
Such conditions of permitted advertising should include criteria of objective comparison of the features of goods and services. ê 97/55/EC Recital 10 10.
The international conventions on copyright as well as the national provisions on contractual and non-contractual liability should apply when the results of comparative tests carried out by third parties are referred to or reproduced in comparative advertising. ê 97/55/EC Recital 11 11.
It may, however, be indispensable, in order to make comparative advertising effective, to identify the goods or services of a competitor, making reference to a trade mark or trade name of which the latter is the proprietor. ê 97/55/EC Recital 15 15.
Such use of another’s trade mark, trade name or other distinguishing marks does not breach this exclusive right in cases where it complies with the conditions laid down by this Directive, the intended target being solely to distinguish between them and thus to highlight differences objectively. ê 84/450/EEC Recital 9 (adapted) 16.
Persons or organisations regarded under national law as having a legitimate interest in the matter should have facilities for initiating proceedings against misleading Ö and unlawful comparative Õ advertising, either before a court or before an administrative authority which is competent to decide upon complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. ê 84/450/EEC Recitals 11 and 12 (adapted) 17.
However, this in no way implies that Member States are under an obligation to introduce rules requiring the systematic prior vetting of advertising. Õ ê 84/450/EEC Recital 16 (adapted) 18.
The voluntary control exercised by self-regulatory bodies to eliminate misleading Ö or unlawful comparative Õ advertising may avoid recourse to administrative or judicial action and ought therefore to be encouraged. ê 97/55/EC Recital 17 19.
National self-regulatory bodies may coordinate their work through associations or organisations established at Community level and inter alia deal with cross-border complaints. ê 2005/29/EC Recital 21 (adapted) 20.
It shall be for each Member State to decide which of the facilities referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be available and whether to enable the courts or administrative authorities to require prior recourse to other established means of dealing with complaints, including those referred to in Article 6.
The administrative authorities referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 must: (a) be composed so as not to cast doubt on their impartiality; (b) have adequate powers, where they decide on complaints, to monitor and enforce the observance of their decisions effectively; (c) normally give reasons for their decisions. 6.
Where the powers referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 are exercised exclusively by an administrative authority, reasons for its decisions shall always be given.
Article 11 This Directive shall enter into force on 12 December 2007 . ê 84/450/EEC Article 12 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
