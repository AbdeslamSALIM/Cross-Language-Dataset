Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities and for their calculation and dissemination /* COM/2006/0135 final - COD 2006/0042 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 22.3.2006 COM(2006) 135 final 2006/0042 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities and for their calculation and dissemination (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
The Structural Funds Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, gives statutory responsibility to the Commission for calculating GDP on a purchasing power basis.
The Regulation establishing a Cohesion Fund (Council Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 of 25 May 1994) states that it is the Community’s task to promote economic and social cohesion and solidarity between the Member States, and Cohesion Fund is an instrument to accomplish this.
It is therefore important to provide a stable, binding and reliable legal framework capable of ensuring the timely availability of these data. 2006/0042 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities and for their calculation and dissemination (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[3], Whereas: 1.
The Community PPPs need to be produced in accordance with a harmonised methodology, consistent with Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community[4], (ESA 95) which lays down a framework for the construction of national accounts in the Member States. 3.
Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds[5], – must be read in conjunction with Part 15 of Annex II of the 2003 Act of Accession, entitled “Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments”.

PPPs shall be calculated according to the basic headings as listed in Annex II, consistent with the related GDP classifications defined in Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996.
Article 4 Roles and responsibilities 1.
Article 5 Transmission of basic information 1.
Article 6 Statistical units 1.
The basic information listed in Annex I shall be obtained either from statistical units as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 696/1993[12] or from other sources which yield data meeting the quality requirements specified in Annex I, point 5.1. 2.
Article 7 Quality criteria and control 1.
Article 8 Periodicity The Commission (Eurostat) shall calculate PPPs relating to each calendar year.
Article 9 Dissemination 1.

Article 11 Committee procedure 1.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Article 1 of Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom. 2.
Article 12 Implementing measures The measures necessary for the implementation of the provisions of this Regulation, including measures to take account of economic and technical changes, shall be laid down, insofar as this does not involve a disproportionate increase in costs for the Member States, in accordance with the procedure specified in Article 11(2).
BASIC INFORMATION 2.1 BASIC INFORMATION ITEMS For the purpose of this Regulation, the Basic Information according to Articles 2 and 4 and the minimum frequency of new data supply shall be: Basic Information | Minimum Frequency | GDP expenditure values | Annual | Actual and imputed rentals | Annual | Compensation of employees | Annual | Temporal adjustment factors | Annual | Prices of consumer goods and services and related representativity indicators | 3 years1 | Prices of equipment goods | 3 years | Prices of construction projects | 3 years | Spatial adjustment factors | 6 years | 1) The minimum frequency refers to the provision of data for a particular product group, related to the rolling cycle of surveys. 2.2 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING BASIC INFORMATION The Commission (Eurostat), after taking account of the views of the Member States, shall determine the sources and data suppliers to be used for each of the above items of Basic Information.
If the Commission (Eurostat) obtains basic information from a data supplier other than a Member State, the latter shall be relieved of the obligations set forth in paragraphs 5.1.4 to 5.1.13. 3.
Consumer Price Survey Procedure 6.1 MEMBER STATES SHALL CARRY OUT THE PRICE SURVEYS ACCORDING TO THE WORK PROGRAMME. 6.2 For each survey, the Commission (Eurostat) shall prepare the survey item list, based on proposals which shall be made by each Member State for each basic heading. 6.3 The Commission (Eurostat) shall provide, together with the item list, in all official languages of the European Union, a translation of all specifications in each survey list. 7.
Calculation Procedure 7.1 CALCULATION OF BILATERAL PARITIES AT BASIC HEADING LEVEL a) The calculation of multilateral EKS (Èltetò-Köves-Szulc) parities at basic heading level shall be based on a matrix of bilateral parities for each pair of participant countries.
d) The national annual average price shall be estimated, where necessary, on the basis of the average survey price by using appropriate spatial and temporal adjustment factors.
b) A Laspeyres-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the arithmetic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the second country of each pair of participant countries.
c) A Paasche-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the harmonic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the first country of each pair of participant countries.
d) A Fisher-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the geometric mean of the Laspeyres-type and Paasche-type parities established for each pair of participant countries. 7.4 CALCULATION OF TRANSITIVE MULTILATERAL PPPS The calculation of multilateral transitive parities shall be carried out either at basic heading level or any aggregated level by using the “EKS” procedure based on a complete matrix of Fisher-type parities between each pair of participant countries as follows: [pic] where [pic]denotes the EKS parity between country s and country t ; [pic] denotes the Fisher-type parity between country s and country t ; z denotes the number of participant countries. 8.
Transmission 8.1 THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) SHALL SUPPLY TO THE MEMBER STATES THE TEMPLATES FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF THE BASIC INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CALCULATE PPPS. 8.2 Member States shall provide basic information to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the templates. 9.
