At its 418th plenary session, held on 8 June 2005 the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 134 votes to 1 with 7 abstentions.
Mode 1 is when services are provided remotely (by post, fax, telephone or internet).
But the provision of services through Modes 1 and 2 can also be facilitated by Mode 4.
Studies of the trade, growth and employment effects of Mode 4 liberalisation are further hampered by the lack of statistics on temporary movement under Mode 4.
Labour migration under GATS Mode 4 is temporary migration at the initiative of the service supplier for the provision of a service.
The governing principle in the ILO is that "Labour is not a commodity" [4].
Mode 4 is about people, human beings.
Human rights, workers' rights and working conditions are nevertheless not mentioned in the GATS agreement, but could and should be observed in both Members requests, offers and commitments as the EU and the Member States have done. 2.2 Mode 4 and the Annex on Movement of natural persons supplying services under the Agreement 2.2.1 The link between trade, migration and labour market regulation embodied in Mode 4 is recognised in the GATS Agreement by a specific Annex.
Point 2 in this annex states that the GATS shall not apply to measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of a Member, nor shall it apply to measures regarding permanent migration, residence or employment on a permanent basis.
The annex makes it clear how sensitive an issue temporary mobility is for WTO Members. 2.3 EU commitments 2.3.1 The commitments that WTO Members have made for Mode 4 differ from those made for other Modes in certain respects, the most important being that they have tended to be made horizontally, applying to all sectors cited in a Member State's list of commitments.
