2006/740/EC: Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 implemented by Germany for Hamburgische Landesbank %mdash% Girozentrale, now HSH Nordbank AG (notified under document number C(2004) 3928) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 implemented by Germany for Hamburgische Landesbank — Girozentrale, now HSH Nordbank AG (notified under document number C(2004) 3928) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/740/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on the Member State and other interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) The procedure concerns the transfer of shares in Hamburgische Wohnungsbaukreditanstalt ("WK") to Hamburgische Landesbank — Girozentrale ("HLB") by the Land of Hamburg ("FHH").
There are a further six cases in which proceedings have been initiated against Germany in connection with transfers of assets to Landesbanks, and in particular to Westdeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale ("WestLB"). (2) By letter of 12 January 1993, the Commission asked Germany for information concerning the circumstances of, and reasons for, a capital increase in WestLB resulting from the incorporation of Wohnungsbauförderanstalt ("WfA") and similar increases in the own funds of the Landesbanks of other Länder.
Germany replied in March and September 1993 and, in response to further Commission requests dated 10 November and 13 December 1993, provided additional information in March 1994.
In addition to information concerning WfA's transfer to WestLB, the German replies referred to similar transfers in Lower Saxony, Berlin and Schleswig-Holstein. (3) By letters of 31 May and 21 December 1994, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken e.V. ("BdB"), an association representing private banks established in Germany, informed the Commission among other things that, with effect from 1 January 1986 and 1 January 1993, FHH had transferred shares in WK to HLB directly or indirectly.
By letter of 8 December 1999, Germany submitted information on the transfer of WK to HLB which it supplemented by letter of 22 January 2001. (7) By letter of 13 November 2002, the Commission informed Germany of its decision to initiate on account of the aid the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty. (8) After requesting, and being granted, extensions of the deadline, Germany submitted its comments and provided additional information by letters of 14 April and 15 May 2003.
Following a renewed Commission request, Germany provided additional information on 29 August 2003. (9) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published on 4 April 2003 in the Official Journal of the European Union [4] .The Commission called on interested parties to submit comments.
On 1 October 2004 Germany provided updated figures and additional information. (11) Following the merger between HLB and Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein-Girozentrale ("LSH") creating HSH Nordbank AG ("HSH") on 2 June 2003, the WK shares received by HLB were transferred back to FHH. (12) On 19 July 2004 the complainant BdB, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB notified a provisional understanding concerning the appropriate remuneration for the transferred assets.
The definitive version of the understanding reached the Commission on 13 October 2004.
On 29 September 2004 BdB, FHH and HSH Nordbank, which resulted from the merger of HLB and Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein in 2003, also reached a provisional understanding on the appropriate remuneration for the special-purpose assets transferred.
The definitive version of the understanding on the transfer of the special-purpose assets to HLB reached the Commission on 14 October 2004.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURES HAMBURGISCHE LANDESBANK — GIROZENTRALE ("HLB") (13) At the time of the transfer, HLB was a public-law institution that had been set up by decree in 1938.
This decree was replaced in 1993 by the Hamburgische Landesbank — Girozentrale Act, which was amended in 1997 in connection with the partial sale to "LSH". [5] Up to that point, FHH had been the sole shareholder in HLB as well as its sponsor and guarantor.
In addition, HLB-Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH ("HLB-BG"), which is controlled by FHH and the holding company Hamburger Gesellschaft für Beteiligungsverwaltung mbH ("HGV"), owns a de facto share of 1 % via an atypical silent partnership. (14) On 2 June 2003 (for tax and balance-sheet purposes, 1 January 2003) HLB and LSH merged to form HSH.
The owners are FHH with over 35 %, the Land of Schleswig-Holstein with just under 20 %, WestLB with just under 27 % and the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Schleswig-Holstein with over 18 %.
With a balance-sheet total of some EUR 180 billion and some 4500 employees in all, HSH is today one of the larger credit institutions in Germany. (15) When the two transfers took place, HLB had a balance-sheet total of DEM 36,5 billion (1986) and just under DEM 60 billion (1992).
That same year it had 2700 employees at group level. (16) As a state-owned bank, HLB took charge of FHH's banking business and that of its public and private legal persons.
According to the relevant contract of 10 July 1986 concluded between FHH and HLB, this was done as a means of increasing the latter's capital. (18) In accordance with the Act increasing the capital of Hamburgische Landesbank — Girozentrale of 22 December 1992, FHH transferred with effect from 1 January 1993 a further 38 % of its shares in WK to HGV and the remaining shares (a further 38 %) directly to HLB.
In an addendum adopted on 21 April 1997 to the contract of 22 December 1992, it was laid down that, in the event of a reassignment, any increase in undisclosed reserves brought about by a readjustment of the WK aid scheme would accrue not to HLB but to FHH.
CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE OWN FUNDS AND SOLVENCY DIRECTIVES (20) The German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz — KWG) has been amended in line with Council Directive 89/647/EEC on a solvency ratio for credit institutions [6] (the "Solvency Directive") and Council Directive 89/299/EEC on the own funds of credit institutions [7] (the "Own Funds Directive"), which require banks to have own funds equivalent to 8 % of their risk-adjusted assets.
In determining the total own funds available to a bank for supervisory purposes, the core capital is of decisive importance because additional capital, or "tier II" capital, is accepted as underpinning for risk-bearing transactions only up to the amount of the available core capital. (21) German banks had to adapt their own funds to the new requirements of the Solvency Directive and the Own Funds Directive by 30 June 1993 [8].
The transfer of WK shares presented the advantage of allowing this to happen without the need for an additional capital contribution from FHH's budget. (23) Back in the 1980s, business expansion had given rise to a steadily growing need for capital.
REMUNERATION FOR THE OWN FUNDS TRANSFERRED (28) According to the available information, FHH received no remuneration for the shares transferred on 1 January 1986 (24 % or DEM 212,16 million).
According to the information supplied, a sum of DEM [...] million had been paid by HLB since this understanding of 23 December 1992 (effective as of 1 January 1993). (30) No further remuneration was agreed.
Accordingly, the Commission came to the provisional conclusion that the measures in question probably constituted aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, giving rise to misgivings regarding their compatibility with the common market since none of the exemption clauses in Article 87(2) and (3) or in Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty appear to be applicable in the present situation. (39) As part of its provisional assessment and in accordance with Article 1(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [12], the Commission also assumed that, if there were aid, the measure constituted new aid and not existing aid and referred here to Article 15(2) of that Regulation.
In its view, the decision to initiate the procedure was a further Commission measure that interrupted the limitation period within the meaning of Article 15(2) and, as such, confirmed previous measures, including the Commission's requests for information dated 12 January, 10 November and 13 December 1993 and 1 September 1999 as well as the decisions to initiate the procedure in the WestLB case [13] and in the case of Landesbank Berlin [14].
COMMENTS FROM GERMANY (40) In its comments, Germany repeated first of all the view that the transfer on 1 January 1986 of 24 % of WK's capital (value transferred to the reserves: DEM 212,16 million) to HLB could not be recovered as unlawful aid in accordance with Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 since the ten-year period applicable to the transfer had expired on 1 January 1996. (41) This transfer ("1986 transfer") was to be seen as a legally and economically independent process separate from the 1993 transfers.
According to Germany, the Court had thus laid down the minimum requirements that a request for information must meet in order to be regarded as action interrupting the limitation period. (43) In the present case, the Commission, with its requests for information of 12 January, 10 November and 13 December 1993, which were mentioned by it in the decision to initiate the procedure and were addressed to Germany, fell far short of these requirements.
This was because the WK Act was amended only on 25 June 1997 and because HLB as shareholder was granted the right to dissolve or liquidate WK. (46) Germany stated that the transferred funds had, therefore, been made available to HLB in full as liability cover only retrospectively on 1 January 1997.
Even so, as Germany later explained, HLB had before that date used part of the capital reserve as liability cover, viz.
It was only after 1 January 1997 and until the divestment of WK at the time of the merger with LSH to form HSH on 2 June 2003 that the amount of DEM 659,4 million had been available.
No remuneration was paid on the capital reserve of some DEM 659 million. (48) Germany nevertheless repeated the view that it was not only the agreed, direct remuneration for the silent partnership contribution that should be taken into account as a remuneration component.
And so, as the sole shareholder until 1997, FHH had received the highest dividend of 6 % laid down in the statutes and from 1997 onwards had received varying, but increasing dividends on its share of the share capital.
As they were then payable only on 50,5 % of FHH's shares, they amounted to EUR [...] million in 1997 and to EUR [...] million in 2001. (49) Moreover, the reserves that HLB had itself built up were regularly converted into equity capital, which rose from EUR 228,3 million in 1985 to EUR 250,9 million in 1997 and has remained unchanged since.
The revenue reserves had also risen steadily, from EUR 93,1 million in 1985 to EUR 321,8 million in 2001.
There was an increase in value of between some [...] % and [...] % that was attributable solely to the transfer of WK shares.
Between 1985 and 1992 the value of HLB had risen by DEM [...] million, or just under DEM [...] million a year, giving a return of [...] % in terms of the WK shares transferred in 1986.
Between 1992 and 1995 the company's value had risen by DEM [...] million a year, giving an annual yield of [...] % in terms of the WK shares transferred on 1 January 1993.
According to the calculations provided, the interest-rate difference relative to a cash contribution in the case of the non-monetary capital transferred in 1986 was some 6,8 % in respect of lending and some 6,8 % in respect of income-producing, risk-free investments.
For the contribution made on 1 January 1993, the difference was around 8,3 % for lending and 7,36 % for risk-free investments.
In terms of the gross return, this represented a difference of some 6 % (1996) and 6,6 % (1993) between capital assumed to be provided in cash and the illiquid capital actually provided.
A market-economy investor too must take this disadvantage into account when assessing whether his remuneration is appropriate.
No remuneration at all had been agreed for the WK shares transferred on 1 January 1986 while, for the shares transferred in 1993, only the interest payable on the silent partnership contribution had been agreed.
What mattered was the expectation at least of an average return that private banks too regularly associate with the provision of equity capital to their subsidiaries. (54) Admittedly, it is true that this anticipated return did not figure in the understanding on a fixed interest rate since the return to the parent company could be in the form not only of dividend payments but also of the increase in the revenue and associated value of the subsidiary.
The transfer in 1997 of 49,5 % of the shares to LSH had not removed the aid element.
For the state aid investigation it was a matter of whether a transaction had taken place under normal economic conditions. (58) It transpired from all this that, under these circumstances, a private investor would have undertaken the investment only if revenue or cash flows could have been generated promptly, either in the form of fixed dividends or alternatively in the form of variable cash flows.
In its comments of 25 June 2003, it assumed in the first place a long-term market risk premium of a uniform 4,6 %. (63) The BdB stated that it estimated the beta values on the basis of a historical data sample for comparable banks.
No remuneration at all had been agreed for the transfer of the other shares to the capital reserve. (68) The limitation period for the transfer of shares on 1 January 1993 had been interrupted by the Commission as a result of the information request dated 1 September 1999 and the decision of 13 November 2002 to initiate the procedure.
The transfers in 1986 and 1993 were, therefore, to be regarded as a single capital measure, and the aid was not granted in full until 1 January 1993. (69) Accordingly, it was also immaterial whether the Commission's requests for information in 1993 could have interrupted the limitation period.
By deducting refinancing costs in full, it arrived at an appropriate remuneration of 1,48 % for the total contribution. (76) In line with its interpretation of the law, however, Germany also calculated in its reply the return on the capital reserve according to the CAPM.
Assuming a market risk premium of 3 % and a beta value for HLB of 0,7861, this gave a hypothetical minimum return on cash deposits of 9,74 % in respect of the increase in the capital reserve although the full refinancing costs had to be deducted on account of the lack of liquidity, with the result that the actual minimum normal market return worked out at 2,36 %.
After deducting again the full refinancing costs, this produced a premium of 1,29 % for silent partnership contributions of unlimited duration similar to HLB's contribution.
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE BDB, FHH AND HSH (78) On 8 October 2004 the Commission was informed of the outcome of an understanding reached between the complainant BdB, FHH and HSH, which resulted from the merger of LSH and HLB in 2003.
As regards the indirect contribution to a silent partnership reserve that also took place on 1 January 1993 of 19,86 % of WK shares amounting to DEM 300 million, although agreement could be reached on the basic approach of a fixed remuneration criterion, no agreement was reached on the exact calculation method, especially regarding the deduction for lack of liquidity (see paragraphs 81 to 203).
The understanding did not concern the 1986 transfer; the parties declared that they would not object to a definitive Commission decision on the limitation period for this transfer. (79) Applying the CAPM, the parties first determined a minimum normal market remuneration for the contribution to the capital reserve (some DEM 959 million).
Lastly, a deduction of 3,62 % was determined for the capital's lack of liquidity (on the basis of the risk-free interest rate as gross refinancing costs, of which some 50 % company taxes plus solidarity surcharge to determine net refinancing costs).
This gives an appropriate remuneration of 6,57 %. (80) HSH and FHH calculated a remuneration margin of 129 basis points for the DEM 300 million transfer to the silent partnership reserve since the gross refinancing costs had to be deducted.
ASSESSMENT OF THE MEASURES 1.
ON THE GENERAL QUESTION OF THE LIMITATION PERIOD (81) Germany has taken the view that the ten-year limitation period provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 has elapsed as regards the transfer on 1 January 1986 of 24 % of the shares, which increased HLB's capital by DM 212160000, in so far as it constituted state aid.
The side letter of 22 December 1992, which is mentioned by Germany in a letter dated December 1999 and was subsequently handed over, does not, as originally claimed, speak of a uniform investment objective for both transfers.
It refers solely to the 1993 transfer and, for this purpose, takes over a specific rule governing the 1986 transfer and applies it to the 1 January 1993 transfer of additional shares, namely the right of FHH to require the transfer of WK's shares. (85) The transfer of FHH on 1 January 1986 is to be taken as the time at which the unlawful aid, if any, was granted.
The resources were available to HLB with effect from 1 January 1986; they were recognised by BAKred for 1986.
Accordingly, the ten-year period ended on 1 January 1996. (86) In accordance with Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, the ten-year period is interrupted by any action taken by the Commission or by a Member State, acting at the request of the Commission, with regard to the unlawful aid.
In Scott the Court of First Instance ruled that, although a request made by the Commission prior to the entry into force of the Regulation for information concerning a clearly defined possible aid measure could not possibly interrupt the ten-year period at that time, such an effect could be attributed to it if the Commission exercises its powers to recover the aid in question following the entry into force of the Regulation. [19] (87) In the present case the Commission requests for information prior to 1 January 1996 do not satisfy the requirements for action interrupting the ten-year period as they do not constitute action with regard to the unlawful aid, as provided for in Article 15(2). (88) Prior to the request for information dated 1 September 1999, the Commission did not, in any letter to Germany, ask about the transfers in Hamburg and did not mentioned either FHH or HLB.
The three letters from 1993 refer exclusively to the transfer of WfA to WestLB; what is more, they simply contain general requests relating to other possible transfers to Landesbanks of other Länder.
In addition to questions concerning WestLB, the request for information dated 10 November 1993 mentions only the Länder of Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony.
To this extent, the German authorities and HLB, which in 1986 undertook share transfers between two companies wholly owned by it, could not assume the existence of possible state aid and hence the need for a notification. (91) Accordingly, the Commission regards the ten-year period under Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 as having expired.
Any aid associated with the contribution of 24 % of WK's shares to HLB on 1 January 1986 is to be regarded as existing aid within the meaning of Article 15(3) of the Regulation.
In contrast, a financial measure is deemed unacceptable for a market-economy investor if, and this has to be examined, the expected or agreed remuneration for the transferred resources is lower than the remuneration paid on the market for comparable investments. (96) The market-economy investor principle is likewise applicable to all public undertakings, irrespective of whether they are profit- or loss-making.
This position of the Commission has been confirmed by the Court of First Instance in WestLB [22]. (97) The Commission must base its assessment of a case on the information that was available to the investor when he decided on the financial measure in question.
Whatever the motives behind it, a capital injection by a shareholder should be measured instead according to whether the investor can expect a normal return on the additional resources within a reasonable period. (100) The Court has raised no objections to this interpretation of the market-economy investor principle, which the Commission has already applied in its Decision 2000/392/EC [23].
Lastly, as the Court also points out with reference to other case law, "the comparison between the conduct of public and private investors must be made by reference to the attitude which a private investor would have had at the time of the transaction in question having regard to the available information and foreseeable developments at the time" [26].
Even if this fact were to make it possible not to focus simply on an agreed remuneration (here DEM [...] million [...], corresponding to [at most 10 %] on the silent partnership contribution), ownership of FHH cannot be relied on in the present case to justify the low level of direct remuneration. (107) Reference to FHH's ownership of HLB would necessitate the existence of a business plan, expert report or valuation of the expected return on the investment in question. (108) This was not the case here.
In setting an appropriate remuneration, a distinction should be made between the different parts of the capital reserve according to their benefit for HLB. (113) The value of the shares transferred and shown on the balance sheet remained constant after 1 January 1993 at DEM 659,4 million.
The table in paragraph 183 gives the relevant basis for calculating the appropriate return on liable capital. (114) Although they were not, and could not, be used to expand its competitive business, the parts of the reserve that were not covered up to 1997 and could not subsequently be covered (see the table in paragraph 183) were still of benefit to HLB since the amount of capital shown on the balance sheet provides the bank's lenders with an indication of its soundness and thus affects the conditions on which it can borrow capital.
According to the information available to the Commission, these were in 1992 simply the equity or share capital of a bank as well as the reserves and silent partnership contributions that satisfied the special requirements laid down in Section 10(4) KWG. (120) The Commission has already made clear in its Decision 2000/392/EC that a comparison between WfA's assets, which were also recognised as core capital, and hybrid equity instruments that were regarded only as additional capital, such as profit participation certificates and non-voting preference shares, cannot serve as a basis for determining the appropriate remuneration for the transferred capital [27].
For the capital provided to be recognised as original own funds, there must be greater exposure to risk, which, as a general rule, is also reflected in a higher market remuneration for such instruments.
Any point of comparison with "additional funds" that offer only limited scope for business expansion can therefore be ruled out at the outset. (121) The Commission considers that the comparison with silent partnership contributions made by Germany and HLB is not suitable as a basis for determining the appropriate remuneration for the capital reserve.
Instead, the transfer of the shares is comparable to an investment of share capital in HLB. (122) An essential point for the Commission is that the transfer of the promotion-related assets was precisely not in the legal form of a silent partnership contribution but consisted in the creation of a reserve.
As it stated in its original position, this meant, in terms of the gross return, a difference of some 6,6 % compared with capital contributed in cash.
A market-economy investor must take this cost into account when considering the appropriateness of his remuneration. (125) The Commission is also of the opinion that the lack of liquidity should be taken into account.
They applied a long-term, risk-free interest rate of 7,23 % for the total refinancing costs [30].
Determination of a likely minimum remuneration for an investment in the share capital of HLB (129) The expected return on an investment and the investment risk are key determinants in the decision of a market-economy investor to invest.
Similarly, he will not invest in a company whose expected return is lower than the average return expected for other companies with a similar risk profile.
Consequently, the minimum appropriate remuneration for a risky investment can be described as the sum of the risk-free rate of return and the additional risk premium for assuming the investment-specific risk. (132) The basis for any determination of return is thus the existence of a default-risk-free form of investment with an assumed risk-free return.
The risk premium for the specific investment is determined by multiplying the market's risk premium by the beta factor. (133) The CAPM is the predominant method of calculating investment returns in the case of large listed companies.
The parties then determined the rate per annum, which reflects the trend tracked by the REXIO Performance Index in the period 1970-91 and, in this way, arrived at the risk-free basic interest rate of 7,23 % referred to above. (135) Since HLB's capital injection was made available on a permanent basis, the method of determining the risk-free basic interest rate appears appropriate in this specific case.
Moreover, the REX10 Performance Index is a generally recognised source of data.
In the corresponding report on the procedure, a range of some 3 % to 5 % was applied, depending on the method, the period under examination and the basic relevant data.
Appropriate remuneration for the uncovered and uncoverable part of the capital reserve (143) As stated above, the capital share that was not used up to 1997 and could not be used subsequently is of material value to HLB and its economic function can be compared to that of a guarantee or liability.
In that decision a premium of a further 0,3 % per annum was added to the rate of 0,3 % per annum (before tax) because guarantees are normally tied to certain transactions and of limited duration (which was not the case in WestLB) and because the amount of DEM 3400 million made available to WestLB was higher than that normally covered by such bank guarantees. (145) On account of the fundamental comparability between WestLB and HLB and for want of other points of reference, the Commission assumes that a rate of 0,3 % corresponds to the remuneration that HLB would also have had to pay on the market in the early 1990s for a guarantee in its favour.
It also notes that the amount of the capital in question is much smaller in the case of HLB than in the case of WestLB and that, for this reason, the second reason given in the WestLB decision does not hold.
The fact of the sole guarantee function was, therefore, restricted from the outset, and this distinguishes the HLB case from the WestLB case. (146) Accordingly, the Commission considers that, in the case of HLB as opposed to WestLB, a premium is not justified and so sets a rate of 0,3 % per annum (before tax) as an appropriate remuneration for the guarantee function of the capital from the time of its inclusion in the balance sheet on 1 January 1993 until its recognition by BAKred.
As with the refinancing costs, the Commission assumes a single overall tax rate of 50 %.
Capital base (151) From 1 January 1993 onwards, the value of the silent partnership contribution remained unchanged at DEM 300 million.
The table in paragraph 183 provides details on the calculation basis of relevance to the appropriate return on liable capital. (152) Although the silent partnership contribution that was not covered prior to 1997 was not, and could not, be used to expand competitive business, it was of benefit to HLB since the amount of equity shown on the balance sheet provides the bank's lenders with some indication of its soundness and thus affects the conditions on which the bank can borrow outside capital.
As explained above, the starting point for determining the normal market remuneration in this case is the remuneration that would be demanded by a market-economy investor providing a bank with equity capital. (155) The BdB is of the opinion that this constitutes an investment similar to share capital.
It already made clear in its Decision 2000/392/EC that a comparison between WfA's assets, which were also recognised as core capital, and equity instruments that were recognised only as additional capital, such as profit participation certificates and non-voting preference shares, cannot serve as a basis for determining the appropriate remuneration for the transferred capital [33].
Any point of comparison with "additional funds", which offer only limited scope in business expansion, can therefore be ruled out at the outset. (158) The Commission considers that, viewed from a risk analysis angle, the silent partnership contribution is, typologically speaking, a "normal" silent partnership contribution, and not share capital.
Starting from the methodology employed by FHH and HLB, the remuneration for the silent partnership contribution in question should be determined on the basis of silent partnership contributions that are of limited duration and otherwise comparable. (160) Germany has stated that, during the 1990s, silent partnership contributions were used increasingly by the Landesbanks to expand their capital base.
Changes in the risk premium for long-term HLB profit participation certificates could serve as a benchmark.
If, therefore, the market conditions at the end of 1997 are transposed to 31 December 1992, the appropriate risk premium at the end of 1992 is at least not understated [35].
Accordingly, the risk premium appropriate for the end of 1992 for a silent partnership contribution with a duration i can be determined by applying the following equation: risk premium on silent partnership contributions, i, 1992 = swap spread on Federal loans, i, 1992 + swap spread on silent partnership contributions, i, 1997. (163) The market data collected for December 1997 and February 1998 and the interest rates on agreed silent partnership contributions would give for such contributions with a duration of 16 years a premium of some 1,25 % over swaps.
Taking the market data as at 31 December 1992 (swap spread for Federal loans of 0,04 %), an appropriate risk premium for 16-year silent partnership contributions would be 0,04 % + 1,25 % = 1,29 %. (164) Alternatively, the fair risk premium could also be derived from the conditions for other financial instruments with a similar risk profile, this being normal practice.
In addition, the report drawn up by Lehman Brothers for WestLB gave risk premiums for profit participation certificates issued by German banks as at mid-December 1991 [36]. (165) In order to derive from HLB's conditions for profit participation certificates at the end of 1992 the appropriate risk premium for silent partnership contributions of limited duration to HLB, an assessment is needed of the fair return premium as between the two instruments.
The appropriate risk premium for silent participation contributions at the end of 1992 can then be determined by applying the following equation: risk premium for silent partnership contributions, i, 1992 = risk premium for profit participation certificates, i, 1992 + spread for silent participation contributions/profit participation certificates, i, 1997. (166) Market data as at December 1997 and February 1998 give a premium of 0,35 %-0,40 % over 10-year HLB profit participation certifications for 16-year silent participation contributions as at the end of 1997.
Taking the market data as at 31 December 1992 (risk premium on 8-year HLB profit participation certificates of 0,91 %) gives an appropriate risk premium for 16-year silent participation contributions of between 1,26 % and 1,31 %.
Applying the risk premium for 10-year profit participation certificates of 0,90 % used in the Lehman Brothers report for the end of 1991 yields virtually identical values [37]. (167) Using both methods, the information provided by Germany yields a margin of some 1,26 %-1,31 %.
As stated above (see paragraph 110), according to the market-economy investor principle, dividend payments and/or increases in value occurring after the investment are not relevant. (182) The Commission takes the view, however, that, in spite of the differences between the two capital instruments attributable to the fact that the 1993 transfer by FHH was designed as an overall package, the agreed, excessive remuneration for the silent partnership contribution can be set off as the remuneration paid for this entire investment project.
Despite its name, tradition and statutory tasks, HLB was much more than a mere local or regional bank until 2003. (187) These facts clearly show that HLB offered its banking services in competition with other European banks outside Germany and, since banks from other European countries are active in Germany, inside Germany. (188) It should also be pointed out that there is a very close relationship between a credit institution's equity capital and its banking activities.
The formal conditions for this are not met in the present case and were not referred to by Germany. (196) Since no exemption from the principle of the ban on state aid pursuant to Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty applies, the aid in question cannot be found compatible with the Treaty.
The contribution of WK's shares to HLB on 1 January 1993 is not existing aid. (197) The transfer on 1 January 1993 cannot be regarded either as being covered by institutional liability and guarantor liability. (198) On the one hand, the test of guarantor liability as a default liability vis-à-vis creditors in the event that the bank's assets are not sufficient to satisfy them is not met from the outset.
Article 2 Germany shall take all necessary measures to discontinue and recover from the beneficiary the aid referred to in Article 1 and unlawfully made available to it.
Article 3 Recovery shall be effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures of national law provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of the Decision.
Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 [41].
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.

In estimating the long-term, risk-free basic interest rate, the estimation of the expected long-term average inflation rate of 3,60 % was then added to the "real basic interest rate" at the relevant moment.

[21] Commission communication to the Member States: Application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty and of Article 5 of Commission Directive 80/723/EEC to public undertakings in the manufacturing sector (OJ C 307, 13.11.1993, p. 3; see paragraph 11.
However, the principal reasoning holds. [29] The situation does not change if one takes into account the possibility of raising additional own funds up to the same amount of original own funds (a factor of 25 instead of 12,5 for original own funds). [30] The REX10 Performance Index of Deutsche Börse AG was used as a generally recognised source in determining the risk-free basic interest rate. [31] According to documents provided by the German Government, the corporation tax rate was 46 % in 1992, to which has to be added the solidarity surcharge of 3,75 % (i.e. 49,75 % in total).
