To avoid many farmers in Malta being disqualified from the area based direct payments, the minimum size of application to area based direct payments in Malta should be fixed at 0.1 ha and, for the years 2005 and 2006, Malta should be allowed to derogate from Article 107(9) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. (4) The sowing of land for the sole purpose of qualifying for area payments should be prevented.
Local standards should be respected in order to reflect the diversity of agricultural practice within the Community. (5) Only one application for an area payment should be permitted in respect of any parcel cultivated in a given year except in cases where the area payment is given as a supplement to the same crop or the aid concerns the production of seeds.
In order to ensure that those requirements are respected, the criteria for the variety screening method in each Member State should be fixed and the procedure for the establishment of the eligible varieties list as well as the minimum quantity of certified seeds to be used should be fixed. (8) The short time between the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and the entry into force of the specific quality premium for durum wheat makes it impossible to establish a list of eligible varieties for the granting of the aid in the year 2005 according to the envisaged screening method.
As a consequence, detailed rules should be laid down for the establishment, the management and the cultivation modalities applicable to base areas and sub-base areas. (13) The observation of a possible overrun of the base area referred to in Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 implies a reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice.
The conditions for the granting of the aid should therefore be established and, where applicable, cross references should be made to the existing provisions concerning the quota system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. (16) Articles 95 and 96 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide that the dairy premium and additional payment are paid to producers.
Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector [13] provides for specific provisions in case of inactivity.
It is therefore appropriate to provide, when a natural or legal person holding an individual reference quantity no longer meets the conditions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 during the twelve-month period preceding 31 March of the year concerned, for an exclusion from the benefit of the premium and payment. (17) Articles 88 to 92 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for a new aid scheme for energy crops to be granted to farmers.
The conditions where processing is carried out by the farmer on the holding should also be defined. (19) To ensure that the raw material is processed into the specified energy product, first processors should lodge a security, despite the fact that the aid is granted not to first processors but to farmers.
In addition, in order to make the control system for the scheme effective, sales of raw materials and of semi-processed products should be limited to a maximum of two before final processing. (20) An explicit distinction should be made between the applicant's obligations, which end once the total quantity of raw material harvested is delivered, and the obligations incumbent on first processors, which commence on delivery and end with the final processing of the raw materials into energy products. (21) Certain transport operations within Community territory involving raw materials and products derived therefrom should be subject to controls entailing the use of T5 control copies to be issued in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code [14].
Provision should be made for alternative evidence should the T5 control copy be lost as a result of circumstances for which the first processor is not responsible. (22) Article 98 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for a reduction of the specific regional aid for arable crops when the total amount of aid claimed exceeds the fixed ceiling.
The modalities for the calculation of the reduction coefficient should therefore be established. (23) Article 99 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility of direct aid being granted for the production of one or more seed species. (24) That aid may be granted only for the production of basic seed or certified seed and these products should be clearly defined by reference to the Directives on certification and marketing of seeds: Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed [15], Council Directive 66/402/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of cereal seed [16], and Council Directive 2002/57/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants [17]. (25) To make controls possible, basic seed and certified seed should be produced under growing contracts or growing declarations which will be joined to the single application and seed establishments and breeders should be officially approved or registered.
The necessary measures should be laid down for cases where a seed establishment or a breeder from one Member State grows seed in another Member State. (26) For administrative reasons, aid should, in each Member State, be granted only in respect of products harvested on the territory of that Member State. (27) Under Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, production aid is payable for basic and certified seed of varieties of Cannabis sativa L.
eligible for aid set up in Annex II to Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers [18] should be used for that purpose. (28) Article 108 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 defines the land that is eligible for arable crops area payments.
Accordingly, it is necessary to define what is meant by silage grass. (30) Article 106 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 subjects the area payment for flax and hemp grown for fibre to the conclusion of a contract or to a commitment as referred to in Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre [19].
A list of eligible varieties for flax should therefore be drawn up, the eligible varieties for hemp being listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 796/2004.
To provide firmer guarantees in the case of hemp, the use of certified seed should also be required. (31) Article 109 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 requires producers of cereals, oilseeds and protein plants to complete sowing by 31 May at the latest.
In certain cases, sowing may be put off until after 31 May because of the climate.
The final date for sowing sweetcorn should therefore be deferred to 15 June. (33) It is appropriate to provide that a minimum quantity of certified durum wheat seed is to be used in the case of the durum wheat supplement and special aid.
In view of the diversity of agricultural practice within the Member States and within regions thereof, the setting of the minimum quantity should be left to the Member States concerned. (34) For the purpose of Article 103 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, what is meant by irrigation should be defined. (35) The areas to be taken into account with a view to assessing any overshoot in the base area and the rules for determining the extent of such overshoots should be specified.
The procedure to be followed for establishing overshoot of the ceiling of the payments referred to in Article 102(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should also be specified. (36) In the event of application of Article 71 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, eligibility for arable crops area payments is conditional on an obligation on the producers concerned to set aside part of the area on their holdings.
The legume crops referred to in the second indent of Article 107(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be defined. (37) Under Article 107(6) and in the event of application of Article 66 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, detailed rules should be established regarding land voluntarily set-aside.
Those rules should be consistent with the overall system introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. (38) The criteria for eligibility for sheep and goat premiums provided for in Chapter 11 of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, and in particular the conditions required, need to be laid down. (39) Article 113(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the granting of a premium to goatmeat farmers in certain areas of the Community.
Provisions should be made for a declaration to be provided by farmers meeting those criteria to prove that at least half of the land they are using for agricultural production is located in less-favoured areas or in areas which qualify for the goat premium. (41) For the purpose of control on eligibility for the correct level of ewe premium, Member States should draw up an inventory of farmers marketing sheep's milk or sheep's milk products. (42) With a view to implementing the system of individual limits as introduced by Articles 116, 117 and 118 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the existing administrative rules may continue to be applied as regards, in particular, the use of rights granted free of charge, the use of normal rights including minimum use, the temporary leasing and transfer of rights, the notification of changes on individual ceiling and the transfer of rights through the national reserve.
Some of those rules are specific provisions for exceptional and duly justified circumstances such as, regarding the use of rights, the small farmers and farmers participating in extensification programs and early retirement schemes, and, for the transfer purpose, the inheritance of premiums rights and the case of farmers using only publicly or collectively owned land for grazing. (43) The Commission is to monitor the new arrangements and as a result it needs to be properly provided by the Member States with the essential information regarding the implementation of the premium rules. (44) If applicable, detailed information on the national rules on, and the implementation of, the additional payments should be forwarded to the Commission. (45) Title IV Chapter 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for beef and veal payments.
For the purposes of the deseasonalisation premium, those animals should be deemed to have qualified for the special premium. (47) Provision should be made for the administrative document laid down in Article 123(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to be drawn up and issued at national level.
In order to take account of particular administrative and control conditions in the Member States, different forms of administrative document should be allowed. (48) Article 123(3)(a) and Article 130(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 lay down a retention period as a condition for granting the special premium and the slaughter premium.
In order to take account of the specific features of the form of granting at the time of slaughter, the age conditions for steers and the method of presentation of the carcase for adult bovine animals should be laid down. (50) The conditions for granting the deseasonalisation premium should be laid down, in accordance with the arrangements for granting the slaughter premium.
Provision should be made for using the computerised database referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 [20]. (56) Steps should be taken to ensure that the extensification payment is not granted to farmers who artificially comply with the average stocking rates required for the grant of the extensification payment. (57) The procedures for determining, on the basis of available information, which Member States meet the conditions in Article 132(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 for granting the extensification payment to dairy cows should be laid down.
A minimum retention period should be laid down. (58) Specific provisions should be laid down as regards the application of the rules on periods, dates and time limits to the retention period. (59) In the interests of simplification, the "livestock" aid application provided for in the integrated system should be taken to represent application for the slaughter premium, provided that it contains all the elements needed to justify payment of the premium and that the animal is slaughtered in the same Member State or in another Member State, or exported. (60) It should be possible to use the computerised database referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 to facilitate the management of the slaughter premium, on condition that the Member State concerned considers that the database offers adequate assurances as to the accuracy of the data it contains for the purposes of the payment of premiums. (61) The slaughter premium for calves is conditional on a maximum weight limit.
Therefore detailed rules for the application of the single area payment scheme should be laid down. (70) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 143b(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and in order to avoid managing numerous applications that would entail payments per holding lower than EUR 50, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have requested the authorisation to set the minimum size of eligible area par holding at a level higher than 0.3 ha. (71) The Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have estimated the part of their utilised agricultural area which has been maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 and have proposed to adjust it in accordance with the minimum size of eligible area per holding. (72) Article 143c of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides for the possibility in the new Member States of complementing direct aid paid to a farmer, subject to authorisation by the Commission.
The general modalities for implementing this possibility should be established. (73) Article 55(b) and the first indent of Article 107(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for exemption from set-aside if the land is used for producing materials for the manufacture within the Community of products not primarily intended for human or animal consumption, provided that effective control systems are applied. (74) The cultivation of sugarbeet, Jerusalem artichokes or chicory roots on land set aside should not be ruled out under certain conditions.
To this end it should be laid down that a contract must be concluded between the producer and the collector or first processor with respect to the agricultural raw materials concerned.
Conditions should also be laid down for cases where processing is carried out by the farmer on the holding. (76) To guarantee conformity with point 7 of the Memorandum of understanding on certain oil seeds between the European Economic Community and the United States of America within the framework of the GATT, approved by Council Decision 93/355/EC [21], detailed implementing rules must be laid down to reduce, where necessary, the quantity of by-products which may be produced for human or animal consumption if the total quantity of those by-products exceeds 1 million metric tonnes annually, expressed in soya bean meal equivalents. (77) To ensure that the raw material is processed into the specified end product, collectors or first processors must lodge a security, even though the aid is granted to farmers.
In addition, to make the control system for the scheme effective, the number of processors should be limited. (78) A clear distinction must be made between the applicant's obligations, which end once the total quantity of raw material harvested is delivered, and the obligations, including the requirement concerning securities, incumbent on collectors and first processors, which commence on delivery and end with the final processing of the raw materials into end products. (79) Certain transport operations within Community territory involving raw materials and products derived therefrom should be subject to controls entailing the use of declarations and T5 control copies to be issued in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
It is necessary to lay down the way in which the total sum per Member State available for the additional payments is distributed over the eligible areas. (81) A time limit should be set for committing the payment in respect of the measures listed in Article 7(1) (a) to (d) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 of 26 July 1971 on the common organisation of the market in hops [22] by the recognised hop producer groups and the Commission should be informed about the way the payment has been used.
This Regulation lays down detailed rules for the implementation of the following supports schemes provided for in Titles IV and IVa of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003: (a) specific quality premium for durum wheat provided for in Title IV Chapter 1 of that Regulation; (b) protein crop premium provided for in Title IV Chapter 2 of that Regulation; (c) crop-specific payment for rice provided for in Title IV Chapter 3 of that Regulation; (d) area payment for nuts provided for in Title IV Chapter 4 of that Regulation; (e) aid for energy crops provided for in Title IV Chapter 5 of that Regulation; (f) aid for starch potato provided for in Title IV Chapter 6 of that Regulation; (g) dairy premium and additional payments provided for in Title IV Chapter 7 of that Regulation; (h) specific regional aid for arable crops provided for in Title IV Chapter 8 of that Regulation; (i) seed aid provided for in Title IV Chapter 9 of that Regulation; (j) arable crops area payment provided for in Title IV Chapter 10 of that Regulation; (k) sheep and goat premiums provided for in Title IV Chapter 11 of that Regulation; (l) beef and veal payments provided for in Title IV Chapter 12 of that Regulation; (m) grain legumes aid provided for in Title IV Chapter 13 of that Regulation; (n) single area payment scheme provided for in Article 143b of that Regulation; (o) complementary national direct payments provided for in Article 143c of that Regulation; (p) hops area aid provided for in Title IV Chapter 10d of that Regulation. 2.
This Regulation lays down detailed rules as regards the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials under the single payment scheme provided for in Title III of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and under arable crops area payment provided for in Title IV Chapter 10 of that Regulation.
The direct payment referred to in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (h) and (j) shall be granted only for the areas entirely sown and on which all normal cultivation conditions have been performed in accordance with local standards.
However, in the case of the specific quality premium for durum wheat provided for in Title IV Chapter 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and of arable crops payment provided for in Title IV Chapter 10 of that Regulation, crops grown on areas which are fully sown and which are cultivated in accordance with local standards, but which do not attain the stage of flowering as a result of exceptional weather conditions recognised by the Member State concerned, shall remain eligible for aid provided that the areas in question are not used for any other purpose up to this growing stage. 3.
Land used to produce raw materials referred to in Article 55 (b) and in the first indent of Article 107 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or cultivated under the energy crop aid provided for in Title IV Chapter 5 of that Regulation shall not be eligible for Community aid provided for in Title II Chapter VIII of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 [24], with the exception of support granted in respect of the costs of planting fast-growing species as provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 31(3) of that Regulation.
For the purpose of the protein crop premium provided for in Title IV Chapter 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and arable crops area payment provided for in Title IV Chapter 10 of that Regulation, "sweet lupins" shall means those varieties of lupins producing seed comprising not more than 5 % bitter seeds.
The bitter seed content shall be calculated in accordance with the test set out in Annex I to this Regulation.
Article 3 Communications The Member States shall communicate the following data to the Commission by electronic transmission: (a) by 15 September of the year concerned at the latest: the available data on the areas, or the quantities in the case of the dairy premium and additional payment provided for in Articles 95 and 96 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, for which the aid has been claimed for that calendar year, where the case may be subdivided by sub-base area; (b) by 31 October of the year concerned at the latest: definitive data on the areas or quantities referred in point (a), taking into account checks already carried out; (c) by 31 July of the following year at the latest: the final data corresponding to the areas or quantities for which the aid has actually been paid for the year concerned, after, where applicable, the deduction of the reductions in area provided for in Title IV Chapter 1 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004.
The coefficient of reduction of area in the case referred to in Articles 75, 78(2), 82, 85, 89(2), 98, 143 and 143b(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 or of the quantities and the objective criteria in the case referred to in Article 95(4) of that Regulation shall be fixed at the latest by 15 November of the year concerned on the basis of the data communicated in accordance with Article 3(b) of this Regulation. 2.
Member States listed in Article 74(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall establish the list of durum wheat varieties eligible for the special quality premium provided for in Article 72 of that Regulation in accordance with the variety screening method laid down in paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article. 2.
Member States shall analyse durum wheat varieties according to the following quality parameters and assign to each parameter the relevant weighting: (a) protein content (40 %); (b) gluten quality (30 %): (c) yellow index (20 %); (d) specific weight or weight of one thousand kernels (10 %).
A Member State may exclude from the list of eligible varieties the varieties which have an average rate of loss of vitreous aspect of durum wheat ("mitadinage") exceeding 27 %. 5.
The yellow index shall be measured in accordance with the ICC 152 method or an equivalent recognised method. 3.
The gluten quality shall be measured in accordance with the ICC 158 method or according to the ICC 151 method.
Article 7 Quantity of certified seeds Member States shall fix, before 1 October of the year preceding the year in respect of which the specific quality premium for durum wheat is granted, the minimum quantity of seed, certified in accordance with Directive 66/402/EEC [26], to be used in accordance with the current agricultural practices in the production zone concerned.
Article 8 Publications and communications 1.
Member States shall publish the list of selected varieties which are eligible at national or regional level to the special quality premium for durum wheat, by 1 October at the latest for winter varieties, and by 31 December at the latest for spring varieties, of the year preceding the year in respect of which the premium is granted. 2.

Without prejudice to Article 87 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, a Member State may establish further eligibility criteria, provided that such criteria are consistent with the environmental, rural, social and economic objectives of the aid scheme and do not introduce discrimination between producers.
Member States shall communicate to the Commission in any case before the date for lodging an application fixed by Member States in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 and at the latest: (a) by 31 March, the higher levels and the criteria referred to in Article 15(4) and the additional criteria referred to in Article 16; (b) by 15 May, where a Member State differentiates the aid in accordance with Article 83(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the level of the area payment per products and/or the modified national guaranteed area ("the NGA"). 2.
Article 18 Transitional measures 1.
Member States may determine whether and under what conditions the improvement plans referred to in Article 86(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 may be ceased before their normal expiry and relative areas become eligible under the scheme provided for in Chapter 4 of Title IV of that Regulation. 2.
