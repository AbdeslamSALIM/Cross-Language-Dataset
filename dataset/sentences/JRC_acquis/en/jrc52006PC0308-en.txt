The existing instruments, such as the European economic interest grouping on Community level or bi- or multilateral agreements between Member States have proven ill-adapted to organising a structured co-operation for economic and social cohesion in the meaning of Article 158 of the Treaty and in particular of structural fund programmes within the INTERREG initiative during the 2000-2006 programming period.
Amendment 3 The definition of “territorial co-operation” as covering the three forms of co-operation, namely “cross-border”, “trans-national” and “inter-regional”, has not been taken up in Recital 7, but in Article 1(2).

Amendment 37 The common position foresees an assembly and a director (Article 10(1)).
