Huber PCC; - declare that the concentration forming the subject matter of case COMP/M.3796 — Omya/J.M.
Huber PCC is deemed to have been declared compatible with the common market; and - order the Commission to pay the costs.
Finally, the applicant alleges that the contested decision is in breach of the legitimate expectation of the applicant that it had discharged its obligation to provide the requested information and that the deadline for a final decision on the notified concentration was 31 March 2006.
