Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Green Paper &amp;mdash; Defence procurement (COM(2004) 608 final) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Green Paper — Defence procurement (COM(2004) 608 final) (2005/C 221/12) On 23 September 2004 the Commission decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the Green paper — Defence procurement.
At this same meeting the EESC adopted the following opinion, by 96 votes with 9 abstentions: 1.
The challenge will be to use Article 296 in conformity with decisions in past cases [8] while retaining its possibility as a derogation from standard rules for public procurement.
The benefits of greater competition and greater transparency should be stressed in the discussion. 3.2.4 The list of products produced in 1958 under Article 296.2 which suggests the scope of Article 296.1 is not working and is likely to remain of no real value as a useful way of ensuring the proper use of the security derogation.
Industry also needs to avoid over burdensome regulatory procedures. 4.2 It must be made very clear what parts of the defence equipment procurement process will be covered by the rules agreed. 4.3 Article 296 of the Treaty will continue to be required.
Brussels, 9 February 2005.
The President of the European Economic and Social Committee Anne-Marie Sigmund [1] OJEC C10/1 of 14.1.2004 [2] EDA has four agreed functions; defence capabilities development, armaments cooperation, the European defence technological and industrial base and defence equipment market and research and technology. [3] As we commented in our opinion on COM(2003) 113 final, this combined EU spending is about 40 % that of the US, yet only produces about 10 % of the operational capabilities. [4] For example, the Committee notes the recent (September 2004) statement by the head of the EDA that EU forces are not well adapted to the modern world and its conflicts and threats; he spoke of the need to acquire more high technology equipment. [5] Such as OCCAR, Western European Armemnets group (WEAG) and Letter of Intent (LoI) countries. [6] OCCAR is a joint organisation for armaments cooperation to which 5 MS currently belong. [7] However, because of the specific nature of defence markets and because of the need to manage payments as part of national financial arrangements, MS will inevitably play a role in facilitating the development of defence equipment. [8] The decisions in the "Bremen case" (1999/763/63(OJ L 301/8 of 24 November 1999) and the "Koninklijke Schelde Groep" (OJ L 14/56 of 21 January 2003) are examples of the current lack of clarity. [9] We should note that even apparently simple equipment such as clothing can involve advanced technology.
