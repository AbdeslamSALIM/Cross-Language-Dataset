Case T-417/05: Action brought on 29 November 2005 — ENDESA v Commission Action brought on 29 November 2005 — ENDESA v Commission Parties Applicant: ENDESA S.
Muñoz de Juan, lawyers, J.
In that regard, the applicant states, first of all, that the contested decision should have been adopted prior to the decision on referral, provided for in Article 22 of the Regulation on concentrations, since it is clear from the wording of that provision itself that decisions relating to requests for a referral must relate to concentrations which comply with the threshold laid down by the laws of one or more countries and which lack a Community dimension.
Likewise, the applicant maintains that by failing to take into consideration Endesa's consolidated accounts for the last accounting year, which were properly drawn up in accordance with Community accounting criteria (NIC/NIIF) in force at the time when the concentration took place, the Decision infringes Article 5 of the Regulation on concentrations by departing from the Commission's practice and conflicting with the principles set out in the Notice on calculation of turnover.
The applicant adds that in relation to the adjustments, which the Decision examines in the light of the Notice on calculation of turnover, a number of those adjustments comply with the strict application of the Community accounting criteria in force and they should not be confused with adjustments in accordance with Article 5 of the Regulation on concentrations.
