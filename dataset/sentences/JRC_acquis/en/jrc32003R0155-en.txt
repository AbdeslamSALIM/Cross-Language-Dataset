Initiation (2) On 13 June 2002, the Commission announced by a notice (Notice of Initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports into the Community of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the PRC and Taiwan. (3) The review was initiated on an initiative of the Commission in order to examine the appropriateness of the measures in force.
RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION (7) Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993(4) laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code foresees, for the determination of the customs value, an apportioning of the price actually paid or payable in situations where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation. (8) In order to avoid that an excessive amount of anti-dumping duty is levied, the specific duty should, in case of damaged goods, be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable.
Done at Brussels, 27 January 2003.
