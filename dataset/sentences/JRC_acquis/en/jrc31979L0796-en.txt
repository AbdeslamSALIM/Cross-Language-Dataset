Preparation of the solution Weigh as quickly as possible 26 ± 0 7002 g of the sample and transfer it quantitatively into a 100 ml volumetric flask (5.5) with approximately 60 ml of water.
Mix the solution by rotating the flask and wash the flask walls, until the volume is such that the meniscus is about 10 mm below the calibration mark.
Allow to stand for five minutes. 6.2.
Polarization Maintain the temperature at 20 ± 1 ºC for all subsequent operations. 6.2.1.
Collect the next 50 ml of the filtrate. 6.2.3.
Place the filled tube in the cradle of the instrument. 6.2.5.
Formula and method of calculation The results are expressed in degrees S to the nearest 0 71 ºS.
To convert the angular degrees into degrees S, the following formula is used: ºS = degree of arc × 2 7889 7.2.
Repeatability The difference between the results of two determinations when carried out simultaneously or in rapid succession on the same sample, by the same analyst, under the same conditions, and each representing the mean of five readings, must not exceed 0 71 ºS.
