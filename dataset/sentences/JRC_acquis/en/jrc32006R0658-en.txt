Those detailed rules should follow the same lines as those already laid down in Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 with regard to olive oil, tobacco, cotton and hops. (4) The application of Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to all sectors included in the single payment scheme after the first year of application may lead to the situation that the amounts that remain in the national reserve after allocation of reference amounts from that national reserve in the cases provided for in that Article are not needed anymore to cover any further cases.
In that case the Member States should be authorised to increase proportionally the unit value of all payment entitlements. (5) Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 provides for the detailed rules for farmers who made investments in production capacity or who leased parcels on a long-term basis.
In the case where the amounts contained in the national reserve show to be higher than what is needed to cover the cases referred to in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the Member States may increase proportionally the unit value of all payment entitlements.
Payment entitlements may only be declared for payment once per year by the farmer who holds them at the latest date for lodging the single application in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004.
However, where a farmer makes use of the possibility to amend the single application in accordance with Article 15 of that Regulation, he may also declare payment entitlements which he holds at the date of his notification of the amendments to the competent authority provided that the payment entitlements concerned are not declared by another farmer in respect of the same year.
Where a Member State has applied the single payment scheme in 2005, the percentage of reduction fixed by the Member State in accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall apply in 2006 to the tobacco, olive oil, cotton, sugar beet, cane and chicory reference amounts to be integrated in the single payment scheme."; (e) paragraph 7 is replaced by the following: "7.
