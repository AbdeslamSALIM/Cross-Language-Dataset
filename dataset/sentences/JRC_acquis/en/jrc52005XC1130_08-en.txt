The Commission therefore undertook to fall into line with the approach adopted by a large number of States and supported by international bodies such as IFAC [1] and OECD.
The Financial Regulation [2] lays down the broad outlines of the new accounting framework for the European Communities from 2005.
The transitional provisions of the Financial Regulation include the general rule that the provisions of Title VII of part one — Accounting — shall apply gradually depending on technical possibilities in order to be fully effective for the budgetary year 2005.
Finally, the scope of consolidation will be extended in 2005 to include the various Community agencies.
Thus these financial statements for 2004 are the last to be prepared under the transitional provisions of the Financial Regulation.

EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES [1] International Federation of Accountants. [2] OJ L 248, 16.9.2002. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 1 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, RULES AND METHODS A.
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES 1.
LEGAL PROVISIONS The accounts are kept in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of this Financial Regulation.
THE FINANCIAL REGULATION The Financial Regulation adopted by the Council on 25 June 2002 (OJ L 248 of 16 September 2002, p. 1, with a corrigendum in OJ L 25 of 30 January 2003, p. 43) brings together the provisions on the presentation of accounts and accounting in Title VII of Part One.
While this Financial Regulation is applicable from 1 January 2003, Article 181 contains a number of transitional provisions, some of which relate to the presentation of the accounts.
Article 128 stipulates that, starting with the annual accounts for 2005, the Commission's accounting officer must submit the consolidated provisional accounts by 31 March of the following year, on the basis of the provisional accounts that each Institution and other consolidated bodies have sent by 1 March.
These accounts are sent to the Court of Auditors, who must make its observations by 15 June (Article 129).
The transitional provisions lay down the general rule that the provisions of Title VII of Part One shall apply gradually depending on technical possibilities in order to be fully effective for the budgetary year 2005.
Under the transitional provisions of the new Financial Regulation, for accounts relating to financial years prior to 2005, the Accounting Officer of the Commission must, in accordance with Article 128(2) and Article 181(2) of the Financial Regulation, prepare the provisional consolidated annual accounts and send them no later than 1 May to the Court of Auditors together with the individual provisional annual accounts of each Institution (and other consolidated bodies).
Both the provisional and final annual accounts for 2004 are presented as follows: Volume I contains the consolidated accounts, Volume II the Commission's accounts and Volume III the individual accounts of the other consolidated Institutions and the ECSC in liquidation. 3.
If they are to present a true and fair view, financial statements must not only supply relevant information to describe the nature and range of an Institution's activities, explain how it is financed and supply definitive information on its operations, but do so in a clear and comprehensible manner which allows comparisons between financial years.
For example, the financial statements for 2004 take account of certain elements of the principle of prudence and accrual accounting, such as value adjustments for entitlements, depreciation and the entry of carryovers in the accounts as charges for the financial year.
CURRENCY AND BASIS FOR CONVERSION 1.1 Accounts are kept in euros. 1.2 Except for the headings set out below, assets and liabilities are converted into euros on the basis of the conversion rates applying on 31 December 2004: €1 | CYP 0,5800 | €1 | CZK 30,4640 | €1 | DKK 7,4388 | €1 | EEK 15,6466 | €1 | GBP 0,7051 | €1 | HUF 245,9700 | €1 | LVL 0,6979 | €1 | LTL 3,4528 | €1 | MTL 0,4343 | €1 | PLN 4,0845 | €1 | SKK 38,7450 | €1 | SIT 239,7600 | €1 | SEK 9,0206 | €1 | USD 1,3621 | €1 | JPY 139,6500 | Different conversion methods apply to the following headings: - tangible and intangible assets, which retain their value in euros at the rate that applied at the date when they were purchased; - commitments outstanding, some of which are commitments in national currencies, were revalued using the rates for December; - pre-financing paid under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, which are converted at the exchange rates applying on the 10th day of the month following the month in which they are granted. 1.3 Monetary items other than those listed above are revalued at the closing euro rate on the date the accounts are closed.
REVENUE 2.1 The amounts of own resources and financial contributions entered in the accounts are those credited in the course of the year to the accounts opened in the Commission's name by the governments of the Member States.
The difference between the amount of VAT own resources, GNI-based resources and financial contributions entered in the budget and the amount actually due is calculated by 1 July of the following year and entered in an amending budget for that year. 2.2 The other revenue entered in the accounts is the amount actually received in the course of the year. 3.
EXPENDITURE 3.1 For the purposes of calculating the budget outturn for the year, expenditure comprises payments made against the year's appropriations for payments plus any of the appropriations for that year that are carried over to the following year. 3.2 Payments made against the year's appropriations for payments means payments that are made by the accounting officer by 31 December of the financial year.
EAGGF guarantee expenditure may be subject to a clearance decision following controls in the Member States. 4.
As a result of these adjustments, the annual accounts can be presented in accordance with the principle of modified accrual accounting, based on modified cash budget accounting. 4.3 Result of borrowing and lending activities Borrowing and lending activities are off-budget operations provided for in the Treaties.
The result is paid back to the general budget of the Communities.
A reserve has also been set up for future risks. 4.4 Economic outturn of the ECSC in liquidation The economic outturn of the ECSC in liquidation represents the difference between its revenues and expenses for the year arising from the liquidation of its financial operations, investment movements and its contributions to the Research Fund for Coal &amp; Steel.
This result is not paid back to the Communities but kept within the ECSC in liquidation to finance its future activities. 5.
Assets covered by finance leases are valued at the date of entry into force of the lease at the lower of the market value of the asset or the discounted value of the minimum lease payments due, in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000.
Except for land, assets under construction, pre-financing paid out and works of art, these fixed assets must also be subject to depreciation, according to the straight line method (Title IV, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000 on the management in the accounts of the non-financial fixed assets of the European Institutions) at the following rates: Depreciation rates Type of asset | Straight line depreciation rate | Computer software | 25 % | Computer hardware | 25 % | Kitchens — Cafeterias — Nurseries Small electrical equipment | 25 % | Cash registers | 25 % | Large kitchen equipment | 12,5 % | Specialist furniture for kitchens, cafeterias | 12,5 % | Specialist furniture for nurseries | 25 % | Plant, machinery and tools | | Telecommunication and audiovisual equipment Telephone and fax machines | 25 % | Headphones, earphones, microphones | 25 % | Cameras | 25 % | Videos | 25 % | Video and dictating machines | 25 % | Projectors (slides and overhead) | 25 % | Photographic equipment | 25 % | Projector screens | 25 % | Televisions, radios, monitors (not including computers) | 25 % | Technical equipment Printers, mail, security, building, tools | 12,5 % | Measuring or laboratory equipment | 25 % | Other plant, machinery and tools | 12,5 % | Movable shelving, partitions, false floors, false ceilings and wiring | 25 % | Vehicle fleet | 25 % | Furniture | 10 % | Buildings | 4 % | Land | n.a. | 5.2 Stocks: Office supplies and other consumer goods are valued at the price of the last supplies received.
Entitlements due for more than one year are written down by 20 %.
PRE-FINANCING Pre-financing amounts for operational purposes are included in the year's expenditure and do not appear as assets in the balance sheet.
Pre-financing amounts to public or private intermediaries which had not been received by the final beneficiary at 31 December 2004 and which are included in the year's budget expenditure are entered on the assets side of the balance sheet as short-term assets, under sundry debtors. 7.
As a result, the financial statements of the ECSC in liquidation were consolidated in the European Communities accounts for the first time in 2003.
The scope of consolidation will be extended in the 2005 annual accounts to the bodies mentioned in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation.
At 31 December 2004 the total assets of both were EUR 246 million and EUR 18.6 billion respectively. [1] This differs from cash-based accounting because of elements such as carryovers. [2] In the case of the EFTA-EEA countries, the volume of appropriations carried over from year n to year n+1 is known after the accounts have been closed.
The budgetary procedure is set out in Article 272 of the EC Treaty which stipulates the sequence of stages and the time-limits which must be respected by the two arms of the budgetary authority: the Council and Parliament.
Unless otherwise stated, the following budgetary provisions refer to the Financial Regulation adopted by the Council on 25 June 2002 (OJ L 248, 16 September 2002, p. 1 and corrigendum OJ L 25, 30 January 2003, p. 43) which applies with effect from 1 January 2003. 1.
BUDGETARY PRINCIPLES The general budget of the Communities is governed by a number of basic principles: - unity and budget accuracy: all Communities' expenditure and revenue must be incorporated in a single budget document, must be booked on a budget line and expenditure must not exceed authorised appropriations; - universality: this principle comprises two rules: - the rule of non-assignment, meaning that budget revenue must not be earmarked for specific items of expenditure (total revenue must cover total expenditure); - the gross budget rule, meaning that revenue and expenditure are entered in full in the budget without any adjustment against each other; - annuality: the appropriations entered are authorised for a single year and must therefore be used during that year; - equilibrium: the revenue and expenditure shown in the budget must be in balance (estimated revenue must equal payment appropriations); - specification: each appropriation is assigned to a specific purpose and a specific objective; - unit of account: the budget is drawn up and implemented in euros and the accounts are presented in euros; - sound financial management: budget appropriations are used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, namely in accordance with the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness; - transparency: the budget is established and implemented and the accounts presented in compliance with the principle of transparency — the budget and amending budgets are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. 2.
A part of the funds of the ECSC in liquidation were placed at the disposal of the operational budget of the ECSC in liquidation.
The last budget was drawn up for the period of 1st January to 23 July 2002.
As from 24 July 2002, the revenue and charges connected with the operational budget are included in the revenue and expenditure account of the ECSC in liquidation.
For the differentiated appropriations, budget commitments not yet made for future years are shown as a contingent liability in the off balance sheet (under point 6). - payment appropriations: cover expenditure arising from commitments entered into in the current financial year and/or earlier financial years. [2] 4.
They come from previous financial years or outside sources. 4.1 Final Budget Appropriations — Initial budget appropriations adopted — Transfers Appropriations may be transferred between lines in accordance with the rules laid down in Articles 22 to 24 of the Financial Regulation. [3] — Amending budgets The budget adopted may be amended or increased by an amending budget.
The rules are set out in Articles 37 and 38 of the Financial Regulation. 4.2 Appropriations carried over from previous year or made available again — Appropriations automatically carried over These are non-differentiated payment appropriations which may be carried over automatically for one financial year only (no limits for the ECSC in liquidation) in accordance with Article 9(4) of the Financial Regulation. — Appropriations carried over by decision of the Institutions An Institution may decide to carry over appropriations from the previous budget in one of two cases: if the preparatory stages have been completed (Article 9(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation) or if the legal base is adopted late (Article 9(2)(b)).
The amounts received are considered to be revenue from third parties which is allocated to the budget lines concerned (often in the field of research) and may be carried over without limit (Article 10 and Article 18(1)(a) and (d) of the Financial Regulation). — Work for third parties As part of their research activities, the Communities' research centres may work for outside bodies, (Article 161(2) of the Financial Regulation).
Like the revenue from third parties, the work for third parties is assigned to specific budget lines and may be carried over without limit (Article 10 and Article 18(1)(e) of the Financial Regulation). — Appropriations made available again as a result of repayment of payments on account These are Communities' funds which have been repaid by the beneficiaries.
Repayments of payments on account are entered as assigned revenue (Articles 10 and 18(2) of the Financial Regulation) and may be carried over without limit.
the budget in accordance with this Regulation, on its own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations authorised." Article 50 states that the Commission shall confer on the Institutions the requisite powers for the implementation of the sections of the budget relating to them. 6.1 Execution of revenue The budget takes over the revenue forecasts subject to any changes resulting from the adoption of amending budgets which adjust the forecasts in the initial budget in line with the reductions or increases in revenue established during implementation.
The actual revenue for a financial year corresponds to the revenue collected against entitlements established in the course of the year and amounts collected against entitlements still to be recovered from previous years. 6.2.
The execution of expenditure shows how appropriations for commitments [4] and appropriations for payments [5] are changed, used, carried over and lapse during the year. 6.2.1.
Utilisation of appropriations: - Appropriations for commitments: The appropriations authorised are available during the financial year for entering into commitments. - Appropriations for payments: The appropriations authorised are available during the financial year for making payments. 6.2.2.
Carryovers to the following year: Appropriations for commitments: Some types of appropriation which are not committed may be carried over automatically, as is the case with assigned revenue (Article 10 of the Financial Regulation).
Appropriations for payments: As is the case for commitment appropriations, unused payment appropriations from assigned revenue are carried over automatically. - non-differentiated appropriations: carryover is generally automatic if it is to cover outstanding commitments (Article 9(4) of the Financial Regulation); - differentiated appropriations: unused payment appropriations usually lapse; however, they may be carried over by Commission decision if the payment appropriations for the following financial year will not cover existing commitments or commitments linked to commitment appropriations which have themselves been carried over (Article 9(3) of the Financial Regulation). 6.2.3.
Cancellation of appropriations: Any appropriations for commitment and for payment not used and not carried over are cancelled at year-end (Article 9(1) of the Financial Regulation). 7.
FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE The 2004 financial year was the fifth covered by the financial perspective 2000-2006, concluded on 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on the basis of the conclusions of the Berlin European Council of 24 and 25 March 1999 which called for tighter budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.
As the initial financial perspective was drawn up in constant 1999 prices, point 15 of the Agreement states that each year the Commission will make a technical adjustment to the financial perspective in line with movements in the Gross National Income (GNI) of the European Union and prices.
The corresponding ceiling on the appropriations for payments comes to EUR 111,380 million, i.e. 1.08 % of GNI.

FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE AND PROGRAMMING The financial perspective for 2000-06 sets out the overall and annual totals for all the Structural Funds.
The initial financial programming was based on the annual allocations in the financial perspective for all the Funds and corresponds to the financing plans in the programming documents initially adopted. 3.
The Commission then commits the annual tranches by 30 April of each year and automatically decommits any commitments not used within two years. 3.2.
This payment may be subdivided over two budget years.
The balance of 5 % is paid on the closure of the programme once all the documents required are submitted and approved by the Commission.
A correction mechanism in respect of budgetary imbalances is also part of the own resources system. 1.
For the separate account, the Member States send the Commission a quarterly statement that includes: - the balance to be recovered during the previous quarter, - the amounts recovered during the quarter in question, - rectifications of the base (corrections/cancellations) during the quarter in question, - amounts written off, - balance to be recovered at the end of the quarter in question.
The information sent in by the Member States does not allow the amounts recovered during the year to be assigned to the year in which the entitlements arose.
When the traditional own resources from the separate account are recovered, they must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or the body appointed at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the second month following the month during which the entitlement was recovered. 2.
The VAT base is capped at 50 % of GNI for all Member States.
These VAT and GNI balances, either positive or negative, are called in by the Commission from the Member States for 1 December of the year following the budget year in question.
Corrections may still be made to the final VAT and GNI bases in subsequent years.
The budgetary imbalance correction mechanism in favour of the United Kingdom was instituted by the European Council in Fontainebleau (June 1984) and the resulting Own Resources Decision of 7 May 1985.
Article 2(3) of this Decision states that Member States shall retain, by way of collection costs, 25 % of traditional own resources instead of 10 %.
However the rate of 10 % remains applicable for the amounts of traditional own resources that should have been made available before 28 February 2001.
Since 1993 these internal policies have been brought together under a single heading of the financial perspective, forming an extremely diversified group.
Heading 4 — External action This heading of the financial perspective covers all Communities' expenditure in favour of third countries, except for enlargement-related expenditure on the candidate countries and expenditure under the European Development Fund (EDF).
Heading 5 — Administrative expenditure This heading of the financial perspective covers all the expenditure on the running of the Communities' Institutions.
Heading 6 — Reserves This heading covers three types of reserve designed to leave the necessary margins available, beneath the total ceiling on expenditure of the financial perspective, to meet expenditure which could not be foreseen when the budget was drawn up.
Heading 7 — Pre-accession aid As regards enlargement-related expenditure for the ten candidate countries from Central and Eastern Europe, a new heading, 7, has been created to cover the three pre-accession instruments established in the financial perspective for 2000-06: the agricultural instrument (SAPARD), the structural instrument (ISPA) and the Phare programme.
Pre-financing payments and payments of balances The new Financial Regulation draws a distinction between four different types of payment: - payment of the entire amount due; - prefinancing, which may be divided into a number of payments; - interim payments; - payment of the balance of the amounts due.
EAGGF Guarantee — modulations/cross compliance: these are the "modulations" adopted by the Member States under Article 3(2) and Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/99.

To be entered on the assets side of the balance sheet, they must be controlled by the Institution and generate future economic benefits for the European Communities.

For buildings that had been fully depreciated at 1 January 1998, a new depreciation plan was fixed.
This method of valuation and depreciation, applied by Ispra in 2000, was used to value land and buildings of the JRC at Geel at end-2001.
The JRC site at Ispra has, during the year, finished construction/alternation work on their building to a value of EUR 22.2 million and this amount has therefore been transferred from assets under construction to land and buildings.
Considering the age of the building has it been decided to apply a yearly depreciation rate of 10 % instead of the normally used 4 %.
An advance payment of EUR 15.9 million was made on 31 December 2003 for the Atrium II building in Brussels.
The Court of Auditors has transferred EUR 29 million from the heading "Fixed assets under construction and advances in respect of tangible fixed assets" to this heading during 2004.
Plant, machinery and tools Furniture and vehicles Computer hardware For approximately 20 % of the Delegations, there is no information about tangible fixed assets at 31 December 2004.
The result had been that, at 31 December 2003, the asset values for these buildings had been overstated by EUR 188 million, the total finance lease liabilities had been overstated by EUR 254 million and the accumulated depreciation overstated by EUR 23 million.
The net overstatement of liabilities was thus EUR 89 million and this correction has been made to the results carried forward from 2003.
The Berlaymont building is included in the balance sheet of the Commission at 31 December 2004 since the long term lease contract (27 years) was signed during 2004 and the building was taken into service.
The main building occupied by the Publications Office is not included in the balance sheet but in the "Off-balance-sheet commitments — contingent liabilities" annex to the financial statements.
In accordance with Commission Regulation No 2909/2000 of 29 December 2000 on the management in the accounts of the non-financial fixed assets of the European Institutions (OJ L 336, 30.12.2000 p. 75), this complex was up to 31 December 2003 shown in the balance sheet under "finance leases and similar entitlements".
However, in December 2003 the Parliament invoked its purchase option for this building and the purchase agreement was signed in February 2004.
On 26 March 2003 the Council signed a convention for the construction of a building in Brussels and the finance lease covering this building.

Investments in related organisations — European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) subscription The EBRD was given initial capital of EUR 10 billion, of which 3 % was subscribed by the Communities.
The proportion of this capital called up is 30 %.
The 3 % shareholding in the EBRD is valued at cost, as it represents a financial instrument under IPSAS 15 and IAS 39. — European Investment Fund (EIF) subscription The EIF is the European Union's financial institution specialising in risk capital and guarantees to SMEs.
The Commission has paid all the called-up capital, which amounts to 20 %.
Payments outstanding on non-called up capital (80 %) amount to EUR 480 million and are included as contingent liabilities in the off balance sheet.
Under the equity method, the shareholding is valued at 30 % of the EIF's own capital.
The Communities' share is 30 % of this amount (EUR 176 million), of which EUR 8.2 million concerns the result for 2004.
The Communities have subscribed for EUR 520 million of the capital of this entity and at 31 December 2004 EUR 282 million had been paid, with the balance, EUR 238 million uncalled.
Thus the value of the investment at 31 December 2004 was EUR 89.3 million being the investment of EUR 282 million less the accumulated share of the losses, EUR 192.7.
In 2003 the interest earned by Galileo on Communities' funds received was treated as a further contribution of the Communities — in 2004 this was corrected so that such interest was accounted for as income of the Galileo joint venture.
Other financial fixed assets B.1.
Although it has been difficult to calculate reliably the real value of ECIP equity contributions, in particular due to the geographical disbursal of the beneficiaries, because of the ongoing work this year the Commission has more information available and so did not need to apply a 100 % write down as in previous years. — Eurotech Capital, Venture Consort and JOP The purpose of the Eurotech Capital instrument is to encourage the private funding of trans-national high-technology projects developed by small and medium-sized undertakings through a network of risk-capital investors.
It covers payments made since 1990 in the form of pre-financing repayable under certain circumstances when contracts run out.
These contributions are reimbursable according to conditions specified in the contracts between the Communities and these venture capital companies.
In accordance with the principle of prudence, a 100 % write down has been made for the value of these contributions, which are therefore entered in the balance sheet at zero. — Other financial instruments The "SME Finance Facility/SME financing mechanism" under the trusteeship of the EBRD is designed to encourage investment funds to grow and to retain over the long term the capital investments they make in SMEs in the Phare candidate countries.
The programme is financed jointly by the Commission budget, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), in association with the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).

This facility covers loans guaranteed by the Communities as a result of a Council Decision, in particular European Investment Bank (EIB) lending operations outside the European Union and loans under macro-financial assistance (MFA loans) and Euratom loans outside the European Union.
In accordance with Article 6 of the Regulation the Commission entrusted financial management of the Fund to the EIB under an agreement signed between the Communities and the EIB on 23 November 1994 in Brussels and on 25 November 1994 in Luxembourg.
Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 on the Guarantee Fund, as amended by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1149/1999 of 25 May states that with effect from 1 January 2000 the Fund is endowed by payments from the general budget equivalent to 9 % of the capital value of the operations.
The same Regulation sets the target amount at 9 %.
The Inter-institutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure provided that the general budget of the European Communities should include a guarantee reserve to cover loans to third countries.
Since the Fund may be called on to cover defaulting debtors at any time, a provision has been created for risks and charges in line with the principle of prudence.
This provision of EUR 1,086 million (2003: EUR 1,369 million) corresponds to the target amount [2] for the Guarantee Fund calculated on the basis of the amount outstanding at 31 December 2004.

SHORT-TERM ASSETS A.
Long-term assets falling due in less than one year These amounts represent the portion of the long-term receivables that fall due during the following 12 months — see tables above for more details.
B.2 Amounts owed by Member States a.
The above figure does not include the EUR 5 million (2003: EUR 64.5 million) declared by the Member States as irrecoverable.
The declared estimate of the write-down is EUR 895.4 million (as estimated by the Member States), which accounts for 57.4 % of the total amount to be recovered at 31 December 2004 (53.2 % at 31 December 2003.) The Commission relies on the estimates of the Member States based on the assumption that the paying agencies are in a better position to assess the amounts likely to be recovered.

Own resources: The separate account contains traditional own resources of EUR 1,905 million (less 25 % [5] equals EUR 1,428.8 million) which, under Article 6(3)(b) of Regulation No 1150/2000, have been established by the Member States but not made available to the Communities as they have not yet been recovered or guaranteed, or because they have been challenged.
Each Member State sends the Commission a quarterly statement of these accounts, with the following particulars for each type of resource: - the previous quarter's outstanding balance, - the amounts recovered during the quarter in question, - rectifications of the base (corrections/cancellations) during the quarter in question, - amounts written off, - balance to be recovered at the end of the quarter in question.
When the traditional own resources from the separate account are recovered, they must be entered in the Commission's account with the treasury or the body appointed at the latest on the first working day following the 19th day of the second month following the month during which the entitlement was recovered.
In order to ensure that the separate account provides a better picture of the actual budgetary situation Article 6(4)(b) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 was amended by Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2028/2004 of 16 November 2004.
This Article states now; "Together with the final quarterly statement for a given year, Member States shall forward an estimate of the total amount of entitlements contained in the separate account at 31 December of that year for which recovery has become unlikely." Based on the estimations sent by Member States, a write-down of EUR 689.4 million has been deducted from the item for receivables from Member States on the assets side of the balance sheet — for information, the statistical method produces a similar amount.

However, the principal of the fine must be paid within the time limit laid down as the appeal does not have suspensory effect (Article 242 of the EC Treaty).
In respect of imposed fines outstanding at 31.12.2004, a total of EUR 2,021 million was collected provisionally.
These guarantees do not affect the amount of receivables on the assets side of the balance sheet, but are entered in the annex as off-balance-sheet commitments under contingent assets.
The amount shown in the off-balance-sheet commitments as potential liabilities totals EUR 3,837.9 million, being the total outstanding claims pending judgement plus interest earned on payments received pending final judgement. 2.
This amount, which totals EUR 1,313.6 million, represents funds held by intermediaries at 31 December 2004 (2003: EUR 1,007.5 million.) The split of these amounts by budget-line is given below.
As part of this project to move to full accrual accounting, the Accounting Officer has laid down accounting rules for the inclusion of pre-financing on the assets side of the balance sheet on the basis of Article 3(5) of the Regulation laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation.
Certain financial instruments are managed on trust by third-party bodies, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Investment Fund (EIF), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB) and EUROFER.
This figure does not include investments in risk capital funds by these instruments, which are shown under "Other investments" (Assets IV.B.1).
The EFTA financial mechanism was introduced in 1993 to support the development and structural adjustment of certain regions of the European Union.
The Commission's share at 31 December 2004 is EUR 36.3 million (2003: EUR 44.5 million.) 5.
These amounts primarily relate to advances granted under both the ECIP (EUR 51.5 million) and MEDIA (EUR 41.7 million) programmes.
Given the nature and circumstances surrounding this receivable a write down of 100 % was considered prudent. 7.
These are recovery orders entered in the accounts at 31 December 2004 as established entitlements to be recovered and not already included under other headings on the assets side of the balance sheet.
Entitlements due for more than one year are written down by 20 %.
This overall write-down is calculated on the amount of the entitlements outstanding at the end of the year.

This provision of EUR 1,086 million (2003: EUR 1,369 million) corresponds to the target amount [7] for the Guarantee Fund calculated on the basis of the amount of loans outstanding at 31 December 2004.
The difference between the amount of the Fund shown on the assets side and the amount of the provision corresponds to the surplus to be repaid to the budget i.e.
To fully apply IPSAS rules, this provision is indexed for inflation (at a rate of 2.5 %) and then discounted to its net present value (at 5 %).
Pensions At 31 December 2004, the rules concerning the Communities' pension scheme are defined by the new version of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities (in force from 1st May 2004).
In accordance with article 83 of the Staff Regulations, the payment of the benefits provided for in the pension scheme constitutes a charge to the Communities' budget.
The liabilities under the Communities' pension scheme were the subject to an actuarial valuation by independent experts on 31 December 2004 on the basis of the applicable rules of the new statute.
The life table (EU 2004) was made on the basis of the national tables of the officials' countries of origin, and was corrected to take account of actual observed mortality rates; 2.
The nominal discount rate was based on the zero coupon euro yield curve in December 2004 for a duration close to that of the scheme (19 years), being 4.3 %; on the other hand, the inflation was based on the annual rate of change of the HICP in December 2004, being 2.4 %; so the used real discount rate was 1.9 %; 4.
The matrimoniality coefficients for active officials at the time of their departure on retirement were based on statistics of the population of officials and equal to 90 % for men and 60 % for women; 7.
The departure on retirement was supposed to occur at the time when the official benefits from his full rights, taking into account the reduction for early retirement and the Barcelona Incentive for late retirement, at the latest at 65 years.

CONTINGENT ASSETS POINT 1: GUARANTEES RECEIVED 1.1 Guarantees received under borrowing and lending activities The Commission has received guarantees from third-party guarantors in respect of guarantees it has granted on loans under its borrowing and lending activities.
The guarantees received may be classified as follows: Guarantees received EUR | | 31.12.2004 | 31.12.2003 | Euratom: guarantees by third countries | 170000000 | 105000000 | NCI: Loans to Member States | 0 | 16316686 | Total | 170000000 | 121316686 | The Commission has not received third-party guarantees for loans granted under the financial assistance (MFA) scheme.
However, these loans, totalling EUR 1,214 million, are guaranteed by the Guarantee Fund. 1.2 Other guarantees received These are guarantees received by the Commission in connection with the operation of its various activities during the year, particularly concerning pre-financing payments made.
Due to the work undertaken by the Commission services as part of the accounting modernisation project, a significant number of guarantees were recorded in the accounting system during 2004 in preparation for the opening balance sheet of 2005.
Also included are guarantees totalling EUR 97.2million (2003: EUR 112.2 million) received by the ECSC in liquidation and guarantees of EUR 3.6 million received by the Court of Auditors. 1.3 Guarantees received in respect of fines' cases pending See balance sheet heading assets VII.B.4 and Point 4 under Contingent Liabilities for further details of the treatment of the amounts received in relation to fines issued.
POINT 2: SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED These are SWAPS entered into by the Commission and ECSC in liquidation outstanding at year-end.

For structural operations, Member States must now send the Commission once a year a statement of the amounts awaiting recovery (Article 8 of Regulation No 438/2001) to give a better picture of the actual situation. - Even if the Member State concerned launches recovery proceedings in time, a positive outcome is not guaranteed.
The table below shows the breakdown by Member State of the estimated number of cases booked as memorandum items in respect of own resources: Estimates of number of cases booked Member State | Agricultural duties | Sugar levies | Custom duties | VAT balances | GNI balances | Late payment interest | Total | Belgium | 2 | 0 | 7 | 4 | 3 | 21 | 37 | Denmark | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 5 | 23 | 32 | Germany | 0 | 1 | 26 | 17 | 1 | 45 | 90 | Greece | 0 | 0 | 3 | 9 | 7 | 3 | 22 | Spain | 2 | 0 | 11 | 3 | 5 | 24 | 45 | France | 1 | 0 | 9 | 9 | 8 | 18 | 45 | Ireland | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 7 | 14 | Italy | 0 | 0 | 8 | 12 | 4 | 16 | 40 | Lux | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 6 | NL | 0 | 0 | 8 | 2 | 4 | 20 | 34 | Austria | 0 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 13 | Portugal | 0 | 0 | 10 | 5 | 4 | 15 | 34 | Finland | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 3 | 7 | 20 | Sweden | 0 | 1 | 10 | 21 | 0 | 19 | 51 | UK | 0 | 0 | 16 | 7 | 6 | 22 | 51 | Total | 5 | 2 | 122 | 103 | 59 | 243 | 534 | CONTINGENT LIABILITIES POINT 1: GUARANTEES GIVEN 1.1.
However, the Communities' guarantee is limited to a percentage of the ceiling of the credit lines authorised: 65 %, 70 %, 75 % or 100 %.
At 31 December 2004 the amount outstanding totalled EUR 13,900 million (2003: EUR 13,573 million) and this, therefore, is the maximum risk faced by the Communities.
The loans granted by the EIB from its own resources to third countries and covered by the Communities' budget guarantee are as follows: EIB LOANS GUARANTEED BY THE COMMUNITIES EUR millions | | "Risk Sharing" 31.12.2004 | "Non-risk Sharing" 31.12.2004 | Outstanding 31.12.2004 Total | Outstanding 31.12.2003 Total | Public authority | Private company | 65% guarantee | 1306 | 3227 | 447 | 4980 | 3508 | 70% guarantee | 574 | 3233 | 577 | 4384 | 4607 | 75% guarantee | 0 | 2110 | 332 | 2442 | 2772 | 100% guarantee | 0 | 1577 | 517 | 2094 | 2686 | Total | 1880 | 10147 | 1873 | 13900 | 13573 | 1.2.
Excluding these amounts since the EIF bears no risk, the total guarantees given and commitments in venture capital operations by the EIF at 31 December 2004 is EUR 2,188.4 million; this represents a maximum potential risk of EUR 656.5 million for the European Communities, as the Communities contribute 30 % of the capital of the EIF.
The total capital subscribed by the Communities is EUR 600 million, of which 20 % has been called up.
The Communities' share of the EIF's own resources totals EUR 176 million (2003: EUR 170.2 million), see also note IV.A Assets.
The capital not called up totals EUR 480 million.
Thus, should all the guarantees be called in, the European Communities would have a liability of EUR 0.5 million (being share of guarantees outstanding EUR 656.5 million, less share of EIF own resources EUR 176 million, less share of uncalled capital EUR 480 million).
The proportion of the capital subscribed by the European Communities which has not been called up (80 %) is also included in the off-balance-sheet commitments as a contingent liability (Point 7). 1.3.
POINT 2: SWAPS TO BE DELIVERED These are SWAPS entered into by the Commission and ECSC in liquidation outstanding at year-end.
Swaps to be delivered EUR | | 31.12.2004 | 31.12.2003 | Commission: Exchange rate swaps | 125000000 | 130000000 | ECSC in liquidation: Interest rate swaps | 158516396 | 164307097 | ECSC in liquidation: Interest &amp; Exchange rate swaps | 88085042 | 88085042 | Total | 371601438 | 382392139 | POINT 3: EAGGF GUARANTEE 3.1.
Expenditure between 16 October 2004 and 31 December 2004 In the case of the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, the payments are those affected by the Member States between 16 October 2003 and 15 October 2004, provided that the accounting officer was notified of the commitment and authorisation by 31 January 2005.
Payments made by Member States between 16 October and 31 December 2004 are included in the off-balance-sheet commitments. 3.2.
The determination of the final amount of the liability and the year in which it will be charged to the budget will depend on the length of the procedure before the Court of Justice. 3.3 Contingent debt pending a judgement by the Court Contingent debt towards a Member State as part of a procedure lodged with the Court of Justice concerning correction of advances. 3.4 Contingent debts in respect of judgements pending execution Contingent debts for which the Commission decision has not been taken by the date on which the accounts are closed and for which the compensation arrangements need to be agreed on between the parties concerned.
POINT 4: FINES As the fines imposed by the Commission for infringement of competition rules are entered in the result for the financial year, it has been decided that both fines for which an appeal has been lodged [2] and those where it is unknown if an appeal will be made should be included as a contingent liability in the off-balance-sheet commitments pending a decision by the Court of Justice.
Fines Outstanding EUR millions | Year | Appeals presented | Provisional payments appeal not known | Appeal not known, no amounts received | Total contingent liability | With bank guarantees | Provisional payment made | Neither payment or guarantee | Total | Pre 2004 | 1165,8 | 1387,7 | 219,3 | 2772,8 | 42,2 | 35,4 | 2850,4 | 2004 | 0,0 | 497,2 | 19,9 | 517,1 | 5,9 | 348,7 | 871,7 | Total | 1165,8 | 1884,9 | 239,2 | 3289,9 | 48,1 | 384,1 | 3722,1 | This table shows the state of play with fines imposed by the Commission that were still pending a legal decision when the accounts were closed.
However, the principal of the fine has to be paid within the prescribed time limit, since under Article 242 of the EC Treaty appeals do not have suspensory effect.
Only once the final judgment is delivered, does the Accounting Officer either refund the full amount of the provisional payment plus the interest on the principal or irrevocably collect the amount of the fine, as fixed by the final judicial decision, refunding, if appropriate, the relevant portion of the provisional payment together with the related interest.
POINT 5: OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS (RAL) Commitments against differentiated appropriations still outstanding at 31 December 2004 totalled EUR 108.8 billion, of which EUR 1,366 million is covered by carryovers of payment appropriations from 2004 to 2005.
For 2004, the increase of commitments outstanding (before carry over) was 4.7 %, compared to a 5 % increase in 2003, mainly due to the gradual stabilisation of the situation for the Structural Funds in 2004.
In Joint Declarations in 2002 and 2003, the Commission, Parliament and Council emphasised the need to contain the amounts still to be cleared and to eliminate "abnormal outstanding commitments" in the medium term.
As each new financial year will add cases becoming potentially abnormal RAL, the Commission has continued the monitoring of potentially abnormal RAL in 2004.
The following table shows the potentially abnormal RAL in 2004.
EUR millions | | Structural Funds | Internal policies | External action | Other | Total | Potentially abnormal RAL in the beginning of 2004, of which | 10249 | 1107 | 2318 | 685 | 14359 | —paid in 2004 | 4214 | 267 | 657 | 133 | 5271 | —de-committed in 2004 | 2182 | 214 | 282 | 36 | 2714 | —amounts retained after examination of commitments | 3853 | 626 | 1379 | 516 | 6374 | POINT 6: LEGAL COMMITMENTS WITHOUT A BUDGET COMMITMENT These contingent liabilities originated because the Commission decided to enter into legal commitments in respect of amounts that were not covered by commitment appropriations in the budget.
Under the Inter-institutional Agreement and, more generally, the rules relating to the budget, the following expenditure must be recorded as off-balance-sheet commitments in view of the volume of financial commitments which arises: - The Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund represent expenditure targets and the whole allocation shown in the financial perspective is meant to be matched by decisions.
As a result, contingent commitments are evaluated at a maximum (points 6.1 and 6.2).
The ceilings in heading 7 (pre-accession) are not expenditure targets and the Inter-institutional Agreement allows a degree of flexibility between the various pre-accession instruments.
