Expenditure effected by paying agencies whose accreditation is maintained by their Member State even though they have failed to implement such a remedial plan within the determined time limit should be subject to the conformity clearance procedure provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (4) Detailed rules should be laid down as regards the content and format of the statement of assurance referred to in Article 8(1)(c)(iii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. (5) The role of the coordinating body referred to in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 should be clarified and the criteria for its accreditation laid down. (6) In order to ensure that the certificates and reports to be drawn up by the certification bodies referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 are of assistance to the Commission in the clearance of accounts procedure, their content should be specified. (7) In order to allow the Commission to clear the accounts pursuant to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, it is necessary to specify the content of the paying agencies’ annual accounts and to establish a date for the transmission of those accounts and other relevant documents to the Commission.
Regulation (EC) No 2390/1999 should therefore be repealed. (9) Detailed provisions should be laid down for both the procedure for the clearance of accounts provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and the conformity clearance procedure provided for in Article 31 of that Regulation, including a mechanism whereby the resulting amounts are, as the case may be, deducted from or added to one of the subsequent payments made to the Member States. (10) For the purpose of the conformity clearance procedure, Commission Decision 94/442/EC of 1 July 1994 setting up a conciliation procedure in the context of the clearance of the accounts of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee Section [4] set up a Conciliation Body and laid down rules for its composition and operation.
The competent authority shall, by way of a formal act, decide on the accreditation of the paying agency on the basis of an examination of the accreditation criteria.
Where, as regards an accredited paying agency, one or more of the accreditation criteria are no longer respected or so seriously deficient as to affect the agency’s ability to fulfil the tasks set out in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the competent authority shall put the agency’s accreditation under probation and draw up a plan to remedy the deficiencies found within a period to be determined according to the severity of the problem, which shall not exceed 12 months from the date on which the accreditation is put under probation.
Where the Commission finds that the competent authority has not complied with its obligation to draw up a remedial plan pursuant to paragraph 3 or that the paying agency continues to be accredited without having fully implemented such a plan within the determined period, it shall pursue any remaining deficiencies through the conformity clearance provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
The statement of assurance referred to in Article 8(1)(c)(iii) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall be drawn up in due time for the certification body to issue the opinion referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of this Regulation.
Article 4 Coordinating body 1.
The coordinating body referred to in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall act as the Commission’s sole interlocutor for the Member State concerned for all questions relating to the EAGF and the EAFRD as regards: (a) the distribution of Community texts and guidelines relating thereto to the paying agencies and to bodies responsible for the implementation of those texts and guidelines, as well as the promotion of their harmonised application; (b) the communication to the Commission of the information referred to in Articles 6 and 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005; (c) the availability to the Commission of a full record of all accounting information required for statistical and control purposes. 2.
A paying agency may act as a coordinating body provided that the two functions are kept separate. 3.
The communications provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 6(3) and in Article 8(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall be made immediately after the coordinating body is first accredited and, in any case, before any expenditure for which it is responsible is charged to the EAGF or the EAFRD.
The certification body referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall be designated by the competent authority.
Article 7 Transmission of information 1.
Article 8 Form and content of the accounting information 1.
The form and content of the accounting information referred to in Article 7(1)(c) and the way it is to be forwarded to the Commission shall be established in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 41(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 2.
Any personal data included in the accounting information collected shall only be processed for the purposes specified in paragraph 2.
Article 9 Conservation of accounting information 1.
The supporting documents regarding the expenditure financed and the assigned revenues to be collected by the EAGF shall be kept at the disposal of the Commission for at least three years following the year in which the Commission clears the accounts of the financial year concerned under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 2.
The supporting documents regarding the expenditure financed and the assigned revenues to be collected by the EAFRD shall be kept at the disposal of the Commission for at least three years following the year in which the final payment by the paying agency has taken place. 3.
In the case of a conformity clearance procedure provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the supporting documents referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article shall be kept at the disposal of the Commission for at least one year following the year in which that procedure has been concluded or, if a conformity decision is the subject of legal proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Communities, for at least one year following the year in which those proceedings are concluded.
Article 10 Financial clearance 1.
The clearance of accounts decision referred to in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 shall determine the amounts of expenditure effected in each Member State during the financial year in question which shall be recognised as being chargeable to the EAGF and the EAFRD on the basis of the accounts referred to in Article 6 of this Regulation and any reductions and suspensions under Articles 17 and 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
For the EAFRD, the amount determined by the clearance of accounts decision shall include the funds which may be re-used by the Member State concerned pursuant to Article 33(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 2.
The Commission shall communicate to the Member State concerned the results of its verification of the information supplied, together with any amendments it proposes, by 31 March following the end of the financial year at the latest. 4.
If, for reasons attributable to the Member State concerned, the Commission is unable to clear the accounts of a Member State before 30 April of the following year, the Commission shall notify the Member State of those additional inquiries it proposes to undertake pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005. 5.
This Article shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to assigned revenues within the meaning of Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
Article 11 Conformity clearance 1.
The communication shall evaluate the expenditure which the Commission envisages to exclude from Community financing under Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and shall make reference to Article 16(1) of this Regulation. 3.
The Commission, after having examined any report drawn up by the Conciliation Body in accordance with Chapter 3 of this Regulation, shall adopt, if necessary, one or more decisions under Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 in order to exclude from Community financing expenditure affected by the non-compliance with Community rules until the Member State has effectively implemented the corrective measures.
As regards the EAGF, the deductions from the Community financing shall be made by the Commission from the monthly payments relating to the expenditure effected in the second month following the decision pursuant to Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
This Article shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to assigned revenues within the meaning of Article 34 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
