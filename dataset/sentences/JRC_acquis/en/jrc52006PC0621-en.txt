Article 3 of the Council Decision 1994/375/EC specifies that the position of the Community on a possible capital increase in the capital of the Fund and on its participation in that increase shall be decided unanimously by the Council, acting on proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament.
Due to its co-investment obligations under certain mandates, there would also be an impact on the mandate activity. | 130 | The Fund's capital increase falls within the framework of the Lisbon strategy and is considered as a further measure to those laid down in the Commission Communication "Implementing the Community Lisbon Programme: financing SME Growth – Adding European Value" COM(2006) 349, which includes measures to generate more risk capital investments, to develop bank finance for innovation and make existing financing systems more SME-friendly.
Article 4 of this amendment specifies that the European Community and financial institutions may become members of the Fund and contribute to its subscribed capital.
Finally, the Fund's Board of Directors has the responsibility to ensure that Fund's resources are used to contribute to the pursuit of Community objectives. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | 211 | Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents The ECOFIN of 14 March 2006 adopted a report on the proposal by the EIB Group (the EIB and the Fund) for reinforcing the contribution by the EIB Group to promoting growth and employment in the EU under the Lisbon strategy.

The intention is to issue 1000 new shares, which would mean, in nominal terms, an increase of the total subscribed share capital from EUR 2 billion to EUR 3 billion and, maintaining the current paid-in ratio of 20%, an increase from EUR 400 million to EUR 600 million of the paid-in capital.
The capital increase of the Fund was endorsed within the framework of the EIB Group's contribution to the growth and jobs initiative which was welcomed by the ECOFIN of 14 March 2006 and European Council of 23-24 March 2006.
Under the Financial Framework 2007-2013, an amount of EUR 100 million is allocated in the general budget for this purpose.
The dividends earned and required during the period 2007-2010 to cover the cost of the capital increase are considered as assigned revenue in accordance with Article 18(2) of the Financial Regulation.
In any case, the maximum Community liability will not exceed the budget allocation of EUR 100 million and the dividends received during this period, estimated at around EUR 20 million. | 310 | Legal basis Article 3 of Council Decision 1994/375/EC of 6 June 1994 on Community membership of the European Investment Fund. | 329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community.
In any case, the maximum Community liability will not exceed the budget allocation of EUR 100 million and the dividends received during this period, estimated at around EUR 20 million. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | Review/revision/sunset clause | 531 | The proposal includes a review clause. | 570 | Detailed explanation of the proposal Article 1 determines that the Community shall subscribe to the 50% capital increase of the Fund in nominal terms.
Article 2 covers the budgetary aspect of the proposal.
In order to maintain the 30% Community shareholding, the Commission would purchase up to 300 of the Fund's new shares.
Article 3 covers the evaluation of the Fund's activities to be carried out by the Commission by 31 July 2012.
Article 4 proposes a change to this practice and invites the Fund to send its Annual Report and the Annual Report of the Audit Board directly to the European Parliament and the Council.
In accordance with Article 2 of the Council Decision 1994/375/EC, the Commission will continue to notify the Council of the matters to be discussed at the Funds' General Meeting. | 1. 2006/0203 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION on the Community participation in the capital increase of the European Investment Fund THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Decision 1994/375/EC of 6 June 1994 on Community membership of the European Investment Fund[2], and in particular Article 3 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[3], Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[4], Whereas: (1) The authorised capital of the European Investment Fund, hereinafter "the Fund", was set at the time of its establishment at EUR 2 billion, divided into 2 000 shares each with a nominal value of EUR 1 million.
As the Fund is expected to exhaust its own resources by mid 2007 and therefore will be unable to continue its own resources operations, the Board of Directors has proposed to increase by 50% the Fund’s authorised capital in nominal terms. (4) The ECOFIN Council of 14 March 2006 adopted a report on the proposals put forward by the European Investment Bank Group, hereinafter "the EIB Group", for reinforcing the contribution by the EIB Group to promoting growth and employment in the EU, which includes the proposal for a capital increase of the Fund. (5) The European Council of 23-24 March 2006 welcomed the EIB Group contribution and invited the relevant actors to take the necessary follow-up steps, taking into account the final agreement on the Financial Framework 2007-2013. (6) The Community subscription for the new shares would support the implementation of the Lisbon strategy and help achieve the Community’s objectives in the field of small and medium-sized enterprises, job creation, innovation, research and development, cohesion and regional policy and enlargement. (7) A budget allocation of EUR 100 million for the capital increase of the Fund is consistent with the final agreement on the Financial Framework 2007-2013. (8) New shares should be subscribed by the Fund's shareholders at their discretion over a four-year period, starting in 2007 and ending in 2010, while respecting the interests of the financial institution shareholders and the European Investment Bank as well as the budgetary constraints of the Community.
The price of the new shares should be set annually and be based on the net asset value formula agreed between the Fund's shareholders. (9) The annual dividends received for the Community participation in the Fund from 1995 to 2006 have been duly returned to the Community budget.
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: Article 1 In addition to its current shareholding in the European Investment Fund, hereinafter "the Fund", the Community shall subscribe for up to 300 shares each of nominal value of EUR 1 million in the Fund.
Article 2 The Community shall purchase the new shares over a four-year period starting in 2007.
In addition, a total amount of up to EUR 100 million for the whole period shall be available within the general budget of the European Communities to cover the remaining cost.
The budgetary commitment may be broken down into annual instalments over four years in accordance with Article 76(3) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No. 1605/2002.
Article 3 The Commission shall submit to the Council an evaluation of the own resources activity of the Fund by 31 July 2012.
Article 4 The Fund shall transmit its Annual Report and the Annual Report of the Audit Board to the European Parliament and the Council.

The EIF proposal for the capital increase foresees that the new shares will be priced on the basis of the Replacement Share Purchase Undertaking (RSPU) formula agreed between the shareholders in June 2005 which is determined as follows: Share price = (Capital paid-in + share premium account + reserves + unrealised venture capital gains + profit brought forward + profit of the year – dividends of the year) / number of shares.
Consequently the number of shares to be issued in 2007 would be higher than in the following years.
This would notably enable the Community shareholding structure to remain relatively stable by 2010 and show the Commission's intention to purchase as many shares as possible right from the start, thus demonstrating its commitment to the EIF and to the capital increase.
Based on the EIF's 30 June 2006 profit and loss account of the EIF and the indicative share price, the table hereunder provides an example of the number of shares the Commission could possibly purchase and the budget needs: 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | Total | Indicative number of shares to be subscribed by the shareholders | 790 | 90 | 89 | 26 | 1000 | Indicative number of shares to be subscribed by the Commission | 95 | 90 | 89 | 26 | 300 | Indicative annual share price (in EUR) | 326 526 | 338 912 | 351 406 | 364 376 | Indicative budgetary need (in EUR) | 31 019 970 | 30 502 080 | 31 275 134 | 9 473 776 | 102 270 960 | Community Revenues According to Article 24 of its Statutes, EIF targets appropriate returns for its shareholders.
For illustrative purposes, the table below shows a simplified example: Financial Year *) | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | Number of shares initially subscribed by the Commission | 600 | 600 | 600 | 600 | Indicative number of new shares to be subscribed by the Commission | 0 | 95 | 90 | 89 | Cumulative number of shares subscribed by the Commission | 600 | 695 | 785 | 874 | Annual estimated dividend per share (in EUR) | 10 299 | 8 014 | 8 197 | 8 8534 | Estimated amount of dividends to be received by the Commission in the following year (in EUR) | 6 179 400 | 5 569 730 | 6 434 645 | 7 458 716 | *) Dividends pertaining to financial year n are paid in May/June of year n+1.
Overall impact on the Community budget In order to maintain the Community shareholding at approximately 30%, the Commission would purchase up to 300 new EIF shares.
The annual payments will be done during the period 2007-2010 in accordance with Article 76(3) of the Financial Regulation.
In addition to the annual budget allocation of EUR 25 million the Commission proposes to use the dividends paid during the period 2007-2010 to cover part of the cost of the capital increase.
