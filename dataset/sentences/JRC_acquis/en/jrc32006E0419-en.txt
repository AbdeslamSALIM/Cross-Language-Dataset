The projects should take into account the conclusions and recommendations of the Report of the Committee of the Security Council established pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1540 (2004), particularly with regard to regional needs and gaps in the implementation of the Resolution as well as the need of some States for technical assistance, as applicable.
