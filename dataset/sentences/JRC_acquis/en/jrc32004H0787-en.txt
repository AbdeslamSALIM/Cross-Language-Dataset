GENERAL PRINCIPLES 1.
Member States should take account of the guidance on sampling protocols for products consisting of, containing or produced from GMOs when inspecting and controlling whether operators are complying with Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003. 2.
Where the obtained analytical result is close to the established threshold (± 50 % of its value), the analysis of the individual file increment samples is recommended to provide a measure of the associated uncertainty.
The following documents should be taken into account: (a) ISO standard 6644 (2002); (b) ISO standard 13690 (1999); (c) ISO standard 5725 (1994); (d) ISO standard 2859 (1985); (e) ISO standard 542 (1990). 2.1.
The number of increments or sampling points (where the increment samples for creating the bulk sample and the file increment samples are taken) is defined according to lot size, as follows: Lot size in tonnes | Size of the bulk sample in kg | Number of incremental samples | ≤ 50 | 5 | 10 | 100 | 10 | 20 | 250 | 25 | 50 | ≥ 500 | 50 | 100 | In case of lots from 50 to 500 tonnes, the size of the bulk sample should be 0,01 % of the total lot size.
In case of lots smaller than 50 tonnes, the size of the bulk sample should be 5 kg.
Initially, the increment samples collected according to sub-section 2.1 are combined and mixed thoroughly, according to the procedures described in ISO standards 13690 and 6644, to form a bulk sample.
The bulk sample is used to create an analytical sample, according to the procedures described in ISO standards 13690 and 6644, and analysed for the presence of GMOs according to "analytical test protocols/testing methods", as outlined in section V.
If the result of the analysis is close to the established threshold (threshold ± 50 % of its value), an estimation of the associated uncertainty may be necessary (a protocol for estimating this uncertainty is foreseen in Article 2.3). 2.3.
Analytical results from these 20 samples are used to estimate the GMO content of the lot and its associated uncertainty expressed as standard deviation (SD).
If this uncertainty associated to the analysis of the 20 samples is acceptable, no additional analysis of the remaining file increment samples is necessary.
The number of additional samples to be analysed should be established on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the level of uncertainty estimated from the initial 20 samples.
The sequential analytical process should stop when either or both of the following is the case: - the estimated lot GMO content (mean GMO content of the analysed file increment samples) is above or below the established threshold ± 50 % of its value, - the uncertainty associated to the measured lot GMO content reaches an acceptable level (± 50 % of the mean analytical result).
Laboratory requirements Member States’ laboratories carrying out the analyses in accordance with this Recommendation should be accredited according to EN ISO/IEC 17025/1999 or certified according to an appropriate scheme, and should regularly participate in proficiency testing schemes organised or co-ordinated by nationally or internationally recognised laboratories and/or by national, international organisations.
Foodstuffs submitted for analysis in accordance with this Recommendation should be submitted to laboratories complying with the provisions of Article 3 of Directive 93/99/EEC.
An up-dated list of validated methods, including validated methods reported to Codex Alimentarius, is available in (http://biotech.jrc.it). 5.
It is recommended to interpret the results according to the instructions given in the draft European standard prEN ISO 24276:2002.
