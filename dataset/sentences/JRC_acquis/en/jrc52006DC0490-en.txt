Communication from the Commission - Annual report by the six European coordinators on the progress of certain trans-European transport network projects /* COM/2006/0490 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 13.9.2006 COM(2006) 490 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Annual report by the six European coordinators on the progress of certain trans-European transport network projects EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM In view of their transnational nature, the major trans-European transport projects require considerable funding, as well as sustained coordination between the Member States which they cross.
On 20 July 2005, after consultation with the European Parliament and with the agreement of the Member States concerned, the Commission appointed six European coordinators[2]: Loyola de Palacio, Karel Van Miert, Étienne Davignon, Péter Balázs, Pavel Telicka and Karel Vinck.
All the coordinators were given a hearing by the European Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism between January and May 2006 in order to present the actions undertaken.
The Commission points out, however, that the financial needs considered necessary by each coordinator for the projects for which they are responsible will have to be incorporated into the overall analysis of the funds necessary for the TENs within the framework of the multiannual programming for 2007-2013 for the 30 priority projects identified in the Decision of Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004.
