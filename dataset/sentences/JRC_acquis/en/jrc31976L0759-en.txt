Each Member State shall grant EEC component type-approval for any type of direction indicator lamp which satisfies the construction and testing requirements laid down in Annexes 0, I, III, IV and V. 2.
The Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval shall take the measures required in order to verify that production models conform to the approved type, in so far as this is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities in the other Member States.
Such verification shall be limited to spot checks. (1)OJ No 28, 17.2.1967, p. 458/67. (2)OJ No 224, 5.12.1966, p. 3802/66. (3)OJ No L 42, 23.2.1970, p. 1. (4)See page 1 of this Official Journal. (5)Economic Commission for Europe, Document E/ECE/324, Addendum 5 of 22 May 1967.
Article 2 Member States shall, for each type of direction indicator lamp which they approve pursuant to Article 1, issue to the manufacturer, or to his authorized representative, an EEC component type-approval mark conforming to the model shown in Annex III.
Article 4 The competent authorities of each Member State shall within one month send to the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the component type-approval certificates, an example of which is given in Annex II, completed for each type of direction indicator lamp which they approve or refuse to approve.
Article 6 Any decision taken pursuant to the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive to refuse or withdraw component type-approval for a direction indicator lamp or prohibit its placing on the market or use shall set out in detail the reasons on which it is based.
Article 7 No Member State may refuse to grant EEC type-approval or national type-approval of a vehicle on grounds relating to its direction indicator lamps if these bear the EEC component type-approval mark and are fitted in accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive 76/756/EEC.
Article 8 No Member State may refuse or prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service or use of any vehicle on grounds relating to its direction indicator lamps if these bear the EEC component type-approval mark and are fitted in accordance with the requirements laid down in Directive 76/756/EEC.
Article 10 Any amendments necessary to adjust the requirements of the Annexes to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC.

DEFINITION 1.1.
GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
Each sample shall conform to the specifications set forth in sections 6 and 8. 5.2.
INTENSITY OF LIGHT EMITTED 6.1.
Outside the reference axis, within the fields specified in the arrangement diagrams in Annex I, intensity of the light emitted by each of the two samples must: 6.2.1.
Moreover, 6.2.3.1.
throughout the fields defined in the diagrams in Annex I, the intensity of the light emitted must be not less than 0 73 cd for devices in categories 1, 2 and 5; 6.2.3.2.
for devices in category 1, the intensity of the light emitted in the directions corresponding to the points of measurement in the luminous intensity distribution table other than 0 to 5º to the right and 0 to 5º to the left, must not exceed 400 cd; 6.2.3.3.
Annex IV, referred to in 6.2.1, gives particulars of the measurement methods to be used. 7.
TEST PROCEDURE 7.1.
CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION Every device bearing an EEC component type-approval mark must conform to the approved type and comply with the photometric conditions specified in sections 6 and 8.

an indication of which of the categories 1, 2 or 5, the device belongs to; 1.2.2.
and incorporate a space large enough to contain the EEC component type-approval mark and the additional symbols prescribed in section 4 ; this space shall be shown in the drawings mentioned in 1.2.3. 3.
If all the samples submitted in accordance with section 1 meet the requirements of Annexes 0, I, III, IV and V, EEC component type-approval shall be granted and a component type-approval number assigned. 3.2.
This mark shall consist of a rectangle surrounding the lower case letter %quot%e%quot% followed by the distinguishing letter(s) or number of the Member State which has granted the type-approval: 1 for Germany, 2 for France, 3 for Italy, 4 for the Netherlands, 6 for Belgium, 11 for the United Kingdom, 13 for Luxembourg, DK for Denmark, IRL for Ireland.
The arrow shall be directed outwards from the vehicle in the case of devices in categories 1 and 2 and towards the front of the vehicle in the case of devices in category 5. 4.4.
Appendix EXAMPLE OF AN EEC COMPONENT TYPE-APPROVAL MARK %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0009383%quot%%gt% The device bearing the EEC component type-approval mark shown above is a direction indicator lamp in category 5 EEC type-approved in Germany (e 1) under the number 1471.

The direction H = 0º and V = 0º corresponds to the reference axis. (On the vehicle, it is horizontal, parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle and oriented in the required direction of visibility).
The values shown in the table give, for the various directions of measurement, the minimum intensities as a percentage of the minimum required in the axis for each light (in the direction H = 0º and V = 0º). 2.2.
for a minimum specification, below 50 % of the lower of the two minimum intensities prescribed for these directions of measurement; 2.2.2.
