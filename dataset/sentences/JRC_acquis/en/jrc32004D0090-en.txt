General When performing measurements on a vehicle as described in this Part, the vehicle should be positioned in its normal ride attitude as described in point 2.3.
The type of reference mark used and the vertical (Z) position of each mark relative to the ground shall be specified by the vehicle manufacturer according to the running conditions specified in point 2.3.
If the primary reference marks are found to be within ± 25 mm of the design position in the vertical (Z) axis, then the design position shall be considered to be the normal ride height.
The tape is held taut throughout the operation with one end held in contact with the ground, vertically below the front face of the bumper and the other end held in contact with the frontal upper surface (see Figure 3).
For vehicles of such shape that the top end of the straight edge makes first contact then the geometric trace of 1000 mm wrap around distance as defined in point 2.8, will be used as bonnet leading edge reference line at that lateral position.
For the tests described in Section 3.1 of Annex I to the Directive, the diameter of the sphere is 165 mm.
For the tests described in Section 3.2 of Annex I to the Directive, the diameter of the sphere is 165 mm if the lower windscreen frame on the vehicle's centre line is located at a wrap around distance, as defined in point 2.8, of 1500 mm or more from the ground and the diameter of the sphere is 130 mm when this wrap around distance is less than 1500 mm.
If the bonnet rear reference line is located at a wrap around distance of more than 2100 mm from the ground, the bonnet rear reference line is defined by the geometric trace of the 2100 mm wrap around distances, as defined in point 2.8.
Values of HPC for which the time interval (t1 - t2) is greater than 15 ms are ignored for the purposes of calculating the maximum value. 2.11. %quot%Windscreen%quot% is the frontal glazing of the vehicle which meets all the relevant requirements of Annex I to EU Directive 77/649/EEC. 2.11.1 %quot%Rear windscreen reference line%quot% is defined as the geometric trace of the most forward points of contact between a sphere and the windscreen, as defined in paragraph 2.11, when a sphere of diameter 165 mm is traversed across the windscreen top frame, including any trim, while maintaining contact with the windscreen (see Figure 10).
