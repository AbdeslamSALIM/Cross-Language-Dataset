This initiative builds on the Commission’s 2002 initiative for better regulation and reinforces the way in which better regulation contributes to achieving growth and jobs, while continuing to take into account the social and environmental objectives and the benefits for citizens and national administrations in terms of improved governance[1].
Therefore, in order to guarantee that legislation is designed and implemented efficiently, under a common strategic approach, Member States must increase their efforts in promoting better regulation, in parallel with actions already put in place at the EU level, so that the issue is tackled in a comprehensive manner.
Importance has been recognised by all Institutions An Inter-institutional Agreement (IIA) on Better Law-Making[4], agreed in December 2003 by the three EU institutions (European Parliament, Council and Commission,), establishes a global strategy for better lawmaking throughout the entire EU legislative process.
Moreover, the following actions are deemed necessary: - The Commission has decided that, as a rule, initiatives set out in its Legislative and Work Programme 2005 – key legislative proposals as well as the most important cross-cutting policy-defining non-legislative proposals - should be the subject of an integrated impact assessment[7].
The screening will focus on proposals adopted before 1 January 2004, and in particular those - Which have not made substantial progress in the legislative process for a significant period of time; - For which impact assessments were not carried out, or whose impact assessments have revealed substantial weaknesses in the light of a significant number of converging contributions from the co-legislators, stakeholders and/or experts; - Where substantial new scientific evidence, market developments or societal changes justify a review of the approach initially chosen.
Results in these areas might already be seen in 2005.
The Commission recommends that all Member States establish national Better Regulation strategies and, in particular, impact assessment systems for the integrated assessment of economic, social and environmental impacts, along with the supporting structures adapted to their national circumstances.
The Commission will encourage Member States to aim for a scope of coverage for impact assessment which is similar to that of Commission integrated impact assessments.
The Commission will also encourage such simplification when scrutinising national measures for compliance with Community law, notably in the contexts of the implementation of Community directives, infringement proceedings under Article 226 EC and the notification of new technical regulations under Directive 98/34/EC[17].

[17] Directive 98/34/EC obliges Member States to notify in draft any new technical regulation relating to products and information society services in the non-harmonised area.
This applies to national rules in the non-harmonised area and also in the harmonised area, where implementing rules go beyond the minimum requirements of Community directives without constituting non-compliance. [20] This legislation provides a “transparency mechanism” allowing the Commission and Member States to examine draft technical rules notified by a Member State before they enter into force in order to identify possible infringements of Treaty rules or the creation of new barriers in the internal market.
