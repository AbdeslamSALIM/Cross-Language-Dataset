By way of derogation from paragraphs 1 to 4, Member States which, on 1 January 1993, did not avail themselves of the option provided for in the third subparagraph of Article 12 (3) (a) may provide that for imports of the works of art, collectors' items and antiques defined in Article 26a (A) (a), (b) and (c), the taxable amount shall be equal to a fraction of the amount determined in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 4.

The taxable amount of the supplies of goods referred to in paragraph 2 shall be the profit margin made by the taxable dealer, less the amount of value added tax relating to the profit margin.
The taxable dealer may apply the normal value added tax arrangements to any supply covered by the special arrangements pursuant to paragraph 2 or 4.
Organizers of sales by public auction who supply goods under the conditions laid down in paragraph 1 must indicate in their accounts, in suspense accounts: - the amounts obtained or to be obtained from the purchaser of the goods, - the amount reimbursed or to be reimbursed to the vendor of the goods.
However, this period shall be increased to six months for the motorized land vehicles defined in (a), - they have travelled more than 6 000 kilometres in the case of land vehicles, sailed for more than 100 hours in the case of vessels, or flown for more than 40 hours in the case of aircraft.
