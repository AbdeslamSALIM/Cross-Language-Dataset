The Commission in its Communication on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme identified promotion of cogeneration as one of the measures needed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector and announced its intention to present a proposal for a Directive on the promotion of cogeneration in 2002. (6) In its Resolution of 25 September 2002 on the Commission communication on the implementation of the first phase of the European Climate Change Programme(7), the European Parliament welcomes the idea of submitting a proposal to strengthen Community measures to promote the use of combined heat and power (CHP) and calls for prompt adoption of a Directive on the promotion of CHP. (7) The importance of cogeneration was also recognised by the Council Resolution of 18 December 1997(8) and by the European Parliament Resolution of 15 May 1998(9) on a Community strategy to promote combined heat and power. (8) The Council in its Conclusions of 30 May 2000 and of 5 December 2000 endorsed the Commission's Action Plan on energy efficiency and identified promotion of cogeneration as one of the short-term priority areas.
Where cogeneration installations are equipped to generate separate electricity or heat production, such production should not be specified as cogeneration for issuing a guarantee of origin and for statistical purposes. (14) To ensure that support for cogeneration in the context of this Directive is based on the useful heat demand and primary energy savings, it is necessary to set up criteria to determine and assess the energy efficiency of the cogeneration production identified under the basic definition. (15) The general objective of this Directive should be to establish a harmonised method for calculation of electricity from cogeneration and necessary guidelines for its implementation, taking into account methodologies such as those currently under development by European standardisation organisations.
Application of the calculations in Annexes II and III to micro-cogeneration units could, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, be based on values resulting from a type testing process certified by a competent, independent body. (16) The definitions of cogeneration and of high-efficiency cogeneration used in this Directive do not prejudge the use of different definitions in national legislation, for purposes other than those set out in this Directive.
Such support will in some cases be necessary to further exploit the potential for cogeneration, in particular to take account of the need to internalise external costs. (25) Public support schemes for promoting cogeneration should focus mainly on support for cogeneration based on economically justifiable demand for heat and cooling. (26) Member States operate different mechanisms of support for cogeneration at the national level, including investment aid, tax exemptions or reductions, green certificates and direct price support schemes.
For practical reasons and based on the fact, that the use of the heat output for different purposes requires different temperature levels of the heat, and that these and other differences influence efficiencies of the cogeneration, cogeneration could be divided into classes such as: %quot%industrial cogeneration%quot%, %quot%heating cogeneration%quot% and %quot%agricultural cogeneration%quot%. (32) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, general principles providing a framework for the promotion of cogeneration in the internal energy market should be set at Community level, but the detailed implementation should be left to Member States, thus allowing each Member State to choose the regime, which corresponds best to its particular situation.
Article 2 Scope This Directive shall apply to cogeneration as defined in Article 3 and cogeneration technologies listed in Annex I.
Article 4 Efficiency criteria of cogeneration 1.
For the purpose of determining the efficiency of cogeneration in accordance with Annex III, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), not later than 21 February 2006, establish harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat.
The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2), review the harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat referred to in paragraph 1, for the first time on 21 February 2011, and every four years thereafter, to take account of technological developments and changes in the distribution of energy sources. 3.
Member States implementing this Directive before the establishment by the Commission of harmonised efficiency reference values for separate production of electricity and heat referred to in paragraph 1, should, until the date referred to in paragraph 1, adopt their national efficiency reference values for separate production of heat and electricity to be used for the calculation of primary energy savings from cogeneration in accordance with the methodology set out in Annex III.
Article 5 Guarantee of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration 1.
Schemes for the guarantee of origin do not by themselves imply a right to benefit from national support mechanisms. 5.
A guarantee of origin shall: - specify the lower calorific value of the fuel source from which the electricity was produced, specify the use of the heat generated together with the electricity and finally specify the dates and places of production, - specify the quantity of electricity from high efficiency cogeneration in accordance with Annex II that the guarantee represents, - specify the primary energy savings calculated in accordance with Annex III based on harmonised efficiency reference values established by the Commission as referred to in Article 4(1).
Member States may include additional information on the guarantee of origin. 6.
Article 6 National potentials for high-efficiency cogeneration 1.
Member States shall establish an analysis of the national potential for the application of high-efficiency cogeneration, including high-efficiency micro-cogeneration. 2.
Member States shall for the first time not later than 21 February 2007 and thereafter every four years, following a request by the Commission at least six months before the due date, evaluate progress towards increasing the share of high-efficiency cogeneration.
Article 7 Support schemes 1.
Member States shall ensure that support for cogeneration - existing and future units - is based on the useful heat demand and primary energy savings, in the light of opportunities available for reducing energy demand through other economically feasible or environmental advantageous measures like other energy efficiency measures. 2.
Without prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty, the Commission shall evaluate the application of support mechanisms used in Member States according to which a producer of cogeneration receives, on the basis of regulations issued by public authorities, direct or indirect support, which could have the effect of restricting trade.
The Commission shall in the report referred to in Article 11 present a well-documented analysis on experience gained with the application and coexistence of the different support mechanisms referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.
Article 8 Electricity grid system and tariff issues 1.
Article 9 Administrative procedures 1.
Member States or the competent bodies appointed by the Member States shall evaluate the existing legislative and regulatory framework with regard to authorisation procedures or the other procedures laid down in Article 6 of Directive 2003/54/EC, which are applicable to high-efficiency cogeneration units.
Article 10 Member States' reporting 1.
Member States shall not later than 21 February 2007 and thereafter every four years, following a request by the Commission at least six months before the due date, publish a report with the result of the evaluation referred to in Article 6(3). 3.
Member States shall submit to the Commission, for the first time before the end of December 2004 covering data for the year 2003, and thereafter on an annual basis, statistics on national electricity and heat production from cogeneration, in accordance with the methodology shown in Annex II.
Member States may also submit statistics on primary energy savings achieved by application of cogeneration, in accordance with the methodology shown in Annex III.
Article 11 Commission reporting 1.
On the basis of the reports submitted pursuant to Article 10, the Commission shall review the application of this Directive and submit to the European Parliament and to the Council not later than 21 February 2008 and thereafter every four years, a progress report on the implementation of this Directive.
Article 12 Alternative calculations 1.
Until the end of 2010 and subject to prior approval by the Commission, Member States may use other methods than the one provided for in Annex II(b) to subtract possible electricity production not produced in a cogeneration process from the reported figures.
However, for the purposes referred to in Article 5(1) and in Article 10(3), the quantity of electricity from cogeneration shall be determined in accordance with Annex II. 2.
Such a production can be regarded as high-efficiency cogeneration provided it fulfils the efficiency criteria in Annex III(a) and, for cogeneration units with an electrical capacity larger than 25 MW, the overall efficiency is above 70 %.
However, specification of the quantity of electricity from cogeneration produced in such a production, for issuing a guarantee of origin and for statistical purposes, shall be determined in accordance with Annex II. 3.
Until the end of 2010, Member States may, using an alternative methodology, define a cogeneration as high-efficiency cogeneration without verifying that the cogeneration production fulfils the criteria in Annex III(a), if it is proved on national level that the cogeneration production identified by such an alternative calculation methodology on average fulfils the criteria in Annex III(a).
If a guarantee of origin is issued for such production then the efficiency of the cogeneration production specified on the guarantee shall not exceed the threshold values of the criteria in Annex III(a) unless calculations in accordance with Annex III prove otherwise.
However, specification of the quantity of electricity from cogeneration produced in such a production, for issuing a guarantee of origin and for statistical purposes, shall be determined in accordance with Annex II.
Article 13 Review 1.
The threshold values used for calculation of electricity from cogeneration referred to in Annex II(a) shall be adapted to technical progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2). 2.
The threshold values used for calculation of efficiency of cogeneration production and primary energy savings referred to in Annex III(a) shall be adapted to technical progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14(2). 3.
Article 15 Transposition Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 21 February 2006.
Article 16 Amendment to Directive 92/42/EEC The following indent shall be added to Article 3(1) of Directive 92/42/EEC: %quot%- cogeneration units as defined in Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on the promotion of cogeneration based on useful heat demand in the internal energy market(20).%quot% Article 17 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 18 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
