BACKGROUND The Health Security Committee (HSC) was established by the Council in 2001 at the occasion of a discussion following the bioterrorist attacks in the USA where the cardinal role of public health bodies in the fight against bioterrorism was recognised.
A Working Party of the HSC discussed in June 2005 the possible scope and terms of references of the Committee, notably in the light of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm being now operational, and identified further activities, priorities and deliverables on the basis of the Strategy document on Generic Preparedness Planning for EU public health threats.
The HSC has established relations with: - The Community Network on communicable diseases[1], in particular with the EWRS (Early Warning and Response System), and the ESCON (Epidemiological Surveillance Component of the Community Network), surveillance and epidemiological activities which are now managed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). - The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
MANDATE OF THE HEALTH SECURITY COMMITTEE IN THE TRANSITIONAL PHASE UNTIL 2008 The Health Security Committee (HSC) provides a forum for high-level representatives of the Member States to co-ordinate and advise on choices and decisions to be adopted either by the Council, the Commission or by MS in preparedness and response to major health threats and to act as an interface between different actors at European level.
CONCLUSIONS The Commission invites the Council to adopt conclusions which endorse the mandate of the Health Security Committee as outlined above in section 4 and allow for the continuation of the existing cooperation within the Health Security Committee.
