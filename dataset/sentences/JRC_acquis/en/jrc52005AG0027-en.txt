Based on assessments by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty, the Council shall, within the framework of multilateral surveillance under Article 99 of the Treaty, examine the medium-term budgetary objective presented by the Member State concerned, assess whether the economic assumptions on which the programme is based are plausible, whether the adjustment path towards the medium-term budgetary objective is appropriate and whether the measures being taken and/or proposed to respect that adjustment path are sufficient to achieve the medium-term objective over the cycle.

INTRODUCTION On 20 March 2005, the Council (ECOFIN) adopted a report on "Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact".
The European Council, meeting on 22 and 23 March, endorsed the Council report and invited the Commission to bring forward proposals for amending Regulations (EC) No 1466/97 and (EC) No 1467/97.
The European Central Bank delivered its opinion on 3 June 2005 [1].
The European Parliament delivered its opinion on 9 June 2005 [2].
ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON POSITION The overall approach taken by the Council in examining the Commission's proposal has been to remain as close as possible to the Council's report of 20 March.
It also offers the best possibility for rapid and coherent implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact. [1] OJ C 144, 14.6.2005, p. 17. [2] Not yet published in the Official Journal. --------------------------------------------------
