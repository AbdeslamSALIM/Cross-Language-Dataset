Interested parties may submit their comments on the aid measure in respect of which the Commission is initiating the procedure within one month of the date of publication of this summary and the letter which follows it, to: European Commission Directorate-General for Transport and Energy Directorate A: General Affairs and Resources Building DM 28, Office 6/100 B-1049 Brussels: Fax No: (32-2) 296 41 04 These comments will be communicated to Belgium.
These two measures reduced its turnover from EUR 62 million in 2002 to EUR 58 million in 2003.
IFB succeeded in increasing its volume on this market substantially in 2004 (compared with 2003).
IFB has less than 7 % of this market.
The Commission notes, however, that the smallest terminal was closed, that its closure was primarily intended to reduce the losses of IFB Terminals, and that, following the capital increase, IFB will once again be operating the two terminals which it sold, since SNCB/NMBS will transfer to IFB 47 % of its shares in TRW, which has major holdings in the Brussels and Zeebrugge terminals.
