Ecological criteria on ingredients Key parameters The following parameters are considered: - total chemicals, - critical dilution volume, toxicity (CDVtox), - phosphates (as STPP)(1), - non-biodegradable organics (aerobic) (NBDO aerobic), - non-biodegradable organics (anaerobic) (NBDO anaerobic), Appendix II presents the definition of the parameters used in the calculations.
Wfactor = weighting factor HEXCI. = hurdle. 2.2.
The cardboard packaging shall be 80 % recycled material and the plastic packaging shall be labelled according to ISO 1043. 3.
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA The product shall have a satisfactory washing performance at the recommended dosage according to the standard test developed by IKW.
The test procedure on purity must ensure that no production organism is detected in a 20 ml standard test sample of the final enzyme product. 4.2.
Testing laboratories The testing shall be performed at the expense of the applicant by laboratories that meet the general requirements laid out in the EN 45001 standards or any equivalent systems. 5.

Appendix II DEFINITIONS RELATED TO THE ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA 1.
Critical dilution volume toxicity (CDVtox) The CDVtox is calculated for each ingredient i in the formulation according to the respective data for loading factors (LF) and long-term effects (LTE) in the DID-list in l/wash: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% The CDVtox of the product is the sum of all ingredients CDVtox in l/wash. 3.
Phosphates (as STPP) Weight per wash of all inorganic phosphates expressed as STPP, in g/wash. 4.
Non-biodegradable organics (aerobic) Weight per wash of all ingredients which are aerobically non-biodegradable organics (see DID-list) in g/wash. 5.
