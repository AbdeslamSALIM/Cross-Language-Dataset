Complaint The complaint was lodged on 4 April 2006 by Grass Valley Nederland BV (%quot%the complainant%quot%) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Community production of certain camera systems. 2.
The product concerned is normally declared within CN codes ex85253090, ex85254091, ex85282114, ex85282116, ex85282190, ex85282200, ex85299081, ex85299095, ex85371091, ex85371099, ex85438997 and ex90029000.
On this basis, the dumping margin calculated is significant. 4.
Procedure Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the Community industry and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission hereby initiates an investigation pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. 5.1.

Non-cooperation In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. 9.
