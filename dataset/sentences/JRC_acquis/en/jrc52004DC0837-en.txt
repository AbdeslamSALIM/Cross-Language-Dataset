INTRODUCTION The Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[1], as adjusted for enlargement and revised in 2003[2], contains the financial perspective table for EU-25 (Table 1a).
Point 15 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that each year the Commission will, ahead of the budgetary procedure for year n+1, make a technical adjustment to the financial perspective in line with movements in the EU's gross national income (GNI) and prices.
Table 2 shows the financial perspective for EU-25 adjusted for 2006 at current prices, including the budgetary implications of a political settlement in Cyprus.
Table 3 presents the economic parameters used for this adjustment exercise.
In accordance with point 23 (a) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, the monetary reserve has been eliminated as from 2003.
To ensure consistency with the Cohesion Fund, allocations for the ten new Member States enshrined in the Accession treaties, the overall figure for the Cohesion Fund in 2006 prices has been rounded up to the superior unit.
