At its 414th plenary session held on 9 and 10 February 2005 (meeting of 9 February), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 135 votes with 6 abstentions: 1.
As a general rule the costs involved in eradicating epizootic diseases are financed by the Veterinary Fund, with 50 % of the funds coming from the Member States. 1.2 In addition, there is a strain on the markets in the products concerned, not least as a result of sales bans and restricted areas being introduced.
General comments 2.1 It is regrettable that since 1992 the Commission and the Member States have not respected the hitherto applicable general principle of full Community financing for measures forming part of the so-called "first pillar" of the Common Agricultural Policy, including measures implemented within the framework of the common market organisations.
Conclusion 3.1 The EESC wishes to maintain the principle of full Community solidarity for exceptional measures under the rules applying to market organisations, and therefore rejects the Commission's proposal for 50 % co-financing by the Member States.
Brussels, 9 February 2005.
