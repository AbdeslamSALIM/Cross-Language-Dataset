THE PROCEDURE (1) Based on Regulation (EC) No 1013/97, the Commission in a decision of 6 August 1997 [4] authorised restructuring aid for Spanish public shipyards amounting to approximately EUR 1,9 billion.
According to both the decision and Council Regulation (EC) No 1013/97 the condition for the approval of the aid was that no more aid for restructuring purposes should be provided. (2) In the years 2000, 2001 and 2002, the state holding company Sociedad Estatal de Participationes Industriales (hereafter SEPI) provided IZAR Construcciones navales (hereafter IZAR) with capital injections for a total sum of EUR 1477 million.
By letters dated 8 November 2002 and 14 January 2003, the Commission requested information on this matter. (3) By decision of 27 May 2003 the Commission initiated the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty (hereafter the opening) concerning the transactions whereby SEPI injected EUR 1477 million in IZAR.
The Spanish authorities were informed of the decision in a letter from the Commission dated 28 May 2003. (4) Spain, by letters dated 11 July 2003, 29 July 2003, 11 August 2003, 19 January 2004, 23 February 2004, 14 April 2004 and 26 July 2004 submitted its comments on the opening of the procedure. (5) Following the opening of the procedure, the Commission received comments from Royal Van Lent Shipyard by letter dated 24 September 2003, from a party requesting anonymity by letter dated 24 September 2003 and from IZAR by letter dated 6 October 2003.
All the civil shipyards and related activities were therefore bought, on 20 July 2000, by BAZAN and then merged into BAZAN which subsequently changed name to IZAR. (7) IZAR’s civil activities mainly take place at Astilleros de Cadiz (Cadiz), Astilleros de Puerto Real (Puerto Real), Astilleros de Sestao (Sestao), Astilleros de Sevilla (Sevilla), Juliana Constructora Gijonesa (Juliana), Fábrica de Manises (Manises), Astilleros de Fene (Fene).
IZAR also have three mainly military shipbuilding sites, Ferrol, Cartagena and San Fernando.
THE AID (8) The investigation covers the following capital injections from SEPI: EUR 1322,227 million (ESP 220 billion), provided to BAZAN on 28 July 2000, EUR 105,171 million provided to IZAR in 2001 and EUR 50,000 million provided to IZAR in 2002. (9) In the opening decision the Commission noted that the capital provided by SEPI to IZAR may confer economic benefits to civil shipbuilding which they were unlikely to have received from commercial sources.
IZAR finally claims that the possibility of recovery of any aid provided to the public Spanish shipyards in 1997 is unacceptable since it is existing aid.
The capital was injected in order to cover a number of costs linked to this plan, developed in 1998.
In particular, EUR […] [7] million related to so-called externalisation of social costs linked to pre-pensions by former BAZAN employees.
The Commission notes that the Council adopted on this basis Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 (hereafter the Shipbuilding Regulation), which was in force from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2003.
Although Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 expired on 31 December 2003, and is not concerned by the Commission notice on the determination of the applicable rules for the assessment of unlawful State aid [8], in the interest of a consistent practice the Commission — using its broad margin of appreciation — intends to apply that Regulation in the present case. (24) Shipbuilding is an economic activity involving trade between Member States.
The Commission further notes that Article 2 of the said Regulation states that aid granted for shipbuilding, ship repair and ship conversion may be compatible with the common market only if it complies with the provisions of the Regulation.
This provision states that no rescue or restructuring aid may be granted to an undertaking that has been granted such aid pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1013/97. (28) As a consequence, aid in excess of the aid that was authorised by the initial Commission decision of August 1997 would have to be considered as incompatible with the common market, unless approved under another legal base. (29) The Commission notes that the shipyards Sestao, Puerto Real, Sevilla, Cadiz, and Juliana were undertakings covered by Regulation (EC) No 1013/97 and the 1997 Commission decision referred to above.
Furthermore, SEPI has a history of behaviour towards the shipyards which has been carried out in a manner that can be considered imputable to the State, such as providing part of the authorised restructuring aid in 1997 and unlawful aid in 1998 [12].
Therefore Spain argues that any aid provided to BAZAN would enjoy the derogation provided for in Article 296 of the EC Treaty. (41) The Commission does not agree with this and notes that when the capital was provided, BAZAN owned all the concerned civil shipyards and related activities.
The Commission therefore doubted that the funds provided to cover these costs would fall under Article 296 of the EC Treaty. (43) The Commission notes that the social costs linked to BAZAN’s past indeed cover a part of the total capital provided.
Spain has also argued that a further EUR […] million was paid directly by BAZAN to certain pre-retired BAZAN employees. (44) However, the social costs linked to BAZAN’s military past do not cover the entire amount of capital provided by SEPI.
This information indicates a total loss for the civil activities within IZAR of EUR 290 million, as specified in Table 1.
Table 1 Estimated results of IZAR’s civil activities 2000 to 2003 [17] (EUR million) | | Gijon | Sestao | Pto Real | Sevilla | Cadiz | Fene | Manises | Total | 2000 | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | – 80,2 | 2001 | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | – 103,6 | 2002 | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | – 59,9 | 2003 | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | – 46,4 | Total | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | – 290,1 | (46) The results are provided after extraordinary gains, which in particular affected Puerto Real, Sestao and Sevilla due to the fact that these companies had positive book values at the time they were bought by BAZAN for a symbolic price.
From the table it can be concluded that IZAR has covered losses generated in its civil activities for a total sum of EUR 290 million during the period 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2003. (47) Furthermore, Spain has provided information concerning the central costs of IZAR, which have not been allocated to the civil activities in the calculation of the results in Table 1.
The total amount of central costs for the period 2000 to 2003 were EUR […] million.
Using this as a key to distribute the central costs would imply an additional loss of the civil activities of EUR 74 million over the concerned period. (48) In total, the civil activities of IZAR thus made an estimated loss of EUR 364 million over the period 2000 to 2003. (49) When BAZAN acquired the civil activities, it had limited financial resources (own capital EUR 100 million by the end of 1999).
The Court has stated that an appropriate way of establishing whether a capital injection is state aid is to apply the criterion of determining to what extent the undertaking would be able to obtain the sums in question on the private capital markets, the so called private investor test [18]. (51) From the information provided by Spain it is clear that the civil companies bought by BAZAN in July 2000 were in economic difficulties (see Table 2).
Table 2 Book values and financial risks (estimated by Spain) in July 2000 (EUR million) | Company | Book value | Estimated Risks | Estimated net value | Companies sold by AESA to BAZAN/IZAR: Puerto Real | […] | […] | […] | Sestao | […] | […] | […] | Sevilla | […] | […] | […] | Companies sold by SEPI to BAZAN/IZAR: Cadiz | […] | […] | […] | Juliana | […] | […] | […] | Manises | […] | […] | […] | Fene | […] | […] | […] | Total sum | 130,5 | 192,6 | – 62,1 | (52) There were furthermore no signs that the difficult financial situation for the civil activities, which had been loss-making for several years, would improve.
Loans repaid by IZAR on behalf of three activities (55) As was established in State aid decision on case C-40/00, loans amounting to EUR 192,1 million were on 12 September 2000 repaid to SEPI, with interest, by IZAR.
The funds had been provided in 1999 to the companies Juliana, Cadiz and Manises, which subsequently were taken over by BAZAN/IZAR in July 2000.
As stated in the decision on case C-40/00, information linked to this loan repayment would be used in the present investigation. (56) According to information received from Spain, the reported losses for the civil activities for the year 2000, in Table 1 above, do not include the repayment of the above-mentioned loans. (57) It is evident that funds provided by SEPI in 1999 benefited the civil companies Juliana, Cadiz and Manises.
For this reason it can be excluded that IZAR could have received a loan on market condition if it had not received the illegal and incompatible aid in the form of EUR 364 million of the capital injection. (59) The repayment of EUR 192,1 million by IZAR to SEPI should therefore be considered as a further use of the capital injection under investigation to the benefit of IZAR’s civil activities.
Summary (60) Based on the above assessment the Commission concludes that IZAR’s civil activities have benefited from the capital injection provided from SEPI to IZAR in year 2000, by receiving loss coverage of EUR 364 million as outlined in paragraph 48 above, plus the aid repayment of EUR 192,1 million as outlined in paragraph 51 above.
The total aid amount is thus EUR 556,1 million.
RECOVERY OF RESTRUCTURING AID ALREADY GRANTED AND APPROVED IN 1997 (61) Since the doubts of further incompatible State aid to the public Spanish civil shipyards have been confirmed, the Commission must assess, as noted in the opening of the procedure, whether some of the restructuring aid granted in 1997 will be considered to be incompatible and be recovered. (62) On this issue, the Commission considers that, taking into consideration the comments made by Spain and IZAR in the context of this procedure, there is no grounds to consider part of the restructuring aid authorised in 1997 to be incompatible.
The reason is that, according to the decision [19] authorising the aid, the Commission’s right to request recovery of the aid authorised in 1997 expired with the last monitoring report [20], dated 13 October 1999.
Therefore, the aid approved in 1997 became existing aid once the monitoring period expired.
ARTICLE 296 (63) Spain claims that the capital injection would fall under Article 296 and thus outside the scope of the state aid rules, since BAZAN was a military company at the time of the acquisition of the yards. (64) It cannot be disputed that the civil activities needed financial aid in order to continue operations after July 2000.
Therefore aid to such activities falls under Article 87 of the Treaty.
Spain shall take all necessary measures to recover from IZAR the aid referred to in Article 1 and unlawfully made available to the beneficiary. 2.
Article 3 Spain shall inform the Commission, within two months following notification of this Decision, of the measures already taken and planned to comply with it.
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.
