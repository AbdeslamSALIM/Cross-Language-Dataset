Proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 92/84/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages /* COM/2006/0486 final - CNS 2006/0165 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 8.9.2006 COM(2006) 486 final 2006/0165 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE amending Directive 92/84/EEC on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL - Grounds for and objectives of the proposal Council Directive 92/84/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages lays down minimum rates of duty for each product category.
The Commission's report, presented on 26 May 2004, concluded that more convergence of the rates of excise duty in the different Member States is needed so as to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular with regard to the potential for distortions of competition and fraud.
It should be noted that the categories of alcoholic drinks for which positive minimum rates of excise duty were agreed in 1992 and are, therefore, the subject of revalorisation are beer, intermediate products and alcohol.
The Council, therefore, called upon the Commission "to come forward with a proposal to adjust the minimum rates of excise duty in order to avoid a fall in the real value of the Community minimum rates, providing transitional periods and derogations for those Member States who may have difficulties in increasing their rates; the Commission should also duly take into account the overall political sensitivity of this special issue". - Collection and use of expertise Given the limited scope of this proposal, it was not necessary to collect and use particular expertise. - Impact assessment The purpose of the proposal is to update the existing Directive 92/84/EEC by increasing the minimum rates in order to restore their real value agreed by Council in 1992 as the minimum necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market without fiscal borders.
The Commission’s enquiry conducted in preparation of its 2004 report has not brought to light any new developments which, in today’s perspective, would plead against such an adjustment.
However, this adjustment could create difficulties for some of the Member States required to increase their national rates substantially and within a relatively short period of time in order to meet the revalorised minima – see Tables 2, 3 and 4 below.
For the consumer, and based on subsequent retail price adjustments, this increase is likely to represent less than the typical EU annual inflation rate. 3) LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL - Summary of the proposed action The Commission proposes: - to revalorise the minimum rates on alcohol, intermediate products and beer in line with inflation from 1993 to 2005, which is in the order of 31%, to take effect from 1 January 2008.
Based on Eurostat data on the annual rate of change of the HICP (Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) between 1993 and 2005, the total EU-wide inflation rate for the period between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 2005 is of the order of 31%.
Therefore, re-valorising the minimum rates applying this percentage increase gives the following results: TABLE 1 Product | Rate expressed Per | Present minimum rate | Indexed minimum rate on 31/12/2005 (present rate x 1.31) | Wine (Still and sparkling) | Hl | 0 € | 0 € | Beer | Hl degree Plato or Hl degree alcohol | 0.748 € or 1.87 € | 0.98 € or 2.45 € | Intermediate products | Hl | 45 € | 59 € | Alcohol | Hl of pure alcohol | 550 € | 720 € | It is proposed that the changes come into force on 1 January 2008.
However, the national rates currently applied in several Member States are below the proposed revalorised minima and consequently they will be required to increase their national rates, as follows: TABLE 2 - BEER Member State | Current national rate € (1) (2) | % increase required to meet new minimum rate 0.98 € Plato or 2.45 € abv | Plato | Abv | Malta | 0.746 | 31.3% | Latvia | 1.87 | 31% | Germany | 0.787 | 24.5% | Luxembourg | 0.7933 | 23.5% | Czech Rep | 0.81 | 20.9% | Lithuania | 2.03 | 20.6% | Spain | 0.91 | 7.7% | TABLE 3 - INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS Member State | Current national rate € (1) (2) | % increase required to meet new minimum rate – 59€ | Greece | 45.00 | 31% | Cyprus | 45.89 | 28.5% | Malta | 46.57 | 26.6% | Portugal | 54.57 | 8.1% | Spain | 55.53 | 6.2% | TABLE 4 - ALCOHOL Member State | Current national rate € (1) (2) | % increase required to meet new minimum rate – 720€ | Cyprus | 610.71 | 17.9% | Slovenia | 695.14 | 3.6% | Footnotes: (1) For non Eurozone Member States, exchange rates used are those published in the Official Journal of the European Union - C 244 of 4/10/2005 (2) Member States national rates are those notified as at January 2006.
It should be noted, however, that not all these Member States will necessarily have difficulties in increasing their national rates to meet the revalorised minima as at the date of entry into force of the revalorised minima, 1 January 2008.
The Directive increases the minimum rates in order to restore their real value agreed by Council in 1992 as the minimum necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the Internal Market without fiscal borders.
In accordance with Article 8 of that Directive, an examination of the rates of excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages has been carried out. 3.
Those consultations led to a second Commission report[8], presented on 26 May 2004.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
The following annual rates of change of the HICP have been used: 1993: 3,4%; 1994: 2,8%; 1995: 2,8%; 1996: 2,4%; 1997: 1,7%; 1998: 1,3%; 1999: 1,2%; 2000: 1,9%; 2001: 2,2%; 2002: 2,1%; 2003: 2,0%; 2004: 2,0%; 2005: 2,1%. [2] OJ L316, 31.10.1992, p.21.
