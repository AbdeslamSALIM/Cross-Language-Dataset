Efforts will continue at international level on the decent work agenda and the Commission intends to contribute fully to these. 2.
Many developing countries have economies in which the informal sector and poor quality jobs predominate and in which dualism exists in the labour market, particularly in countries in which most people depend on subsistence farming.
By placing the emphasis on employment, the quality of employment and appropriate social policies, the promotion of decent work is a factor not only in justice and social cohesion but also in economic performance.
The Member States have already ratified a large number of ILO conventions relating, in particular, to core labour standards, labour inspection, labour administration, employment, social security and wages[7].
In this context, the Commission will support initiatives on: - promoting trade union freedom and collective bargaining in order to enhance the capacity of the parties concerned to engage in autonomous social dialogue; - improving labour administration, labour inspectorates and bodies for managing social protection; - developing prevention strategies in the field of health and safety at work.
The Commission will implement cooperation with the African Union concerning the social dimension of regional integration and decent work, as well as bilateral cooperation with South Africa.
It has launched in 2005 a dialogue with China on employment, labour legislation, social dialogue, social protection and social cohesion.
In particular, it plans to: - improve the link between the GSP, the GSP + and Community external assistance; - take account of the social dimension, decent work and the recommendations of SIA studies in bilateral and regional trade negotiations (including the APE/EPA, the ACP countries, Mercosur, the Gulf Cooperation Council, MED and Central America); - make use of EU policies and instruments, such as external assistance, to promote decent work in the context of an open system of trade; - adopt the approach concerning the interaction between trade, social rights and employment which was presented in 2004 in the submissions to the trade policy review mechanism, and encourage other members of the WTO to adopt this approach; - promote cooperation between the WTO, UNCTAD, the ILO and other relevant organisations. 3.4.
Promoting international and multilateral governance It is essential that international and multilateral governance be strengthened in order to promote the social dimension of globalisation and ensure that the partners take ownership of the decent work agenda.
The Commission will contribute not only to the UN’s work on the implementation of the conclusions of the 2005 Summit on productive employment and decent work but also, and in particular, to the work of the High-Level Segment of the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in July 2006.
The Commission will produce a report on the follow-up to this Communication by the summer of 2008. [1] Global Employment Trends, 2006, ILO; report by the CMDSM, 2004, ILO.
