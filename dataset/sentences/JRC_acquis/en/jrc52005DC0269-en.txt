Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament - Implementing the community strategy to reduce co2 emissions from cars: fifth annual communication on the effectiveness of the strategy {SEC(2005) 826 } /* COM/2005/0269 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 22.6.2005 COM(2005) 269 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Implementing the Community Strategy to Reduce CO2 Emissions from Cars:Fifth annual Communication on the effectiveness of the strategy{SEC(2005) 826 } . 1.
According to Article 9 of Decision 1753/2000/EC[5] the Commission has to inform Council and European Parliament annually on the effectiveness of the strategy[6].
The cornerstone of the strategy are the Commitments of the European, Japanese and Korean Automobile Manufacturers Associations to achieve total new passenger car fleet average CO2 emissions of 140 g CO2/km by 2008/2009 (measured according to Directive 93/116/EC).
Finally, the voluntary Commitments of ACEA and JAMA contain the obligation to carry out, based on 2003 data, a joint “Major Review”.
The main findings for the reporting period 1995 to 2003 are: - Taking official Member States’ data in 2003, the average specific CO2 emissions of the fleets are 163 g/km for ACEA, 172 g/km for JAMA and 179 g/km for KAMA.
If data collected by ACEA were taken, its average specific CO2 emissions would be 161 g/km. (see Table 1 in the Attachment). - Compared to 1995 the average specific CO2 emissions have been reduced by 22 g/km or 11.9 % for ACEA (24 g/km or 13.0 % if using ACEA figures), 24 g/km or 12.2 % for JAMA and 18 g/km or 9.1 % for KAMA. - Compared to 2002 all three associations reduced, in 2003, the average specific CO2 emissions of their cars registered for the first time on the EU market, ACEA by about 1.2 %[7], JAMA by about 1.0 % and KAMA around 2.2 %[8].
JAMA is, since 2002, inside the intermediate target range.
That KAMA made the biggest progress in 2003 and also launched a passenger car with an emission value less than 120 g/km are good news in this context. - In order to meet the final target of 140 g CO2/km additional efforts are necessary, as the average annual reduction rate of all three associations needs to be increased.
If seen as an average, over the full period 1995-2008/9 the reduction rate shall be around 2 %, or about 3.5 g/km per year.
In the years remaining until 2008/9 the reduction rates must now reach an average of 2.8 % for ACEA, 3.1 % for JAMA and 3.6 % for KAMA.
However, it is noted that the gaps to be closed, expressed in required annual performance, are increasing (see Table 2 in the Attachment).
In 2003 the overall average CO2 emissions of new passenger cars registered was lower in all Member States compared with 1995 and the years in between (see Figure 1 in the Attachment).
IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 1753/2000/EC The so-called “Monitoring” Decision came into force on 30 August 2000.
Nevertheless, the work on data quality will be continued and it is expected that over the long-term data differences should diminish. 4. “MAJOR REVIEW” AND WORK ON ARTICLE 10 OF DECISION 1753/2000/EC The voluntary Commitments to reduce new passenger car CO2 emissions contain the obligation to carry out, based on 2003 data (2004 data for KAMA), a “Major Review”.
general consumer behaviour, economic situation, fuel prices, fiscal measures, availability of consumer information, mainly for two reasons: the market changes observed in the period 1995 to 2003 are relatively small and CO2 relevant technological developments penetrated practically all vehicle categories. 4.
ACEA and JAMA draw attention to a number of points which are of importance for the delivery of the 140 g CO2/km target.
The joint conclusions of the “Major Review”/Article 10 work are attached to the respective Joint Reports of ACEA and JAMA. 5.
ACEA’S AND JAMA’S REVIEWS TO MOVE FURTHER TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY TARGET OF 120 G/KM According to the text of the Commitments, and to the Commission's Recommendations endorsing the Commitments[12], ACEA and JAMA shall in 2003 "… review the potential for additional CO 2 reduction, with a view to moving further towards the Community’s objective of 120 g CO 2 /km by 2012".
Both ACEA and JAMA presented the result of their respective review in December 2003 (KAMA’s review took place, as planned, in 2004).
In their position papers ACEA and JAMA claim that - although the technological potential to achieve the Community target of 120 g CO2/km by 2012 is available, the associated costs would be prohibitive.
ACEA nevertheless gave a first indication that a further reduction of 5 % of the average CO2 emission of the new vehicle fleet between 2008 and 2012 (equal to a target of about 133 g CO2/km) could be feasible by means of improvements in vehicle technologies.
Overall, the aim of the Commission is to achieve the Community goal of 120 g CO2/km in a “sustainable way”, taking into account the three pillars of the Gothenburg Council (environmental, social, economic aspects).
Based on the results of this impact assessment it is the intention of the Commission to put forward to Council and the European Parliament a proposal concerning the achievement of the 120 g CO2/km target around the end of 2005. 6.
According to Article 9 Member States had to report by 31 December 2003 on the effectiveness of the Directive.
The Commission received 14 reports which are currently being evaluated.
OTHER RELATED MEASURES The Environment Council conclusions of 10 October 2000 requested the Commission to study emission reduction measures on Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV, in technical terms equal to category N1 vehicles[15]) and mobile air conditioning systems used in passenger cars[16].
CONCLUSIONS The Community’s strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and improve fuel economy aims at achieving an average specific CO2 emission figure for passenger cars newly registered in the Community of 120 g CO2/km by 2010 at the latest.
The specific CO2/km value achieved in the calendar year 2003 was 164 g CO2/km[18], compared to 186 g CO2/km in 1995, the reference year of the Community strategy – a reduction of about 12 %.
In order to meet the final target of the Commitments (140 g CO2/km) all three associations have to increase their efforts.
ACEA has met its interim target for 2003 in 2000 and expressed its firm determination to make the best possible efforts to live up to its CO2 Commitment, but could no longer confirm the concluding statement given in the previous reports.
With regard to KAMA there is a real concern.
The position papers presented by ACEA and JAMA in 2003[19] as the results of their respective reviews on the potential to moving further towards the Community's objective of 120 g CO2/km by 2012 signals that the associations see no possibility to achieve this target in a cost-efficient manner by technical measures.

If ACEA's data for 2002 and the official EU data for 2003 were taken there would be no reduction.
For 2003 these two Member States are included.
