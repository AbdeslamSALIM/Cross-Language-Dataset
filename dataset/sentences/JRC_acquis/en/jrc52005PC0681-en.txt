The conclusions of this Report were brought forward by the Commission in its Communication COM (2003)386 which was welcomed by the Council in its Conclusions of December 2003 and was received favourably at Parliament.
The Commission received 80 response(s).
Also, the proposal updates Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices to make it coherent with the other Directives on medical devices.
Finally, Directive 98/8/EC on biocides is amended to exclude in vitro diagnostic medical devices from its scope, this removes the legal ambiguity that exists, in certain cases, as to which Directive should apply. - 310Legal basis The legal basis for the proposal is Article 95 EC Treaty (formerly Article 100A) upon which Directive 93/42/EEC is based.
National authorities, through the Medical Device Expert Group Report of June 2002 into the functioning of the medical device Directives, have called for the Commission to propose necessary changes to the Directives on medical devices.
Also, in order to clarify that it is possible for both the Directive on medical devices and the Directive on personal protective equipment to simultaneously apply to a product, such as a surgical glove, it is necessary to delete the reference in Article 1 to the Directive on personal protective equipment to allow both apply.
Measures to increase transparency Article 20 on confidentiality, which previously maintained all information available under the Directive as being confidential, has been relaxed, to allow certain information on all devices to be publicly available and to allow, by comitology, a method of making other information non-confidential, such as summary information on the approval of high risk devices.
