INTRODUCTION Decision 20/2004//EC of 8 December 2003 sets up a general framework for actions in support of consumer policy for the period 2004-2007.
The annual commitment appropriations (including EFTA contribution) for 2004 and 2005 amounted to about €20.6 million (about €19.5 million in operational and €1.1 in administrative credits).
The Commission adopted the 2004 work programme, as foreseen in Article 11 of the Decision, on 31 March 2004, and an amended version in December 2004.
The 2005 programme was adopted on 5 April 2005 and amended on 17 February 2006.
The Advisory Committee of the Member States was consulted on the annual work programmes, and on the implementation of actions 9, 10, 16, 17 and 18. 2.
This amount was used to convoke 137 meetings which resulted in the adoption of 55 reports and scientific opinions.
Results will be available in autumn 2006.
In November 2005, the new Consumer Policy Network of senior officials, discussed consumer policy strategy options for 2007-2013 (€21.000). 2.3.
Action 4: The collection and exchange of data and information that provide an evidence base for the development of consumer policy and for the integration of consumer interests in other EU policies To support policy development and a stronger consumer focus in key EU policy areas impacting consumer interests, about €2.1 million was committed for surveys of consumer perceptions and opinions on financial services, services of general interest (SGIs) and passenger rights.
An analysis of national rules and case law on unfair commercial practices in new Member States was commissioned (€90.000) to complement previous studies.
Perceptions on SGI were fed into the 2005 Report “Evaluation of the performance of network industries providing services of general interest”.
Surveys data of preceding years were brought together and published in “Consumers in Europe – Facts and figures” (€56.000).
Results were presented to the Member States and system development has started in 2006. 3.2.
The inventory will be finalized in 2006 and compare health and safety risk assessment approaches for consumer products as used by surveillance and enforcement authorities as well as testing and certification bodies in EU and EEA countries.
The basic application will be tested early 2006 and is expected to become fully operational later in the year.
An inventory and comparative analysis of national measures transposing Directive 2001/95/EC on General Product Safety and their practical implementation was undertaken at a cost of €200.000.
In 2005, a joint action with 15 Member States was co-financed at a cost of over €1 million to develop best practice in various areas of market surveillance.
First results are expected early 2007. 4.
Action 14: Information actions about consumer rights Almost €2 million was spent on an information campaign on consumer rights and promoting consumer associations in Poland, which was launched on 16 May 2005 in Warsaw by Commissioner Danuta Huebner.
About €50.000 was earmarked to a needs analysis for the development of European Integrated Masters Degrees in consumer issues. 4.4.
Action 16 and 17: Financial contributions to the functioning of European consumer organisations Grants for operating costs were allocated to the European Association for the Coordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation (ANEC, about €1.2 million in 2004, €1.3 in 2005) and the European Consumers’ Organisation (BEUC about €1.2 million in 2004; €1.25 in 2005).
With respect to previous years, these grants increased to allow for the integration of consumer associations from new Member States at EU-level. 5.
Action 18: Financial contributions for specific projects at Community or national level in support of consumer policy Following the call for proposals in 2004, a total of 15 specific projects were co-financed for a total amount of about €2.3 million.
Four projects were selected for co-financing at an estimated total of about €2.35 million.
In follow-up to recommendations of the Assembly of Consumer Organisations, an ad-hoc working group of the European Consumer Consultative Group met in February 2005 and discussed ways to improve specific projects (€ 4.000). 5.2.
In 2005, €230.000 was spent on an evaluation of the European Consumer Diary and on an assessment of the impact of the EU Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006 on national consumer policies.
No actions were financed under action 6, 11 and 12. 6.
The merger of European consumer help centres increased cost-efficiency, and their execution as joint actions with the Member States has provided a more secure financial basis.
