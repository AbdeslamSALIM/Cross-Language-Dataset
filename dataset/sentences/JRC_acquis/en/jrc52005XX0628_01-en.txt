In response to a request made by BPB on 2 May 2001, the deadline for BPB was extended by two weeks, to 9 July 2001, on the grounds that access to the file had not been granted sufficiently early and that the deadline set by the Commission was objectively too tight for the firm to be able to prepare its defence.
By letter dated 13 February 2002, I once again replied to Lafarge pointing out to it that it could argue its case further in an appeal against the Commission's final decision.
