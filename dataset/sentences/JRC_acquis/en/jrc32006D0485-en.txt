and DENO Acquisition EURL, Outokumpu Oyj and Outokumpu Copper Products OY and Wieland Werke AG (Case C.38.069 %mdash% Copper Plumbing tubes) (notified under document number C(2004) 2826) Commission Decision of 3 September 2004 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement against Boliden AB, Boliden Fabrication AB and Boliden Cuivre %amp% Zinc SA, Austria Buntmetall AG and Buntmetall Amstetten Ges.m.b.H., Halcor SA, HME Nederland BV, IMI plc, IMI Kynoch Ltd and IMI Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd, KM Europa Metal AG, Tréfimétaux SA and Europa Metalli SpA, Mueller Industries, Inc., WTC Holding Company, Inc., Mueller Europe Ltd, DENO Holding Company, Inc.
and DENO Acquisition EURL, Outokumpu Oyj and Outokumpu Copper Products OY and Wieland Werke AG (Case C.38.069 — Copper Plumbing tubes) (notified under document number C(2004) 2826) (Only the Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian and Swedish texts are authentic) (2006/485/EC) On 3 September 2004, the Commission adopted a decision relating to a proceeding under Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 [1], the Commission herewith publishes the names of the parties and the main content of the decision, having regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business interests.
Imputation of liabilities SMI and KME (3) Societa Metallurgica Italiana SpA (SMI) is the Italian holding company of the KME-group, to which Europa Metalli SpA (EM or EM/LMI or Europa Metalli) and Tréfimétaux SA (Tréfimétaux or TMX) belong.
KME’s management board was different from that of its sister companies and KME’s operational management appears to have been coordinated with those of EM and TMX only after the restructuring of the group in 1995, when KME obtained 100 % of the shares in EM and TMX.
It may therefore be concluded that during the period from 1988 to 1995, KME is liable only for its own conduct but not for that of its sister companies. (5) On the other hand, EM and its wholly-owned subsidiary until 1995, TMX, must be regarded as one economic unit and thus a single undertaking distinguished from KME until the restructuring of the group.
Accordingly, in the period from 1989 to 1995, EM bears liability of its own conduct and is jointly and severally liable with TMX for the illicit behaviour of the latter. (6) As to the period from 1995 to 2001, when KME controlled 100 % of the capital of both EM and TMX, the entities of the KME-group must be considered to have acted as a single undertaking on the market.
Accordingly, KME, EM and TMX bear joint and several liability of their illegal conduct during the period from 1995 to 2001.
Outokumpu (7) With regard to Outokumpu (Finland), the Commission held the parent company Outokumpu Oyj jointly and severally liable for the conduct of its wholly-owned subsidiary Outokumpu Copper Products Oy (OCP).
Furthermore, the parent company, according to Outokumpu, was involved in the infringement through its Copper Products Division before May 1988 and was therefore aware of it also after the subsidiary was created and took its functions between May and December 1988.
Accordingly, a full and effective control of Outokumpu Oyj over its subsidiary's commercial policy can be presumed, which Outokumpu has been unable to rebut.
Other Participants (8) Mueller, IMI, Wieland and Boliden did not contest the liability of their respective holding and parent companies for the conduct of the subsidiaries involved in the copper plumbing tube business.
Duration of the infringement (9) The undertakings participated in the infringement during at least the following periods: (a) Boliden AB, together with Outokumpu Copper Fabrication AB (formerly: Boliden Fabrication AB) and Outokumpu Copper BCZ SA (formerly: Boliden Cuivre %amp% Zinc SA), from 3 June 1988 until 22 March 2001; (b) Outokumpu Copper Fabrication AB (formerly: Boliden Fabrication AB), together with Boliden AB and Outokumpu Copper BCZ SA (formerly: Boliden Cuivre %amp% Zinc SA), from 3 June 1988 until 22 March 2001; (c) Outokumpu Copper BCZ SA (formerly: Boliden Cuivre %amp% Zinc SA), together with Boliden AB and Outokumpu Copper Fabrication AB (formerly: Boliden Fabrication AB), from 3 June 1988 until 22 March 2001; (d) Austria Buntmetall AG: (i) together with Buntmetall Amstetten Ges.m.b.H., from 29 August 1998 at the latest until 8 July 1999, and (ii) together with Wieland Werke AG and Buntmetall Amstetten Ges.m.b.H, from 9 July 1999 until 22 March 2001; (e) Buntmetall Amstetten Ges.m.b.H.: (i) together with Austria Buntmetall AG, from 29 August 1998 at the latest, until 8 July 1999, and (ii) together with Wieland Werke AG and Austria Buntmetall AG, from 9 July 1999 until 22 March 2001; (f) Halcor SA from 29 August 1998 at the latest, until at least beginning of September 1999; (g) HME Nederland BV from 29 August 1998 at the latest, until 22 March 2001; (h) IMI plc together with IMI Kynoch Ltd and Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd (formerly: IMI Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd), from 29 September 1989 until 22 March 2001; (i) IMI Kynoch Ltd together with IMI plc and Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd (formerly: IMI Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd), from 29 September 1989 until 22 March 2001; (j) Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd (formerly: IMI Yorkshire Copper Tube Ltd) together with IMI plc and IMI Kynoch Ltd, from 29 September 1989 until 22 March 2001; (k) KM Europa Metal AG: (i) individually, from 3 June 1988 until 19 June 1995, and (ii) together with Tréfimétaux SA and Europa Metalli SpA, from 20 June 1995 to 22 March 2001; (l) Europa Metalli SpA: (i) together with TMX, from 29 September 1989 to 19 June 1995, and (ii) together with KM Europa Metal AG and Tréfimétaux SA, from 20 June 1995 to 22 March 2001. (m) Tréfimétaux SA: (i) together with Europa Metalli SpA, from 29 September 1989 to 19 June 1995, and (ii) together with KM Europa Metal AG and Europa Metalli SpA, from 20 June 1995 to 22 March 2001. (n) Mueller Industries, Inc., together with WTC Holding Company, Inc., Mueller Europe Ltd, DENO Holding Company, Inc.

and Mueller Industries, Inc., from 21 October 1997 until 8 January 2001; (s) Outokumpu Oyj together with Outokumpu Copper Products Oy, from 29 September 1989 until 22 March 2001; (t) Outokumpu Copper Products Oy, together with Outokumpu Oyj, from 29 September 1989 until 22 March 2001; (u) Wieland Werke AG: (i) individually from 29 September 1989 until 8 July 1999, and (ii) together with Austria Buntmetall AG and Buntmetall Amstetten Ges.m.b.H., from 9 July 1999 until 22 March 2001.
Functioning of the cartel (14) The addressees of the present decision participated in a single, continuous, complex and, as far as Boliden, the KME-group and Wieland are concerned, multiform infringement of Article 81 of the Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement, covering most of the EEA territory by which they allocated volumes and market shares, agreed in certain cases on price targets, price increases or other commercial terms for plain copper plumbing tubes (and, as far as KME and Wieland are concerned, plastic-coated copper plumbing tubes), and monitored the implementation of their anti-competitive arrangements by exchanging information on sales, orders, market shares and pricing, and by a market leader arrangement.
It was complex because it was composed of both agreements and concerted practices. (16) The anti-competitive behavior also constituted a multiform infringement because it was organised on three levels with the object to avoid competition in the copper plumbing tube industry. (17) Cooperation on the first level started at least in June 1988 (lasting until March 2001) and involved the so-called "SANCO®" producers ("SANCO" club): KME, Tréfimétaux, Europa Metalli, Boliden and Wieland.
KME and Wieland also cooperated with respect to WICU® and Cuprotherm plastic-insulated copper plumbing tubes starting from at least beginning of 1991 until March 2001. (18) Cooperation on the second level started at least in September 1989 and involved the largest European producers (the "group of the five") (including SANCO- and non-SANCO-producers): KME (including Tréfimétaux and Europa Metalli), Wieland, Outokumpu, IMI and, as of October 1997, Mueller.
These contacts developed in three stages: from September 1989 until June/July 1994 (establishing of the information exchange and coordination); from July 1994 until June 1997 (less intensive contacts); from June 1997 until March 2001 (effective and efficient reestablishment of the coordination). (19) Cooperation on the third level started in August 1998 and lasted between August 1999 and March 2001.
The first category included KME; the second category consisted of Outokumpu, IMI, Mueller and Wieland Werke group including BMA (roughly a half of KME's market share); the third category consisted of Boliden (roughly two thirds of the market share of the second group); and the fourth group consisted of HME and Halcor (roughly a half of the market share of the second group). (24) As EM and TMX formed a single undertaking in the period from 1988 to 1995, they are jointly and severally responsible for their respective part of the infringement.
Similarly, KME, EM and TMX formed a single undertaking (the KME-group) in the period from 1995 to 2001, and they are jointly and severally responsible for that part of the infringement.
The result of this was that KME has been individually fined EUR 17,96 million; EM and TMX are jointly and severally liable for the payment of a fine of EUR 16,37 million; and KME, EM and TMX (or the KME-group) are jointly and severally liable to pay a fine of EUR 32,75 million. (25) In a similar way, two different periods were distinguished for the purposes of the allocation of liability within the Wieland-group.
Wieland Werke AG acquired sole control over the Buntmetall group in 1999.
Accordingly, Wieland Werke AG and the Buntmetall group were treated as a single undertaking with joint and several liabilities for the infringement only as of 1999. (26) In order to ensure that the fines imposed had a sufficient deterrent effect, a multiplying factor of 1,5 was applied to the starting amount of the fine set for Outokumpu.
The infringement started at the latest on 3 June 1988 and continued at least until 22 March 2001.
The following companies committed a continuous infringement for the respective duration indicated: Boliden-group : 12 years 9 months, Buntmetall-group : 2 years 6 months, Halcor : 12 months, HME : 2 years 6 months, IMI-group : 11 years 5 months, KME-group : 12 years 9 months (in total, split according to the participation of each member company) (KME 12 years 9 months; EM/TMX: 11 years 5 months), Mueller-group : 3 years 2 months, Outokumpu-group : 11 years 5 months, Wieland Werke : 11 years 5 months. (28) There were periods of different intensity in the cartel discipline.
KME and Wieland continued their WICU, Cuprotherm and SANCO cooperation.
Hence, no mitigating circumstances apply to any of the undertakings in this case. (35) The 1996 Leniency Notice does not provide for any specific reward to a leniency applicant that discloses facts previously unknown to the Commission and affecting the gravity or duration of the cartel.
Outokumpu was the first to disclose the whole duration of the European cartel in the copper plumbing tubes sector, and, in particular, was first in providing decisive evidence and explanations to prove continuity of the infringement during the period from July 1994 until July 1997 (and the period from 1990 until end of 1992).
The 1996 Leniency Notice was applied as follows: Section B of the Leniency Notice: reduction between 75 % and 100 % (39) Mueller Industries Inc., (Mueller) was the first undertaking that informed the Commission (in January 2001) about the existence of a cartel in the European Copper Plumbing Tube sector in the 1990s.
Section D: reduction between 10 % and 50 % (41) Before the Commission adopted its Statement of Objections (SO), Outokumpu (April 2001), KME (October 2002), Wieland (January 2003) and Halcor (April 2003) provided the Commission with information and documents which contributed to establishing the existence of the infringements.
These companies therefore qualified for a reduction between 10 % and 50 % under Section D of the Leniency Notice. (42) Outokumpu was the first to submit decisive evidence for the period from 1989 to mid-1997.
The period from mid-1997 until March 2001 had already been covered by Mueller and material collected during the inspections.
The Commission granted Wieland (including Buntmetall) a 35 % reduction of the fine that would otherwise have been imposed. (44) Halcor provided a number of contemporaneous documents for the period of its participation (August 1998 until August 1999).
However, given the prior cooperation of Mueller, Outokumpu, the KME-group, Wieland and Halcor, as well as the inspections, the infringement had already been established in its entirety.
Given the cooperation of Mueller, Outokumpu, the KME-group, Wieland and Halcor, as well as the inspections, the infringement had already been established in its entirety.
The Commission as a result granted the IMI group a 10 % reduction of the fine that would otherwise have been imposed.
The following fines were imposed: Boliden AB, Outokumpu Copper Fabrication AB (formerly: Boliden Fabrication AB) and Outokumpu Copper BCZ SA (formerly: Boliden Cuivre %amp% Zinc SA) jointly and severally : EUR 32,6 million; Austria Buntmetall AG and Buntmetall Amstetten Ges.m.b.H.

According to a study of Boliden, 45 % are used for water tubes/plumbing, 52 % for heating systems and 3 % for gas pipes. [3] These figures are currently being verified.
