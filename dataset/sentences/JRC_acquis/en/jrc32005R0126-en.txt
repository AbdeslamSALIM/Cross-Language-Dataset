This corresponds to 343356 tonnes for Greece, 1591330 tonnes for Spain, 3335 tonnes for France, 741956 tonnes for Italy and 34473 tonnes for Portugal.
The amount withheld from production aid for this olive oil marketing year serves as the basis for financing measures to improve the quality of oil during the production cycle commencing on 1 May 2004.
