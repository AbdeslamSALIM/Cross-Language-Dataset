Communication from the Commission - Green Paper %ldquo%Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between the generations%rdquo% /* COM/2005/0094 final */ Brussels, 16.3.2005 COM(2005) 94 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Green Paper “Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between the generations” COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION Green Paper “Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between the generations” Europe is facing today unprecedented demographic change.
In 2003, the natural population increase in Europe was just 0.04% per annum; the new Member States, with the exception of Cyprus and Malta, all saw falling populations.
The population will start to drop in some cases before 2015, and in some cases the fall will by more than 10-15% by 2050. - Immigration has recently mitigated the impact of falling birth rates in many countries. - The situation in the candidate countries accentuates the demographic contrasts.
Children (0-14) | -19.4% (-14415) | -3.2% (-2391) | -8.9% (-6411) | -8.6% (-5612) | Young people (15-24) | -25.0% (-14441) | -4.3% (-2488) | -12.3% (-6815) | -10.6% (-5139) | Young adults (25-39) | -25.8% (-25683) | -4.1% (-4037) | -16.0% (-15271) | -8.0% (-6375) | Adults (40-54) | -19.5% (+19125) | +4.2% (+4170) | -10.0% (+10267) | -14.1% (-13027) | Older workers (55-64) | +8.7% (+4538) | +9.6% (+5024) | +15.5% (+8832) | -14.1% (+9318) | Elderly people (65-79) | +44.1% (+25458) | +3.4% (+1938) | +37.4% (+22301) | +1.5% (+1219) | Very elderly people (80+) | +180.5% (+34026) | +17.1% (+3229) | +57.1% (+12610) | +52.4% (18187) | These developments are part of a wider trend: all parts of the world will witness demographic ageing over this century.
Our main partner, the United States, may see its population rising between 2000 and 2050[9].
Better integration of young people Today’s children and young people will have to take over from larger numbers of individuals in the previous generations.
In parallel, the number of people aged 55 and over will grow by 9.6% between 2005 and 2010, and by 15.5% between 2010 and 2030, before falling sharply in its turn.
Companies will therefore have to rely increasingly on the experience and skills of older workers, whilst actively preparing those younger than 55 to replace them.
Despite a certain degree of progress, the employment rate for people aged 55+ (40.2% in 2003, or around 20.5 million people in employment) is far below the European objective of 50%.
They will also be better off, having been more likely to build up a full pension, and will have more savings than their predecessors and their children.
The social dialogue has concluded agreements on parental leave and part-time working which have been implemented by way of directives.
GRAPH 14: TRENDS IN NET MIGRATION Graph 14 demonstrates the growing importance of migration as a source of population growth.
A large share of migration comes about as a result of family reunification. [1] Eurostat’s baseline scenario, used for population forecasting, provisional results – December 2004. [2] Regions NUTS 2.
