Pending that opinion, the Member State of destination may carry out checks on products coming from the establishment(s) or holding(s) to which the dispute relates and, if the result is positive, take measures similar to those provided for in Article 7 (1) (b) of Directive 89/662/EEC (20).
Where the Commission considers that the measures taken are insufficient, it shall, after consultation with the Member State in question and having regard to the measures necessary to safeguard public health, take appropriate measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 32. 2.
