FORM OF DOCUMENTS OF COMPLIANCE AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATES When ships operate only in a Member State, Member States shall either use the forms attached to the ISM Code or the Document of Compliance, the Safety Management Certificate, the Interim Document of Compliance and the Interim Safety Management Certificate drawn up in the form set out below.
Following legal/linguistic revision, the Council adopted its common position on 18 July 2005.
The European Parliament agreed in its opinion in first reading on 10 March 2004 to approve the Commission's proposal without amendments [2].
The provisions of the ISM Code shall apply to all ships flying the flag of a Member State, engaged on international and domestic voyages, and to all ships falling under the scope of the Solas Convention exclusively engaged on domestic voyages or operating to or from ports of Member States on a regular shipping service.
The Council supports the principle laid down in the Commission proposal submitted in December 2003 to replace Regulation (EC) No 3051/95 by a new text obliging all companies and ships covered by Chapter IX of the Solas Convention to apply the ISM Code, taking also into account that the Code became mandatory at international level in 2002.
For reasons of proportionality, passenger ships, other than ro-ro passenger ferries, operating less than 5 miles from the coastline as well — in line with the ISM Code — as cargo ships and mobile offshore drilling units of less than 500 gross tonnage are excluded from the scope.
Following the principle of respecting the ISM Code, these documents shall be accepted by Member States if they are issued by the administration of any other Member State or on behalf of this administration by a recognised organisation under Directive 94/57/EC, or if they are issued by, or on behalf of, the administrations of third countries.
Finally, the common position incorporates a number of mainly technical modifications, which are necessary in order to bring the new text in line with existing Community legislation.
