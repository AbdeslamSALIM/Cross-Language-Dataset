On 18 January 2005, the Council decided in accordance to Article 104(8) that Greece had not taken effective action in response to these recommendations.
On 17 February 2005, upon a Commission recommendation in accordance with Article 104(9), the Council decided to give notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary to remedy the situation.
Specifically, the Council decided that ‘ Greece shall put an end to the present excessive deficit situation as rapidly as possible and the latest by 2006 through: (i) a rigorous implementation of the 2005 budget as approved by its Parliament, and (ii) implementing in 2006 adjustment measures of a permanent nature leading to a correction in the deficit of at least 0.6 percentage point of GDP’ .
Finally, the Council required Greece to ‘submit, by 21 March 2005 at the latest, a report outlining the decisions to respect the recommendations of this Decision’ .
ACTION TAKEN BY GREECE IN RESPONSE TO THE COUNCIL DECISION The Greek authorities submitted on 21 March this year a revised update of the stability programme covering the period 2004-2007.
The targets in the programme take account of the budgetary impact of a fiscal package communicated to the Commission on the same date and made public by the government on 29 March, to underpin the implementation of the revised programme.
The Commission considers this revised update of the stability programme together with the commitment made public on 29 March as the report required in article 2(1) of the Council decision.
According to the general government data reported by the Greek government in the EDP March notification[1], real GDP grew at 4.2% in 2004 and the deficit attained 6.1% of GDP[2].
In the reference scenario, used for the assessment of the programme[4], real GDP is projected to grow at 2.9% in 2005 and 3% in 2006 and 2007.
The cyclically-adjusted deficit is projected to improve by 2.5, 0.9 and 0.5 percentage points of GDP in 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively.
Such programme projections assume full implementation of both the 2005 budget and the additional fiscal package made public on 29 March.
Specifically, for 2005, the Greek government has announced permanent measures involving an increase of the average VAT rate by 1 percentage point in 2005, which should provide additional revenues of EUR 610 millions, together with an increase in tobacco, alcohol and oil products excise duties, which should amount to EUR 280 millions.
On 29 March, the government also made public its commitment to include in the 2006 draft budget possible measures needed to bring the deficit below the 3% threshold next year.
There are still pending issues in the collection and processing of government data as indicated in by Eurostat in its press release of 18 March.
ASSESSMENT OF THE DECISIONS TAKEN The assessment of compliance of the measures above with the Council decision under Article 104(9) is carried out on the basis of the Commission services spring 2005 forecast, released on 4 April, which take account of the March EDP notification and of the revised update stability programme covering the period 2004-2007.
The assessment should also take into account the budgetary impact of the additional fiscal package, which could not be incorporated by the Commission services spring 2005 forecast, because it was made public after the forecast cut-off date.
The debt ratio is expected to attain 110.5% of GDP in 2005 and 108.9% of GDP in 2006.
The deficit figure of 4.4% in 2006 is based on a no-policy-change scenario, in which the 2005 deficit outcome is set at 4.5% of GDP and it is assumed that no discretionary measures are implemented.
The deficit projections in the revised update of the stability programme (3.7% of GDP in 2005 and 2.9% in 2006) and those in the Commission services spring 2005 forecast (4.5 and 4.4% respectively) differ because, as indicated above, the forecast does not include the budgetary impact of the additional fiscal package.
Furthermore, according to the Commission services spring 2005 forecast, the revised update of the stability programme seems to project too high an increase in social security contributions relative to compensation of employees in 2005, which does not seem warranted either on the basis of measures spelled out in the programme or on the basis of past trends[6].
In addition, the Greek government is committed not only to apply the 2005 budget with rigour but also to implement additional measures, worth half a point of GDP in 2005, which would partly offset the base-year effects of the additional slippage recorded in 2004.
According to the government, the carryover effects in 2006 of the additional measures to be implemented in 2005 should reduce the deficit by 0.9 percentage points of GDP.
Under the usual no-policy-change scenario, the spring 2005 forecast are based on a more cautious Commission’s assessment of the developments in some budget items, such as social contributions, public wages, and EU grants[8], although, in the Commission view, the interest payments might be somewhat lower than projected in the programme[9].
Overall, the Commission considers that there exist risks in the form of revenues shortfalls, expenditure overruns and statistical revisions that, if materialised, would result in deficit outturns for 2005 and 2006 higher than projected in the stability programme.
According to the Commission services spring 2005 forecasts the information provided in the revised update of the stability programme indicates that SFAs, albeit still significant in 2005 and 2006, are declining compared to 2004.
