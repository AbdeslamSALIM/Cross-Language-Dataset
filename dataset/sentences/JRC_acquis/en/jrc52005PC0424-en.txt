On 13 April 2005, the Commission imposed, by Regulation (EC) No 552/2005 ('the provisional Regulation'), a provisional anti-dumping duty on the imports into the Community of certain magnesia bricks originating in the PRC.
It is proposed that definitive anti-dumping duties should be imposed on imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the PRC.
It is proposed that the Council adopts the attached proposal for a Regulation, with a view to publish it in the Official Journal on 12 October 2005 at the latest. | 310 | Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 461/2004 of 8 March 2004. | 329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community.
Provisional Measures (1) On 13 April 2005, the Commission imposed, by Regulation (EC) No 552/2005[2] (‘the provisional Regulation’), a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China (‘PRC’). (2) It is recalled that the investigation period of dumping and injury (‘IP’) covered the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004.
The examination of trends relevant for the injury analysis covered the period from 1 January 2001 to the end of the IP (‘period considered’). 2.
Subsequent procedure (3) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnesia bricks from the PRC, some interested parties submitted comments in writing.
After the imposition of provisional measures, on-spot verification visits were carried out at the premises of - Carboref GmbH, Germany (unrelated importer) - Duferco, S.A., Switzerland (unrelated importer) - Duferco La Louvière, Belgium (user) - Refratechnik Steel GmbH, Germany (related importer). (5) The Commission further disclosed all the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of the provisional duty.
PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT (6) It is recalled that, in recital (12) of the provisional Regulation, the product concerned was defined as chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80% MgO, whether or not containing magnesite, originating in the PRC ('the product concerned'), normally declared within CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10.
It was found in the further course of the investigation that CN code ex 6815 99 90 could also be legally used for imports of the product concerned. (7) The investigation has shown that the product concerned was also imported under CN codes ex 6815 10 10, ex 6902 10 00 and ex 6903 90 90 (ex 6903 90 20 before 1 January 2004) during the IP.
In addition, CN code 6815 10 10 includes products which are essentially characterised by carbon, whereas the product concerned is essentially characterised by the magnesium oxide content.
In order to prevent misclassifications in the future, and to ensure that the codes will be correctly used, the customs authorities have been alerted via a special risk information form. (8) One interested party argued that only the CN codes 6815 91 00 and 6815 99 10 were mentioned in the notice of initiation and that the investigation could, therefore, not be extended to the additional codes.
The investigation has clarified that the product concerned should legally be imported under CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90.
If, however, it was found that the product concerned was mistakenly declared under a different CN code, the investigation also covered that product. (9) In the absence of any other comments regarding the definition of the product concerned and the like product, it is therefore concluded that the product concerned is defined as chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80% MgO, whether or not containing magnesite, originating in the PRC, declared within CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90.
The general methodology as set out in particular in recitals (35), (45) and (61) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 2.
Therefore, and in the absence of any other comments on IT, the findings as set out in recitals (29) to (34) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 4.
Normal value 4.1.
Analogue country (16) As set out in recital (39) of the provisional Regulation, the Commission sought cooperation from 38 known producers around the world.
In this respect, it is recalled that, as set out in recital (40) of the provisional Regulation, the investigation showed that the USA have a competitive market for the product concerned with at least 3 producers, around 30 suppliers, more than 15 importers and approximately 300 users.
It must be noted that this claim is irrelevant in the context of the assessment of normal value in the analogue country as any such adjustment on the costs would render the investigation in the analogue country meaningless and it would lead to adjust the normal value to non-market economy levels.
It is recalled that normal value in the analogue country was established on the basis of the data provided by two companies in the USA.
No indications were found during the investigation that this relationship had any influence on the normal value in analogue country. (24) Finally, following substantiated claims by a number of exporters, normal value was adjusted downwards due to (i) differences in quality of the raw material used by the producers in the analogue country as compared to that used by producers in the PRC; (ii) the higher costs of transport and other charges; and (iii) importation costs associated with the purchases of these raw materials by the US producers.
Furthermore, the investigation showed that an adjustment concerning the level of trade was also warranted. (25) In the absence of any other comments, recitals (42) and (43) of the provisional Regulation are confirmed. 4.2.
Determination of normal value of all exporting producers granted MET (26) At the provisional stage, the normal value for companies granted MET was established for each type of magnesia bricks.
The claim on the profit was therefore rejected. (30) Another exporting producer claimed that the profit margins deducted for its related companies were excessive and provided evidence that the actual profit was at a lower level.
The claim concerning the export VAT, however, was rejected as the company did not provide any evidence supporting its claim. (32) Contrary to its position at provisional stage, one exporting producer granted IT claimed at a very late stage in the investigation that it was related to a Community importer and requested that its dumping margin be revised accordingly.
It claimed that its dumping margin should be calculated starting from the resale price of the allegedly related importer.
At the definitive stage, the Commission streamlined the methodology to ensure consistency and groupings to PCNs on MgO basis were applied to calculate the export price for producers granted MET as well. (35) In the absence of any other comments, the provisional findings set out in recitals (59)-(60) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 6.
Comparison (36) In the absence of substantiated claims, the provisional findings as described in recitals (61)-(62) of the provisional Regulation are herewith confirmed. 7.
Dumping margin 7.1.
For the co-operating exporting producers granted MET/IT (37) The definitive weighted average dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the CIF Community frontier price, duty unpaid, are: Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co.
However, at the definitive stage the calculation methodology of the country-wide margin was revised in line with the consistent practice of the Commission in case of low cooperation.
Community production (41) In the absence of any new comments submitted, the provisional findings concerning the total Community production as set out in recital (68) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 2.
These parties claimed that RHI’s core business is not situated in the Community and that its volume of imports in the IP is almost the same as that of the Refratechnik group (‘Refratechnik’), another importing producer which was excluded from the Community industry. (43) It is recalled from recital (70) in the provisional Regulation that RHI’s biggest production sites as regards the product concerned as well as its headquarters and R%amp%D centre are situated in the Community.
Therefore, there is no compelling reason why RHI should be excluded from the Community industry. (44) Moreover, it was found that any comparison with the situation of Refratechnik is not appropriate.
Furthermore, in contrast to the RHI situation discussed above, although Refratechnik imported similar absolute volumes, these represented a much larger percentage of their sales on the Community market.
For these reasons, the claims had to be rejected and it is confirmed that RHI is part of the Community industry. (45) In the absence of any other comments submitted, the definition of the Community industry as set out in recitals (69) to (78) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 3.
Community consumption (46) In the absence of any comments submitted, the calculation of Community consumption as set out in recitals (79) to (82) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 4.
Market share of imports concerned (47) In the absence of any comments submitted, the findings on market share of imports concerned as set out in recitals (83) to (84) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 4.2.
Prices of imports and undercutting (48) It is recalled that, as set out in recitals (85) to (87) of the provisional Regulation, a comparison was made between the ex-works prices of the Community industry and those of the exporting producers in the country concerned at CIF Community frontier level. (49) Bearing in mind the revised methodology for underselling margins at recital (86) below, it was also considered appropriate to similarly revise the undercutting methodology.
The average undercutting was calculated at 23,9%. (50) Apart from the adjustments made as set out in recital (49) above, and in the absence of any other comments, recitals (85) to (87) of the provisional Regulation concerning prices of imports and undercutting are confirmed. 5.
Indeed, when looking solely at certain volume indicators such as production, market share or sales on the Community market, isolated from other indicators, these do not show a very negative trend. (54) However, it is recalled that the Community industry responded to the dumped imports over the period considered by reducing its prices in order to maintain its volume of sales on the Community market.
In such circumstances, the injury is consequently reflected particularly in prices and profitability. (55) In addition, when analysing the development of the Community industry’s economic indicators between 2001 and the IP, one must bear in mind that the Community industry had already restructured in order to decrease overcapacities and in order to rationalise in the 1990’s.
However, as can be seen from the substantially decreasing developments in profitability of Community sales (recital (98) of the provisional Regulation) and decreasing average sales prices (recital (94) of the provisional Regulation), the situation deteriorated significantly between 2001 and the end of the IP. (56) As regards the slightly improving situation in the IP, it is recalled that this was achieved by a further reduction in costs and that the improved situation in the IP was still far from the level that could be achieved in the absence of dumped imports (recital (99) of the provisional Regulation). (57) In the absence of any other comments submitted in addition to the above, the findings in respect of the situation for the Community industry, as set out in recitals (88) to (111) of the provisional Regulation, are hereby confirmed. 6.
Conclusion on injury (58) In view of the above, and in the absence of any other comments, it is confirmed that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
Impact of the imports from the PRC (59) One interested party alleged that the imports did not have an effect on the Community industry as market share and sales volume were stable during the period considered.
Impact of developments within the steel industry (60) One interested party alleged that the technical progress resulting in longer lasting bricks and an efficient steel making process were causing the injury suffered by the Community industry and that this was not taken into account sufficiently in the provisional Regulation. (61) It is recalled in this respect that, based on data obtained from the user industry, the decrease of magnesia bricks used per tonne of steel produced was calculated at around 2% in the IP (recital (116) of the provisional Regulation).
In addition, it was found that Community consumption was stable during the period considered (recital (82) of the provisional Regulation).
The magnitude of the injury margins in this case show that the dollar depreciation could hardly have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. 4.
It should be noted that only 5 % of the total sales volume of RHI was imported from the PRC (recital (121) of the provisional Regulation) and that these imports were sold at prices comparable to those of the Community industry in the Community.
It is, however, recalled that exports only fell slightly over the period considered and that their profitability was higher than that of the sales on the Community market (recital (122) of the provisional Regulation).
While it is true that the mines for the main raw material are situated in the PRC leading to a cost and a strategic advantage for the producers in the PRC, such differences, which result in cost advantages, have in any event been taken into account in price comparisons. 7.
Conclusion on causation (67) In the absence of any other comments on causation, the conclusions drawn in this respect in recitals (112) to (124) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 1.
Interest of the Community industry (68) In the absence of any comments submitted with respect to the interest of the Community industry, the findings as set out in recitals (125) to (129) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 2.
The companies did not, however, present any new evidence that could change the Community interest conclusions as shown in the provisional Regulation. (70) Further arguments submitted by the importers which coincided with those of the users are discussed under recitals (73) to (82) below. (71) In the absence of any other comments, the findings set out in recitals (130) to (132) of the provisional Regulation concerning importers’ interests are confirmed. 3.
Interest of suppliers (72) In the absence of any comments submitted with respect to the interest of the Community suppliers, the findings as set out in recital (133) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 4.
Interest of users 4.1.
Although no new arguments were made in this respect, some additional material was provided to support this claim. (74) It is recalled that the largest producer on the Community market did not have a majority market share in the IP for the product concerned (recital (141) of the provisional Regulation).
In the absence of any other comments, the finding described in recitals (140) to (141) of the provisional Regulation are therefore confirmed. 4.2.
Shortage of supply and increased costs (75) It was claimed that the measures would lead to a shortage of supply of the product concerned in the Community market as the exporting producers would stop exporting it to the Community due to the measures.
These arguments are therefore not relevant for assessing the impact of the imposition of anti dumping measures. (77) The user industry also expressed its concern that measures would lead to a substantial cost increase for magnesia bricks and that this should be taken into account when considering the cost effect of measures on the steel industry.
However, the steel industry did not generally question the fact that magnesia bricks account for significantly less than 1 % of their total costs (recital (143) of the provisional Regulation).
Nevertheless, they pointed out that consideration should be given to the fact that (i) the product is of strategic importance; (ii) technical failure of magnesia bricks could cause substantial additional costs; and (iii) prices are likely to increase considerably due to other factors. (78) It was already noted in the provisional Regulation in recital (135) that refractories are a strategically very important consumable material for the steel industry as all steel has to pass through its converters, furnaces and ladles.
It was, however, not contested by the large majority of the steel industry, leading to the conclusion that it is also in their interest that a viable magnesia bricks production rests within the Community. (82) In the absence of any further comments submitted with respect of the claimed disruption in the market structure and increased costs, the findings as set out in recitals (140) to (143) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 4.3.
Conclusion on users’ interest (83) In the absence of any further comments submitted with respect of the users’ interest, the findings as set out in recitals (134) to (144) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 5.
The conclusion as set out in recitals (145) and (146) of the provisional Regulation is therefore confirmed.
DEFINITIVE ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
Adjustments to this methodology were claimed and investigated as set out in recitals (86) to (88) below. (86) In the provisional Regulation a standard adjustment was made to the CIF export prices in order to cover post importation costs, importer costs and level of trade.
The injury elimination margins calculated are shown below at recital (90). (87) A users’ association claimed that the difference in costs for resin or pitch, which is used as binder for magnesia bricks was not taken into account in the calculations.
This figure was not contested by any interested parties and it is therefore definitively confirmed. (90) The definitive weighted average injury margins for companies granted either IT or MES are: Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co.
Ltd. | 48,2% | (91) Following the various adjustments mentioned above that have been made to the normal value and export prices, the injury elimination level established on the basis of data of cooperating companies not granted MET or IT and non co-operating companies was found to be 39,9%. (92) In the absence of any further comments, other than the amendments discussed above, the methodology set out in recitals (147) to (152) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 2.
Definitive measures (93) In the light of the foregoing and in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margin or at the level of the injury margin calculated in all cases, where it is lower than the dumping margin found. (94) On the basis of the above, the definitive duties should be as follows: Company | Injury elimination margin | Dumping margin | Proposed anti-dumping duty | Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co.
Ltd | 48,2% | 8,1% | 8,1% | All other companies | 39,9% | 51,5% | 39,9% | (95) The individual anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
Collection of provisional duties (107) In view of the magnitude of the dumping margins found and in the light of the level of the material injury caused to the Community industry, it is considered necessary that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty, imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 552/2005, should be collected at the rate of the duty definitely imposed.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80% MgO, whether or not containing magnesite, originating in the People's Republic of China, falling within CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90 (TARIC codes 6815 91 00 10, 6815 99 10 20 and 6815 99 90 20). 6.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community frontier price, before duty, of the products described in paragraph 1, shall be as follows: Manufacturer | Anti-dumping duty | TARIC additional code | Liaoning Mayerton Refractories Co.
Ltd., Jinqiao Development Zone, Dashiqiao, Liaoning Province, 115100, PRC | 2,7% | A632 | Yingkou Sanhua Refractory Material Co.
Ltd., Gangdu Management Zone, Dashiqiao City, Liaoning Province, 115100, PRC | 8,1% | A633 | Yingkou Kyushu Refractories Co.
Ltd., Houlashan, Jinqiao Village, Dashiqiao City, Liaoning Province 115100, PRC | 18,6% | A634 | Yingkou Guangyang Refractories Co.
Ltd., Houlashan, Jinqiao Village, Dashiqiao City, Liaoning Province, 115100, PRC, | 18,6% | A635 | Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co.
Ltd., Qinghuayu Village, Qinghua District, Dashiqiao City, Liaoning Province, 115100, PRC | 15,3% | A636 | Dashiqiao Sanqiang Refractory Materials Co.
Ltd., Biangan Village, Nanlou Economic Development zone, Dashiqiao City, Liaoning Province, 115100, PRC | 27,7% | A638 | All other companies | 39,9% | A999 | 7.
Notwithstanding the provisions in paragraph 2, the definitive duty shall not apply to imports declared for release into free circulation in accordance with the provisions of Article 2. 8.
A customs debt shall be incurred at the time of acceptance of the declaration for release into free circulation whenever it is established, in respect of goods described in Article 1 and exempted from anti-dumping duty under the conditions listed in paragraph (1), that one or more of such conditions are not fulfilled.
Article 3 Amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 552/2005 on imports of chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80% MgO, whether or not containing magnesite, originating in the People's Republic of China, falling within CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90 (TARIC codes 6815 91 00 10, 6815 99 10 20 and 6815 99 90 20) shall be definitely collected in accordance with the rules set out below.
Article 4 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
