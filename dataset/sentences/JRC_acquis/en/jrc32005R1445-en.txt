If a set contains provisional data, this should be explained in Part I.
For the generation of waste the key aggregates are: - hazardous waste generated by households, - non-hazardous waste generated by households, - hazardous waste generated by enterprises (the total of all NACE categories), - non-hazardous waste generated by enterprises (the total of all NACE categories).
For the treatment of waste the key aggregates are: - hazardous waste used as fuel, - non-hazardous waste used as fuel, - hazardous waste incinerated, - non-hazardous waste incinerated, - hazardous waste recovered, - non-hazardous waste recovered, - hazardous waste disposed of, - non-hazardous waste disposed of.
Description of the parties involved/sources used in the data collection.
The different methods are: - Survey, - Administrative sources, - Modelling, - Other (specify).
Part II: Report on quality attributes 1.
Non-response errors - Response rate at the level of the key aggregates; - Description of the handling of non-responses (unit and item non-responses) in surveys; - Determination of expectancy of errors resulting from non-responses. 2.2.5.
Model assumption errors - Description of models, assumptions connected with the model application and expected errors and how to cope with them; - Results of sensitivity analysis; - Sources used (refer to description of sources in Part I). 3.
Punctuality of data transmission to Eurostat will be evaluated according to the Regulation on waste statistics, which specifies the periodicity and deadlines for data transmission.
Accessibility and clarity The national reporting organisation (identified in Part I of the quality report) should describe: - the policy on dissemination of waste statistics, - the measures and tools to establish/improve clarity, - the relevant confidentiality policy. 5.
An evaluation of the consequences should be carried out. 6.
There is no need to report on coherence with: - OECD/Eurostat Joint questionnaire, - Specific waste reporting obligations (end-of-life vehicles, waste from electrical and electronic equipment, packaging and packaging waste, waste shipment, etc.), - Integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) reporting, - Reporting to European Environmental Agency.
Complete data sets The completeness of the data sets is defined by the transmission format for statistics on waste (Commission Regulation (EC) No 782/2005 of 24 May 2005 [1]). 2.
The Commission (Eurostat) informs the person responsible for the quality of waste statistics in the Member State of the outcome of the evaluation within two months after the deadline for the transmission of data. [1] OJ L 131, 25.5.2005, p. 26. --------------------------------------------------
