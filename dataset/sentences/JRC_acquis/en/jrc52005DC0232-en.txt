Section 2 develops the objectives under the priority topics of the strategic concept on tackling OC.
Annex 1 lists the measures for implementing the strategic concept on tackling OC, and corresponding responsibilities with target dates and priority ratings.
Annex 2 lists and summarises recently adopted Communications and Council conclusions which are relevant.
Annex 3 details the follow-up to the mid-term evaluation of the Millennium Strategy.
The future EU crime statistics system should collect information from law enforcement agencies and also quantitative information based on citizen and business surveys, as well as measuring crime and victimisation in specific groups to aid decision-making in different policy areas.
The Commission will submit a dedicated Communication on combating trafficking in human beings in 2005 which will take an integrated, human-rights oriented and victim-centred approach. 15.
To meet legal considerations the Commission will submit in 2005 a proposal for a directive as appropriate legal instrument. 20.
Strengthen tools to address financial aspects of OC 22.
The Protocol to the 2000 MLA Convention aims at facilitating cooperation in cross-border financial investigations.
The European Council stressed in The Hague Programme that strengthening freedom, security and justice requires an innovative approach to the cross-border exchange of law enforcement information .
The Commission will submit a legislative proposal on this in 2005. 28.
Strengthen inter-institutional and cross-jurisdictional cooperation 29.
The potential of Eurojust [28] and Europol in the fight against OC has yet to be fully exploited by Member States.
Implementation of the Europol Information System in all Member States will facilitate Europol’s access to information on OC. 33.
Improve monitoring and evaluation 37.
The Commission regards this as of crucial importance and will present its views on evaluation, bearing in mind Article III-260 of the Constitutional Treaty in 2006.
Europol’s strategy on external relations 2004-2006[35] should be pursued further and Eurojust should develop its own external relations strategy.
Alternatively, it could be evaluated separately in order for this evaluation to be tuned to the process of annually identifying strategic priorities in the fight against OC at EU level. 48.
A specific evaluation of the strategic concept is recommended at the end of 2006 to provide a benchmark before implementation of the financial perspectives 2007-2013 and in view of the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty.
