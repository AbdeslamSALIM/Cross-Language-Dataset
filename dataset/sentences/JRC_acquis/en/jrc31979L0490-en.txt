Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Any vehicle in one of the categories M1, M2, M3, N1, O1 or O2 (1) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in item II.5.1 if the ground clearance of the entire rear width of the chassis or the main parts of the body does not exceed 55 cm.
This requirement must be satisfied over a distance of 45 cm measured from the rear extremity of the vehicle.
When the vehicle is unladen (2), the lower edge of the device must at no point be more than 55 cm above the ground; II.5.4.2.
The width of the device must at no point exceed the width of the rear axle measured at the outermost points of the wheels, excluding the bulging of the tyres close to the ground, nor must it be more than 10 cm shorter on either side.
The section height of the cross-member must be not less than 10 cm.
It must be possible for the operator to vary the position of the device by applying a force not exceeding 40 daN; II.5.4.5.
This requirement will be satisfied if it is shown that both during and after the application the horizontal distance between the rear of the device and the rear extremity of the vehicle does not exceed 40 cm at any of the points P1, P2 and P3.
The height must not, however, exceed 60 cm when the vehicle is unladen.
The forces specified in items II.5.4.5.2 and II.5.4.5.3 above must be applied separately.
