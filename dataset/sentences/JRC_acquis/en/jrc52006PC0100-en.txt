Proposal for a Council Regulation laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species /* COM/2006/0100 final - CNS 2006/0030 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 8.3.2006 COM(2006) 100 final 2006/0030 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1) BACKGROUND TO THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal This proposal seeks to update the Community rules transposing the technical conservation measures for certain stocks of highly migratory species adopted within the regional fisheries organisations (RFOs), responsible for the management and conservation of tunas and related species.
The regional organisations in question are: - the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), of which the Community has been a member since 14 November 1997; - the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), of which the Community has been a member since 18 September 1995; - the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC); the Community has applied to join the latter and has participated in the accession process for the adoption of the Convention - not yet in force - for strengthening it. - the Western and Central Pacific Ocean Fisheries Commission (WCPFC), of which the Community has been a member since 25 January 2005. | 120 | General background The European Community participates in a number of regional fisheries organisations which provide a framework for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of certain stocks of highly migratory species.
The technical measures adopted by these organisations have now been incorporated in Community law as Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratoty species (OJ L 137, 19.5.2001), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 831/2004 (OJ L 127, 29.4.2004).
The proposed regulation calls on the committee procedures provided for in Decision (EC) 1999/468 to ensure the implementation of the regulation and the amendment of its annexes. | 130 | Provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal The technical measures adopted by the regional organisations have now been incorporated in Community law as Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratoty species (OJ L 137, 19.5.2001), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 831/2004 (OJ L 127, 29.4.2004).
The technical measures will apply to Community fishermen fishing for tuna species in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. | 3) LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 305 | Summary of the proposed measures Transposal into Community law of technical measures adopted by regional fisheries organisations responsible for the management of tuna species to which the European Community is a contracting party. | 310 | Legal basis Article 37 of the Treaty | 329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal concerns an area that falls under exclusive Community competence.
Pursuant to Decision 86/238/EEC[4] the Community has been a Contracting Party to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, hereinafter "the ICCAT Convention", since 14 November 1997. 3.
The Community has fishing interests in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and has participated in the procedure for the adoption of the Convention for the strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, hereinafter the ‘Antigua Convention’.
These measures should therefore be incorporated in Community law. 11.
The WCPFC Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation with a view to ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable exploitation of highly migratory fish stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean through the setting up of a Fisheries Commission for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPFC). 13.
The technical measures adopted by these regional fisheries organisations have been transposed in Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species[10]. 15.
The limits on capacity must be determined in accordance with Article 20 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy[11]..... 17.
