Individual duty rates ranging from 0 to EUR 0,11 per kilo were imposed on cooperating exporting producers in the PRC.
It should be noted that exporting producers with 0 EUR duty rate represented around 60 % of the total exports of sodium cyclamate from the PRC during the investigation period of this reinvestigation. (6) The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purpose of this reinvestigation.
In establishing whether the export prices and the resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community had moved sufficiently, the price levels charged during the new IP were compared to those charged during the investigation period used in the investigation which led to the imposition of the original measures ("original IP"), which had covered the period from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002.
If it were then found that absorption had occurred, the dumping margin would have to be recalculated. (12) In accordance with Article 12 of the basic Regulation, importers/users and exporters were provided with an opportunity to submit evidence to justify a decrease in export prices and lack of movement in resale prices in the Community following the imposition of measures for reasons other than absorption of the anti-dumping duty. 1.
The resale price was established on the basis of information submitted by the importer in the Community which accounted for the majority of the imports of the co-operating exporter in the PRC. (16) The comparison showed that the average resale price in the Community, expressed in euro, of sodium cyclamate originating in the PRC, had decreased by 10 %.
Therefore any decrease in resale prices in the Community of sodium cyclamate should be estimated taking into account the USD/EUR exchange rate variation between the original IP and the new IP. (18) This was verified and it was found that the US dollar had depreciated against the euro by 35 % between the original IP and the new IP.
Article 2 This Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
