Given that only Extra, %quot%E%quot% and %quot%A%quot% quality products are eligible for carry-over aid set out in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the calculation of the quantities eligible for this aid should be based on these categories of products only. (3) In order to give maximum encouragement to action to stabilise the market, producer organisations not observing the Community withdrawal price throughout the fishing year should be excluded from receiving financial compensation for carry-over aid. (4) Systematic compliance with the common marketing standards referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 is a determining factor in price formation and contributes to stabilisation of the market.
Payment of the carry-over aid for eligible quantities of products shall be subject to the condition that, for the product or group of products concerned, all the quantities put up for sale by the producers organisation or its members during the fishing year have been classified previously in accordance with the marketing standards referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. 3.
The financial costs shall be a flat-rate sum of EUR 10 per tonne for the year 2001.
Thereafter the flat-rate shall be adjusted year on year using the interest rate which is set annually in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78. 5.
Article 2(1), (2) and (3), Article 3, Article 4(1)(c) and Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 shall apply mutatis mutandis to the carry-over aid arrangements provided for in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.
Article 8 At the request of the producer organisation concerned, the Member State shall grant a monthly advance on carry-over aid due in respect of the quantities for which aid is requested in that month, provided that the producer organisation has lodged a security equal to 105 % of the amount of the advance.
Article 10 Regulation (EEC) No 3901/92 is hereby repealed.
Article 11 This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
