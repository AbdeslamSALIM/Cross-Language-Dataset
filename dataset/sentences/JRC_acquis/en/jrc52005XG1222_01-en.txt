[no entries] -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 7 [1] Reference amounts determined annually by the national authorities for the crossing of borders BELGIUM Belgian law lays down general provisions for the verification of adequate means of subsistence, without specifying any mandatory rules.
If he is without any financial credit at all, he must have access to approximately EUR 38 for each day of the planned stay. — Aliens staying at a hotel If the alien is unable to furnish proof of any credit at all, he must have access to approximately EUR 50 for each day of the planned stay.
If the sum referred to in the undertaking does not reach this amount, the alien shall be obliged to submit a document proving the ownership of funds equivalent to the difference between the Subsistence Minimum for Personal Needs and the amount of the commitment for the period of his expected stay, however, not more than 6 times the Subsistence Minimum for Personal Needs.
Document on the provision of means for one's residence may be replaced by a decision or an agreement on the allocation of a grant acquired pursuant to an international treaty by which the Czech Republic is bound. (4) An alien who has not attained 18 years shall be obliged to prove the availability of funds for his stay pursuant to sub-section 1 equivalent to a half of the amount." and Section 15 provides the following: "Invitation In an invitation, the person inviting an alien shall undertake to cover the costs: (a) related to the maintenance of the alien throughout his stay in the Territory until he leaves the Territory; (b) related to the accommodation of the alien throughout his stay in the Territory until he leaves the Territory; (c) related to the provision of healthcare to the alien throughout his stay in the Territory until he leaves the Territory, and the transfer of the alien when ill or of the remains of the deceased; (d) arising to the Police in connection with the alien staying in the Territory and leaving the Territory in case of administrative expulsion." DENMARK Under the Danish Aliens Law, an alien entering Danish territory must have means adequate for his subsistence and for the return journey.
GREECE Ministerial decree No 3011/2/1f of 11 January 1992 fixes the amount for the means of subsistence which foreign nationals — with the exception of nationals of the Member States of the European Community — must have at their disposal if they wish to enter Greek territory.
The amount of foreign currency required per day is reduced by 50 % for minors who are members of the alien's family.
This amount is therefore EUR 25,20 per day.

MALTA It is the practice to ensure that persons entering Malta have a minimum amount of MTL 20 (EUR 48) per day for the duration of their visit.
THE NETHERLANDS The amount which border control officials take as the basis when checking means of subsistence is currently EUR 34 per person per day.
Amounts indicated in the above regulation are as follows: - PLN 100 per day of stay for persons over 16 years old, but not less then 500 PLN, - PLN 50 per day of stay for persons under 16 years old, but not less then 300 PLN, - PLN 20 per day of stay, but not less then 100 PLN, for persons participating in tourist trips, youth camps, sport competitions or having costs of stay in Poland covered or arriving to Poland for health treatment in a sanatorium, - PLN 300 for persons over 16 years old, whose stay in Poland does not exceed 3 days (including transit), - PLN 150 for persons under 16 years old, whose stay in Poland does not exceed 3 days (including transit).

In addition to the funds, or tickets, required for the departure and accommodation during the stay, approximately EUR 30 per day is considered necessary, depending on the arrangements for accommodation and a possible sponsor.
In practice, the reference amount is ISK 4000 per person.
The total minimum amount is ISK 20000 for each entry.
Account is taken of the length of stay, whether the foreign national will be staying with family or friends, whether he or she has a ticket for the return journey and whether a guarantee has been given for the stay (as an indication, an amount of NOK 500 per day is deemed to be adequate for visitors who are not staying with relations or friends).

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 334/2002 of 18 February 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(iii) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [3], Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [4], Whereas: (1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 [5] laid down a uniform format for visas. (2) Measure No 38 of the Vienna Action Plan, adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 December 1998, states that attention must be given to new technical developments in order to ensure, where appropriate, greater security in the uniform format for visas. (3) Conclusion No 22 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 states that a common active policy on visas and false documents should be further developed. (4) The establishment of a uniform visa format is an essential element in the harmonisation of visa policy. (5) It is necessary to make provision for the establishment of common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas, in particular common rules on the technical methods and standards to be used for filling in the form. (6) The integration of a photograph produced according to high security standards is a first step towards the use of elements establishing a more reliable link between the uniform format visa and the holder as an important contribution to ensuring that the uniform format for visas is protected even against fraudulent use.
The specifications set out in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) document 9303 on machine readable visas will be taken into account. (7) Common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas are essential to meet high technical standards and to facilitate detection of forged or falsified visa stickers. (8) The powers to adopt such common standards should be conferred on the Committee set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 which should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [6]. (9) Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 should therefore be amended. (10) The measures provided for in this Regulation to make the uniform format for visas more secure do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents. (11) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents. (12) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis falling within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis [7]. (13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 4 December 2001, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation. (14) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation.
The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at two months. 3.
Article 4 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

If a third-country national does not fulfil all these conditions, entry or the issue of a visa shall be refused except where a Contracting Party considers it necessary to derogate from this rule on humanitarian grounds, on grounds of national interest, or because of international obligations.
In such cases, the Contracting Party concerned may issue a visa with limited territorial validity (LTV) only and must inform the other Contracting Parties (Articles 5(2) and 16 of the Schengen Convention).
The rules of procedure in force are as follows: 1.2.1.
In general, information shall be sent within 72 hours. 1.2.2.
Issue of visas by the border authorities In this case, information shall be sent within 72 hours to the central authorities of the other Contracting Parties. 1.2.3.
The following information shall be sent to the Contracting Parties: Surname, first name, and date of birth of visa holder Nationality of visa holder Date and place of issue of LTV Reasons for issuing visas with limited territorial validity - humanitarian grounds - grounds of national interest - international obligations - travel document which is not valid in all Contracting Parties - second issue of a visa within a six-month period - in emergencies, there was no consultation with the central authorities - the central authorities of a Contracting Party raised objections during consultation 2.
CANCELLING, REVOKING AND REDUCING THE DURATION OF VALIDITY OF A UNIFORM VISA In accordance with the principles adopted by the Committee Executive when cancelling, revoking and reducing the duration of a uniform visa's validity (SCH/Com-ex (93) 24), the following information must be sent to the other Contracting Parties: 2.1.
Contracting Parties which cancel a visa issued by another Contracting Party shall in principle inform the central authorities of the issuing State within 72 hours.
A Contracting Party which revokes a uniform visa shall inform the issuing Contracting Party in principle within 72 hours.
Reducing the duration of a visa's validity When a Schengen State reduces the duration of validity of a visa issued by another Contracting Party, it shall inform this Contracting Party's central authorities in principle within 72 hours.
With regard to the communication referred to in Article 25 of the Convention, such a procedure is closely connected with the functioning of the Schengen Information System (SIS).
The rules of procedure set out in this note shall be re-examined from the point of view of their practical applicability at the latest twelve months after the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement has been brought into force. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 15 Specimen harmonised forms providing proof of invitation, sponsorship and accommodation drafted by the Contracting Parties GERMANY +++++ TIFF +++++ +++++ TIFF +++++ FRANCE +++++ TIFF +++++ +++++ TIFF +++++ LITHUANIA (1) +++++ TIFF +++++ -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 16 Specimen harmonised uniform visa application form +++++ TIFF +++++ +++++ TIFF +++++ -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 17 Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 693/2003 of 14 April 2003 establishing a specific Facilitated Transit Document (FTD), a Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) and amending the Common Consular Instructions and the Common Manual THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [2] Whereas: (1) In order to prepare accession of new Member States, the Community should take into account specific situations, which may occur as a result of the enlargement and set out the relevant legislation in order to avoid future problems in relation with the crossing of the external border. (2) The Community should address in particular the new situation of third country nationals who must necessarily cross the territory of one or several Member States in order to travel between two parts of their own country which are not geographically contiguous. (3) A Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and a Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) should be established for this specific case of transit by land. (4) The FTD/FRTD are to constitute documents having the value of transit visas authorising their holders to enter in order to pass through the territories of Member States in accordance with the provisions of the Schengen acquis concerning the crossing of external borders. (5) The conditions and the procedures for obtaining these documents should be facilitated in line with the provisions of the Schengen acquis. (6) Penalties, as provided for in national law, should be imposed on the holder of the FTD/FRTD in case of misuse of the scheme. (7) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the recognition of FTD/FRTD, issued by one Member State, by the other Member States bound by the provisions of the Schengen acquis concerning the crossing of external borders cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale of the action be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
CHAPTER II ISSUING AN FTD/FRTD Article 4 Conditions In order to obtain an FTD/FRTD, the applicant shall: (a) possess a valid document, authorising him to cross external borders as defined pursuant to Article 17(3)(a) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, signed at Schengen on 19 June 1990 [10]; (b) not be a person for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing entry; (c) not be considered to be a threat to public policy, national security or the international relations of any of the Member States.
However, in relation to the FRTD, prior consultation in accordance with Article 17(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement shall not apply; (d) for the FTD, have valid reasons for frequent travelling between the two parts of the territory of his country.
The application for an FTD shall be presented on the standard form as set out in Annex I. 4.
Article 6 Issuing procedure 1.
The decision on issuing the FRTD shall be taken by the competent consular authorities at the latest 24 hours after the electronic transmission provided for in Article 5(4). 2.
In this case it shall be affixed by the consular offices on the uniform format for forms for affixing the visa in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 333/2002 [11].
CHAPTER III COMMON PROVISIONS RELATED TO THE FTD/FRTD Article 8 Refusal 1.
Article 9 Penalties Penalties, as provided for in national law, should be imposed on the holder of the FTD/FRTD in case of misuse of the scheme.
CHAPTER IV FINAL PROVISIONS Article 10 Subject to the specific rules set out in this Regulation, the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to visas shall also apply to the FTD/FRTD.
Article 12 Implementation 1.
Article 13 Report The Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on the functioning of the facilitated transit scheme at the latest three years after the entry into force of the first decision as set out in Article 12(1).
Article 14 Entry into force This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community.
