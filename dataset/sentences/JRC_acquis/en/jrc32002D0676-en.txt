This Communication was welcomed by the European Parliament in a Resolution of 18 May 2000(4).
The policy approach with regard to the use of radio spectrum should be coordinated and, where appropriate, harmonised at Community level, in order to fulfil Community policy objectives efficiently.
Where it is necessary to adopt harmonised measures for the implementation of Community policies which do not fall within the remit of CEPT, the Commission could adopt implementation measures with the assistance of the Radio Spectrum Committee. (13) The CEPT comprises 44 European countries.
In international negotiations, Member States and the Community should develop a common action and closely cooperate during the whole negotiations process so as to safeguard the unity of the international representation of the Community in line with the procedures which had been agreed in the Council conclusions of 3 February 1992 for the World Administrative Radio Conference and as confirmed by the Council conclusions of 22 September 1997 and 2 May 2000.
It is therefore important to ensure compatibility between the Community's arrangements for negotiating trade and market access issues with the radio spectrum policy objectives to be pursued under this Decision. (21) It is necessary, due to the potential commercial sensitivity of information which may be obtained by national authorities in the course of their action relating to radio spectrum policy and management, that the national authorities apply common principles in the field of confidentiality laid down in this Decision. (22) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely to establish a common framework for radio spectrum policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 Definition For the purposes of this Decision, %quot%radio spectrum%quot% includes radio waves in frequencies between 9 kHz and 3000 GHz; radio waves are electromagnetic waves propagated in space without artificial guide.
Article 3 Committee procedure 1.
Article 4 Function of the Radio Spectrum Committee 1.
In order to meet the aim set out in Article 1, the Commission shall submit to the Radio Spectrum Committee, in accordance with the procedures set out in this Article, appropriate technical implementing measures with a view to ensuring harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum, as well as the availability of information related to the use of radio spectrum, as referred to in Article 5. 2.
The Commission shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(2). 3.
For the purpose of this paragraph, the Commission shall act in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(3). 4.
The measures referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 may, where appropriate, provide the possibility for transitional periods and/or radio spectrum sharing arrangements in a Member State to be approved by the Commission, where justified, taking into account the specific situation in the Member State, on the basis of a reasoned request by the Member State concerned and provided such exception would not unduly defer implementation or create undue differences in the competitive or regulatory situations between Member States. 6.
To achieve the aim set out in Article 1, the Commission may also adopt technical implementing measures referred to in paragraph 1 which are not covered by paragraph 2, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 3(3). 7.
Article 5 Availability of information Member States shall ensure that their national radio frequency allocation table and information on rights, conditions, procedures, charges and fees concerning the use of radio spectrum, shall be published if relevant in order to meet the aim set out in Article 1.
Article 6 Relations with third countries and international organisations 1.
The Commission shall monitor developments regarding radio spectrum in third countries and in international organisations, which may have implications for the implementation of this Decision. 2.
The Commission shall report regularly on the results of the application of paragraphs 1 and 2 to the European Parliament and the Council and may propose measures with the aim of securing the implementation of the principles and objectives of this Decision, where appropriate.
Article 7 Notification Member States shall give the Commission all information necessary for the purpose of verifying the implementation of this Decision.
Article 8 Confidentiality 1.
Paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the right of relevant authorities to undertake disclosure where it is essential for the purposes of fulfilling their duties, in which case such disclosure shall be proportionate and shall have regard to the legitimate interests of undertakings in the protection of their business secrets. 3.
Paragraph 1 shall not preclude publication of information on conditions linked to the granting of rights to use radio spectrum which does not include information of a confidential nature.
Article 9 Report The Commission shall report on an annual basis to the European Parliament and the Council on the activities developed and the measures adopted pursuant to this Decision, as well as on future actions envisaged pursuant to this Decision.
Article 10 Implementation Member States shall take all measures necessary, by laws, regulations and administrative provisions, for the implementation of this Decision and all resulting measures.
Article 11 Entry into force This Decision shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 12 Addressees This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
