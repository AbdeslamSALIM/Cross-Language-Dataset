At its 413th plenary session of 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 16 December), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 60 votes to one, with 6 abstentions.
Introduction 1.
As a response, the Commission submitted a Proposal for Regulation on the issue, which was adopted by the by Council in 1991 [1].
In its Opinion of 1990 [2] the EESC, while stressing the importance of achieving consistency on this issue, not only supported a European ban on leghold traps, but also proposed an international ban for them. 2.
The text also includes a large series of possible derogations, and two annexes (Annex II and III) relating to humane trapping standards and testing of trapping methods. 3.4 The Proposal highlights that Member States can be allowed to implement stringent legislation on the issue and the 1991 EU regulation banning the use of leghold trap remains in force.
Article 2 defines "trapping methods" but it does not include a definition of "humane trapping standards".
In relation to killing traps, the standards set in the Proposal clearly do not meet the scientific standards agreed upon by the Community, which recommend instantaneous death or a maximally tolerable threshold time of 30 seconds before death.
Trappers 8.1 The proposal foresees that a system of authorizations and training for trappers should be put in place.
