Council Regulation (EC) No 1652/2006 of 7 November 2006 terminating the new exporter review of Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyesters originating, inter alia , in the People's Republic of China Council Regulation (EC) No 1652/2006 of 7 November 2006 terminating the new exporter review of Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyesters originating, inter alia, in the People's Republic of China THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] the %quot%basic Regulation%quot%), and in particular Article 11(4) thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: 1.
MEASURES IN FORCE (1) The measures currently in force on imports into the Community of polyester staple fibres (%quot%PSF%quot%) originating in the People's Republic of China (%quot%PRC%quot%) are definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 [2]. 2.
CURRENT INVESTIGATION 2.1.
After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by Regulation (EC) No 342/2006 [3], a review of Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 with regard to the applicant and commenced its investigation. (5) Pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 342/2006, an anti-dumping duty of 49,7 % imposed by Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 on imports of PSF produced, inter alia, by the applicant was repealed.
Investigation period (9) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 October 2004 to 31 December 2005 (the investigation period or IP). 3.
Considering that the related Chinese producer was subject to the definitive anti-dumping duty in force, it was found that the criterion of the second sentence of Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, which sets out that a new exporter or producer should show that it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the exporting country which are subject to the anti-dumping measures on the product, is not fulfilled. (12) The applicant argued that the related producer did not export the product concerned to the Community during the original investigation period.
In support of this argument, the applicant provided the related producer's audited accounts for the period between 2002 and 2004 which, according to the applicant, contained no indication of any export sales having been made during the original IP. (13) The evidence submitted by the applicant did, however, not show that the related producer did indeed not export the product concerned during the original investigation period.
Therefore, findings with regard to this company were based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Furthermore, the purpose of the joint venture between the applicant and the related producer was, as laid down by chapter 5 of the joint venture agreement, to achieve %quot%a competitive position in quality and price for the world market%quot%, to %quot%produce and sell polyester staple fibre%quot% and to %quot%import and export products and raw materials in connection with polyester staple fibre%quot% which indicates that both companies would indeed cooperate and at least adjust their decisions in order to maximise their world market position.
The applicant did not submit any information which showed that such risk of circumvention could be sufficiently excluded. (36) The applicant contested the decision to reject its IT claim, submitting that possible circumvention should be addressed through the initiation of an investigation in accordance with Article 13 of the basic Regulation, and that nothing in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation places the companies located in China any burden with respect to the demonstration that they would not circumvent any anti-dumping measures. (37) In this regard, it is noted that the second paragraph of Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation is clear on the conditions applicable for the establishment of an individual duty when Article 2(7)(a) applies, which is applicable in the present case since it could not be concluded that the applicant fulfilled the criteria of Article 2(7)(c).
CONCLUSION (39) The purpose of the present review was to determine the individual margin of dumping of the applicant, which was allegedly different from the current residual margin applicable to imports of the product concerned from the PRC.
The request was mainly based on the allegation that the applicant fulfilled the criteria for MET. (40) As the investigation concludes that, in the absence of cooperation from its related producer, the applicant was granted neither MET nor IT, the Commission could not establish that the applicant's individual dumping margin was indeed different from the residual dumping margin established in the original investigation.
RETROACTIVE LEVYING OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY (41) In the light of the above findings, the anti-dumping duty applicable to the applicant shall be levied retroactively on imports of the product concerned, which have been made subject to registration pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 342/2006. 6.
DISCLOSURE (42) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations leading to the above conclusions and were invited to comment in accordance with Article 20 of the basic Regulation.
The anti-dumping duty applicable according to Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 to %quot%all other companies%quot% in the People's Republic of China is hereby levied with effect from 26 February 2006 on imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyesters which have been registered pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 342/2006. 3.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
