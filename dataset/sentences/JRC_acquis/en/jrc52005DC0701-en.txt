Report from the Commission - 2004 Report on Phare, pre-accession and transition instruments {SEC(2005)1773} /* COM/2005/0701 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 23.12.2005 COM(2005)701 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION 2004 REPORT ON PHARE, PRE-ACCESSION AND TRANSITION INSTRUMENTS{SEC(2005) 1773} SUMMARY Together with two other instruments financed by the European Communities, namely ISPA (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession) and SAPARD (Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development), the Phare Programme aims to assist candidate and acceding countries in their preparations for joining the European Union.
Main evolutions of the Enlargement Process in 2004 On 1 May 2004, the Europe of 25 became a reality.
On 6 October 2004, the Commission adopted its enlargement package including regular reports for Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, a strategy paper on enlargement and an impact assessment on issues arising from Turkey's membership perspective.
The accession negotiations were completed with Bulgaria and Romania to allow both countries to join the EU in 2007.
In the light of a recommendation delivered by the Commission on 6 October 2004, the December European Council also decided to open accession negotiations with Turkey in October 2005.
The decision was taken in recognition of the progress on reforms achieved by Turkey and provided that key pieces of legislation would enter into force and the Protocol extending the Ankara Agreement to the new Member States would be signed before opening negotiations.[1] On 20 April 2004, the Commission recommended opening accession negotiations with Croatia .
Based on this recommendation, the June European Council decided to convene a bilateral intergovernmental conference with Croatia early in 2005 in order to begin negotiations.[2] Regarding financing, on 29 September 2004, the Commission proposed, in conjunction with its proposals on the financial perspectives for 2007–2013, the establishment of an instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA) to replace Phare, ISPA, Sapard and CARDS, and cover current and future applicants.
For the period 2004–2006, the Council laid down a general approach for reallocating the resources still available under Sapard and ISPA.
The Union reaffirmed its commitment that if the European Council decides in December 2004 that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.
Brussels European Council of 16-17 December 2004: The European Council welcomed the findings and recommendations presented by the Commission on 6 October 2004 in its regular reports on Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey, the strategy paper on enlargement, its recommendation on Turkey and the impact assessment on issues arising from Turkey's membership perspective.
The European Council noted with satisfaction that progress made by Romania in implementing the acquis and commitments entered into as regards, in particular, Justice and Home Affairs and Competition, made it possible to formally close all of the outstanding chapters with this candidate on 14 December 2004 and accordingly looked forward to welcoming it as a member from January 2007.
It requested the Council to agree on a framework for negotiations, to be presented by the Commission, with a view to opening negotiations on 3 October 2005.
Phare and Pre-Accession for Turkey and the Special Aid Package for the Northern Part of Cyprus From 2004, the eight Central and Eastern European countries and the two Mediterranean countries which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004 have no longer been beneficiaries of pre-accession aid.
However, a special Phare phasing-out mechanism for a maximum period of 15 months was established in order to allow an orderly transition of the EU delegations’ role in the management of Phare programmes to the national authorities.
The 2004 pre-accession financial assistance programme for Turkey focused mainly on addressing the Copenhagen political criteria, approximation to the acquis , strengthening the public administration, justice and home affairs, and economic and social cohesion.
The Commission Decision on the 2003 Special Aid Package for the northern part of Cyprus was amended on 11 August 2004 (Commission Decision C(2004)3030) in order to refocus the assistance programme following the outcome of the April 2004 referenda by increasing the allocation for TAIEX assistance and for feasibility studies.
By the end of 2004, contracts were signed with UNDP, British Council and the British Council for a total amount of €10.3 million.
Funding in 2004 was in line with the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council which endorsed the revised roadmap for Bulgaria and Romania as well as the transfer of aid for Turkey to Heading 7 (pre-accession).
Total Phare operational commitments amounted to € 757.7 million comprising: National Programmes | €577.8 million | Nuclear Decommissioning (Kozloduy) | €85.0 million | Cross-Border Co-operation | € 64 million | Multi-Country/Horizontal Programmes | €28.4 million | (N.B.
The remaining € 2.5 million represent Phare commitments to the European Training Foundation managed under the Education and Culture policy area.) National programmes were divided as follows: Bulgaria | €172.5 million | Romania | €405.3 million | The pre-accession assistance programme was agreed for Turkey: Turkey | €245.9 million | This includes the National Programme (€236.7 million), as well as horizontal measures including TAIEX and support expenditure.
Detailed information about Phare in each country and Pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey can be found in the Annex - Part I: Country section- to this report. 2.2.
Transition Facility The ten countries which used to receive pre-accession financial assistance under Phare (or specific pre-accession facilities in the cases of Cyprus and Malta) instead benefited for the first time in 2004 from a special Transition Facility for institution building aimed at allowing the then new Member States to strengthen and consolidate institutional and administrative capacity to implement the acquis communautaire and thus continue the institution-building measures initiated under Phare.
The Transition Facility was created by article 34 of the Act of Accession, as a temporary post-accession financial instrument.
Total commitments amounted to €189.6 million, comprising: National Programmes | €166.6 million | Horizontal and Multi-country Programmes and others | €23.0 million | National programmes were divided as follows: Cyprus | €9 million | Czech Republic | €17.1 million | Estonia | €8.4 million | Hungary | €18.4 million | Malta | €11.8 million | Latvia | €6.7 million | Lithuania | €22.4 million | Poland | €49.9 million | Slovenia | €8.7 million | Slovakia | €14.2 million | 2.3.
ISPA [4] (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession) is directed mainly towards aligning the applicant countries on Community infrastructure standards.
A General Assistance Document, through which the Commission informed the Phare Management Committee of the co-ordination of pre-accession aid in 2004, was presented to Member States at the Phare Management Committee on 10 June 2004.
A separate annual report on co-ordination of pre-accession assistance provides more detailed information on co-ordination between Phare, ISPA and SAPARD. 2.4.
Co-operation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and International Financial Institutions (IFIs) As in previous years, Co-operation with the EIB and other IFIs continued in 2004 under the framework of the Memorandum of Understanding on co-operation in pre-accession assistance.
PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT 3.1.
Poland was the only new Member State not to have received EDIS accreditation in 2004, though a decision was expected in the first weeks of 2005.[5] Details concerning the EDIS decision in each of the 10 new member states can be found in point 1 of each of the country sections.
The Commission and the national administrations in these countries continued to monitor the process through the High Level Working Groups (HLWG), set up in 2002 in all Phare countries to oversee and provide guidance for the transition to EDIS.
Monitoring and Interim Evaluation In 2004, the external interim evaluation schemes generated some 45 individual country, sectoral, ad-hoc or thematic evaluation reports covering Phare and other pre-accession financial instruments measures, as well as a Consolidated Summary Report of Phare support allocated in 1999-2002 and implemented until November 2003.
The exercise will conclude at the end of 2006, after a planned duration of 20 months 3.3.
The signature took place on 29 July 2005 and a formal decision signalling the beginning of negotiations was taken on the 3 October 2005. [2] EU Member States decided in Luxemburg on 3 October to launch accession negotiations with Croatia.
The opening of the accession negotiations was made possible by the assessment of the Council of Ministers that Croatia was fully cooperating with the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) set up by the UN [3] For general information on SAPARD, we refer to the website of DG Agriculture http://europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/external/enlarge/index_en.htm [4] For general information on ISPA, we refer to the website of DG Regional policy http://europa.eu.int/comm/regional_policy/funds/ispa/ispa_en.htm [5] Poland was granted EDIS accreditation in January 2005.
