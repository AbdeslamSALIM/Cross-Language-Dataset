The appellant claims that the Court should: - whilst upholding the submissions made at first instance, partially set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 15 June 2005 in Joined Cases T-71/03, T-74/03, T-87/03 and T-91/03, [1] in so far as it dismissed the action in Case T-91/03 brought against the Commission's decision C(2002) 5083 final, of 17 December 2002 relating to a proceeding under Article 81 EC; - in the alternative, reduce the fine imposed on the appellant in Article 3 of the decision of 17 December 2002 and further reduce the amount of the interest payable pending judgment and the default interest laid down in the operative part of the judgment under appeal, as appropriate; - order the respondent to pay the entire costs of the proceedings.
No justification was given for increasing the amount of the fine by 35 % as a result of the allegation that the appellant was the sole ringleader, since the indisputable facts and the Court of First Instance's own contradictory findings do not provide a basis for so doing.
