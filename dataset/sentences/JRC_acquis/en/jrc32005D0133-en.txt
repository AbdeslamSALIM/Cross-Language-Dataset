The definitive Regulation amended definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 [3], as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1515/2002 [4] and repealed the possibility of exemption from the duties as provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 ("original measures").
Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable. (4) The definitive Regulation takes account mainly of the situation between October 2001 and September 2002, i.e.
Consequently, and because of the special circumstances regarding, inter alia, the non-application of the measures on imports from Russia and Romania, it is considered that the duty levels of 23 % and 38,5 % established in the original investigation for Croatia and Ukraine respectively would be sufficient to eliminate injurious dumping. (7) The Commission also notes that the current temporary change in market conditions does not warrant a complete suspension of measures applicable against Croatia and Ukraine.
