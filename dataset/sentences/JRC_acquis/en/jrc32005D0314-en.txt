DETAILED DESCRIPTION A.
CMR was founded on 20 June 2002 to take over the assets of the bankrupt ship repair yard Compagnie Marseillaise de Réparations (CMdR). (8) Previously, ship repair activities in the port of Marseille had been carried out by three undertakings: Marine Technologie, Travofer and CMdR.
These yards employed some 430 people in 1996 (310 at CMdR, 70 at Marine Technologie and 50 at Travofer).
At the same time, Cammell Laird also took over the other two Marseille ship repair yards, Marine Technologie and Travofer.
On 31 July 2001, the commercial court of Marseille opened bankruptcy proceedings in respect of CMdR. (12) CMR, a company set up on 20 June 2002, placed its takeover bid for CMdR at the commercial court of Marseille, which accepted the sale plan on 20 June 2002. (13) Thus, in the context of the CMdR bankruptcy proceedings, CMR bought CMdR’s assets for a price of EUR 1001 (consisting of one symbolic euro for the assets and EUR 1000 for stocks).
The information shown on CMR’s balance sheet indicates that CMR started its operation in 2002 without debts. (14) France initially indicated that CMR also took over the work in progress. (15) Moreover, in compliance with French social security legislation on the sale of business activities (Article L 122-12, paragraph 2 of the Labour Code), CMR was obliged to take over all the labour contracts with unchanged conditions regarding skills, pay and seniority.
The estimate of the company’s operation changed accordingly and Table 1 below reproduces these new estimates. (in euro) | Operation | 2002(6 months) | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | Turnover | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Operating costs | | | | | | Purchases of goods | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Purchases from subcontracting | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Other purchases and external costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Salaries and wages | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Paid holidays | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | "Asbestos departures" | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total personnel costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | External assistance | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total personnel charges and assistance | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Taxes | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Total operating costs | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Operating result | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Subsidy | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | Net operating result | […] | […] | […] | […] | […] | (23) According to France, the business plan is based on the turnovers generated by the ship repair companies in Marseille before the Cammell Laird group experienced difficulties in 2000 and on the capacity of CMR to achieve similar levels within two years.
These costs are outlined in Part 2 of Table 2 below, taking into account reviewed figures provided by France in its letter of 29 January 2004. (in euro) | Item | Amount | Investment in restructuring and maintenance (2002 to 2006):Initial | […] (*) | Annual (4 × EUR 100000) | […] (*) | Inventories | […] (*) | Training needs: 200 man/hours | […] (*) | Subtotal 1 | […] (*) | Costs for "asbestos departures" incurred before the takeover | […] (*) | Paid leave due before the takeover | […] (*) | Subtotal 2 | […] (*) | | Total (Subtotal 1 + Subtotal 2) | 3649494 | (26) The total costs deemed necessary to launch CMR are thus EUR 3649494.
The financial measures (27) According to France, the EUR 3649494 required by CMR is to be financed by loans and grants provided from public and private sources as outlined in Table 3 below.
France adopted a preliminary decision to grant public support to CMR on 3 May 2002, i.e.
A legally binding decision to grant the support was issued on 26 June 2002. (in euro) | Source | Amount | French central government | 1600000 | Conseil régional of Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur | 630000 | Conseil général of Bouches-du-Rhône | 630000 | City of Marseille | 630000 | Subtotal 1 | 3490000 | Shareholders’ capital contribution | 610000 | Bank loans | 1830000 | Subtotal 2 | 2440000 | | Total (Subtotal 1 + Subtotal 2) | 5930000 | (28) (The French central government will provide CMR with EUR 1600000 in the form of an interest-free loan.
France attributed to the loan a net grant equivalent (NGE) of EUR 404640, which is based on the Commission’s reference rate for 2002, i.e. 5,06 %.
In September 2003, an amount of EUR 800000 was paid to CMR. (in euro) | Amount | Year of payment | Year of repayment | 533333 | n | n+6 | 266667 | n | n+7 | 400000 | n+1 | n+7 | 400000 | n+2 | n+7 | (29) The Conseil régional of Provence Alpes-Côte d’Azur, the Conseil général of Bouches-du-Rhône and the City of Marseille will provide CMR with EUR 630000 in the form of a grant.
France states that maintaining three ship repair companies in Marseille (Marine Technologie, Travofer and CMdR) until 2000 when they were taken over by Cammell Laird exceeded the capacity of the market.
France argues, however, that the existence of a single ship repair company in Marseille is in line with market requirements. (32) As regards CMR’s workforce, CMR had 100 production workers in March 2003, compared with an average of 184 in the five preceding years.
The decision to initiate proceedings under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty (34) In the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure (hereinafter referred to as the decision to initiate proceedings), the Commission took the view that the measures constituted state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.
Consequently, the Commission also doubted whether the business plan for CMR was suitable for restoring CMR’s viability within a reasonable timescale. (38) In addition, the Commission doubted whether the capacity reductions required by Article 5 of the Shipbuilding Regulation would take place.
The financial sources thus exceeded the claimed restructuring needs. (40) In the context of proportionality, the decision to initiate proceedings raised the issue of determination of the net grant equivalent of the loan granted to CMR by the state, noting that, in conformity with the Commission notice on the method for setting the reference and discount rates [9], the reference rate may be increased in situations involving a particular risk (for example, a company in difficulty) and, in such cases, the premium may amount to 400 basic points or more.
The Commission therefore doubted whether the totality of the loan could be considered to be aid. (41) Also in the context of proportionality, the Commission doubted whether all the costs could be admitted as restructuring costs, citing in particular the costs relating to the training of employees of CMR’s subcontractors.
COMMENTS FROM FRANCE (42) In its reply to the decision to initiate proceedings and in the supplementary information which it subsequently provided, France submitted the following information and comments. (43) As regards the doubts as to whether CMR was a firm eligible for restructuring aid, France argued that despite the fact that CMR was a new company, it still faced difficulties.
However, the attempt to stabilise the situation in CMdR was not successful and, due to a decrease in its assets and a lack of orders, CMdR eventually filed for bankruptcy on 31 July 2001.
CMR would resume the ship repair activity abandoned by CMdR in favour of ship conversion.
Also CMR envisaged introducing annualisation of the working schedule within the framework of the regulation limiting weekly working hours to 35 hours and harmonising differences in staff status.
These measures, in addition to the measures notified initially, would, according to France, ensure the viability of CMR within a reasonable timescale. (47) France also stated that the viability of the plan was ensured by realistic market hypotheses based on the actual operations of the ship repair companies in Marseille prior to their integration into Cammell Laird.
Lastly, France observed that CMR’s operating results in 2002 and in the first half of 2003 proved that the company would probably become viable as from 2003, as anticipated in the restructuring plan. (48) As to the need to ensure that competition would not be distorted, France argued that the reduction of ship repair capacities was ensured by the closing of the other two ship repair sites in Marseille (Marine Technologie and Travofer). (49) Moreover, France argued in this context that ship repair yards in the northern Mediterranean were if anything complementary and not in real competition. (50) France further confirmed that CMR was an SME within the meaning of Article 2(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises [10] (hereinafter referred to as the SME Regulation). (51) Lastly, France stated that 132 CMR employees had been taken over by CMR and that a total number of 58 workers were due to leave in the period 2002 to 2004 for reasons related to asbestos exposure. (52) As to the proportionality of the financial measures in question, France stated that the amount of EUR 5930000 in public and private contributions covered, on the one hand, restructuring costs (EUR 3649494) and, on the other, part of the company’s working capital requirements over and above restructuring requirements. (53) France explained that it considered the costs of training of subcontractors to be part of restructuring costs.
State aid (55) According to Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, insofar as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market. (56) Firstly, the loan of EUR 1600000 given to CMR by the French government constitutes a financial advantage made available from state resources.
Furthermore, because of its geographical position, CMR is, at least potentially, in competition with ship repair yards in Italy and Spain. (60) The Commission thus concludes that the public contributions to CMR as outlined in Part 1 of Table 3 all constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. (61) The Commission also notes that France failed to comply with its obligation under Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty not to put its proposed measures into effect until the Commission proceedings had resulted in a final decision (stand-still clause).
Derogation under Article 87 of the EC Treaty (62) Since CMR engages in ship repair, aid granted to support its activities falls within the scope of the special rules on state aid applicable to shipbuilding.
Since 1 January 2004, these rules have been enshrined in the Framework on state aid to shipbuilding [11], which replaced the Shipbuilding Regulation.
Furthermore, the Commission is authorising part of the aid as regional investment aid and is accordingly taking account of the regional concerns involved. (65) Furthermore, the Shipbuilding Regulation constitutes a specific and exhaustive set of rules applicable to the sector, including ship repair, and stands as a lex specialis in relation to the Treaty.
Authorising the aid through direct application of the Treaty would thwart the objectives pursued by establishing specific restrictive rules applicable to the sector. (66) The Commission cannot, therefore, assess the aid directly on the basis of the Treaty. (67) Article 2 of the Shipbuilding Regulation stipulates that aid granted for ship repair may be considered compatible with the common market only if it complies with the provisions of the Regulation. 1.
While no precise Community definition exists, the Commission regards a firm as being in difficulty where it is unable, whether through its own resources or with the funds it is able to obtain from its owners/shareholders or creditors, to stem losses which, without outside intervention by the public authorities, will almost certainly condemn it to go out of business in the short or medium term (point 4 of the Restructuring Guidelines).
These difficulties are manifested for instance by increasing losses, diminishing turnover, growing stock inventories, excess capacity, declining cash flow, mounting debt, rising interest charges and falling or nil net asset value. (71) However, point 7 of the Restructuring Guidelines stipulates that a newly created firm is not eligible for restructuring aid, even if its initial position is insecure.
This is the case, for instance, where a new firm emerges from the liquidation of a previous firm or merely takes over such firm’s assets. (72) The reason for excluding new firms from the eligibility for restructuring aid is based on the assumption that the creation of a company should be a decision reflecting the situation on the market in question.
Therefore, a company should be created only if it has a chance of operating on that market, in other words, if it is capitalised and viable ab initio. (73) A new company is not eligible for restructuring aid because, although it might well face start-up difficulties, it cannot encounter difficulties such as those described in the Restructuring Guidelines.
The new company in such cases does not in principle take over the debts of its predecessor and thus does not suffer from the difficulties described in the Restructuring Guidelines. (76) In the decision to initiate proceedings, the Commission had doubts whether CMR was eligible for restructuring aid, as it appeared to be a newly created company. (77) The Commission notes in this respect, and France acknowledges, that CMR is a new legal entity with a legal personality distinct from CMdR. (78) The Commission also takes the view that CMR is a new economic entity that is distinct from CMdR.
However, France also notes that the existence of a single ship repair company in Marseille is in line with the needs of the market.
The legally binding decision to grant it aid was issued on 26 June 2002, i.e.
The Commission’s conclusions here would apply in the hypothesis that CMR was not a new company, but a company in financial difficulties and therefore eligible for restructuring aid. (90) For the sake of completeness, the Commission notes that the measures cannot be deemed to be rescue aid.
Pursuant to point 7 of the Restructuring Guidelines, new firms are not eligible for rescue aid.
Consequently, as a new firm that is not in difficulty within the meaning of the Restructuring Guidelines, CMR is not eligible for this type of aid. 1.2.
The Commission therefore doubted whether CMR was suffering from such difficulties and whether the business plan was suitable to restore its viability. (93) France explained that CMR’s difficulties were due to the commercial policy of Cammell Laird, which had attempted to switch ship repair companies in Marseille to ship conversion.
Finally, the level of capacity reduction is to be determined on the basis of the level of actual production in the five years preceding the restructuring. (98) First, as regards France’s argument that the capacity reduction will be achieved by the closure of the other two ship repair yards in Marseille (Marine Technologie and Travofer), the Commission concludes that, in accordance with Article 5(2) of the Shipbuilding Regulation, such closure is irrelevant since it concerns undertakings other than the beneficiary, unless capacity reduction would undermine the restructuring plan. (99) In the case at hand, Marine Technologie and Travofer are entities that are legally distinct from CMR and their closure resulted from an event that was independent of CMR, namely the bankruptcy of their parent company Cammell Laird.
Furthermore, France has not claimed that a capacity reduction would undermine the business plan of CMR. (100) The Commission therefore does not accept this argument as evidence of a capacity reduction at CMR. (101) Second, several other factors were raised which might be of relevance in deciding on the avoidance of undue distortions of competition (see paragraphs 48 to 51 above). (102) The Commission observes at the outset that the Restructuring Guidelines in principle exempt SMEs from the requirement that aid recipients must mitigate any adverse effects of the aid on competitors, except where otherwise provided by rules on state aid in a particular sector.
Such rules do exist here and are enshrined in the Shipbuilding Regulation, which does not provide for any such exemption for SMEs. (103) Similarly, the fact that other ship repairers in the region are not in competition with CMR is not decisive.
The Shipbuilding Regulation presumes that restructuring aid in this sector has an impact on competition and does not allow for any flexibility in the light of specific market conditions, in contrast to point 36 of the Restructuring Guidelines.
Ship repair, as another sensitive sector, is subject to the same rules and principles as shipbuilding, for the same reasons of overcapacity. (104) Finally, the Commission notes that the workforce at CMdR in 1996, when its difficulties started, was 310 persons.
At the time of the takeover of CMdR’s assets by CMR, there were 132 persons.
It is clear, however, that at least some of these workers will be replaced (30, as indicated in the letter of 6 March 2003). (106) On the basis of this information, the Commission’s doubts as to whether CMR undertook a genuine and irreversible reduction of its capacities commensurate to the aid granted have not been allayed.
Therefore, even if CMR were eligible for aid as a company in difficulty, the aid would not have been compatible with the Shipbuilding Regulation. 1.4.
France replied that the amount of EUR 5930000 in public and private contributions covered, on the one hand, the costs of restructuring (EUR 3649494) and, on the other, part of the working capital requirements over and above the requirements related to restructuring. (109) In this context, the Commission raised the issue of determination of the net grant equivalent of the loan granted to CMR.
No private borrower would provide CMR with a loan under the conditions in question, i.e.
The contribution of the beneficiary is thus not significant, contrary to the requirement stipulated by the Restructuring Guidelines. (111) The Commission concludes that even if CMR were a company in financial difficulties eligible for restructuring aid, the proportionality requirement would not have been met and therefore the aid would not have been compatible with the Restructuring Guidelines. 1.5.
The 1994 Restructuring Guidelines (112) In the decision initiating proceedings, the Commission assessed the measures under the Restructuring Guidelines adopted in 1999.
It should be noted that Article 5 the Shipbuilding Regulation makes reference to the 1994 Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty [16] (hereinafter referred to as the 1994 Restructuring Guidelines) which were replaced in 1999 by new Restructuring Guidelines.
Regional investment aid (114) The conditions governing the compatibility of regional investment aid with the common market are laid down in Article 7 of the Shipbuilding Regulation.
First, the measures must concern a region referred to in Article 87(3)(a) or Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty.
Eligible expenditure may also include certain categories of intangible investment (point 4.6 of the Regional Guidelines). (117) In its letter of 29 June 2004, France described the investment at CMR eligible for regional aid as being inventories, investment in equipment and building.
The Commission describes in Table 5 the expenditure it considers eligible for aid for initial investment. (in euro) | Item | Amount | 1.Investment in equipment, comprising: | 420108 | 2.Transport material/vehicles | 162500 | 3.Computer equipment | 35600 | 4.Various other equipment and installation | 222008 | 5.Building | 1000 | Total | 421108 | (118) The Commission accepts that this investment contributes to achieving the goals of CMR’s business plan as described in paragraph 20, and thus to upgrading and modernising the yard with the objective of improving its productivity.
The investment also corresponds to a uniform set of items of expenditure: investment in buildings (item 5 of Table 5) and investment in plant/machinery (items 1 to 4 of Table 5). (119) In conclusion, the total expenditure eligible for regional investment aid amounts to EUR 421108 (EUR 401152 in discounted value, base year 2002, discount rate 5,06 %). (120) The maximum allowable aid intensity is 12,5 % net (corresponding in this case to 18,9 % gross [21]).
The aid was granted after the entry into force of Commission Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to training aid [22] (hereinafter referred to as the Training Aid Regulation). (123) The Training Aid Regulation was adopted by the Commission, which was empowered to do so by Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal state aid [23].
The Commission notes that Article 2 of the Training Aid Regulation defines specific training as training involving tuition directly and principally applicable to the employee’s present or future position in the assisted firm, i.e.
The Commission considers the latter expenditure to be eligible for training aid. (127) According to Article 4 of the Training Aid Regulation, aid intensity must not exceed 40 % for small and medium-sized enterprises, in areas qualifying for regional aid pursuant to Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty and for projects involving specific training. (128) Consequently, the total amount of training aid amounts to EUR 102400. (129) The Commission concludes that the aid for CMR can be partially approved as training aid in the amount of EUR 102400.
CONCLUSION (130) The Commission concludes that France has unlawfully implemented aid amounting to EUR 3490000 in breach of Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty.
However, the Commission finds that the aid is in part compatible with the common market as aid for initial investment pursuant to Article 7 of the Shipbuilding Regulation and as training aid pursuant to the Training Aid Regulation.
France shall take all necessary measures to recover from the beneficiary the aid referred to in Article 1(c) and unlawfully made available to the beneficiary.
Such aid amounts to EUR 3311863. 2.
Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions laid down in Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 [24].
The interest rate will be applied on a compound basis throughout the entire period referred to in paragraph 3. 5.
Article 3 France shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures planned and already taken to comply with it.
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.
