Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, 2005-2009 /* SEC/2006/0227 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 22.2.2006 SEC(2006) 227 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, 2005-2009 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Background The Stability and Growth Pact, which entered into force on 1 July 1998, is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
The first convergence programme of Cyprus was submitted in May 2004.
The programme broadly follows the model structure for stability and convergence programmes specified in the code of conduct[4]. 2.
On 5 July 2004, the Council decided that Cyprus was in excessive deficit.
In its opinion of 8 March 2005 on the previous update of the convergence programme, covering the period 2004-2008, the Council invited Cyprus to implement with vigour the measures envisaged to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2005, ensure that the debt ratio started to decline by then, and pursue pension and health reforms. 3.
This was largely matched by the borrowing needs of the public sector, which posted a deficit above 4% of GDP in 2004.
This is plausible until 2007, but slightly favourable in 2008 and 2009.
The external deficit is projected to steadily decrease, from 5⅓% of GDP in 2006 to 2¾% in 2009. 5.
Since ERM II entry on 2 May 2005, the CYP/EUR exchange rate has stayed close to the central rate.
Government bond yields decreased in the course of 2005, falling below 4% at the beginning of 2006.
The spread vis-à-vis euro area yields has narrowed to less than 100 basis points.
Cyprus aims at achieving euro area membership on 1 January 2008. 6.
The current update estimates the 2005 deficit outcome at 2½% of GDP, compared with 2¾% of GDP in the Commission services’ autumn 2005 forecast and just below 3% in the previous update.
The difference with the previous update mainly reflects about 0.5% of GDP better than expected interest expenditure. 7.
Building on the deficit reduction to below 3% of GDP in 2005, the update aims at further consolidating public finances until 2009, when the deficit would approach 0.5% of GDP and the gross debt 53½% of GDP.
After reaching 0.75% of GDP in 2005, the primary surplus is projected to rise gradually to 1¾% of GDP in 2009.
The narrowing of the deficit reflects a cut in the expenditure ratio by around 4% of GDP that is less than fully compensated by a decline in the revenue ratio (by 2%).
The more gradual adjustment over the period 2006-2008 compared to the previous programme reflects slightly lower GDP growth. 8.
The lack of improvement in the structural balance in 2007 reflects the anticipated deterioration of Cyprus' net position vis-à-vis the EU budget, as temporary compensating grants associated with accession to the EU are terminated in 2006.
The update clearly identifies its medium-term objective (MTO) as a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP, and targets to achieve it in 2009.
The risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced.
Moreover, the macro outlook in 2008 and 2009 is slightly optimistic and tax projections seem somewhat favourable.
Taking account of the estimated outcome for 2005 and of the balance of risks to the budgetary targets, the budgetary stance in the programme seems consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005, in line with the Council recommendation under Article 104(7).
The pace of adjustment towards the programme’s MTO implied by the programme is broadly in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. 11.
Government debt is estimated to have been 70½% of GDP in 2005, above the 60% of GDP reference value.
The update projects a steady decline in the debt ratio, to 53½% in 2009, as a result of rising primary balances, high nominal GDP growth, and, from 2006, debt-reducing stock flow adjustments (decumulation of sinking funds).
The debt ratio seems to be on a sufficiently diminishing path. 12.
Implementing rigorously the planned consolidation of public finances over the medium term will alleviate the risks to long-term sustainability and, as recognized in the programme, substantial pension and healthcare reform measures will also be necessary to contain the projected high increase in age-related expenditure in the period up to 2050 and to reduce the risk to long-term sustainability. 13.
The envisaged measures in the area of public finances are broadly consistent with the broad economic policy guidelines included in the integrated guidelines for the period 2005-2008.
The National Reform Programme of Cyprus, submitted on 11 November 2005 in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, identifies the following challenges with significant implications for public finances (i) promoting R%amp%D and innovation and facilitation of ICT diffusion; (ii) upgrading of basic infrastructures; (iii) enhancing human capital development and (iv) social cohesion.
On 5 July 2004, the Council decided that Cyprus was in excessive deficit.
In its opinion of 8 March 2005 on the previous update of the convergence programme, covering the period 2004-2008, the Council invited Cyprus to implement with vigour the measures envisaged to bring the deficit below 3% of GDP by 2005, ensure that the debt ratio started to decline by then, and pursue pension and health reforms. 18.
The current update estimates the 2005 deficit outcome at 2½% of GDP, compared with 2¾% of GDP in the Commission services’ autumn 2005 forecast and just below 3% in the previous update.
The difference with the update mainly reflects a 0.5% of GDP better than expected interest expenditure. 19.
The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth just above 4% over the period 2005-2009.
Building on the deficit reduction to below 3% of GDP in 2005, the update aims at further consolidating public finances until 2009, when the deficit would approach 0.5% of GDP.
After reaching 0.75% of GDP in 2005, the primary surplus is projected to rise gradually to 1¾% of GDP in 2009.
The narrowing of the deficit reflects a cut in the expenditure ratio by around 4% of GDP that is less than fully compensated by a decline in the revenue ratio (by 2%).
the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and other temporary measures) calculated according to the commonly agreed methodology is planned to improve on average by more than 0.5% of GDP per year, from a deficit of around 3% of GDP in 2005 to about 0.5% in 2009.
The lack of improvement in the structural balance in 2007 reflects the anticipated deterioration of Cyprus' net position vis-à-vis the EU budget, as temporary compensating grants associated with accession to the EU are terminated in 2006.
The programme sets the medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position at a structural deficit of 0.5% of GDP and aims to achieve this position by 2009.
The risks to the budgetary projections in the programme appear broadly balanced.
Moreover, the macro outlook in 2008 and 2009 is slightly optimistic and tax projections seem somewhat favourable.
In the years following the correction of the excessive deficit, the pace of adjustment towards the programme’s MTO implied by the programme is broadly in line with the Stability and Growth Pact, which specifies that, for euro area and ERM II Member States, the annual improvement in the structural balance should be 0.5% of GDP as a benchmark and that the adjustment should be higher in good economic times and could be lower in bad times. 25.
The debt ratio is estimated to have reached 70.5% of GDP in 2005, above the 60% of GDP Treaty reference value.
Implementing rigorously the planned consolidation of public finances over the medium term will alleviate the risks to long-term sustainability and, as recognized in the programme, substantial pension and health care reform measures will also be necessary to contain the projected high increase in age-related expenditure in the period up to 2050 and to reduce the risk to long-term sustainability. 27.
The envisaged measures in the area of public finances are broadly consistent with the broad economic policy guidelines included in the integrated guidelines for the period 2005-2008.
In particular, Cyprus is on track to correct its excessive deficit by the deadline set by the Council and does the necessary to achieve its MTO, while the debt ratio is on a declining path from 2005 onwards. 28.
The National Reform Programme of Cyprus, submitted on 11 November 2005 in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, identifies the following challenges with significant implications for public finances: (i) promoting R%amp%D and innovation and facilitation of ICT diffusion; (ii) upgrading of basic infrastructures; (iii) enhancing human capital development and (iv) social cohesion.
