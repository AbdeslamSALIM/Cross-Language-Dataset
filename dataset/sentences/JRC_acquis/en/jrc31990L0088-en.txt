ANNEX 'ANNEX II THE BASIC EQUATION EXPRESSING THE EQUIVALENCE OF LOANS ON THE ONE HAND, AND REPAYMENTS AND CHARGES ON THE OTHER: 1.2.3.4.5.6 // // K = m K = 1 // AK (1 + i) tK // = // K' = m' K' = 1 // A'K' (1 + i) tK' Meaning of letters and symbols: 1.2 // K // is the number of a loan // K' // is the number of a repayment or a payment of charges // AK // is the amount of loan number K // A'K' // is the amount of repayment number K // // represents a sum // m // is the number of the last loan // m' // is the number of the last repayment or payment of charges // tK // is the interval, expressed in years and fractions of a year, between the date of loan No 1 and those of subsequent loans Nos 2 to m // tK' // is the interval expressed in years and fractions of a year between the date of loan No 1 and those of repayments or payments of charges Nos 1 to m // i // is the percentage rate that can be calculated (either by algebra, by successive approximations, or by a computer programme) where the other terms in the equation are known from the contract or otherwise.
e. 1,5 years, after the date of the loan. 1.2 // The equation becomes 1 000 = // 1 200 (1+i) 1,5 1.2.3 // or // (1+i) 1,5 // = 1,2 // // 1+i // = 1,129243 . . . // // i // = 0,129243 . . .
Second example The sum agreed is S = ECU 1 000 but the creditor retains ECU 50 for enquiry and administrative expenses, so that the loan is in fact ECU 950; the repayment of ECU 1 200, as in the first example, is made 18 months after the date of the loan. 1.2 // The equation becomes 950 = // 1 200 (1+i) 1,5 1.2.3.4.5.6 // // or // (1+i) 1,5 // = // 1 200 950 // = 1,263157 . . . 1.2.3.4.5,6 // // // 1+i // = // 1,16851 . . . // // // i // = // 0,16851 . . .
rounded off to 16,9 % or 16,85 %.
Third example The sum lent is ECU 1 000, repayable in two amounts each of ECU 600, paid after one and two years respectively. 1.2.3.4 // The equation becomes 1 000 = // 600 1+i // + // 600 (1+i) 2; it is solved by algebra and produces i = 0,1306623, rounded off to 13,1 % or 13,07 %.
Fourth example The sum lent is ECU 1 000 and the amounts to be paid by the borrower are: 1.2.3 // After three months // (0,25 years) // ECU 272 // After six months // (0,50 years) // ECU 272 // After twelve months // (1 year) // ECU 544 // Total // // ECU 1 088 The equation becomes: 1.2.3.4.5.6 // 1 000 = // 272 (1+i) 0,25 // + // 272 (1+o) 0,50 // + // 544 1+i This equation allows i to be calculated by successive approximations, which can be programmed on a ocket computer.
The result is: i = 0,1321 rounded off 13,2 or 13,21 %.'
