In addition, the protected zone in respect of that organism should also be restricted to the Isle of Man and Jersey. (5) From information supplied by Estonia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl.
Estonia may therefore be recognised as a protected zone for that organism. (6) From information supplied by Italy and from additional information collected by the Food and Veterinary Office during a mission in Italy in May 2004, it appears that Citrus tristeza virus is now established in that Member State.
Italy should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Citrus tristeza virus. (7) From the Swiss legislation on plant protection, it appears that the Canton of Ticino is no longer recognised as a protected zone for Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl.
Accordingly, that Annex should be amended. (9) In order to enhance the phytosanitary protection of the Community seeds of Medicago sativa L.
and the Community certified seeds of Helianthus annuus L., Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L.) Karsten ex Farw.
They shall apply those provisions from 15 May 2005.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
