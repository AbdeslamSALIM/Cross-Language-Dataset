Pending the completion of the procedure necessary for its entry into force an Interim Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia covering trade and trade-related provisions was concluded and entered into force on 1 June 2001. (2) The Council is in the process of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia of the other part, which was signed on 29 October 2001.
Within the Additional Protocols on wine, individual tariff quotas have been provided out of the global tariff quota of 545000 hl opened within Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, for imports into the Community of wine originating in the Republic of Croatia (45000 hl), in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (300000 hl) and in the Republic of Slovenia (48000 hl). (7) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 in order to deduct the volumes of the individual tariff quotas from the volume of the global tariff quota and to specify the conditions for the access to the remaining volume of the global tariff quota.
In particular, the yearly increase of the volumes of these individual tariff quotas is subject to using up a minimum volume of 80 % of the individual tariff quotas opened within the previous year.
Therefore, the Commission should review the volumes used each year and should adopt provisions to implement any necessary adjustment of these volumes for Croatia and Slovenia, and accordingly, of the global tariff quota applicable under order No 09.1515. (9) An Agreement on trade in textile products with Bosnia and Herzegovina which had applied provisionally since 1 March 2001 was signed on 27 June 2001.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
It shall apply from 1 January 2002.
Done at Brussels, 18 December 2001.
