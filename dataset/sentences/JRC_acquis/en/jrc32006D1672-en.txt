Such objectives were agreed by the Nice European Council of 7, 8 and 9 December 2000.
Article 13 of the Treaty provides for action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.
Non-discrimination is also enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
In accordance with the principle of equality between men and women, gender mainstreaming should be promoted in all sections and activities of the Programme. (11) Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) active at various levels can make an important contribution at European level through key networks which assist in changing policy orientations relating to the general objectives of the Programme. (12) Since the objectives of this Decision cannot be sufficiently achieved at Member States level because of the need for exchange of information at European level and the Community-wide dissemination of good practice and since therefore these objectives can, by reason of the multilateral dimension of the Community actions and measures, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
The Programme shall run from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
