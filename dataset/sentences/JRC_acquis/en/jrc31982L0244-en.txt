Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
It shall remain between - 0 75 and - 2 75 % without manual adjustment.
Initial adjustment shall be between - 1 and - 1 75 % in the %quot%unladen vehicle%quot% state with one person in the driving seat.
The initial adjustments for each type of vehicle must be specified by the manufacturer and must be indicated in a clearly legible and indelible manner on each vehicle close to either the headlamp or the manufacturer's plate by the symbol shown in Appendix 6.%quot% Item 4.2.6.2.2 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.2.6.2.2.
Width The edge of the illuminating surface furthest from the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle must not be more than 400 mm from the extreme outer edge of the vehicle.
The distance between the inner edges of the two illuminating surfaces shall not be less than 600 mm.
Other requirements The light shall be a flashing light, flashing 90 ± 30 times per minute.
For front direction indicator lamps, the illuminating surface must be not less than 40 mm from the illuminating surface of the dipped-beam headlamps or front fog lamps if any.
A smaller distance is permitted if the luminous intensity in the reference axis of the direction indicator lamp is not less than 400 cd.%quot% Item 4.7.8 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.7.8.
Tell-tale Circuit-closed tell-tale mandatory.
Tell-tale Circuit-closed tell-tale mandatory.
Tell-tale Circuit-closed tell-tale mandatory.
Other requirements In all cases, the distance between the rear fog lamp and each stop lamp must be greater than 100 mm.%quot% Item 4.12.10 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.12.10.
The parking lamp(s) must be able to function even if the device which starts and/or stops the engine is in a position which makes it impossible for the engine to operate.%quot% Item 4.12.11 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.12.11.
Length At rear of vehicle.%quot% Item 4.15.4.3 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.15.4.3.
Length At rear of vehicle.%quot% Item 4.16.4.3 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.16.4.3.
Length At front of vehicle.%quot% Item 4.16.5 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.16.5.
The vertical angle below the horizontal may be reduced to 5º in the case of a reflex reflector, less than 750 mm above the ground.%quot% Item 4.17.4.3 is hereby amended as follows: %quot%4.17.4.3.
The distance between two adjacent reflex reflectors shall not exceed 3 m.
The distance between the rearmost reflex reflector and the rear of the vehicle shall not exceed 1 m.
Headlamp centres of reference shall be at a distance l from the screen of at least 10 m. 3.2.
Measurements shall be carried out on a vehicle which has travelled a distance of between 1 000 and 10 000 km, preferably 5 000 km. 4.2.
Full fuel replenishment means that the fuel tank must be filled to not less than 90 % of its capacity as indicated in the information document, a model of which appears in Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC. 4.3.
If none of the three measured results differs by more than 2 mrad (0 72 % inclination) from the arithmetic mean of the results, that mean shall constitute the final result. 5.2.2.
If the treatment method for category M1 vehicles described in Item 5.4.1 is not possible, the method described in Item 5.4.2.2 or 5.4.2.3 may be used. 5.4.2.2.
If the result(s) of any measurement(s) does (do) not lie within the tolerance indicated in Item 5.5.1 or exceed(s) the limit values, a further three measurements shall be made in the loading conditions corresponding to this (these) result(s) as specified in Item 5.5.3. 5.5.3.
If none of the three measured results differs by more than 2 mrad (0 72 % inclination) from the arithmetic mean of the results, that mean shall constitute the final result. 5.5.3.2.
If any measurement differs from the arithmetic mean of the results by more than 2 mrad (0 72 % inclination), a further series of ten measurements shall be made, the arithmetic mean of which shall constitute the final result. 5.5.3.3.
Requirements have been met, if, under all loading conditions, the variation between the measured initial inclination determined in accordance with Item 5.2 and the inclination measured under each loading condition is less than the values calculated in Item 5.5.1 (without safety margin). 5.5.5.
The %quot%0%quot% position corresponds to the initial alignment according to Item 4.2.6.1 of Annex I. 1.3.
