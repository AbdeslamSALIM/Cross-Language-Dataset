2005/152/EC: Commission Decision of 14 December 1999 pursuant to Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 imposing fines on an undertaking for supplying incorrect and misleading information in a notification in merger control proceedings (Case No COMP/M.1608 %mdash% KLM/Martinair III) (notified under document number C(1999) 4496) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 14 December 1999 pursuant to Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 imposing fines on an undertaking for supplying incorrect and misleading information in a notification in merger control proceedings (Case No COMP/M.1608 — KLM/Martinair III) (notified under document number C(1999) 4496) (Only the English text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2005/152/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between undertakings [1], and in particular Article 14(1)(b) thereof, Having given the undertakings concerned the opportunity to make known their views on the objections raised by the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Concentrations, Whereas: I.
INTRODUCTION (1) Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij NV (KLM) is the leading Dutch international airline, based at Amsterdam Schiphol airport.
The notification was withdrawn on 22 September 1998 [3] after the Commission informed KLM orally of its intention to declare the notification incomplete.
On 21 December 1998 KLM notified the operation again [4].
On 1 February 1999 the Commission decided to initiate proceedings in application of Article 6(1)(c) of the Merger Regulation [5], and on 19 March 1999 the Commission issued a statement of objections against the planned operation.
On 31 May 1999 KLM informed the Commission that it had abandoned the operation.
THE LANGUAGE OF PROCEEDINGS IN THIS CASE (4) On 25 June 1999 the Commission sent a statement of objections to KLM setting out its preliminary view that the notification of 1 September 1998 contained incorrect or misleading information (save as otherwise specified, references in this Decision to "the notification" are to the notification of 1 September 1998).
The Commission interprets this provision as referring to all proceedings under the Merger Regulation which relate to the notified operation and not just those proceedings leading to substantive decisions on the concentration itself, such as a decision under Article 6 or Article 8.
In relation to a notification under Article 4 of the Merger Regulation a number of proceedings are possible, such as the proceedings leading to decisions under Article 11(5) and Article 13(2), proceedings under Article 14(1)(b), (c) or (d) and Article 14(2)(a), (b), or (c), proceedings leading to decisions to revoke a decision under Article 6(3) or Article 8(5) or proceedings on issues relating to access to files.
Therefore, all Martinair destinations are also served by Transavia, which means that in reality there is a complete overlap between Transavia and Martinair destinations. (11) Moreover, the missing destinations include several of the most important ones for holiday customers and for Transavia and Martinair.
Information on scheduled services of Transavia to Mediterranean destinations (a) information given in the notification (12) Nowhere in the notification did KLM state that Transavia has substantial scheduled operations to Mediterranean holiday destinations and that it sells seats on these flights to package tour operators. (13) Section 6 of the notification is entitled "Market definitions".
Under the heading "I.
The description is then given on pages 26 to 41 of the notification without any further headings. (14) The product market is defined as follows: "KLM (primarily through Transavia) [14] and Martinair are both active in the product market that can be defined as the market for transport by plane at the request of tour operators, for inclusion in an organised foreign holiday package including accommodation to countries around the Mediterranean." [15]. (15) The notification refers to this market as the "charter market" which can be distinguished from markets concerning scheduled air transport.
Neither the map with Transavia destinations nor the timetable referred to in paragraph 10 were contained in the notified documents. (17) The only statement to the effect that Transavia is operating scheduled flights at all is made in the subsequent chapter on the description of the market for flights to North America: "B.
Western Europe (via Amsterdam) — United States /Canada markets".
KLM and Martinair have scheduled flights to various other destinations." [19]. (20) There is no statement in this chapter that Transavia is operating scheduled flights to Mediterranean destinations.
This latter statement has been confirmed by a letter from KLM of 4 March 1999 where it is shown that average gross prices of guaranteed seats sold to tour operators are almost identical on scheduled and non scheduled flights.
In the notification of December 1998 KLM stated: "Reality, however, is seldom black and white, the border line between scheduled and charter services is situated in a grey area.
From the information submitted it can be calculated that out of […] (*) [26] passengers transported by Transavia [27] on scheduled flights to Mediterranean destinations [28] in the season summer 1997 and in winter 1997/1998 altogether […] (*) [29] seats were sold to tour operators on a guaranteed basis and […] (*) seats were sold to tour operators on a non guaranteed basis [30].
From those tables it can be concluded that Transavia was serving in the period 1993-1997 airports other than those airports which are mentioned for the year 1998 in the table on page 40 of Form CO of the notification, including the 10 destinations referred to in paragraph 10. (27) The introduction to Form CO contains a section entitled "The need for correct and complete information" which states: "All information required by this form must be correct and complete.
The table contains no reference to the study cited by the parties or to any other source of information.
The only instance in this chapter where a reference to the study is made is on page 34 in the context of the definition of the geographic scope of the relevant market and in order to support the argument that the geographic market is Europe wide [32].
In this context KLM states: "KLM and Martinair adopt SH%amp%E's conclusion as their own for the purpose of this notification." [33]. (29) The SH%amp%E study refers to the years 1993 to 1997 and does not contain any information for the summer season 1998.
In response to the oral question whether Transavia scheduled flights are included in the market share data provided in the notification KLM gave the following written reply: "Such market shares are not included in the SH%amp%E analysis and, consequently, in KLM's notification.
The information provided in response to the Commission's request for information can not be added to the KLM Group's market share provided on p. 62 of the notification.
Including Transavia scheduled flights into the market base would necessarily lead to a substantial increase of the total market base, since scheduled flights by other carriers should then be included as well. …" [34]. (31) The information required by Form CO in relation to market definition is described in Section 6.
A relevant product market may in some cases be composed of a number of individual products and/or services which present largely identical physical or technical characteristics and are interchangeable." (32) In view of the fact that certain seats on Transavia's scheduled flights are sold to package tour operators at the same price and under the same economic condition (guaranteed) as seats on charter flights, these sales are considered by the Commission to form part of the same product market.
The fact that such a market definition would mean that seats sold on scheduled flights performed by other airlines might also have to be included into the relevant product market cannot serve to allow KLM to omit this information. (33) The Commission notes that KLM believed that seats sold to tour operators on scheduled Transavia flights did not form part of the same market as seats sold on charter flights.
However, even under that assumption those activities should have been mentioned in response to Question 6.2 of Form CO as activities in a "market closely related to the affected market" (so-called neighbouring markets).
LEGAL ASSESSMENT 1.
The reference on page 39 to services being complementary can not be understood as relating only to the size of the planes, given the context in which the statement was made — immediately before the table.
Information on Transavia's Scheduled Flights (38) The omission of any information indicating that Transavia has scheduled flights to Mediterranean destinations and that Transavia sells seats on those flights to tour operators makes the information provided on Transavia both misleading and incorrect within the meaning of Article 14 (1)(b) of the Merger Regulation. (39) Not to refer to Transavia's scheduled Mediterranean flights is, in the context of the rest of the information provided in the Form CO, not a matter of a simple omission but, as explained above (Sections III and IV), substantively misleads the reader as it gives a distorted picture of the true facts.
Thus, the information is both incorrect and misleading within the meaning of Article 14(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation. (40) The Commission cannot exclude the possibility that KLM intentionally withheld the information on Transavia's scheduled flights.
IMPOSITION OF FINES (42) Under Article 14(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation, the Commission may impose on undertakings fines of from EUR 1000 to EUR 50000 where, intentionally or negligently, they supply incorrect or misleading information in a notification pursuant to Article 4 of the Merger Regulation.
The Commission thereby takes account of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. 1.
The information that Transavia operates to all relevant Martinair destinations is also relevant for the assessment of the amount of actual competition between Martinair and Transavia, in particular if seen in the context of the parties' repeated statements that Martinair's and Transavia's operations are complementary [37]. (46) The information that Transavia is operating towards many major holiday destinations scheduled and charter services in parallel is also clearly of importance in order to assess Transavia's market position.
KLM refers to the SH%amp%E study which it claims makes it clear that 47 % of all Dutch holiday-makers go on vacation on a scheduled flight.
The fact that KLM sells seats on its scheduled flights to tour operators under the same economic conditions as for its charter flights, and the importance of that activity, was only fully confirmed in the notification of 21 December 1998 and the Commission's subsequent investigation of the information contained in that notification. (59) In assessing the conduct of KLM, it must also be borne in mind that KLM is a large European company with significant business in Europe.
KLM also had prior experience of a notification under the Merger Regulation. (60) In mitigation, KLM has claimed, in summary and as more fully described in paragraphs 47 to 55, that the alleged infringements were not deliberate, that the Commission should have been able to identify the missing information and request it during the prenotification period (which in this instance was quite extensive) and that the missing information was not decisive for the outcome of the case. (61) In the Commission's view, only limited weight can be attached to those claims as regards their impact on the gravity of the infringement and hence on the amount of the fine that should be imposed.
