Annual Report on the implementation of the budget, together with the institutions' replies COURT OF AUDITORS +++++ TIFF +++++ In accordance with the provisions of Article 248(1) and (4) of the EC Treaty, Articles 143 and 181(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Articles 116 and 135(2) of the Financial Regulation of 27 March 2003 applicable to the Ninth European Development Fund, the Court of Auditors of the European Communities, at its meetings of 7 and 14 September 2006, adopted its ANNUAL REPORTS concerning the financial year 2005 The reports, together with the institutions' replies to the Court's observations, were transmitted to the authorities responsible for giving discharge and to the other institutions. -------------------------------------------------- GENERAL INTRODUCTION 0.1.
The structure of the annual report on the implementation of the general budget is now as follows: Chapter 1 — the Statement of Assurance; Chapter 2 — the Commission's internal control system [1]; Chapter 3 — key observations on budgetary management; Chapters 4 to 10 — revenue and activities financed from different parts of the budget, reflecting the headings of the financial perspective; and Chapter 11 — financial instruments and banking activities.
The chapters covering revenue and the major areas of expenditure have the following main elements: - detailed analyses of the results of the audit work carried out in the context of the Statement of Assurance in the form of specific assessments, - results of follow-up reviews of progress made on implementing recommendations of the Court and the Budgetary Authorities arising from previous audits, - a list of the special reports published by the Court since the last annual report. 0.4.
A major element of the Commission's reform programme on-going since 2000 is the system of annual activity reports and accompanying declarations of directors-general.
The Court will evaluate the results of the action plan when the relevant measures have been implemented and it is possible to assess their impact. [1] This chapter consolidates the information previously presented in the Statement of Assurance chapter as well as in the individual income and expenditure chapters. [2] OJ C 107, 30.4.2004.

In accordance with the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002, the %quot%Consolidated financial statements%quot% for the financial year 2005 are prepared for the first time on the basis of accounting rules adopted by the Commission's Accounting Officer which adapt accruals based accounting principles to the specific environment of the Communities [2], while the %quot%Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget%quot% continue to be primarily based on movements of cash.
The change-over to accruals based accounting required a restatement of the opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 and important changes in the presentation [3] and content [4] of the %quot%Consolidated financial statements%quot%.
In the Court's opinion, the %quot%Final annual accounts of the European Communities%quot% were drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002 and accounting rules adopted by the Commission's Accounting Officer.
The Court notes that, in the context of a complex exercise (see paragraph II), the existing financial reporting framework has not been consistently applied, in particular for cut-off, and that accounting systems in certain Directorates-General of the Commission were not able to ensure the quality of financial information which led to multiple corrections after the presentation of the provisional accounts (see paragraphs VII and VIII).
The Court's audit has identified errors in amounts registered in the accounting system as invoices/cost statements and pre-financing which, after corrections made to the provisional accounts, still have the following net financial impact on the elements of the consolidated financial statements listed below (see also paragraph VIII): (a) The consolidated opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2005, which adjusted the consolidated closing balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 on the basis of the new accruals based accounting principles, overstates the accounts payable by some 47 million euro and overstates the total amount of long-term and short-term pre-financing by some 179 million euro.
As a result, the net assets are overstated by some 132 million euro. (b) The errors identified in (a) above affected the consolidated closing balance sheet as at 31 December 2005 which overstates the accounts payable by some 508 million euro and the total amount of long-term and short-term pre-financing by some 822 million euro.
As a result the net assets are overstated by some 314 million euro.
The Court's audit also confirmed the general reservation of the Director-General for Education and Culture covering the lack of assurance as regards the correctness of its share of the total amounts, included in both the consolidated opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 (assets amounting to 572,5 million euro and liabilities amounting to 198,5 million euro) and the consolidated closing balance sheet as at 31 December 2005 (assets amounting to 382,7 million euro and liabilities amounting to 187,3 million euro).
Legality and regularity of the underlying transactions IX.
The Treaty also authorises the Court to supplement this statement with specific assessments of each major area of Community activity. | | 1.2.The aim of the work on the reliability of the accounts of the European Communities is to obtain sufficient evidence to conclude on the extent to which revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities have been properly registered and that the annual accounts faithfully reflect the financial position at the end of the year (see paragraphs 1.5 to 1.58). | | 1.3.The aim of the work on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions is to gather sufficient evidence, of a direct or indirect nature, to give an opinion on whether they are in accordance with the applicable regulations or contractual provisions, and have been correctly calculated (see paragraphs 1.59 to 1.65 of this chapter for horizontal issues and chapters 2 and 4 to 10 for details). | | 1.4.In the absence of systematic indicators presented by the Commission [5], the Court provides certain indicators to monitor progress in improving internal controls both overall, and for each income and expenditure area (see annexes to this chapter and to chapters 2 and 4 to 10). | | Reliability of the accounts General background 1.5.The Court's observations concern the final annual accounts for the financial year 2005, which are drawn up by the Commission's Accounting Officer and approved by the Commission in compliance with Articles 128 and 129 of the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002 [6] and sent to the Court on 28 July 2006.
As already observed by the Court in previous Annual Reports [8], the timetable established for the necessary adaptations and validations was very ambitious. | 1.10.The Commission recognises the extraordinary effort made by its departments to move to accrual-based accounting within a very ambitious timetable.To accomplish the objective to modernise the accounting system, the Commission prepared a very detailed project management plan identifying all the milestones needed to make this project a success. | 1.11.Experience in public administrations undertaking similar reforms [9] shows that projects of a scale and complexity similar to the modernisation of the Communities' accounts inevitably face a variety of problems which complicate and delay their complete implementation.
New accounting rules [10] and methods, a new harmonised chart of accounts and new consolidation tools were introduced in all Community institutions and agencies,stakeholders were provided with individual and consolidated accounts which comprise the new obligatory elements and contain more detailed information about the resources controlled by the different entities, the costs of their operations and the cash flow operations. | 1.11.Despite the complexity of certain issues, the variety of problems and big challenges, the Commission managed the project without delays regarding the key deadlines.
Noteworthy achievements include:the IT systems developed in order to support the new accounting requirements;the transition to the new system was successfully managed which allowed the opening of the new system at the beginning of January 2005;administrative procedures of all the Commission's services were adapted to the needs of accruals based accounting;the opening balances for the first accrual-based accounts were determined and validated;an integrated treasury module was developed to account for the financial activities managed by the Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs;the expenses to be accrued at the end of each year were estimated by all departments;the Commission's accounts were prepared, and consolidated with those of other institutions and agencies.Finally, the Commission respected the time-limits set in the Financial Regulation for the preparation of financial statements which comply in all material aspects with international standards, and has met its commitment to the European Parliament and to Council to report on its progress towards this goal, which all authorities considered very ambitious. | 1.12.Table 1.1 contains a follow-up of the Court's reservation concerning the reliability of the accounts which was expressed in the Statement of Assurance for the 2004 financial year, as well as the other points raised by the Court which were (partly) settled in the context of the modernisation of the Community accounting framework.
Nevertheless, on the basis of systems analysis and substantive testing, the Court concluded that it cannot yet consider the amounts of pre-financing presented in the balance sheet as complete and sufficiently reliable. | Points (partly) resolved within the framework of the modernisation of the Communities’ accounting system | Replies in the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004 | Evolution of the situation | In the absence of a suitable accounting system, the preparation of the year-end financial statements was still, to a large extent, based on records outside the accounts and the information used for this was not always linked to the budgetary transactions.
The differentiation between capital and non-capital expenditure is one of the improvements arising from the introduction of the new accounting system. | Since the introduction of the new accruals based accounting system most of the problems mentioned by the Court have been addressed.
However, these important changes, which continue to necessitate a cultural change on the part of all concerned, have caused internal delays in the production of the information requested and to inaccuracies in this first set of accounts established on the basis of accruals-based accounting. | The Court is unable to give assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of the amounts entered as held by financial intermediaries (1313,6 million euro at 31 December 2004). | The new system introduced in 2005 and based on accrual accounting rules will allow the Commission to better control the amounts of pre-financing (such as for financial intermediaries). | The amounts held by financial intermediaries should from 2005 onwards be included under pre-financing.
However, as already mentioned before (see under qualification in the 2004 Statement of Assurance), the Court cannot yet consider the amounts of pre-financing presented in the balance sheet as complete and sufficiently reliable. | Other weaknesses concerning the presentation of the accounts persist as regards certain items of agricultural expenditure and advances not paid but shown as such (modulation), and the accounting for pension rights, which neutralises the effect on the economic outturn. | The current modulation system is being phased out and there are no plans to change the entry into the budgetary accounts during its last years.
Key elements in the process of the preparation of the Commission's 2005 financial statements were the implementation in the different Directorates-General of the overall cut-off methodology/instructions given by the Commission's Accounting Officer and the validation of opening and closing balances by all Authorising Officers [11].
These validations were in most cases delayed, in particular at the level of the operational Directorates-General. 1.13.
This was the case with the timetables of the Commission.
The figures presented in the financial annex of the annual activity reports by some operational Directorates-General contained errors (see paragraph 1.16). 1.14.
Some imperfections occurred in the split of the accounts by Directorates-General, and this is the reason why some figures presented in the financial annex of the individual annual activity report (AAR) of some Directorates-General contained small errors, but these did not affect the Commission's accounts as a whole. | 1.15.
As a result, cut-off entries for the opening and closing balances were made in the absence of a formalised methodological basis implementing, at the level of a Directorate-General, the overall cut-off methodology/instructions given by the Commission's Accounting Officer. 1.15.
Nevertheless, for the cut-off methodology, the accounting services provided a clear methodology to be followed by all services.
The delays referred to in paragraph 1.13 had an impact on the Court's substantive testing since the Court received opening balances before cut-off (on 18 January 2006) and after cut-off (on 15 March 2006) which were still subject to modifications.
The complete provisional opening balance sheet, giving an indication of the impact of the changes made to restate the balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 under the new accounting principles, was obtained on 31 March 2006, together with the consolidated provisional accounts. 1.17.
The Commission understands the Court's audit work this year was challenging, as was the entire project for the Commission. - sound procedures were followed and the system was documented; - the balances other than cut-off were first uploaded in January 2005; - by mid-2005 approximately 95 % of these balances were final and - the changes made since then were documented and an audit trail specifically made. | Minor issues still pending at the level of the central accounting system (ABAC) — but still material problems at the level of the local subsidiary accounting systems 1.18.
As the work remaining on these issues is not considered material by the Director-General for the Budget, in particular because an effective monitoring system is in place, the reservation on system security and access rights, which was introduced in the 2004 annual activity report, was lifted.
The Court's audit confirms the improved security of ABAC. | | 1.19.
As the situation is constantly evolving, the accounting services' validation team needs to keep track of this evolution, and has also introduced, with effect from 1 June 2006, a procedure for the validation of changes in the local systems, as foreseen in the implementing rules of the Financial Regulation. | 1.20.
The Court's audit confirmed the basis of the Commission's Accounting Officer's decision to refuse, due to material deficiencies, validation concerning three local systems in the EuropeAid Co-operation Office, the Directorate-General for Education and Culture and the Directorate-General for External Relations.
However, in some cases it is not clear why insufficient results for several validation criteria did not lead to a qualified validation. 1.20.
The validation of local systems is a rather new activity, which translates Article 61 of the Financial Regulation into concrete tasks.
The validation reports are produced in order to provide to the Accounting Officer sufficient information for the validation.
The scope and limitations are explained in the preamble of the validation reports. | 1.21.
This situation is also confirmed by the number and importance of horizontal issues [16] and matters for further consideration [17] highlighted in the Commission's Accounting Officer's final report at the end of 2005. 1.21.
The follow up activities will take place within all services, including the Directorates-General for Budget and for Informatics in respect of the ABAC system. | Work to improve the quality of accounting systems and data after the presentation of the provisional accounts The Commission's actions to ensure accurate final accounts 1.22.
On this basis, reasonable assurance along the lines foreseen by the declaration can be given%quot%. 1.22.
However, three local systems have not been validated by the accounting services.
For these reasons, and also because the provisional accounts were to be audited by the Court of Auditors and corrections may be necessary before the approval of the final accounts on 31 July 2006, the Director General for Budget issued on 31 March 2006 a systemic, provisional and time-bound reservation in its 2005 annual activity report. | 1.23.
However, 26 out of 40 Resource Directors indicated that, due to weaknesses identified in the Annual Activity Reports and/or taking into consideration that this is the first year of the provisional closure of the accounts based on accruals accounting, verifications and, where necessary, corrections may still be needed before the final closure of the accounts. 1.23.
The scope of consolidation foreseen in the Accounting Rule No 1 takes into account the principle of control and is based on international accounting standards.
On the other hand, Article 121 of the Financial Regulation (FR) foresees only the consolidation of Institutions and subsidised Agencies.
To avoid the contradiction between the Accounting Rule and the Financial Regulation, it has been proposed to amend Article 121 of the Financial Regulation in the context of its overall revision in order to foresee also the consolidation of all controlled bodies in accordance with the Accounting rule No 1. | 1.25.
Nevertheless, the Joint Sickness Insurance Scheme and two agencies (Community Plant Variety Office and Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market) were not included in the 2005 consolidated accounts (see also paragraph 1.29).
The exclusion of the two agencies is permitted by the Financial Regulation for practical reasons: The Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market still prefers not to be integrated in the scope of consolidation; the Community Plant Variety Office meanwhile agreed to be consolidated, but the consent came too late for the 2005 consolidation.
As indicated by the Court in paragraph 1.29, the non inclusion is not material. | Impact of the ongoing work 1.26.
In its Opinion No 2/2001 [21], on a proposal for a Council Regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, the Court addressed the risks arising from a situation where the provisional consolidated financial statements sent to the Court of Auditors are not yet stabilised.
The Commission did not respect this latter principle that no changes should be made other than those proposed by the Court, as 2005 was a transitional year.
The Court's examination of the adequacy and accuracy of the adjustments made, in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as at 1 January 2005, to bring the figures and information of the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2004 into line with the new accruals-based accounting principles, is presented hereafter (see paragraphs 1.29 to 1.49). | | 1.29.
The inclusion, for the first time, of the agencies in the scope of consolidation has had only a limited impact on the consolidated accounts, the main effect being an increase in cash balances.
With regard to footnote 18, the information was not available for the amounts due at 31 December. | Pre-financing 1.31.
In order to remedy these deficiencies, during 2004 an inventory of all open pre-financing amounts paid up to 31 December 2004 was prepared by every institution and agency, leading to approximately 30000 pre-financing entries for a total amount of 28013 million euro [25]. 1.33.
As required by the new accounting rules, the inventory of the pre-financing amounts was done and from January 2005, the pre-financing amounts not yet cleared are included on the asset side of the balance sheet. | 1.34.
As explained in its replies to the Court's 2004 Annual Report, the follow up of the pre-financing amounts has to take into account the conditions of the various contracts with third parties.
Nevertheless, the presentation of the net amount in the balance sheet shows the economic reality of outstanding pre-financing amounts. | 1.35.
Furthermore, additional audit work on the identification and validation of pre-financing entries revealed the following problems of completeness/accuracy for the opening balance sheet: | 1.36. - the split between long-term pre-financing (21285 million euro) and short- term pre-financing (6728 million euro) took only into consideration amounts related to the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, ISPA and the Solidarity Fund for the 2000 to 2006 programming period.
For the 2006 accounts, following two years experience with the new accounting system, the Commission will have more information on which to base an analysis of the feasibility of making this split. | - for Directorate-General for Education and Culture, despite work performed after the issuance of the provisional accounts, there is still a risk that omissions and double or wrong postings could lead to errors which are unquantifiable due to the complexity of the problems [27]. - Material errors identified in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture which resulted from the wrong treatment of pre-financing payments have been corrected. | Accounts payable 1.37.
The establishment of an inventory listing about 7000 invoices and cost statements received but not yet paid as at 1 January 2005 began in the fourth quarter of 2004 and led to an amount of current payables of 9412 million euro [28]. | | 1.39.
For Directorate-General for Education and Culture, despite work performed after the issuance of the provisional accounts, there is still a risk that omissions and double or wrong postings could lead to errors which are unquantifiable, due to the complexity of the problems. 1.41.
Material errors identified in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture which resulted from the wrong treatment of invoices/cost statements have been corrected. | Cut-off elements 1.42.
Adjustments for accrued charges totalled 64205 million euro [30].
As described above (see paragraph 1.15), the implementation of the overall cut-off methodology per Directorate-General was not finalised before the cut-off bookings.
The following weaknesses identified in the cut-off procedures put at risk the correctness of calculations performed by many Directorates-General: - only limited checks have been made by the Directorates-General on the result of the calculations, - data used were in certain cases of insufficient quality, - knowledge and work was often concentrated in one person without appropriate supervision. 1.45.
All Directorates-General audited (except Directorate-General for Education and Culture) could reconcile the data used in the calculations with the basic accounting data, except for some unexplained differences, which, although not material, confirm a certain level of risk as identified above (see paragraph 1.45). 1.46.
Material errors identified in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture which resulted from the wrong treatment of accrued charges have been corrected. | Structure and presentation 1.47.
Because of the adjustments introduced as a part of the move to accruals accounting, total liabilities in the opening balance sheet (as at 1 January 2005) exceed total assets by 51597 million euro, whereas before the adjustments total assets exceeded the liabilities by 14507 million euro. | | 1.48.
One major factor explaining this change is the fact that the introduction of pre-financing (total amount of 28013 million euro) does not compensate for the introduction of accrued charges (total amount of 64205 million euro).
In addition, long-term receivables have greatly decreased because the Communities' pension obligations towards Members of institutions and staff (net present value of 26012 million euro) are no longer neutralised by a corresponding asset representing the amount receivable from the Member States.
The Court observed that the Accounting Officer did not fully comply with Accounting Rules Nos 2 and 12 with regard to the new structure and presentation of the balance sheet and the revised treatment of the Communities' pension liabilities [31].
Furthermore, the different character of the liabilities to be covered by the amounts to be called from Member States should be disclosed further, in particular the short-term and long-term nature of those amounts. 1.49.
The Accounting rules Nos 2 and 12 will be adapted.
The different character of the liabilities to be recovered by the amounts to be called from Member States, are disclosed in the note to the balance Sheet 3.20. | Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2005 1.50.
Furthermore, the deficiencies concerning the adjustments made for the opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2005 have an impact on the economic outturn for the year 2005 and consequently on the consolidated balance sheet and the statement of changes in net assets. 1.50.
The audit of a representative sample of 162 pre-financings from the population of pre-financings registered, as at March 2006, in the accounting system (29349 million euro) identified a material level of error in terms of frequency and of financial impact.
The same types of errors as for the consolidated opening balance sheet have been identified for the consolidated closing balance sheet (see paragraph 1.35). 1.52.
For the 2006 accounts, following two years experience with the new accounting system, the Commission will have more information on which to base an analysis of the feasibility of making this split. | - for Directorate-General for Education and Culture, despite work performed after the issuance of the provisional accounts, there is still a risk that omissions and double or wrong postings could lead to errors which are unquantifiable due to the complexity of the problems. - Material errors identified in DG EAC which resulted from the wrong treatment of pre-financing payments have been corrected. | Accounts payable 1.54.
The audit of a representative sample of 148 invoices/cost statements from the population of accounts payable registered, as at March 2006, in the accounting system (16194 million euro) identified a material level of error in terms of frequency and financial impact.
The same types of errors as for the consolidated opening balance sheet have been identified for the consolidated closing balance sheet (see paragraph 1.40). 1.54.
For Directorate-General for Education and Culture, despite work performed after the issuance of the provisional accounts, there is still a risk that omissions and double or wrong postings could lead to errors which are unquantifiable due to the complexity of the problems. 1.55.
Material errors identified in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture which resulted from the wrong treatment of invoices/cost statements have been corrected. | Cut-off elements 1.56.
All Directorates-General audited (except Directorate-General for Education and Culture) could reconcile the data used in the calculations with the basic accounting data, except for some unexplained differences, which, although not material confirm a certain level of risk as identified above (see paragraph 1.45). 1.56.
Material errors identified in the Directorate-General for Education and Culture which resulted from the wrong treatment of cut-off elements have been corrected. | Off-balance sheet and notes 1.57.
The Commission has acted on the recommendation made in the Court's 2004 report concerning possible compliance corrections still to be made.
It is considered that the total amount to be recovered in the future is EUR 1151 million, based on an average rate of financial correction of 0,95 % — see also the reply to paragraphs 5.56 and 5.62. | Consolidated economic outturn account 1.58.
Except for the Commission this information only became available after the presentation of the final accounts.
In areas where, according to the Court's evaluation, supervisory and control systems exist but their effectiveness in managing the associated risk has to be improved, the Court's substantive testing still tends to identify material findings as regards the legality and regularity of underlying transactions (see paragraphs 5.52 to 5.57, 6.38 to 6.41, 7.28 and, as regards implementing organisations 8.21 to 8.22).
The Commission has taken steps to manage the risks associated with shared management through audit work, application of action plans in Member States to rectify systems deficiencies, financial corrections, guidance on key controls, and improved reporting of audit results of national auditors.
It is inherent in the system of shared management that certain errors and deficiencies will only be corrected after reimbursement of the expenditure concerned.
As regards implementing organisations in external actions, please see the Commission's replies to paragraphs 8.20 and 8.21. | Multiannual nature of Community activities and error correction 1.63.
Thus, it is argued that the Commission takes errors into consideration when clearing accounts in the EAGGF Guarantee section, when closing operational programmes in the Structural Funds, and when concluding audits relating to decentralised management. 1.63.
In line with Article 53(5) of the Financial Regulation and Article 42 of the detailed rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation [38], these decisions and corrective measures do indeed constitute important components of the Commission's supervisory and control systems.
However, the weaknesses identified in the Court's audits show that %quot%conformity decisions%quot% under the clearance of agricultural accounts, closure procedures for operational programmes under the Structural Funds and concluding audits relating to decentralised management cannot be regarded as mechanisms to ensure the prevention and timely identification and correction of errors (see paragraphs 5.56 to 5.57, 6.31 to 6.37, 6.41, 7.21 to 7.24 and 7.26 to 7.28). 1.64.
The objective of the conformity clearance of accounts decisions is to exclude from Community financing expenditure which has not been effected in compliance with Community rules.
The clearance of accounts decisions encourage Member States to do their best to ensure that the error rate is kept at a tolerable level and that identified irregularities are recovered.
The Commission considers that in the area of agricultural expenditure the chain of controls performed by the Member States and the Commission provides adequate assurance that errors are detected and corrected (see reply to paragraphs 5.56 and 5.58).
Furthermore, as the financial corrections applied result from systems weaknesses, they cannot directly be related to errors at the level of underlying transactions.
In the Commission's view, such corrections repair the damage to the EU budget for errors in the legality and regularity of the transactions affected. | [1] The %quot%Final annual accounts of the European Communities%quot% make up Volume I of the annual accounts of the European Communities financial year 2005. [2] The accounting rules adopted by the Commission's Accounting Officer are inspired by International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the International Federation of Accountants or, in their absence, International Accounting Standards (IAS)/International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. [3] The %quot%Consolidated financial statements%quot% comprise the balance sheet, the economic outturn account (including segment reporting), the cash flow table and the statement of changes in net assets. [4] The main new elements are pre-financing, accounts payable and cut-off. [5] See paragraphs 1.51 and 1.52 of the Court's Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004 and chapter 2 of the present Annual Report. [6] Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1). [7] Communication from the Commission — Modernisation of the Accounting System of the European Communities (COM(2002) 755 final of 17.12.2002). [8] See paragraph 1.8 of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2002, paragraph 1.25 of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2003 and paragraph 1.44 of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004. [9] For instance at the United Nations Headquarters and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or in Australia, Denmark, France, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. [10] The new set of 15 accounting rules adopted by the Commission's Accounting Officer are based on the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and for accounting transactions that are not yet covered by the IPSAS, on the relevant International Accounting Standards (IAS) / International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). [11] According to Article 59 of the Financial Regulation, each institution lays down in its administrative rules the staff of an appropriate level to whom it delegates the duties of the Authorising Officers for implementing revenue and expenditure, the scope of the powers delegated and the possibility to sub-delegate them.
These indicate how each Director-General has discharged his responsibilities and contain an assessment of the extent to which the expenditure for which he or she is responsible is legal and regular.
The 2006 Annual Management Plan (AMP) process (launched in 2005) of the Commission's Directorates-General and Services contained for the first time an assessment of major risks for the Directorates-General's overall strategic objectives and a review of existing or placement of the necessary mitigating controls. | 2.3.On 17 January 2006 the Commission adopted an %quot%action plan towards an integrated internal control framework%quot% [2], which took into account the results of the %quot%gap assessment%quot% carried out by its services in 2005 for all management modes [3].
The actions are to be implemented by Directorates-General and Services in close collaboration with Member States.The Commission would welcome the Court's evaluation as soon as possible to determine whether the internal control framework, as improved by the planned actions, can provide adequate assurance, when properly applied. | 2.4.The Court examined the extent to which the management representations contained in the annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General, and in the Commission's synthesis, are confirmed by the Court’s audit findings and are relevant for the DAS.
Nevertheless, the Court notes that these guidelines were not completely followed in some cases (see paragraph 2.15). | 2.12.The Commission believes that significant progress has been achieved in this respect in 2005, in particular through the agreement of a common approach on materiality by %quot%family%quot%, the emphasis in Part 2 of the annual activity reports on the bases of the declaration of assurance and the outline in Part 3 of the materiality criteria used and the combined impact of the reservations on the declaration of assurance.See also the reply to point 2.15. | 2.13.Furthermore, the Court finds that there is still scope for improvement, especially insofar as the presentation of indicators having a direct link with legality and regularity is concerned.
Despite the fact that relevant key figures and performance indicators (including legality and regularity) [13] should be presented by the Directors-General, there is no specific indication of which monitoring elements (indicators) should be used [14]. | 2.13.In its guidelines, the Commission wanted to allow its services some flexibility in the choice of key figures and performance indicators.Most of the services managing Community programmes presented legality and regularity indicators.
Where systemic weaknesses are found, qualitative factors can also give rise to the formulation of a reservation.In the few cases mentioned by the Court, the criteria used and the factors behind the formulation of a reservation were outlined in Part 3 of the annual activity report and generally relate to qualitative criteria (even if, in quantitative terms, the estimated potential financial impact is less than the quantitative criteria). | 2.16.All the Directors-General stated that they had obtained reasonable assurance that the resources allocated to them had been used for the specified purposes, and that the internal controls which they had introduced ensured the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
The most important reservations in the context of the DAS are shown in Table 2.1. | 2.17.The Commission is conscious that most reservations are recurring ones.
Indeed, in its 2005 Synthesis it analysed the different types of recurring reservations (reservations whose underlying problem is being solved, in some cases with further efforts needed from third parties; reservations relating to structural problems; reservations relating to weaknesses affecting operations carried out outside headquarters).In every case, the Commission will ensure that the Directors-General concerned take the necessary measures in 2006 to solve these problems. | 2.18.In comparison with 2004 [19], the Court notes in general an improvement in the quality of the assessment of the functioning of supervisory and control systems and of the overall impact of the relevant reservations on the assurance given in the declarations.
They entered reservations in their declarations where the information they had built up from their own and the Member States' audit work on the functioning of systems indicated significant deficiencies posing a material risk to the Community budget that could not be adequately managed through the normal corrective mechanisms of the control system.

Despite the strengthened preparation process (see paragraphs 2.11 to 2.13), the Court considers that some annual activity reports [27] do not yet provide sufficient evidence for its Statement of Assurance (see paragraphs 2.15 and 2.18). 2.19.
The Directors-General and Heads of Service concerned have substantiated the bases of the declaration of assurance (Part 2 of the annual activity reports) and given an indication, by explicit arguments, of the impact of the reservations made on the reasonable assurance relating to the use of resources and the legality and regularity of the operations.
They all concluded that they could give their assurance.
The Commission therefore finds that they could equally serve as an element, among others, to give the Court greater assurance than is reflected in the assessment in Table 2.1.
The Court notes that a certain number [28] of Directorates-General present legality and regularity indicators in their 2005 annual activity reports.
They also outlined the bases of their assurance in Part 2 of their annual activity report.
Moreover, in the light of the 2004 Synthesis, there are ongoing efforts to harmonise legality and regularity indicators to ensure a consistent approach by family and to make these indicators operational management tools specific to the nature of the activities. | AUDIT FINDINGS CONCERNING INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS 2.21.
This is also the understanding behind the Commission's Action Plan towards an integrated internal control framework. | 2.22.
Although the Commission appreciates the Court's results oriented approach, the Action Plan reflects the efforts made by the Commission to reinforce its internal control system in order to provide the Court of Auditors with audit evidence on the satisfactory management of the risk of error.
The Directorates-General for structural measures based their assessments of the assurance obtained from management and control systems in the Member States on information from their own and Member States' audit work, taking into account the various instruments available to them to manage the risk of irregular payments.
The Commission considers that this is an indicator of the effective operation of the supervisory role of the Commission. | 2.26.
They entered reservations in their declarations where the information they had built up from their own and the Member States' audit work on the functioning of systems indicated significant deficiencies posing a material risk to the Community budget that could not be adequately managed through the normal corrective mechanisms of the control system.
In addition, the actions under the %quot%Commission's action plan towards an integrated internal control framework%quot% [COM(2006) 9] should in future provide for improved presentation of the key controls used to support reasonable assurance. | [1] The action is foreseen by the 2004 synthesis (multiannual objective No 3).

[6] Annex 1 of the 2005 synthesis includes 15 measures related to the following categories: performance management and internal control, governance, financial management and reporting and human resources.
Most of these actions are the follow-up of the multi-annual objectives included in the 2004 synthesis.

[10] This is a process, organised by groups of Directorates-General, to improve consistency and coherence between reservations. [11] See part 3.1 and appendix 3 of the circular on the annual activity reports for year 2005.
Specific implementing rules were further developed by the Directorates-General of the families of shared management and research, aiming to have common materiality criteria and quantification methodology, as laid down in multiannual objective No 6, established by the 2004 synthesis report (COM(2005) 256 final of 15.6.2005), Annex 1. [12] In particular, the existing guidelines establish the threshold as a function of the budget for the activity in question, i.e. 2 % of the value of the activity concerned (COM(2003) 28 final of 21.1.2003). [13] In part 1, section 1.2 of the relevant circular, it is foreseen that the scorecard of the service for the year 2005 should ensure a balance between impact, output, workload, management and legality and regularity indicators. [14] Appendix 6 of the circular on the annual activity reports for year 2005 foresaw the publication of a supplementary document on performance indicators.

The assessments made in 2003 and 2004 have been adapted in view of presenting a comparable situation for 2003, 2004 and 2005. [20] Even though in some cases (management and control systems in the Member States in 2000 to 2006 for several programmes of structural measures and error frequency for the Sixth Framework Programme of Research) they were dealt with in the annual activity reports.

In the case of %quot%non-differentiated%quot% expenditure (such as much of agricultural spending) commitments and payments within the budget are equal and liquidated during the year. | | 3.2.Most expenditure on structural operations and on internal and external policies takes the form of programmes managed over a number of years (e.g. 2000 to 2006 for the current Structural Funds programming period).
For more detailed information on the budget see Annex I. | | OBSERVATIONS Budget increased for the first full year of enlargement 3.3.2005 was the first full year of the enlarged Union.
Total appropriations for commitments (116,6 billion euro) and payments (106,3 billion euro) were respectively 6,2 and 4,4 % higher than the 2004 final budget.
The increase for commitments is proportionally larger because they can cover expenditure for more than one year (see paragraph 3.2), while payment appropriations are linked to absorption capacity.
Outstanding budgetary commitments for differentiated expenditure as a whole represented 2,4 years of payments at the current spending rate (2,2 years in 2004). | 3.6.An increase in outstanding budgetary commitments (RAL) related to structural operations in EU-10 was to be expected as budgeted commitments are normally somewhat higher than payments in the early years of programming. | Source: 2005 annual accounts. | By type | Total | Agriculture | Structural operations | Internal policies | External actions | Administration | Reserves | Pre-accession strategy | Compensation | Rounding | Non-Differentiated appropriations | Differentiated appropriations | Commitments brought forward Balance brought forward | 1313 | 108834 | 110147 | 1452 | 73285 | 13450 | 12313 | 808 | 0 | 8840 | 0 | –1 | Payments | –1072 | –42852 | –43924 | –1394 | –31184 | –4415 | –3306 | –673 | 0 | –2953 | 0 | 1 | Decommitments | –47 | –2245 | –2293 | –5 | –1304 | –410 | –405 | –35 | 0 | –133 | 0 | –1 | Cancellations | –191 | 0 | –191 | –47 | –1 | –24 | –18 | –96 | 0 | –5 | 0 | 0 | Commitments made in 2005 Commitments made | 55589 | 60689 | 116278 | 48928 | 42490 | 9548 | 5516 | 6355 | 140 | 1994 | 1305 | 2 | Payments | –54311 | –6600 | –60911 | –47071 | –1580 | –3556 | –1707 | –5518 | –140 | –32 | –1305 | –2 | Cancellations | –26 | 0 | –26 | 0 | –2 | –12 | –6 | –5 | 0 | –1 | 0 | 0 | Rounding | –1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | Commitments outstanding at end 2005 | 1254 | 117826 | 119080 | 1863 | 81704 | 14581 | 12387 | 836 | 0 | 7710 | 0 | –1 | | 3.7.
The ratio of %quot%outstanding legal commitments%quot% relative to payments in a given year, is not by itself a useful indicator for the reasons cited by the Court. | Graph 3.1 — Outstanding budgetary commitments 1994 to 2005 Note: Differentiated appropriations comprises expenditure on structural operations, internal policies, external actions and pre-adhesion aid.

Furthermore, from 2007 spending should start on the 2007 to 2013 programming cycle, but the need to complete the current cycle risks delaying the start and subsequent implementation of the new programmes [7]. 3.10.
Member States and the Commission are aware that vigilance is needed to ensure that the switch between cycles is made smoothly, both in terms of ensuring programme implementation, and in tackling the additional workload relating to the establishment of new programmes.
Part of the balance for programmes for the current period will be paid in the years 2007 to 2011 and will therefore overlap with the following period [8].
As a result, total outstanding legal commitments for the Cohesion Fund were 18,6 billion euro which represents 8,5 years' of payments at the 2005 spending rate.
This was slightly higher than in 2004 (245 million euro) but still represented just 0,9 % of the commitment tranches more than two years old and therefore potentially subject to cancellation (and 0,4 % of the total balance of outstanding budgetary commitments). 3.12.
This protection weakens over time, and may lead to growing n + 2 de-commitments in the years ahead (see the Commission's reply to point 2.24 of the Court’s 2004 Annual Report).
Such practices may diminish the effectiveness of the year n + 2 rule. 3.13.
Most of the cancellations under the n + 2 rule relate to the European Social Fund.
However, the allocation was made to the better performing priorities of the programme (see the Commission's reply to point 2.25 of the Court’s 2004 Annual Report). | CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 3.15.
In particular the large spending programmes continued at the expected levels, although absorption difficulties were encountered in the EU-10, particularly the Cohesion Fund.
Member States and the Commission are aware that vigilance is needed to ensure that the switch between cycles is made smoothly, both in terms of ensuring programme implementation, and in tackling the additional workload relating to the establishment of new programmes.
The level of de-commitments is not in itself a proper indicator of the effectiveness of the n + 2 rule, precisely because the rule also has an effect on promoting budget execution.
The Commission fully agrees that the n + 2 procedure needs to be implemented rigorously. | 3.20.
The Commission will continue to ensure the effective application of the n + 2 rule. | 3.21.
The unused revenue that the surplus represents is offset against the own resources to be collected for the following year. [4] See paragraph 3.2. [5] See paragraph 2.12 of the Court's 2003 Annual Report. [6] Early or mid 2009 in certain cases. [7] In the past, closure has been a difficult period in the programming cycle: %quot%The administrative and financial constraints connected with completion of the 1994 to 1999 programmes contributed largely to the delays in starting up programmes for the 2000 to 2006 period.%quot% COM(2002) 528 final, page 4. [8] The final date for eligibility of expenditure under the 2000 to 2006 programmes is normally the end of 2008, in line with the n + 2 rule.
However, the final 5 % balance of a programme can only be paid after Member States have submitted satisfactory closure documents, for which the deadline is early 2010.
In practice this means that some payments will be made in 2010 and 2011. [9] Commission reply to paragraph 2.23 of the Court's 2004 Annual Report.
See also the Commission's reply to paragraph 2.48 of the Court's 2003 Annual Report: %quot%The %quot%N + 2%quot% rule should result in a stabilised level of outstanding commitments over the next few years…%quot%. [10] 4 % of the appropriations allocated to each Member State were placed in reserve for distribution to the best performing programmes in three tranches from 2004 to 2006. [11] For example, in the case of 79 million euro decommitted from a programme following the year n + 2 rule in the Netherlands, 24 million was allocated to the same programme from the Performance Reserve. [12] See Commission reply to paragraph 2.16 of the Court’s 2003 Annual Report: %quot%The overlap of programme cycles for multiannual programmes tends to smooth the pattern of payments over time.
For example, at the beginning of a new Structural Fund programme period, payments made in respect of programmes of the previous period normally compensate for the still low level of payments under current programmes before they reach cruising speed.%quot% -------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER 4 Revenue TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Specific assessment in the context of the Statement of Assurance Scope of audit Legality and regularity of underlying transactions Functioning of supervisory and control systems Commission supervisory and control systems Supervisory and control systems in Member States Conclusions and recommendations Follow-up of previous observations Traditional own resources: B-account adjustment THE COURT'S OBSERVATIONS | THE COMMISSION'S REPLIES | INTRODUCTION 4.1.The revenue in the budget of the European Union consists of own resources and other revenue.

There are three categories of own resources: traditional own resources [2] (customs duties, agricultural duties, and sugar levies) (13,3 %), own resources calculated on the basis of value added tax (VAT) collected by Member States (14,9 %), and own resources derived from the Member States' gross national income (GNI) [3] (66,1 %). | | SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE Scope of audit Traditional own resources 4.3.
It consisted of a review of the organisation of customs supervision and of the national systems for accounting for traditional own resources in eight Member States [4] (see paragraph 4.22); an examination of the effectiveness of the mutual assistance arrangements (paragraphs 4.10 to 4.12); an examination of the Commission's accounts for traditional own resources; and an analysis of the flow of duties in order to gain reasonable assurance that the amounts recorded were complete and correct. | | VAT and GNI own resources 4.5.
In addition, the Court continued its review of supervisory and control systems in relation to the compilation of national accounts at Statistical Offices in Member States. | | Legality and regularity of underlying transactions Traditional own resources 4.6.
However, certain traditional own resources transactions, which should have been made available to the Commission without delay were incorrectly withheld and entered in separate accounts (the B accounts). 4.6.
The Commission requires Member States to pay interest for any delays discovered in making traditional own resources available. | 4.7.
As in previous years the Court's audit and the Commission's inspections (see paragraph 4.9) found systematic problems with the B accounts in a number of Member States [5].
In Member States whose B accounts represent 34 % of the balance, customs debts that are partly secured are nevertheless entered in full in the B accounts, leading to delay in making the secured part available to the Commission.
So far this has been done for just under half the corrections and 387415 EUR made available.
This finding is consistent with the observation in the Court's recent audit of the management of OLAF [9], that there were no rules for consistent monitoring of progress on mutual assistance cases in the Member States. 4.11.
Nonetheless the Commission had already carried out an evaluation of the handling of Mutual Assistance (MA) messages between Member States.
Even if a potential risk has been reported using a RIF, the regulation requires a parallel message to OLAF using the mutual assistance procedure in cases of breaches of customs legislation. 4.12.
OLAF and TAXUD are already and will continue cooperating to obtain maximum synergy between AFIS and RIF taking into account the differences between first phase control requirements and anti-fraud related actions. | VAT own resource 4.13.
The Commission succeeded in maintaining the frequency and quality of its on-the-spot inspections during the financial year 2005 in the enlarged European Union. | | 4.14.
The Commission places reservations where it disagrees with the Member State's figures or method, or where it requires evidence to justify the figures or method used, or where the Member State presents no figures.
The Commission will nonetheless reexamine this question. | Table 4.2 — VAT reservations as at 31 December 2005 Member States [11] | Number of reservations outstanding at 31.12.2004 | Reservations set in 2005 | Reservations lifted in 2005 | Number of reservations outstanding at 31.12.2005 | Oldest year to which reservations apply | Belgium | 4 | 5 | 3 | 6 | 1989 | Denmark | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1991 | Germany | 17 | 8 | 8 | 17 | 1999 | Greece | 13 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 1997 | Spain | 3 | 6 | 3 | 6 | 1999 | France | 9 | 4 | 6 | 7 | 1993 | Ireland | 1 | 9 | 0 | 10 | 1998 | Italy | 12 | 0 | 1 | 11 | 1995 | Luxembourg | 3 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1997 | Netherlands | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2001 | Austria | 3 | 5 | 0 | 8 | 1995 | Portugal | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 1996 | Finland | 6 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 1995 | Sweden | 21 | 1 | 11 | 11 | 1995 | United kingdom | 7 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 1995 | Total | 107 | 41 | 37 | 111 | | | 4.15.
For other cases, the Commission will examine the possibility and opportuneness of introducing, for instance into Council Regulation (EC) No 1553/89, an instrument of the kind suggested by the Court. | GNI own resource 4.16.
As regards the GNI own resource, there was still insufficient verification by the Commission of the underlying national accounts that form the basis for the figures forwarded in the GNI questionnaires [12].
During 2005 Commission inspections as part of supervisory and control systems were limited to desk checks [13] in respect of the quality and consistency of data in the annual GNI questionnaires submitted by Member States. 4.16.
This approach makes the data adequate for provisional use in the budgetary calculations, taking account of existing reservations for Member States.
Resource constraints must be taken into account in this exercise. | 4.17.
In its Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004 [14] the Court drew attention to some weaknesses in the quality reports submitted by Member States.
The Commission will have to put in place a further reservation applicable to all EU-15 Member States in respect of the inclusion of illegal activities in GNI, to allow adjustments to be made in the aggregates concerned, going back to the year 2002 [18]. 4.19.
According to Eurostat [20], the application of these new rules would result in a significant increase of GNI which varies across Member States and years, but roughly ranges between 0,5 and 2 %. | | 4.21.
In cases where modifications to the ESA 95 result in significant changes in the GNI, the Council is required to decide whether these modifications shall apply for the purpose of own resources on the basis of a proposal made by the Commission [21].
Although the decision setting new rules for the allocation of FISIM within ESA 95 had already been taken in 2002, the Commission has not yet presented any proposal for FISIM allocation for own resources purposes.
Such an allocation would have an impact on the incidence of the financial burden on the Member States. 4.21.
Statistical changes adopted by the EU in order to improve the methodology of ESA and achieve a more accurate comparison of economic activity among Member States should apply also to own resources payments, once agreed changes are applied in a uniform manner across Member States.
The Commission will therefore present a proposal to include allocated FISIM for GNI own resources when it considers that all Member States are able to implement this adjustment in a uniform manner. | Supervisory and control systems in Member States Traditional own resources 4.22.
In one Member State [25] the intervals between customs audits of economic operators could routinely exceed three years, thus putting traditional own resources at risk because of time-barring. 4.22.
In 2005 the examination was extended to six more Member States [26] and a number of weaknesses were identified in the following areas: (a) the performance of a formal and structured risk analysis in respect of the process of national accounts compilation [27]; (b) the existence of agreements or equivalent arrangements between national accounts departments and units providing basic statistical data, which set out the conditions for the delivery and the quality of data [28]; (c) the systematic production of %quot%quality reports%quot% accompanying statistical surveys [29]; (d) the performance of internal audits on the process of statistical data collection and compilation [30]. 4.23.
See reply to 4.25. | 4.24.
The implementation by Member States of supervisory and control systems in respect of national accounts compilation could further reinforce this assurance.
Taking into account the scope of the audit (see paragraph 4.3) and with the exception of the B-account matters noted in paragraphs 4.6 to 4.7, the Court found that in all material respects the systems for customs supervision were satisfactory, the accounts recording traditional own resources were reliable and the underlying transactions were legal and regular. | | 4.27.
There is a transitional period for the changes ending in 2009.
Taking into account the scope of the audit as set out in paragraph 4.5 the Court found that, on the basis of data supplied by Member States, the VAT and GNI resources in all material respects were correctly calculated, collected and entered in the Community accounts by the Commission. | | 4.29.
Resource constraints must be taken into account in these control exercises. | (b) further encourage Member States to undertake actions allowing reservations to be lifted (see paragraphs 4.18 to 4.19); (b) At the GNI Committee meeting on 3 and 4 July 2006 the Commission further encouraged Member States to accelerate work aimed at having their reservations lifted. | (c) formulate more precise guidelines in respect of the reporting on results of investigations on the quality of GNI and its components (see paragraph 4.17); (c) The GNI Committee meeting on 3 and 4 July 2006 addressed the issue of GNI quality investigations at national level.
To recognise the uncertainty of recovery, the Commission enters in its balance-sheet a write-down, based since 2004 on estimates provided by the Member States. | | 4.32.
Under the Community Customs Code additional customs duty cannot normally be charged more than three years after the original customs debt was incurred.

The Court analysed the inspection statistics of IACS for all Member States and audited its implementation in a number of old Member States as well as in five [11] of the eight new Member States that have opted for SAPS and in the two new Member States [12] that have opted for the traditional direct aid schemes (see Annexes 5.2 and 5.3). | | Area aid 5.7.
The Court analysed the IACS inspection results of Member States for the 2004 area declarations (for payments in 2005) (see Table 5.2).
For all Member States together, 40 % of the applications checked contained errors.
For EU-15 this latter percentage has increased from 1,8 % in 2003 to 2,2 % in 2004, which thereby exceeded the 2 % materiality threshold [13] set at Commission level.
For the 14 Member States that have implemented IACS satisfactorily, their random checks showed an error rate of 1,95 %. 5.7.
The Commission has not set a 2 % materiality level that could be considered as an acceptable error rate for expenditure.
The threshold of 2 % (expressed in financial terms applied per ABB activity and not excluding other specific thresholds) is only used in case of significant deficiencies not compensated by financial correction procedures.
NB 2: Test performed in year N are relevant to payments made in year N + 1.
The Commission's audits have shown that certain Member States recorded remote sensing controls as random controls, although the farmers had been selected on a risk basis within the zone.
As regards the difference in results between the two types of selection, filtering out the bias resulting from this incorrect reporting, the Commission's analysis shows that only in Denmark and to a lesser extent Ireland, the results of the random selection are higher than those of the risk based selection (no account is taken of GR). | 5.9.
Like last year, some 40 % of the payments tested by the Court were found to contain overdeclarations of the area claimed for the fields measured.
Around one in three payments was affected by relatively small errors of measurement and a small number of cases were affected by larger errors. 5.9.
This action plan covers the deficiencies mentioned by the Court.
Many of these changes are irregular but cannot be precisely quantified; (c) The Commission has repeatedly criticised the role of the farmer's unions in the claim procedure, and formally required the authorities in June 2004 to implement a new procedure.
In Slovenia, however, if the area is overclaimed, the 4 % tolerance is incorrectly applied, leading to overpayments. 5.11.
The Commission services already detected this point during their enquiry in March 2005 and informed the Member State by letter in September 2005.
This point and other findings are subject to clearance of accounts procedures. | The Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) in the New Member States 5.12.
In so far as agricultural parcels fall within the reference parcel or block and the total eligible area of the reference parcel is not exceeded, the eligibility of the agricultural parcel is in principle established.
The Commission performed on-the-spot audits in each of the new Member States in the period 2004 to 2005 and, although establishing weaknesses in some Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), it is reasonably satisfied with the degree of implementation in the first years.
However, the functioning of the cross-checks depends on the quality of the data recorded in the system for the identification of agricultural parcels, and so in the framework of their audits the Commission has underlined the need for a reduction in block sizes and outlined ways in which this might be achieved.
The financial impact of this error cannot be quantified. 5.15.
From the sample of 20 SAPS transactions randomly selected by the Court, five overpayments were found, with a significant level of error.
The Commission will examine the findings of the Court of Auditors. | Animal premiums 5.21.
However, for Italy, Malta and Slovenia it is very high (for the suckler cow premium in Italy, 11,4 % and in Slovenia, 48,2 %, and for the special beef premium in Malta, 11,8 %, in Italy, 21,8 % and in Slovenia, 56,2 %). 5.21.
NB 2: Test performed in year N are relevant to payments made in year N + 1.
For the sheep and goat premiums the number of overclaimed animals decreased from 8,2 % in 2003 to 6,3 %.
As regards the findings for Italy and Slovenia, reference is made to the response to point 5.20.
Overall, the Court’s own testing does not provide evidence which significantly differs from the IACS statistics. | | Olive oil 5.25.
The Court has examined nine olive oil production aid payments in Spain, Greece and Italy [24] — these Member States have declared some 2000 million euro.
Commission audits conducted in the context of the clearance of accounts procedure since 2003 have established similar shortcomings in the Member States audited by the Court, concerning the updating of the olive GIS, the application of sanctions to the mills and the use of the olive GIS to control the yields or apply the regulatory sanctions to the producers over-declaring the number of olive trees.
Member States have been informed and the clearance of Accounts procedure is currently ongoing.
When the expenditure for the new schemes is made, the risk to the EAGGF will be evaluated and may give rise to financial corrections. | 5.27.
The Commission will examine in detail the problems identified by the Court when the replies from the Member States have been received. | Temporary Rural Development Instrument for new Member States 5.30.
The new Member States have a specific rural development regime [26], to support the four so-called %quot%accompanying measures%quot% [27], and some specific rural development measures [28] (payments in 2005 amounted to 1069 million euro). | | 5.31.
The financially most important measure in Poland is Less-Favoured Areas, for which 225,8 million euro was paid in 2005.
These verifications found a high level of non-compliance with the standards; 3281 farms (9,6 % of the farms checked) had one or more infringements. | | 5.32.
This problem has already been identified by the Commission, and a clearance of accounts procedure is already underway and may result in financial corrections. | Export refunds 5.33.
In 2005 refunds accounted for some 3 billion euro, or 7,5 % of CAP expenditure.
Member States are required to physically check 5 % of exports to ensure that they are correctly described and entitled to the export refund claimed.
Two enquiries have meanwhile been closed without a financial correction (Poland, Lithuania).
For the remaining enquiries, where deficiencies have been identified, clearance of accounts procedures are under way (Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, France, Spain, Germany, United Kingdom) and may result in financial corrections. | 5.35.
on which refunds are paid (Belgium, Germany, France [32], Italy [32], United Kingdom [32]); (b) The Commission services will examine the Court's findings and Member State replies and take appropriate action. | (c) excessive numbers of physical checks had been carried out on consignments for which the refund claim was less than 200 euro [33].
According to the rules, these transactions should be excluded unless they are to prevent fraud and abuse; (c) The Commission services verify this aspect as a routine part of their audits on physical checks.
The Commission considers that systematic seal checks by customs at the entrance to ports are useful, but can be compensated if the information and assurance available to customs services from other sources is sufficient. | 5.36.
Furthermore, the Court is not in a position to confirm that checks have been carried out in the required number in respect of the 2005 EAGGF year and have been verified and potential corrections made, as this information is not made available to the Commission until after 30 April 2006. 5.36.
As regards the other weaknesses identified by the Court, the Commission will examine the Court's findings and the replies from the Member States and, if necessary, take appropriate action. | Ex-post scrutiny of subsidies paid to traders and processors 5.37.
The reporting has been further improved by the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 40/2006, permitting the potential level of irregularities to be estimated for all categories of expenditure. | (b) had again carried out specific missions to three Member States to examine the implementation of the Regulation.
The conformity units have continued in 2006 to check the application of Regulation (EC) No 4045/89 as part of their missions covering specific sector related issues. | (c) has started an exercise to assess the extent of the backlog of planned checks in certain Member States (highlighted in previous Court reports).
Recovery of irregular payments is not the responsibility of those carrying out post-payment checks but of the paying agencies.
As regards the persistent delays in the execution of controls in two Member States, the Commission has initiated remedial action, as described in the response to point 5.38 (c). | 5.40.
The results will be reported to the Commission by 1 January 2008 at the latest.
Moreover, Regulation (EC) No 4045/89 provides for an ex-post control system within the comprehensive system for the management and control of agriculture expenditure, as described in detail in the response to point 5.59.
The Court’s findings at the Commission and in the Member States show that, while the system of post-payment checks is improving, the backlog of checks not carried out in certain Member States limits the assurance that can be gained as to the legality and regularity of payments made in previous years in these Member States. 5.41.
The comprehensive system for the management and control of agricultural expenditure, as described in the response to point 5.59, provides reasonable assurance as to the effective management of the risk of error in the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in agriculture.
Regulation (EC) No 4045/89 provides for an ex-post control system which is actually an additional level of controls to the pre-payment checks. | The Commission's clearance of accounts 5.42.
One of the elements considered by the Commission to be of major importance for an adequate control of shared management in the agricultural domain is the audit work carried out by the clearance of accounts units, which leads to the financial and conformity clearance decisions taken by the Commission. | | 5.43.
The Commission's annual clearance decision is limited to the accounts and is dealt with in Chapter 1.
Notwithstanding the clearance of accounts process, the Commission considers that the expenditure does not have a provisional character. | Certifying bodies 5.44.
The Commission takes the view that there is a comprehensive system for the management and control of agricultural expenditure, as described in detail in the response to point 5.59, already provides reasonable assurance as to the effective management of the risk of error in the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in agriculture.
With respect to the paying agencies’ internal control systems the Court’s analysis of the reports of 31 paying agencies [40] has shown that most of the major deficiencies found by the certifying bodies related to payment checks and procedures, accounting (including debtors) and delegation of functions [41]; four paying agencies were found with four or more major deficiencies relating to different accreditation criteria [42].
The Commission places reliance on the work of the certifying bodies by reviewing their reports and certificates but does not evaluate the work of the certifying bodies on the spot on a systematic basis [43]. 5.45.
Expenditure effected by paying agencies whose accreditation is maintained by their Member State although they have failed to implement such a remedial plan within the determined time limit will be subject to the conformity clearance procedure provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
Although a systematic review of the work of the certifying bodies was introduced by the end of 2005, the Commission has visited on-the-spot and reviewed the work of certifying bodies since the introduction of the new clearance of accounts procedure in 1996.
Conformity decisions have the objective of excluding expenditure from Community financing where the Commission has found it has not been in compliance with Community rules.
The procedures in place are not designed to ensure that this objective is achieved at the level of payments made to final beneficiaries (farmers and traders).
These decisions are in most cases flat-rate corrections for weaknessess in the control systems rather than an assessment of the impact of the individual irregular payments.
Therefore, irregular payments are unlikely to be recovered through the clearance of accounts procedure.
In contrast, it is not a mechanism by which irregular payments to beneficiaries are recovered, which according to the principle of shared management is the sole responsibility of the Member States, as clearly stated in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
For example, for area aids, the error estimated on the basis of around 47000 random controls carried out by Member States is 1,95 %.
In order to improve and reinforce the overall system for providing reasonable assurance, the Commission is prepared to implement the Court's recommendation that the certifying bodies should do more work to verify and validate inspection's statistics and post-payment checks (see reply to paragraph 5.44).
The cost of these corrections is borne by the Member States and do not, in most cases, directly affect those who have received the subsidy (farmers and traders). | | 5.48.
The situation in June 2006 is that 97 % of the audits carried out in 2001 (which allow financial corrections back to 1999) and 94 % of the audits carried out in 2002 (which allow financial corrections back to 2000) have been closed.
The still outstanding financial corrections for the years 1999 and 2000 are estimated at a maximum of, respectively, 41 and 126 million euro.
For the audits carried out in 2003 and 2004, the closure rates are, respectively, 83 % and 84 %.
In 2005 the Court carried out an audit of the Commission's Clearance of Accounts units which included the allocation of staff and an assessment of a sample of conformity audits carried out in 2004 and 2005 respectively [44]. | | 5.50.
The result has been, over several years, movements of resources between teams and units and the evaluation of the allocation of personnel is an ongoing process. | (b) for six of the conformity audits examined not all relevant risks and key controls had been covered and this without adequate justification; (b) The Commission's audit work in the field of agricultural expenditure, which in 2004 and 2005 included, respectively 177 and 163 on-the-spot missions, is based on available human resources and a risk analysis.
On this basis the responsible directorate selects certain risks and key controls to be checked, which are considered most appropriate for the enquiry in question.
Such a scope limitation is a perfectly normal and accepted audit practice.
In three of the six cases raised by the Court, the scope limitation was explicitly provided for in the Mission Planning Memorandum.
The Court confirms the conclusions set out in the report, finalised in 2004 [45], of the Commission's Internal Audit Capability for Agriculture.
The Commission remains convinced that the conformity audits are a key element in the overall system for the management and control of agricultural expenditure, as described in detail in the response to point 5.59, and that its audit work is of sufficient quality to contribute to the assurance derived from that system.
The Commission takes the view that for the agricultural expenditure managed and controlled by the IACS the situation is satisfactory, the risks identified by the Court being concentrated on the other CAP measures.
At the moment, IACS covers some 67 % of EAGGF Guarantee expenditure.
The CAP reforms of 2003 and 2004 reduce the overall risk even further by extending the expenditure covered by IACS to around 89 % by 2013.
The systems in place allow the risk of error in the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions to be managed in an effective manner.
CAP expenditure managed and controlled by IACS amounts to 25500 million euro in EU-15 and 1400 million euro in the New Member States.
The Commission considers that it has a comprehensive system for the management and control of agricultural expenditure, as described in detail in the response to point 5.59 and which includes, in particular, the IACS, already provides reasonable assurance as to the effective management of the risk of error in the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions in agriculture.
However, in order to improve and reinforce the overall system for providing reasonable assurance even further, the Commission is prepared to implement the Court's recommendation that the certifying bodies should do more work (see reply to paragraph 5.44). | 5.55.
The Commission considers the clearance of accounts system to be an effective and efficient tool for excluding expenditure from Community financing which does not comply with Community rules.
The Commission considers the total financial corrections in respect of a given year, together with the sanctions imposed on final beneficiaries at national level, to give a valuable estimate of the overall level of irregular payments. | 5.57.
The Commission's conformity decisions are not complete for any year later than 1998.
Since these decisions for 2005 expenditure will be taken in the future, the expenditure is provisional and assurance as to the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the Community accounts can only be provided once a full clearance procedure is in place and applied. 5.57.
The situation in June 2006 is that 97 % of the audits carried out in 2001 (which allow financial corrections back to 1999) and 94 % of the audits carried out in 2002 (which allow financial corrections back to 2000) have been closed.
The still outstanding financial corrections for the years 1999 and 2000 are estimated at a maximum of, respectively, 41 and 126 million euro.
For the audits carried out in 2003 and 2004, the closure rates are, respectively, 83 % and 84 %.
For the financial years 2001 to 2005, the corrections to be decided in future conformity decisions is clearly set out in the Annual Activity Report 2005.
The Commission should continue to support the respective Member State's authorities in order to ensure that IACS is fully implemented in Greece and that the weaknesses found in the new Member States are remedied. | | 5.59.
The decision for issuing the accreditation is based on a detailed review by an external audit body; (b) detailed systems for controls and dissuasive sanctions to be applied by those paying agencies, with common basis features and special rules tailored to the specificities of each aid regime; (c) ex-post controls through certified audit bodies and special departments (checks under Regulation (EC) No 4045/89); (d) clearance of accounts through the Commission (both annual financial clearance and multiannual conformity clearance).
In order to improve and reinforce the overall system for providing reasonable assurance, the Commission is prepared to implement the Court's recommendation that the certifying bodies should do more work to verify and validate inspection's statistics and post-payment checks (see reply to paragraph 5.44). | 5.60.
As indicated last year, the Commission should make post-payment checks a more valuable tool in the identification of irregular CAP payments by addressing the deficiencies in the data requested from Member States, notably by reporting on the value of transactions tested and irregularities detected by budget line. 5.60.
The improvements relating to the value of transactions tested and irregularities by budget line have been included in the amendments to Regulation (EC) No 4/2004, introduced by Regulation (EC) No 40/2006 which has been published on 10 January 2006. | 5.61.
The Commission should investigate why, for IACS checks on areas, tests performed on a random basis continue to show a higher level of error than those selected on the basis of risk analysis. 5.61.
The Commission's audits have shown that certain Member States recorded remote sensing controls with the random controls although they have selected the farmers on a risk basis within the zone.
As regards the difference in results between the two types of selection, filtering out the bias resulting from this incorrect reporting, the Commission's analysis shows that only in DK the results of the random selection are higher than those of the risk based selection (no account is taken of GR).
To enhance a more accurate reporting, the Commission has already taken further action (see paragraph 5.8). | 5.62.
As requested by the Council [47], the Commission should distinguish on the one hand between expenditure which has been verified (and has been the subject of corrections, where necessary) for which it can give reasonable (or no) assurance and, on the other hand, expenditure which is subject to further verification (and possible correction at a later stage) (see also paragraphs 1.57 and 1.64 to 1.66 of the present report). 5.63.
Moreover, in its annual accounts, the Commission makes the necessary disclosure for the amounts which it still expects to be recovered through the clearance of accounts process. | FOLLOW-UP OF PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS Rural development: support for less-favoured areas 5.64.
The contract to carry out this evaluation study was signed in December 2005 and the report is planned to be finalised by the end of 2006 and published in early 2007. | | 5.66.
The new Regulation on support for rural development for the period 2007 to 2013 [50] includes the measures for less-favoured areas, and the discharge authority's other two requests were addressed in this framework. | | 5.67.
However, with the exception of the cross-compliance requirement, the entry into force of all other changes to the less-favoured areas measure has been postponed until 1 January 2010 and will require the adoption of a Council regulation based on a proposal from the Commission.
Concerning the definition of less-favoured areas, the Commission proposal COM(2004) 490 final for the future rural development framework contained a proposition for a reclassification of the %quot%intermediate category%quot% of LFAs.
Following the conclusions of the Council on the Special Report No 6/2004 of the Court the Commission has developed further guidance in close cooperation with the Member States.
With the preparation of an appropriate legislative proposal the Commission intends to consider also the exchange of information between national databases. | 5.71.
As part of the 2003 discharge procedure, the Council [51] sought greater harmonisation between databases in the Member States.
The European Parliament [52] invited the Commission to submit a legislative proposal to ensure compatibility between the national databases, and to provide guidance on exchanges of data. | | 5.72.
The fact that 17 Member States have decided to implement the decoupled single payment scheme without maintaining the slaughter premium has contributed to make the information on the trade of animals for slaughter less important. | 5.75.
Once the situation as regards implementation of the reform has been stabilised, the conditions for applying the slaughter premium in intra-Community trade must be examined from both the standpoint of trade between Member States which apply the %quot%coupled%quot% slaughter premium and that of trade between these Member States and those which have decoupled this premium. | SPECIAL REPORTS ISSUED SINCE THE LAST ANNUAL REPORT 5.76.
The Court has published two special reports relevant to agriculture in the last twelve months: (a) Rural Development Investments: Do they effectively address the problems of rural areas? (Special Report No 7/2006); (b) Growing Success?

The paying agencies concerned declared some 7418 million euro which are to be further analysed by the Commission. [43] In 2005 only the certifying body for OPEKEPE was evaluated on the spot.

It has made regulatory changes to improve the reporting, but the effects are not yet known (5.38). | The Commision should improve the format of the reporting of the results of all supervisory systems. | (b)in 2003 the Court concluded that only one in three post-payment checks for eleven Member States was wholly satisfactory.
The Commission's response in 2004 has been to visit three Member States, the first visits since 2001; | (b)The Commission considers that due to the complexity of post-payment checks, there might often be a margin for improvement without putting into question the value of the checks carried out.In 2004, DG AGRI carried out three missions on the application of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 to cover the general aspects, i.e.
On this basis the shortfall is less than 40 %. | The Commision has started an exercise to assess the extent of the failure to complete the planned checks in certain Member States (highlighted in previous Court reports).
During 2004 the Commission adopted a regulation requiring Member States to report this information with effect from the 2005 report.
The Court hopes that this regulation will effectively remedy these deficiencies (4.13 and 4.52-4.53). | Following the Court's recommendation, the Commission responded by adopting Regulation (EC) No 1454/2004, which stipulates that, as from 2005, the value of transactions checked as well as irregularities exceeding the amount of 200 euro have to be communicated by Member States. | The weaknesses found by the Commission during audits in Member States in 2004 have not yet been the subject of a final decision on whether or not a financial correction should be imposed (5.34). | | Rural development | Most entitlements to rural development support are dependent on respect of commitments entered into by the beneficiaries, such as respect of good farming practices.
The Court's Special report on agri-environment measures concludes that the verification of such expenditure poses particular problems and that it can rarely lead to reasonable assurance at a reasonable cost (4.48). | The control of agri-environment measures is, due to its complexity, resource intensive both in technical and financial terms.
For ovine premiums the administration systematically calculated too small a reduction. | 7 | If the area claimed exceeds the area measured by more than the measurement tolerance, the area accepted for payment is considered to be the area measured increased by the tolerance margin of 4 %. | 8 | Special premium and slaughter premium was granted from Community funds for bovine animals that had been slaughtered prior to the accession to the European Union.
For the previous funding period the Commission approved 1104 Structural Funds programmes and 920 Cohesion Fund projects.
Projects under the Cohesion Fund range from 50000 euro to just over 1 billion euro. | | +++++ TIFF +++++ Figure 6.1a — Breakdown of payments for structural operations by policy area in 2005Regional policy 58 %Employment and social policy 29 %Rural development 11 %Fisheries 2 % | +++++ TIFF +++++ Figure 6.1b — Breakdown of payments for structural operations by objective in 2005Source: Commission annual accounts 2005.Objective 1 63 %Objective 2 12 %Objective 3 11 %Cohesion Fund 7 %Community Initiatives 6 %Other 1 % | SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE Specific characteristics of structural operations 6.6.Community financing of a structural operations programme or project takes the form of an advance payment followed by the reimbursement to the Member State of costs reported by the project promoter [1].
Thus, the Commission remains ultimately responsible for the regularity of structural operations expenditure. | | 6.8.In summary, there is a large number of programmes and projects which are implemented over several years, a large number of eligibility conditions which are sometimes open to divergent interpretations, and a variety of entities which intervene in the management process.
The Commission's Action Plan towards an integrated internal control framework (COM(2006) 9) includes further measures to strengthen shared management. | The Court's audit 6.9.The Court audited 16 Structural Funds programmes: six programmes from the previous funding period and 10 programmes from the current funding period.
The Commission agrees with the Court on the key importance of these checks and has recently issued to Member States a note setting out good practice based on the results of its own audits. | 6.19.
However, Table 6.1 shows that in seven cases this interim certification of expenditure was not carried out as required.
In two out of the seven programmes concerned, the Court found that the systems partly complied with the requirements.
The Commission recently issued a note to Member States setting out good practice in relation to the certification function based on the findings of Commission audits in Member States. | 6.20.
Table 6.1 shows that in six programmes audited the preparation for validation of the final payment is satisfactory. | | Previous Structural Funds programmes Failure to make corrections and lengthy delays in closing programmes 6.22.
In 2005, the Commission continued to make closing payments to Structural Funds programmes from the previous funding period.
Table 6.2 shows that a significant number of programmes remained open at the end of March 2006. 6.23.
In its audit of the closure process, the Court found three cases where the Commission closed programmes without making any financial correction despite there being significant reservations on the certified expenditure. 6.24.
The most frequently occuring errors were similar to those found in the sample of current programmes (paragraph 6.14). 6.26.
For three programmes in the audit sample (ERDF Objective 1 Ireland (Industrial Development), ESF Objective 1 Germany (Sachsen) and ESF Objective 3 Sweden) some of the beneficiaries selected for audit had not retained the supporting evidence for their declared expenditure [5]. 6.27.
These deficiencies in control impaired the reliability of the final expenditure declarations made by the Member States. 6.29.
The Commission is following up these audits with financial corrections of the irregular expenditure.
Corrections will be extrapolated when the level of errors is material or where there are systemic problems. | The Cohesion Fund 6.30.
When Member States make such corrections, they may substitute the irregular amounts with other eligible expenditure in order to avoid a net loss. 6.31.
In such cases, corrected expenditure may not be substituted by other eligible expenditure, leading to a net reduction in the Structural Funds contribution (net financial correction). | | Limited extent of net financial corrections 6.33.
A total of 1,4 billion euro of financial corrections were applied to Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund 2000 to 2006 programmes and projects up to the end of 2005.
Making such corrections can be a lengthy process and can take up to two years. 6.33.
Having regard to the rights of the Member State as auditee to reply to audit findings and the procedure for financial corrections laid down in the applicable regulations, a time lag between audit findings and financial corrections is unavoidable. | 6.34.
The Commission uses this information in its risk assessment and audit planning. | 6.37.
The Court obtained audit evidence which indicates that in budget year 2005 Structural Funds expenditure was not free of material errors (paragraphs 6.13 to 6.15 and 6.26 to 6.28). | | 6.39.
The Commission has taken steps to mitigate the risks and to carry out effective supervision of the performance by Member States of their management and control functions under shared management in the following ways: execution of systems audits up to the end of 2005, audits have been carried out on 274 programmes in the original 15 Member States representing 62 % of the total Structural Funds contribution; application of action plans in Member States to rectify systems deficiencies detected; stopping the certification of expenditure pending the correction of serious deficiencies entailing a significant risk in payment claims; enforcing financial corrections for individual errors or system deficiencies found in audit work; providing guidance on key controls promoting improved reporting of audit results of national auditors — bilateral meetings with all 25 Member States held in 2005.
It is inherent in the system of shared management that certain errors and deficiencies will only be detected by the Commisssion after reimbursement of the expenditure concerned.
The financial correction mechanism, as well as the programme closure procedure, provide a means for rectifying irregular payments. | 6.40.
Concerning the procedures for making financial corrections, the Commission remarks that the Member States make financial corrections as a result of their own and the Commission's audit work.
The Commission applies a multiannual strategy for its audit work to take account of different priorities during the cycle of programme implementation and the fact that it has obligations for three different programme periods at the same time.
The Commission considers that the main incentive to improve systems is effective audit work and timely follow up to ensure that recommendations are implemented.
Financial correction decisions are an important measure to enable the Commission to fulfil its responsibilities but should normally need to be applied only as a last resort. | 6.44.
The Commission agrees that the challenge is to ensure the effective application of the control mechanisms.
The results of the Court's follow-up of the principal observations in recent Annual Reports are in Annex 6.1. | | 6.47.
The Court has issued two Special Reports on structural operations since its last Annual Report: - Special Report No 1/2006 on the contribution of the European Social Fund in combating early school leaving; and - Special Report No 10/2006 on ex-post evaluations of Objectives 1 and 3 programmes 1994 to 1999 (Structural Funds). | | [1] Project promoters range from private individuals to associations, private or public companies to local, regional or national bodies. [2] Structural Funds objectives have since been regrouped for the 2000 to 2006 programme period. [3] For multifund programmes, each Fund part of a programme is counted separately. [4] The programmes audited were: ERDF Objective 1 programmes in Spain, Ireland (Industrial Development) and Portugal (Regional Development); ESF Objective 1 Germany (Sachsen), ESF Objective 3 Sweden and EAGGF-Guidance Objective 5a Denmark (Improving Efficiency of Agricultural Structures). [5] The Commission has proposed to relax the provisions concerning the time period for retention of supporting documents for the next programming period (2007 to 2013).
The Court has continued to find material weaknesses in the supervisory and control systems (paragraphs 6.16-6.21 and 6.29-6.30). (See also Annual Report concerning the financial year 2001, paragraphs 3.56 to 3.64; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2002, paragraphs 5.22 to 5.32; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2003, paragraphs 5.12 to 5.27 and 5.41 to 5.56; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004, paragraphs 5.19 to 5.27 and 5.35 to 5.36). | For the expenditure of the 1994 to 1999 period, the Commission has implemented a closure strategy, involving pre-closure compliance audits, checking by the independent body of declarations accompanying final payment claims and ex post audits of closed programmes.
The Commission has provided some guidance and in 2005 has issued examples of good practice in the area of management checks. | The Commission should intensify its checks of projects for the 2000 to 2006 period and increase coordination between the structural measures Directorates-General in matters of management and control.
Unjustified delays have occurred (paragraphs 6.22-6.25). (See also Annual Report concerning the financial year 2002, paragraphs 5.36 to 5.38; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2003, paragraphs 5.28 to 5.39; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004, paragraphs 5.28 to 5.34). | The Commission has implemented a closure strategy and, in some cases, has made financial corrections.
The Commission has formulated a guidance note for the closure of programmes from the 2000 to 2006. | The weaknesses identified in the closure process for 1994 to 1999 programmes need to be addressed before the closure of programmes of the current period begins. | The Commission has succeeded in closing the large majority of programmes.
For the 2000 to 2006 period closure, the Commission has already discussed the preparations with Member States and is about to issue a detailed guidance document. | Improvements necessary in the internal control environment of the Commission Further measures need to be taken by the structural measures Directorates-General in order to comply with the internal control standards (paragraphs 2.21-2.23).

(See also Annual Report concerning the financial year 2002, paragraphs 5.10 to 5.14 and 5.21; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2003, paragraphs 5.40 and 5.57 to 5.62; Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004, paragraphs 5.39 to 5.45). | The structural measures Directorates-General have continued to examine the management and control systems in view of fulfilling the regulatory requirement to satisfy themselves that the systems meet the required standards. | The shortcomings noted by the Court in the application of supervisory controls by the Commission have to be addressed before the Commission can achieve greater assurance on the operation of the systems. | The Directorates-General continue to increase their level of assurance on systems in Member States through their own audit work, improved coordination with national control bodies, and dissemination of guidance and good practices.
Since 2003, the Commission has initiated action plans aimed at reducing the risk of overstatement of cost declarations. | | +++++ TIFF +++++ Graph 7.1 — Breakdown of commitments by budgetary area in 2005Source: 2005 annual accounts.Total commitments — 9548,6 million euroResearch and technological developmentConsumers, internal market, industry and networksTraining, youth and social operationsEnergy, Euratom and the environmentOther structural operations58 %17 %17 %5 %3 % | +++++ TIFF +++++ Graph 7.2 — Breakdown of payments by budgetary area in 2005Source: 2005 annual accounts.Total payments — 7972,1 million euroResearch and technological developmentConsumers, internal market, industry and networksTraining, youth and social operationsEnergy, Euratom and the environmentOther structural operations57 %19 %18 %4 %2 % | SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE Audit scope 7.4.The audit focused on the following:(a)a sample of commitments and payments authorised in 2005;(b)the steps taken by the Commission to reduce over-declarations of costs;(c)the way selected supervisory and control systems work:the system of audit certificates introduced for the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development (FP6),an analysis of the evolution of the Commission's ex-post financial audits in the area of IP and a review of the ex-post audit function of Directorate-General for Education and Culture (DG EAC) and Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry (DG ENTR),DG EAC's supervisory and control systems for actions implemented by National Agencies (NAs). | | Legality and regularity of transactions 7.5.The Court examined a sample of 11 commitments and 69 payments made by the Commission during 2005.
For 22 payments the review of the legality and regularity of the underlying transaction was extended to include an audit at final beneficiary level.
The Court also tested 13 of these payments in order to assess the audit certificate system. | | Material level of errors in costs declared by the beneficiaries 7.6.The Court detected an overall material level of errors in three quarters of the transactions audited at final beneficiary level.
Average rates can be accepted provided they are calculated according to a consistent methodology which does not generate average rates that are systematically higher than the actual costs. | (c)unjustified allocation of indirect costs to the action; | (c)According to the explanations given by concerned beneficiaries, the Commission will take the appropriate actions. | (d)claims of costs which do not meet the eligibility criteria. | (d)The Commission will examine the Court's findings and take appropriate action. | Frequent absence of a reliable time recording system 7.7.In 5 out of 22 payments audited at beneficiary level, the Court had reservations about the quality of the time records.
Progress will continue in the frame of the Commission's action plan towards an integrated internal control framework (COM(2006) 9 of 17 January 2006).The Commission welcomes the encouragement of the Court.
For one TEN-T transaction, the EU contribution was 50 % instead of the 10 % ceiling stipulated in the rules, leading to an overpayment of 146 million euro.
The Court observes that these payments took the form of contributions to capital in accordance with the statutes of the GJU (Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002), while they were managed as TEN-T grants, although the TEN-T legal base does not allow contributions to capital. | 7.9.Two of the errors detected by the Court result from weaknesses in the management of contract amendments.
For two additional cases, the Commission disagrees about the level of Community contribution applicable to the audited beneficiary.The TEN-T transaction concerns the ERTMS project [5] for which, between 1995 and 2003, a total of EUR 182,7 million was granted through 10 subsequent Commission decisions, covering 50 % of related studies costs.
These 10 Commission decisions clearly indicate that their subject are studies which can benefit from a rate of co-financing of up to 50 % of the cost, as long as the overall support throughout the lifetime of the project remains within 10 % of the total project cost.
The Commission interprets the rules in force in the sense of a project including the whole deployment phase following the study phase.
The cost of the project has thus been estimated at EUR 5000 million (COM(2005) 298).
The amount spent on studies is within the limit of 10 %.
The Commission considers that this fact and other operational arguments allow it to confirm the grant nature of the EU fund. | 7.10.Tests by the Court on the sample of payments revealed that 11 payments had been made late.
In 2005 a common methodology has been developed by Commission services in the research area in line with the Commission Synthesis Report 2004 in order to harmonise the assessment of errors arising during the execution of the programme by Commission services.
At present, a common audit policy of the Research DGs is developed within the research family, and DG ENV is elaborating an ex post audit plan as well as a reserve audit list for each year.
This audit plan is based on internal risk assessment criteria and takes into consideration the audit requests of the operational units and is sent to those units, once approved, for information. | (d)implementing a common IT system for FP6 [7]; | (d)The Commission's corporate IT systems for the management of FP6 support the management of research projects in research DGs while respecting the organisation of the Commission's services.
The Court analysed this certification system in order to assess the contribution that it can provide to the assurance regarding the legality and the regularity of the underlying transactions. | | Complexity of FP6 financial provisions affects audit certification system 7.16.The FP6 funding schemes remain complicated.
This will be done in the light of the experience gained. | High frequency of material errors despite unqualified audit certificates 7.17.The Court audited 16 cost claims for which an unqualified audit certificate has been issued.
It will be reviewed in the light of audits results, cost/benefit considerations, and as an element of the overall control strategy. | 7.20.The reduction in the number of ex-post audits is most significant in the Research area, where it fell from 313 in 2004 to 68 in 2005 (see Table 7.1 and Annex 7.1).
Furthermore, the procedures regarding the follow-up to audits were inadequate.
The Court and the Commission had already reported these weaknesses in DG EAC's ex-post audits [14].
However, the situation has not significantly improved since these observations were made. 7.22.
Their legal situation complicated in certain cases the recovery procedure.
DG EAC is establishing an action plan to improve the situation. | 7.23.
The Court found that the number of audits finalised in DG ENTR fell from 43 in 2004 to 8 in 2005, mainly as a result of operational delays in the implementation of the audits planned.
DG EAC entrusts the implementation of more than 60 % [15] of its budget to NAs.
In order to provide reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, DG EAC should monitor the management and control systems of the NAs. 7.24.
In its 2003 annual activity report, DG EAC made a reservation concerning the non-compliance with this requirement.
DG EAC explained the absence of a reservation for 2004 in the answer to the Court's analysis of the Annual Activity Report.
DG EAC made a reservation in the 2005 AAR concerning the management of the NAs.
The Court's review of a sample of system audit reports [17] revealed several weaknesses in them, such as inappropriate or inconsistent classification of the importance of findings as well as insufficient action to correct the weaknesses identified (see Annex 7.2 for the overall assessment of the Commission's supervisory and control systems relating to the National Agencies). 7.27.
Regarding the identified weaknesses DG EAC is taking appropriate action. | Conclusions and recommendations 7.28.
DG EAC seeks to allow for simple and clear rules to govern the implementation of its new programmes through the design of the legal base which also includes the use of lump sum financing arrangements where possible. | - ensure rigorous and cost-conscious implementation of key controls to reduce over-declarations (paragraphs 7.11-7.13); - This is the objective addressed by the roadmap to an integrated control framework described in paragraph 7.28. | - improve the scope, quality and follow-up of the systems audits of NAs (paragraphs 7.24-7.27); - DG EAC has taken the necessary steps to improve the overall quality of ongoing system audits of NAs working in the framework of the current programmes.
Supervisory and control systems — RTD framework programmes In 1998 the five Directorates-General operating the RTD framework programmes jointly formulated an audit approach, setting themselves for FP5 a target of auditing 10 % of the contractors (see the Annual Reports concerning the financial years 2001, 2002 and 2003, paragraph 6.30).
These audits are to a large extent carried out by external audit firms on behalf of the Commission.
In 2004 the Commission adopted a common audit approach for FP6.
Although the new framework contract for the audit of FP5 indirect RTD actions was signed in November 2004, the Commission has experienced operational problems leading to a drop in the number of audits carried out.
The award of a contract for the audit of FP6 indirect RTD actions was not finalised during 2005. | In the absence of a reconsideration of the overall target of auditing 10 % of FP5 contractors, the Commission should reinforce its audit activities in order to achieve its audit target for FP5 without affecting the number of audits on FP6.
The necessary measures should be taken to ensure that the target set by DG TREN is reached. | In 2004, when DG TREN started auditing Trans-European network projects (TEN) the sample initially selected covered more than 35% of the total costs of the projects finalised in 2003.
DG TREN decided to stick to its audit policy of auditing a large part of the budget and to cover as many beneficiaries as possible but with a risk based approach and with reasonable audit costs. | For TEN-T actions, eligible and ineligible costs are defined in the legal basis and the Commission Decisions (Annual Reports 2001 and 2002).
A new model Commission Decision was adopted in 2004, including a definition of eligible and ineligible costs and a modified definition of studies and works. | A further step was taken for new projects in 2005 with the inclusion in the decision text of binding models for the financial and technical reporting. | As proposed by the Court, in order to avoid financing construction works at the increased rate for studies, clear definitions of the scope of the two main forms of aid, %quot%studies%quot% and %quot%works%quot%, still remain to be transposed into the legal basis and the financing decisions. | DG TREN already introduced clear definitions in the decision text of binding models for the financial and technical reporting.
The new draft TEN regulation (applicable in 2007) contains clear definitions of works and studies. | -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 7.2 Supervisory and control systems A Works well, few or minor improvements required.

The contracted audit firm and the contractual conditions were subject to change in the middle of the reporting period in order to improve the quality of the audits and the reports.
The Directorate-General for %quot%Humanitarian Aid%quot% (DG ECHO) and %quot%Enlargement%quot% (DG ELARG) are responsible for both the formulation of the policy and the strategy as well as for its implementation; DG ECHO for humanitarian aid and DG ELARG for CARDS [2].
Diagrams III and IV of Annex I show the funds spent in 2005 for financial perspective Heading 4 %quot%External actions%quot% (commitments: 5516 million euro; payments: 5013 million euro).
The CARDS programme is implemented either through the EC Delegations (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia) or the European Agency for Reconstruction (Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo and FYROM). | | SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE Audit scope 8.2.The overall objective of the specific assessment was to provide a conclusion as to the legality and regularity of underlying transactions in external actions.
The part of CARDS which is implemented through the European Agency for Reconstruction [3] is the subject of a separate annual financial audit. | | 8.3.Most payments in the external actions field consists of advance payments made to project implementing organisations (international organisations, government institutions, NGOs or management units established for that purpose).
A material incidence of error was found in the transactions examined, such as the non-compliance with the prescribed contracting procedures (encountered in seven projects out of the 17 audited on-the-spot), ineligible expenditure (three out of 17) and insufficient supporting documentation (two out of 17). | 8.5.The Commission has continued to improve its supervisory and control system, in order to ensure the correct application of contractual procedures by beneficiaries.
The terms of reference for financial audits to be launched by beneficiaries have been revised so as to reinforce the verification of compliance with the contract terms including those relating to procurement and eligibility. | Supervisory and control systems Risk analysis EuropeAid cooperation Office at central level 8.6.EuropeAid made two risk analyses in 2005.
However, the analysis did not make reference to the findings of the Commission's own services or of those of project external auditors and to the analysis of risks for the different types of implementing organisations (NGO, international organisation, government institution, etc.) and funding method (grant, budgetary support, trust fund, etc.). | 8.6.The criteria mentioned by the Court are already taken into account by EuropeAid in its approach to risk management.
The Commission will endeavour to further reinforce the current mechanism and better communicate the basis of its analyses. | Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO) 8.7.DG ECHO's risk analysis concluded that, with the exception of the quality of the implementing partners, many risks were inherent to the provision of humanitarian aid and therefore beyond DG ECHO's control.
Projects managed by international organisations, representing a significant proportion of expenditure and requiring specific verification methodologies, were not included in the annual audit programme. | 8.14.In accordance with the financial regulations and international agreements currently in force, projects cofinanced with international organisations are subject to specific verification missions by Commission departments. | 8.15.In the countries visited by the Court, 13 external audit certification reports of projects were reviewed.
In 2006 EuropeAid has included standard terms of reference for external audits in its Practical Guide. | 8.15.The standard terms of reference for external audits introduced through the 2006 revision of the Practical Guide, specifically address compliance with the contract terms including those relating to tendering procedures launched by beneficiaries. | Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (DG ECHO) 8.16.DG ECHO has a comprehensive approach for auditing its implementing partners.
Where relevant, some tasks can be rolled forward to the following year. | Decentralisation under CARDS 8.19.The management of one CARDS project in Albania and seven projects in Croatia had been decentralised to national implementing agencies with ex-ante control of procurement and award decisions.
Before the decentralisation, however, the management capacity of these implementing agencies had not been assessed according to the rules set out in Article 53 and 164 of the Financial Regulation.
However, a material incidence of error with financial impact was detected in the sample tested at the level of the project implementing organisations (see paragraph 8.5).
The Commission is aware of the risks at project implementing organisation level and has adopted over the last years a number of measures to mitigate such risks and address the issues raised by the Court (see also paragraph 8.5). | 8.21.The Court's overall assessment of the Commission's supervisory and control systems in 2005 is shown in Table 8.1.
The management of certain CARDS projects in Albania and Croatia had been decentralised without the required prior assessments. 8.22.
As for Croatia, the decision to decentralise management taken in 2002 was in compliance with the provisions of the former Financial Regulation.
The Commission will endeavour to further reinforce the current mechanism and better communicate the basis of its analyses. | (b) all external auditors of projects should carry out their work on the basis of terms of reference that cover all known risk areas, including compliance with the Commission's requirements regarding contracting procedures and the eligibility of expenditure (see paragraph 8.15); (b) The Commission shares the Court's views and has already adopted a number of measures in this respect.
This should be supported through headquarters' audits carried out by all directorates (see paragraphs 8.10 and 8.13); (d) As explained in paragraph 8.10, information on audits is ensured through the current system.
The Court correctly focuses on the importance of the successful implementation of the verification clause that underpins the FAFA and acknowledges the Commission's and UN's efforts in deepening the renewed partnership. | 8.27.
Only where UN reports provide insufficient detail, Article 2 of the FAFA enables the Commission to request a specific format for reports.
The FAFA working group is the institutional forum to address these and other future issues. | Special Report No 25/98 concerning activities undertaken by the European Union in the field of nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe (CEEC) and in the New Independent States (NIS) from 1990 to 1997 Introduction 8.29.
In 1998 the Court published Special Report No 25/98 on nuclear safety activities financed under the PHARE and TACIS programmes [17].
Since 2001 the Commission has applied a new two-phased approach whereby the actual Plant Improvement Projects are implemented only after the completion of a Preliminary Project Planning phase.
Several projects regarding radioactive waste treatment at the level of the NPPs have been initiated in line with the importance attached to the issue by all parties. | 8.35.
However, the Commission has not sufficiently defined the roles, functions and mandates of the Delegations and the support offices. 8.38.
The average lead time needed for a contract to be signed was reduced from around 700 days in 2000 to 200 days in 2005. | | 8.40.
The n + 3 rule, introduced by the Financial Regulation [21], is, however, motivating all stakeholders to act more quickly. 8.40.
The structures and administrative capacities of the Russian and Ukrainian nuclear safety authorities at the central level have been reinforced.
In 2005 the authorities in both countries expressed their satisfaction with the development of their involvement in the planning and implementation of TACIS activities. | | 8.44.
The Court has published four Special Reports relevant to external actions in the last twelve months concerning: (a) the performance of projects financed under TACIS in the Russian Federation (Special Report No 2/2006), (b) the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Response to the Tsunami (Special Report No 3/2006), (c) the MEDA programme (Special Report No 5/2006), (d) the environmental aspects of the Commission's development cooperation (Special Report No 6/2006).
They can be found on the Court's website (www.eca.europa.eu). | | [1] Aid provided through the European Development Funds is reported separately as it is not financed from the general budget.

[9] The geographic directorates are: Asia and Central Asia; Europe, the Southern Mediterranean, Middle East and Neighbourhood Policy; Latin America. [10] Most elements function, but some need to be improved. [11] The Internal Audit Capability focused on system analysis and has not yet tested the systems; in the case of DG ECHO, testing started in 2005, according to the Commission, and this procedure will be completed during 2006. [12] Improvements are necessary for external audits commissioned by implementing organisations; new measures, introduced by the Commission should have an impact for 2006. [13] The Annual Reports concerning the financial years 2001 and 2004 described the difficulties of the Court in accessing data from UN agencies.
Under decentralised management, the payments to contractors and beneficiaries are made by the national authorities with ex-post control by the Commission. | | 9.4.Sapard on the other hand, is also implemented in a decentralised manner, but without ex-ante approval by the Commission for project selection, tendering and contracting.
The Commission checks to ensure that systems are adequate and are operating as intended and carries out clearance of accounts procedures at the end of a financial year. | | 9.5.In 2005, payments under the pre-accession programmes totalled 2985 million euro.
For the eight Central and Eastern European countries that became Member States in 2004, no new expenditure was committed after accession (except for Sapard, where some commitments were made up to the end of 2004) although payments will continue until at least 2006.
Former ISPA projects in those countries are treated as Cohesion Fund projects. | | SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE Scope of the audit 9.6.For the Phare and Turkey programmes, the Court:(a)carried out substantive tests on transactions under central management at the level of the Commission (8 payments) and transactions under decentralised management in Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey (26 individual tenders and 39 payments under 13 projects); and | | +++++ TIFF +++++ Graph 9.1 — Commitments and payments in 2005Commitments — 1994 million euroPhare 931Turkey 286Sapard 252ISPA 525 | +++++ TIFF +++++ Payments — 2985 million euroPhare 1178Turkey 244Sapard 812ISPA 751 | (b)evaluated the supervisory and control systems, with a specific focus on the operation of systems for the control of national co-financing agreements (11 projects tested in Bulgaria, Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia) the system for procurement under EDIS (13 tenders tested in Latvia, Poland and Slovakia) and decentralized management in Croatia [7]. | | 9.7.For ISPA, the Court performed a limited review at the Commission involving mainly an examination of Commission activities concerning management and control systems in one of the candidate countries (Croatia) and in the accession countries (Bulgaria and Romania), including an examination of the advancement of EDIS for the latter countries.
The audit did not involve an examination of specific underlying transactions. | | 9.8.For Sapard, the Court's audit comprised tests of control and tests of transactions in Bulgaria and Romania on five projects in each country, covering the main measures implemented at the time of the audit.
Romania submitted its EDIS application at the end of 2005, while Bulgaria had not submitted an application by that date.
Furthermore, in the case of ISPA, the Court noted a combination of incompatible management and control functions within the Ministry of Finance in Bulgaria, while the Managing Authority for Infrastructure as National ISPA Coordinator in Romania was inadequately resourced. | 9.16.The delays mentioned by the Court took place despite pressure from the Commission for stronger action on the part of the National Authorities concerned.In Romania, on-the spot audit missions have been undertaken based on applications received.
It hopes to grant accreditation for Phare by the end of 2006.
Following recommendations by the Commission, the staffing level of the National ISPA Coordinator (NIC) in Romania considerably improved in 2006. | 9.17.The Court's audit in Bulgaria and Romania found that the Sapard systems included the key concepts but their functioning showed weaknesses: | 9.17. | (a)the documentation underlying public tenders in Romania did not ensure that bids were received within the deadlines and were duly examined; | (a)The Romanian authorities have already taken action following problems in public tendering procedures at municipalities.
The Commission is examining the operation of public tendering procedures in Romania and will follow up the observations of the Court in this context via the clearance of accounts process. | (b)no appropriate supporting documents were provided for the reimbursement of certain amounts [11] to the beneficiaries, which meant that the paying agency was not able to ensure whether they had been really incurred and/or were eligible (Romania).
However, the Commission is ready to review the procedures in the light of the experience gained in the last years. | give a higher priority to the follow-up of final declarations of expenditure for Phare programmes, especially as regards parallel co-financing, | The Commission is doing its utmost to obtain the final declarations within the period stipulated in the financing agreements. | for Sapard, pay particular attention to the risks associated with projects approved during the end of the contracting period, | The Commission is aware of the potential risk, but has so far found no evidence of a resultant financial risk. | ensure, through close monitoring, that no changes to the accredited procedures are introduced by the Sapard paying agencies without its prior approval. | The countries concerned are regularly reminded of the obligation to submit any proposed procedural changes to the Commission before their implementation.
The Commission will examine unapproved changes in procedures and assess their control impact as appropriate. | SPECIAL REPORTS ISSUED SINCE THE LAST ANNUAL REPORT 9.21.The Court has published a Special Report relevant to the pre-accession strategy in the last twelve months concerning the Phare Investment projects in Bulgaria and Romania (Special Report No 4/2006).
In order to test Croatia's management capacity the Court audited transactions financed under the CARDS programme and implemented by the national authorities.

In 2005 administrative expenditure by the European Union's institutions was 6191 million euro, as further specified in Table 10.1. | | (million euro) | | 2004 | 2005 | European Parliament | 1166 | 1235 | Council | 507 | 533 | Commission | 3721 | 3952 | Court of Justice | 216 | 211 | Court of Auditors | 84 | 92 | European Economic and Social Committee | 92 | 96 | Committee of the Regions | 63 | 64 | European Ombudsman | 5 | 6 | European Data Protection Supervisor | 1 | 2 | Total | 5856 | 6191 | | Specific assessment in the context of the Statement of Assurance Audit scope 10.2.
The audit appraised the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts of the Institutions’ administrative expenditure, in order to provide a specific assessment in the context of the statement of assurance.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT In Parliament, the self appraisals carried out by the authorising officers by delegation on the basis of the minimum management and internal control standards laid down for 2005 show that their supervisory and control systems are continuing to improve in terms of quality and reliability, as the action plans and the Internal Auditor's recommendations are implemented. | 10.3.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT See reply in the last column of table 10.2. 10.3.
It concludes on one hand that the GSC has taken appropriate action in order to gradually eliminate the stock of compensatory leave but on the other hand it states that the payment of additional annual leave, which is an integral part of the action taken, should be discontinued. | - An appeal to officials to use up stocks of compensatory leave on a voluntary basis (Staff Note 80/05 of 17 May 2005) already led to a reduction of the stocks by approximately one third. - Specific measures to eliminate the remaining stocks were announced in Staff Note 25/06 of 10 February 2006 and confirmed in Staff Note 115/06 of 30 June 2006. - compulsory liquidation of all stocks over 25 days; - liquidation over maximum period of four years (2006-2009) at a minimum rate of 25 % per year; - liquidation is to take the form of leave or payment, with automatic payment at year end of that part of the compulsory 25 % which has not been used up through %quot%temps libre%quot%; - stock remaining on departure from GSC will be paid.
There should be clear rules established in the scheme to define the liabilities and responsibilities of the European Parliament and of the members of the scheme in the case of a deficit. | The additional pension scheme is mentioned in Article 27 of the Statute for Members of the European Parliament adopted by the Parliament on 28 September 2005.
The Statute will enter into force on the first day of the European Parliament parliamentary term beginning in 2009.
No rules have been established defining the liabilities and responsibilities of the European Parliament and of the members of the scheme in the case of a deficit. | Until the first day of the European Parliament parliamentary term beginning in 2009 the Statute has no legal effect and cannot provide a legal basis for the parliamentary contribution to the ASBL pension fund.
Appropriate rules should be established defining the liabilities and responsibilities of the European Parliament and of the members of the scheme in the event of a deficit. | Article 27 of the Statute for Members stipulates that the Pension Fund %quot%shall be maintained after the entry into force of this Statute for Members or former Members who have already acquired rights or future entitlements in that Fund%quot%.
The transitional period, from the adoption of the Statute by means of a Parliament decision of 28 September 2005 to the entry into force of the Statute in 2009, can therefore be regarded as being covered by Article 27 of the Statute.
The legal basis valid for the period prior to the adoption of the Statute is specified in Parliament's reply to paragraph 9.18 of the Court's annual report concerning the financial year 2002.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE In the course of the first six months of 2006, the administration carried out an assessment of the situation of the minimum Internal Control Standards.
In 2005 the technical weaknesses noted in 2004 were overcome, minimising the risk of erroneous calculation of the various elements of staff remuneration.
For that reason, DG Personnel carried out in 2005, as in previous years, systematic checks on balances in the Payments and Allowances Unit and, until December 2005, all appointing authority decisions (which are essential determinants of the payroll) were subject to individual checks before being fed into the payroll.
The SGC considers the existing tools (that the PMO has communicated to the users in a comprehensive manner only in May 2006) very useful since they are a way to check results, and the responsible service has, despite the lack of supporting documentation, used them as much as possible. 10.6.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION In each institution, each authorising officer by delegation puts in place the control procedures adapted to its specific situation.
The latter consume the most experienced resources and the PMO envisages using them in 2006 and 2007 to help building in a large number of automatic ex ante controls in a new IT system (IRIS) for the management of individual rights.
Once this system is put into production, the PMO will revise its control strategy. | 10.7.
Contrary to this rule, all the Institutions, except the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the Ombudsman, provided in their internal rules for the payment of a flat-rate sum, ranging from 30 to 60 % of the maximum allowable amount, to staff who do not produce any evidence of having incurred accommodation costs.
After the publication of the European Court of Auditors’ Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004, the European Economic and Social Committee amended its internal rules in December 2005 in order to ensure compliance with the Staff Regulations. 10.7.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Parliament faces particular problems in regard to missions owing to the nature of its activities and their dispersal over three places of work. 10.7.
Adoption of the new rules is scheduled for the beginning of 2007. 10.7.
THE REPLY OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS Regarding the costs incurred on missions, the Committee of the Regions has taken into account the Court of Auditors' remarks and, consequently, it has not paid in 2005 any flat-rate sum to staff who had not produced any evidence of having incurred accomodation costs.
The Committee of the Regions internal rules on missions will be subject to some modifications in 2006, and this rule will be formally introduced in the Guide to Missions. | Specific observations 10.8.
Weaknesses were observed, as in the past (see paragraph 9.16 of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2004), in the supervisory and control systems relating to the payment of allowances to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). 10.9.
At the end of November, less than 20 % of the documents required had been submitted.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT The Quaestors' communication could only be sent to Members late in July 2005.
The task of the administration to give information proved also to be difficult because of the complexity of the rules, the national obligations which differ in each of the 25 Member States and the large number of languages to cope with.
The Quaestors thus extended the deadline for submitting supporting documents for a first time in January 2006 and a second time in April 2006.
Roughly 29 % of paying agents have submitted the requisite documents for the same period. | Council 10.11.
In fact, there was no evidence that 676 out of 1605 Commission staff concerned based in Brussels had been requested to confirm or update their original declarations.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION For each type of family allowance, a specific control strategy is applied.
However, all the cases mentioned here will be verified over the next two years to allow for a regular verification of the complete population.
In general, files need to be verified every four years at the latest to be able to recuperate in view of the deadline of five years imposed by Article 83 of the Staff Regulations.
As regards national child allowances, it is envisaged to use the same control mechanism as outlined above for the household allowances. | Court of Justice 10.13.
Such an involvement in the carrying out of financial operations is not compatible with the total independence with which the internal auditor ought to perform his audit duties, in accordance with the principle stated in Article 86 of the Financial Regulation. 10.13.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE As already stated in the reply to paragraph 9.21 of the 2004 Annual Report, ex-ante verification activities on the one hand, and internal audit activities on the other, are performed by different people within one administrative unit under the administrative authority of a single official, also appointed as internal auditor.
This new administrative structure may thus be implemented in the coming months. | 10.14.
However, at the time of the audit by the Court of Auditors no reports by the internal auditor were available. 10.14.
The Court of Auditors is audited by an independent external audit firm which issued a %quot%certificate concerning the regularity and fairness of the financial statements at 31 December 2005%quot%, accompanied by a %quot%report on the administrative and accounting procedures, the soundness of the financial management and the internal control system%quot%.
The setting-up in the course of 2005 of a unit responsible for coordinating financial and contractual activities throughout the joint services of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions improved annual procurement planning and provided the operational units with guidance on tendering procedures.
However, some weaknesses still appeared concerning the operational management of certain procurement procedures (for example: too little time allowed for the verification of complex draft contracts), and coordination procedures between the new unit and the operating units had not been clearly defined. 10.16.
REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS The Committees welcome the recognition by the Court that annual procurement planning has improved and that the operational services have benefited from clear guidance on tendering procedures.
On the basis of experience acquired, more detailed guidelines may be issued in the second half of 2006.
The remarks in paragraph 10.16 also apply to the Committee of the Regions. | | 10.18.
Following the Court’s 2004 DAS audit and two internal audits, the administration of the Committee of the Regions asked certain beneficiaries of weighted salary transfers to present additional evidence.
Several transfers which had not been regularly carried out before May 2004 and/or for which the beneficiaries did not present sufficient evidence were discontinued.
The Court’s audit did not reveal material errors affecting the legality and regularity of the administrative expenditure. | | Special Reports issued since the last Annual Report 10.21.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The agencies are independent and have a separate discharge procedure for their administrative expenses.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The introduction of internal control, assessment of their operational risks and compliance with recruitment and procurement procedures are within the sole remit of the agency's board of management.
As regards procurement, the Commission publishes guidelines, provides the agencies with access to its libraries of financial information and to its helpdesk and offers training to the %quot%Inter Agency Legal Network%quot% (IALN).
On 16 December 2005 the Commission adopted guidelines for personnel policy in regulatory agencies, which recommend a standardisation of agencies’ selection procedures through a greater involvement of EPSO. | 10.25.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The agencies must, under their own financial regulation based on the framework Financial Regulation (EC), Euratom) No 2343/2002, which requires it for expenditure (Article 30), to set up %quot%a nomenclature with a classification by purpose%quot%.
This service, called the Common Support Service (CSS), which has an annual budget approaching 400000 euro, does not have a legal personality of its own [9].
Since the financial year 2000, these funds (some 1,8 million euro) were managed by the CSS outside the agencies’ budgetary systems.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The CSS is an example of good cooperation between the agencies in order to share costs and knowledge.
The CSS bank account balance appears in the provisional accounts of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) for the financial year 2005 (EMEA was the chair of the CSS in 2005).
However, as stated by the Court, the presentation of this cooperation in the agencies’ accounts should respect the budgetary principles of unity and transparency.
The Court's audit covered five risk capital operations, managed by EuropeAid Co-operation Office (DG AIDCO), Directorate-General for Information Society and Media (DG INFSO) and Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN).
The purpose of the current audit was to determine whether the Commission has taken appropriate measures to monitor the phasing-out of the operations and to protect the Community's financial interests, and whether the related items of the financial statements are complete and reliable. | | (million euro) | Measure | Total payments | Assets in balance sheet | Value adjustments in balance sheet | up to 31.12.2005 | 31.12.2004 | 31.12.2005 | 31.12.2004 | 31.12.2005 | ECIP (European Community Investment Partners) | 224,2 | 63,66 | 51,19 | –38,88 | –8,9 | MEDIA II | 302,3 [4] | 41,66 | 36,53 | –28,07 | –24,53 | Venture consort | 10,2 | 1,49 | 0,77 | –1,49 | –0,77 | Eurotech Capital Programme | 9,5 | 1,63 | 0,46 | –1,63 | –0,46 | Joint Venture Programme | 10,3 | 5,76 | 4,41 | –5,76 | –4,41 | | European Community Investment Partners (ECIP) 11.7.
As the ECIP programme stopped in 1999, the two Technical Assistance Units to which the Commission outsourced the administration and financial management of the operations finished their activities at the end of 2000 [5].
The Court's audit showed that erroneous payments amounting to 207000 euro, dating back many years, were not followed up [6], and that recovery orders were either not followed up (4 million euro) or not issued (62,3 million euro).
In March 2006, the specific unit of DG AIDCO estimated that the amount still to be recovered is 21 million euro. 11.7.
Nevertheless also before the establishment of the specific unit in EuropeAid limited measures have been taken towards the closure of the ECIP files.
The Commission will at that stage be able to provide complete and reliable financial statements. | MEDIA Programme 11.8.
The MEDIA [7] programmes aim to encourage the European audiovisual industry.
Council Decision 95/563/EC of 10 July 1995 [8] established MEDIA II, which is currently being phased out.
For example, if a project did not go into production or was abandoned within a certain time-limit, 25 % of the loan received was repayable.
The Court found that, for financial operations before 2001, the Commission services had no detailed accounting information for the programme nor a specific auditor's certificate for the financial operations involved.
The cases dealt with by the TAO, as well as those dealt with by the Commission, were transferred when the MEDIA Programme files were taken over by the new Education Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA) on 1 January 2006.
The structural weaknesses of the past were resolved after the Executive Agency took over the MEDIA Programme files. | Phasing-out of risk capital operations managed by DG ECFIN 11.10.
The objective of the three venture capital investment programmes, representing a total EU contribution of approximately 30 million euro, is to stimulate investment in desirable but risky market segments.
This policy has already led to additional closures in 2006.
Although the Commission has started corrective action, the audit confirmed, in line with previous Court observations (except for MEDIA II), persistent monitoring weaknesses and failure to protect the financial interest of the Community in the past. 11.11.
The Commission will at that stage be able to provide complete and reliable financial statements. | 11.12.
Concerning the ECIP and MEDIA II Programmes, the related items of the financial statements provide neither a complete nor a reliable valuation of the assets in the Commission's balance sheet.
The management procedures for the Media II programme ruled out any detailed bookkeeping for the implementing transactions.
Payments should be netted-out against recoveries, the liquidation of action files should be speeded up by improved internal monitoring through setting weekly and monthly targets and the phasing-out procedure should be improved; - EuropeAid already ensures a weekly monitoring of the performance against the target and finds that correct phasing-out procedures are now in place. | - in respect of the phasing-out of MEDIA II, action should be taken towards creating an overall plan to speed up the liquidation process.
For the MEDIA programmes, this will be done in consultation with DG INFSO, the Agency’s parent DG. | - since the current audit has once again confirmed the administrative failures found in the past (except for MEDIA II), resulting in material financial losses for the Community, the Commission should consider to take appropriate actions. - The Commission has since March 2005 taken appropriate action to liquidate ECIP and significant progress been made since then.
At 31 December 2005, the Fund's (provisional) total resources were 1323,9 million euro. | | 11.15.
The derived adjustment consisted in the lengthening of duration through substantial switches from shorter term to long term investments.
This strategy is being implemented. | 11.18.
However, the disposal of these assets happened during the lowest price-range of the year.
The loss is 34,4 million euro for the shares and 4,6 million euro for the junior debt. 11.18.
Initial commitments could be exceeded because only global commitments were entered into. [7] MEDIA I 1991 to 1996 (almost closed, with the exception of two cases, all financial assets, 26,7 million euro were written off at the end of 2003 and there is no intention to make further recoveries), MEDIA II 1996 to 2000, MEDIA plus 2001 to 2006 (still ongoing).
