The measures take the form of a specific duty rate of EUR 181,7 per tonne with the exception of imports from several companies expressly mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates. (2) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2603/2000 [3], imposed at the same time a definitive countervailing duty of EUR 41,3 per tonne on imports into the Community of the same product originating in India, with the exception of imports from several companies expressly mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.
CURRENT PROCEDURE 1.
Furthermore, it claimed that it had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation ( 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999), but had exported the product concerned to the Community after that period. 2.
Investigation period (9) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 (the investigation period).
Since these sales amounted to more than 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community, they were considered representative. (14) The Commission subsequently identified those types of PET sold domestically by the company that were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community. (15) The investigation revealed that only two product types exported to the Community are identical or directly comparable to the products sold on the domestic market.
Comparison (18) For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between normal value and export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. (19) All the allowances claimed by the company on export sales have been accepted.
The weighted average dumping margin established for the company, expressed as a percentage of the CIF Community-frontier price amounts to 25,5 %.
Since the latter was higher than the dumping margin, the level of the measures should be based on the dumping margin. (29) In accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation and Article 24(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation. (30) In the parallel accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 2603/2000, an individual countervailing duty rate of EUR 106,5 per tonne corresponding to an ad valorem countervailing duty rate of 13,9 % was established for the company. (31) As all of the subsidies in the parallel accelerated review were found to be export subsidies, the anti-dumping duty needs to be adjusted to reflect the actual dumping margin remaining after the imposition of the countervailing duties offsetting the effect of these subsidies. (32) Accordingly, the anti-dumping duty applicable to the CIF Community-frontier price and taking into account the results of the parallel anti-subsidy proceeding, shall be: Company | Injury Margin | Dumping Margin | Countervailing duty rate | Anti-dumping duty rate | Proposed anti-dumping duty (EUR/tonne) | South Asian Petrochem Limited | 44,3 % | 25,5 % | 13,9 % | 11,6 % | 88,9 | E.
RETROACTIVE LEVYING OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY (33) As the review has resulted in a determination of dumping in respect of the company, the anti-dumping duty applicable to the company should be levied retroactively on imports of the product concerned which have been made subject to registration pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2005.
UNDERTAKING (34) The company offered a price undertaking concerning its exports of the product concerned to the Community, in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. (35) After examination of the offer, the Commission considered the undertaking as acceptable since it would eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
The duty hereby imposed shall also be levied retroactively on imports of the product concerned which have been registered pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2005. 3.
Article 2 In Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000, the following shall be inserted into the table under producers in India: Company | Country | TARIC additional code | "South Asian Petrochem Limited | India | A585" | Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
