Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%1487/2005 of 12 September 2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain finished polyester filament fabrics originating in the People%rsquo%s Republic of China Council Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 of 12 September 2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain finished polyester filament fabrics originating in the People’s Republic of China THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 9 thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Provisional measures (1) On 15 March 2005, the Commission imposed, by Regulation (EC) No 426/2005 [2] (the provisional Regulation), a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain finished polyester filament fabrics originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). (2) It is recalled that the investigation period of dumping and injury (IP) covered the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004.
as lining for low-end garments or as fabric material for high-end garments the price and the quality is significantly different and that these products should not be seen as one product concerned. (12) It should be recalled in this respect that differences in type and in price have been accounted for by the product control numbers (PCN) codes established for the investigation, which ensure that different product types are compared like with like. (13) In recital (15) of the provisional Regulation, it was stated that the Commission had found that FPFF produced by the Community industry and sold on the Community market as well as FPFF produced in the countries concerned and exported to the Community were like products, since no differences in the basic physical and chemical characteristics and uses of the existing different types had been found. (14) In the absence of any further comments regarding the product definition and the like product, the contents and provisional conclusions of recitals (11) to (16) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed.
As stated in recital (8)(a) of the provisional Regulation, the Community producers requested in terms of Article 19 of the basic Regulation that their details should not be published, as to do so would have a significantly adverse effect upon them.
Each single MET application was analysed against the five criteria laid down in that Article. (17) On this basis, as set out in recital (23) of the provisional Regulation, 25 companies could successfully demonstrate that they met the five relevant MET criteria.
Company | Criteria | Article 2(7)(c) first indent | Article 2(7)(c) second indent | Article 2(7)(c) third indent | Article 2(7)(c) fourth indent | Article 2(7)(c) fifth indent | 1 | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | Met | 2 | Met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | 3 | Met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | 4 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | 5 | Not met | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | 6 | Met | Met | Not met | Met | Met | 7 | Met | Met | Not met | Met | Met | 8 | Met | Met | Not met | Met | Met | 9 | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | Met | 10 | Not met | Met | Met | Met | Met | 11 | Met | Not met | Met | Met | Met | 12 | Met | Met | Not met | Met | Met | 13 | Met | Met | Not met | Met | Met | 14 | Not met | Not met | Met | Met | Met | (18) The companies concerned and the complainant were given the opportunity to comment on the above findings.
Those claims were rejected on the grounds mentioned in recital (20). (22) Companies 4 and 5 also claimed that the findings of the Commission were insufficient to conclude that they did not fulfil the first criterion.
The claims made by the companies were therefore rejected. (23) Companies 3, 9 and 14 claimed that the mere fact that the auditors issued a qualified opinion on their annual accounts is not sufficient to consider that the second criterion of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation is not fulfilled.
Company 2 challenged the Commission’s conclusions that this company does not have one clear set of independently audited accounting records used for all purposes.
The fact that an auditor does not refuse to approve the accounts does not mean in itself that the accounts are correct, which could only be guaranteed by an approval without reservations by the auditor. (25) More specifically, concerning Companies 3, 9 and 14, it should be noted that the reservations made by the auditors were rather significant.
It is noted that the inventory value represented more than 10 % of the balance sheet total of that company.
Despite no obvious change in accounting policy, nor any adjustment of issues raised in earlier years, the 2003 accounts did not have the same reservations, which raised doubts as to whether the accounts were independently audited in line with international standards.
The claims made by those companies were therefore rejected. (26) As far as the claim made by Company 2 is concerned, it is noted that the significant adjustments requested by the auditors, having the effect of halving the profits, were only recorded in the annual accounts, but not in the accounts of the company.
In the absence of any further information provided by the company, those findings are hereby confirmed and the claim rejected. (27) In the case of Companies 4 and 5, significant discrepancies were found in the accounts during the verification visit.
In the absence of any further information provided by the companies, those conclusions are hereby confirmed and the claims were rejected. (28) The same last two companies and Company 6 claimed that the conclusions that they did not fulfil the third criterion were unfounded. (29) Company 4 claimed that the Commission had no plausible grounds to conclude that the price paid by the shareholders in the framework of the privatisation process was reduced.
The investigation, however, firstly revealed that the company was valued for only 25 % of its net book value at the time of privatisation, which casts doubts as to the reliability of the valuation report.
The claim that the information could not be disclosed due to business confidentiality cannot be accepted since in anti-dumping investigations all confidential documents obtained during the verification visit are treated as such by the authorities, in accordance with Article 19(1) of the basic Regulation, and would thus in any event not be further disclosed in any way.
The claim was therefore rejected. (30) Company 5 challenged the Commission’s negative MET determination with respect to the third criterion on the grounds that it allegedly purchased its main equipment from a related private company, and that the assets were thus transferred at market prices.
In the absence of any further information, those conclusions are hereby confirmed and the claim was rejected. (31) Company 6 claimed that the fact that all assets are depreciated at the same flat rate should not lead to the conclusion that the financial situation of the company is distorted.
Only one company could provide valid clarifications, while the claims made by the others had to be rejected. (33) More generally, it was claimed by Company 9 that the absence of verification visit was unfavourable to them and discriminatory as compared to those companies that have been subject to a verification visit.
Two other companies claimed that carrying out a simultaneous verification visit of the MET claim form and of the questionnaire reply on dumping worked to their disadvantage, and so did the breach of the three months deadline for the Commission to take a decision of MET pursuant to Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation. (34) In this respect, it is recalled that according to Article 16 of the basic Regulation, verification visits are not compulsory and shall be carried out where it is considered appropriate.
The claims were therefore also rejected. (35) Finally, the claim by the complainant that a verification visit of the MET claim forms should be carried out at the premises of all companies concerned was rejected for the reasons explained above in recital (34). 2.
Secondly, it claimed that according to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, a verification visit is not a necessary condition for demonstrating that a company fulfils the five relevant criteria, so that it could still be granted MET.
It argued that this is evidenced by the fact that MET has been granted to 22 companies, but only 7 companies were visited on the spot.
Finally, the company claimed that it should have received a notification of the consequences of the non-cooperation, as set out in Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation. (42) Concerning the first claim, it is noted that according to Article 17(2) of the basic Regulation, the consent of the parties is not a necessary condition, since that Article provides that the final selection rests with the Commission and that only preference shall be given to choosing a sample in consultation with, and with the consent of the parties concerned.
Finally, it is also noted that the company did not ask for an individual examination, pursuant to Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation. (43) The second claim was considered unfounded since, pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the refusal to provide access to the necessary information, thus also with respect to MET determination, should be considered as non-cooperation.
Finally, the last claim made by the company should also be rejected because the consequences of the non-cooperation were made clear by paragraph 8 of the notice of initiation. 4.
Normal value 4.1.
Determination of normal value for exporting producers granted MET (44) In the absence of any comments, the general methodology used for the determination of the normal value, as described in the recitals (31) to (40) of the provisional Regulation is confirmed. (45) The exporting producers granted MET claimed the occurrence of certain clerical errors in the calculation of the normal value or contested the methodology used for assessing the adjustments that were deemed necessary.
They further claimed that by not being aware of the absence of cooperation by any producer in Mexico, the analogue country proposed at initiation stage, they were not able to provide assistance to the Commission for the choice of an alternative country. (47) In that respect, it should be noted first of all that Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation provides that the parties should be informed shortly after the initiation of the market economy third country envisaged.
Export price (51) Two exporting producers claimed that the requirements for the construction of the export price, as laid down in Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, had not been fulfilled and that any adjustment of the export price when sales were made to the Community via related companies established in a third country should rather be addressed by applying the provisions of Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. (52) In this respect, it is confirmed that the provisions of Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, and more specifically of subparagraph (i) of that paragraph, have indeed been applied, as mentioned under recital (53) of the provisional Regulation. (53) The exporting producers granted MET claimed the occurrence of certain clerical errors in the calculation of the export price or contested the methodology used for assessing certain adjustments that were deemed necessary.
Dumping margin 7.1.
The companies therefore claimed that this new situation should be taken into consideration and that, since they can no longer be considered as related, each company should be attributed an individual dumping margin reflecting its own situation. (64) The investigation revealed, however, that the relationship between the companies concerned during the IP actually consisted of more than just a shareholding link.
Moreover, it is also noted that since this relationship may have affected the findings for the IP, any changes in the relationship after the IP cannot be considered as relevant. (66) It is therefore concluded that the claims made by the companies should be rejected. (67) Furthermore, various interested parties contested the correct use of the provisions on sampling.
Community production (72) In the absence of any comments submitted, the provisional findings concerning the total Community production as set out in recitals (62) to (63) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 2.
Community consumption (76) In the absence of any comments, the calculation of Community consumption as set out in recitals (65) to (66) of the provisional Regulation is hereby confirmed. 4.
Imports into the Community from the country concerned 4.1.
Situation of the Community Industry (79) It is recalled that in recital (98) of the provisional Regulation, the Commission provisionally concluded that the Community industry had suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation. (80) No interested party questioned the figures or their interpretation relating to the situation of the Community industry as presented in recitals (72) to (98) of the provisional Regulation.
Therefore, the findings as set out in these recitals of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed and it is concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
In parallel, the product mix exported by the whole EU-25 industry was sold, during the IP at a price 270 % higher than imports from China.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 1.
It is to be noted that the overall quantities imported from China by the importers who made themselves known are negligible and account only for around 2 % of the total imports from China during the IP.
The remainder 98 % did not react to the measures. (84) In the absence of any other comments with respect to the interest of the unrelated importers, the findings as set out in recitals (119) to (121) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 3.
Interest of suppliers (85) In the absence of any comments in respect of the interest of the Community suppliers, the findings as set out in recitals (122) to (125) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 4.
Interest of users (86) It is recalled that nine users submitted a questionnaire response whereas only one of those users imported the product concerned (recital (127) of the provisional Regulation).
They also argued that high-tech textile machine suppliers in the Community would be affected because textile production in the PRC would decrease due to the duties. (90) However, as set out in recital (128) of the provisional Regulation, it is likely that imports from the PRC will continue to enter the market at fair non-dumped prices and other non-dumped sources will remain available considering that over 30 % of the Community consumption is represented by third countries imports (excluding PRC).
In this respect, it is also to be recalled that users which account for a very small quantity of imports have come forward whereas the large majority has not made any comments in the investigation. (91) In the absence of any other comments with respect to the interest of the users, the conclusions as set out in recitals (126) to (128) of the provisional Regulation are hereby confirmed. 5.
Definitive measures (97) In the light of the foregoing and in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margin and at the level of the injury margin calculated in all cases, where they were lower than the dumping margins found. (98) On the basis of the above, the definitive duties should be as follows: Company | Definitive anti-dumping duty | Far Eastern Industries (Shanghai) Ltd | 14,1 % | Fuzhou Fuhua Textile %amp% Printing Dyeing Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Fuzhou Ta-Tung Textile Works Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou CaiHong Textile Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Hangzhou De Licacy Textile Co., Ltd. | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Fuen Textile Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Hangzhou Hongfeng Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Jieenda Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Jinsheng Textile Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Hangzhou Mingyuan Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Shenda Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Xiaoshan Phoenix Industry Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Hangzhou Yililong Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Yongsheng Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Hangzhou Zhengda Textile Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Hangzhou ZhenYa Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Huzhou Styly Jingcheng Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Nantong Teijin Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Shaoxing Ancheng Cloth industrial Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Shaoxing China Light %amp% Textile Industrial City Somet Textile Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Shaoxing County Fengyi Textile Printing %amp% Dyeing Co., Ltd | 37,1 % | Shaoxing County Huaxiang Textile Co., Ltd | 26,7 % | Shaoxing County Jiade Weaving and Dyeing Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Shaoxing County Pengyue Textile Co., Ltd | 14,1 % | Shaoxing County Qing Fang Cheng Textiles Imp. %amp% Exp.
