2006/261/EC: Commission Decision of 16 March 2005 on aid scheme C 8/2004 (ex NN 164/2003) implemented by Italy in favour of newly listed companies (notified under document number C(2005) 591) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 16 March 2005 on aid scheme C 8/2004 (ex NN 164/2003) implemented by Italy in favour of newly listed companies (notified under document number C(2005) 591) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/261/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1], Whereas: I.
Articles 1(1)(d) and 11 of DL 269/2003 provide for specific tax incentives for companies admitted to listing on a regulated market in the European Union between 2 October 2003 and 31 December 2004.
By letter of 28 October 2004 (D/57697), the Commission forwarded them to the Italian authorities, which reacted by letter of 2 December 2004 (A/39473).
Under the system of advance payment of corporation tax in Italy, a beneficiary company would pay in two instalments the income tax due in respect of the 2004 tax year, based on an estimate of the tax that the company expects to pay for 2004, therefore including the reduction resulting from the scheme.
Owing to the reduction in the nominal rate, beneficiary undertakings enjoy a reduced tax liability in the year in which they obtain a listing and in the following two years.
However, because of the above-mentioned clause in Article 11 of DL 269/2003 limiting the benefits, the actual tax concession could not exceed €11,7 million over the three-year period.
CONCLUSIONS (46) The Commission concludes that the tax incentives granted under this measure constitute operating aid that does not qualify for any of the exceptions to the general ban on such aid and is therefore incompatible with the common market.
The interest shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004. 6.
Within two months of the date of notification of this Decision, Italy shall enjoin all beneficiaries of the aid referred to in Article 1 to reimburse the unlawful aid, with interest.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Republic of Italy.
