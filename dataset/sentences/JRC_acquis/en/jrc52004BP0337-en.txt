Resolution of the European Parliament accompanying the decision concerning discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2002 financial year (Commission) Resolution of the European Parliament accompanying the decision concerning discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2002 financial year (Commission) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, having regard to the general budget of the European Union for 2002, having regard to the definitive annual accounts of the European Communities for the financial year 2002 - Volume I - Consolidated statements on budgetary implementation and consolidated financial statements (SEC(2003) 1104 - C5-0564/2003, SEC(2003) 1105 - C5-0565/2003) [1], having regard to the annual report of the Court of Auditors concerning the financial year 2002, accompanied by the replies of the institutions audited (C5-0583/2003) [2], and the special reports of the Court of Auditors, having regard to the statement of assurance as to the reliability of the accounts and the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions provided by the Court of Auditors pursuant to Article 248 of the EC Treaty [3] (C5-0583/2003), having regard to the Council recommendation of 9 March 2004 (C5-0145/2004), having regard to Articles 274, 275 and 276 of the EC Treaty and Articles 179a and 180b of the Euratom Treaty, having regard to Article 3 of Council Decision 2003/76/EC of 1 February 2003 establishing the measures necessary for the implementation of the Protocol, annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel [4], having regard to Annex 1(3) to Decision 2002/234/ECSC of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, of 27 February 2002 on the financial consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty and on the research fund for coal and steel [5], having regard to the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977, and in particular Article 89 thereof, and to the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002 [6], in particular Articles 145 to 147 thereof, having regard to Article 93 of and Annex V to its Rules of Procedure, having regard to the report of the Committee on Budgetary Control and the opinions of the other committees concerned (A5-0200/2004), A.
stressing its view that the discharge procedure is a process seeking, inter alia, to improve financial management in the EU by improving the basis for decision-taking in the light of the Court of Auditors' reports and the replies and opinions of the institutions, F.
Horizontal issues Shared management General issues 1.
Endorses the Court of Auditors' view that there is a need for both the Commission and the Member States to pay greater attention to a form of management which separates the financing of a Community policy from its implementation and, in the case of the Community, affected 77,6 % of commitment appropriations in 2002; 3.
Stresses that "shared management" has its Community legal basis, in primary law, in Article 274 of the Treaty ("Member States shall cooperate with the Commission to ensure that the appropriations are used in accordance with the principles of sound financial management"), as well as in secondary law, in Article 53(3) of the Financial Regulation (Where the Commission implements the budget by shared management, implementation tasks shall be delegated to Member States â€¦); 4.
Points out that Article 53(5), of the new Financial Regulation reiterates the indivisibility of financial responsibility as follows: "in cases of shared or decentralised management, in order to ensure that the funds are used in accordance with the applicable rules, the Commission shall apply clearance-of-accounts procedures or financial correction mechanisms which enable it to assume final responsibility for the implementation of the budget in accordance with Article 274 of the EC Treaty and Article 179 of the Euratom Treaty"; Member States' responsibility 11.
Arable crops are less exposed to the risk of error than animal premiums, whereas the other categories of expenditure, which are not subject to the integrated administration and control system (IACS), are exposed to greater risk, as well as being subject to less efficient controls; (b) in the case of the structural measures, in spite of an improvement in supervisory systems and controls, especially at Commission level, the same types of error occurred at Member State level with the same frequency as in previous years" [7]; 13.
Points out the following key factors by way of explanation of this situation: (a) the legal basis for shared management lies in secondary legislation (mainly sectoral legislation concerning the EAGGF Guarantee Section and the Structural Funds) and not in the Treaty; (b) the Commission has the right of initiative for sectoral legislation and is fully responsible in legal terms for implementing the budget under Article 274 of the Treaty, but its powers may be limited by sectoral legislation adopted by the Council and Parliament; (c) the Commission is not able to act in any other way than as laid down in sectoral legislation, which generally does not provide it with any means other than supervisory instruments and procedures and financial corrections; 16.
Takes the view that shared management is well-suited as a form of management to implementing Community policies in the two major budget areas of agriculture and the Structural Funds, which have a very high number of final recipients of aid and involve very considerable amounts (77,6 % of commitment appropriations in the 2002 budget); stresses, nonetheless, that sound implementation of these policies requires both the Commission and the national authorities to carry out their respective tasks; Auditing and shared management 24.
Expresses its interest in this initiative, and asks to receive up-to-date information on successes achieved, reservations entered, obstacles removed and the timetable for future actions in the Commission's follow-up report; 26.
Notes that uneven progress has been made in the implementation of the various actions set out in the White Paper; observes that, despite such progress, there are delays and difficulties to overcome in many areas; 33.
Insists that the efforts still required if the reform is to be optimised must be made as quickly as possible, with particular regard to human-resource management (identification of priorities, including "negative" ones; redistribution of resources so that they can be allocated to priority activities; assessment of needs and appropriate training initiatives designed to fill "skills gaps") and the implementation of the 24 control standards; expects such progress to be reflected in the forthcoming annual activity reports; 36.
Welcomes the measures adopted by the Commission to ensure further progress in the harmonisation of the terms and conditions under which Directors-General express reservations in their annual reports; hopes that these measures will be applied in the next annual report drafting exercise, so as to enable the reservations expressed to be assessed and to facilitate identification of corrective measures; 37.
Considers that the future accounting system should ensure full accrual accounting capacity, data consistency and secure access; 46.
Appreciates the Commission's efforts to keep to the timetable laid down by the legislation in force, while recognising that it is extremely tight, given the experience in several Member States which have embarked upon a similar process of modernising public-sector accounts; suggests, therefore, adopting a phased approach which focuses first of all on eliminating any significant security weaknesses and accounting discrepancies, secondly on ensuring that the 2005 accounts will be presented on an accrual basis, and lastly that a coherent and integrated system is put in place to support the new architecture; 53.
Points to the 2005 deadline for the validation process of interfaces between local systems and the central system, after which data provided by non-validated systems will not be recognised; seeks assurances that this deadline will be met for all services without exception; 57.
Expressly regrets the fact that the Commission took no action on its demand, set out in paragraph 21 of its abovementioned resolution of 4 December 2003, that the Commission should submit the requisite legislative proposals for the amendment of the Financial Regulation and/or the implementing provisions relating thereto; 69.
Recalls that the Internal Auditor is independent in the discharge of his duties as set out in the Financial Regulation (Chapter 8, Article 85); stresses that Article 85 of the Financial Regulation refers directly to "the relevant international standard" and that these standards are "International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing" as drawn up by the Institute of Internal Auditors (www.theiia.org); 72.
Draws attention, in particular, to the following standards [17]: "1100 Independence and objectivity: The internal audit activity should be independent, and internal auditors should be objective in performing their work. 1110 Organisational independence The chief audit executive should report to a level within the organisation that allows the internal audit activity to fulfil its responsibilities. 1110.A1 The internal audit activity should be free from interference in determining the scope of internal auditing, performing work, and communicating results"; 73.
Notes that the Audit Progress Committee was set up under the Charter of the Internal Audit Service of the European Commission (SEC(2000)1801/2) [18] with the principal task of monitoring the measures put in place by the DGs and services in the light of the analyses, evaluations and recommendations of the internal and external auditors; 75.
Notes that the Court of Auditors, in its Annual Report for 2001 [20], stated that the existing practice is "contrary to the usual rules forbidding the chairman of an audit board from playing a role in the organisation that is likely to give rise to a confusion of interest" (9.56); believes that, in this connection, it would be desirable to revise the Committee's rules in order to: (a) ensure the absence of conflicts of interest; (b) attach its secretariat directly to the Secretary-General's office, as suggested by the Committee itself in its annual report; and (c) ensure publicity for its annual reports, which should include an assessment of follow-up action on the recommendations of the auditors' reports; The Internal Audit Capabilities (DG level) 78.
Recalls that the reform places a strong emphasis on the decentralisation of financial controls; believes that this in turn highlights the urgent need to develop more suitable and accountable forms of central management supervision of the control systems operating in individual departments; takes the view that this central management supervision should result in a formal opinion on the quality of the departments' internal control systems, which should be published in its original form within the synthesis report; 83.
Cannot understand why the Commission was more than a year late in submitting the progress report required by Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 and why now, after Parliament's adoption of its abovementioned resolution of 4 December 2003, the Commission required almost three months before taking a decision on a corresponding set of proposals on 9 February 2004; notes that these delays have made it practically impossible for improvements to be made to Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 before the European elections; 93.
Notes that most of the 1000 cases which OLAF inherited from UCLAF have been closed; calls on the Supervisory Committee to investigate how many of the cases were closed without any result; calls on the Supervisory Committee to pay particular attention to ensuring that cases have not been closed without proper justification; Presentation of audit results 96.
Considers that there are several good reasons for reorganising the financing of the EU budget, and that the aim should be to secure the European Union's financial independence from national contributions subject to the decisions of national parliaments, and funding for all the tasks to be undertaken in a Union of 25 Member States, without thereby further burdening European taxpayers; Year | EU budget (outturn) [28] euro million | Total tax income EU-15 [29] euro billion | EU budget in % of Member States' tax income | | (1) | (2) | (3) = (1)/(2)/ 1000 | 2000 | 83331,1 | 2414,4 | 3,5 % | 2001 | 79987,3 | 2450,2 | 3,3 % | 2002 | 85144,5 | 2488,1 | 3,4 % | 115. [27], and that many of the public's notions about the size of the EU budget simply have no foundation in reality; 116.
Considers that the EUR 68 million which have so far been spent on the project can only pay off if there is a far greater number of users; also considers that one reason for the low level of use is the decision to apply a "decentralised architecture", whereby the national customs administrations will use a national application, as opposed to a "centralised architecture" based on a common application to which all customs administrations are linked; 121.
Notes that, in many customs administrations, staff numbers are being reduced rather than increased, with the result that false declarations and other irregularities, which can be exposed only by means of on-the-spot physical inspections, are going undetected; notes that the costs involved in increasing the number of inspection staff are more than offset by the increase in customs revenue; calls on the Commission to urge the Member States to increase the number of staff required for physical inspection duties, especially now that the share of customs revenue allocated to the Member States has been increased from 10 to 25 %; 125.
Calls on the Commission to draw up, no later than 15 June 2004, a survey showing the implementation of the 38 recommendations made by the committee of inquiry in 1997; 127.
Notes, in relation to the Commission's reply under point 25 of Special Report No 9/2003 concerning the system for setting the rates of subsidy on agricultural products [31], that neither the Commission nor the Court of Auditors has supplied the discharge authority with details on the content and nature of the "extremely important circumstances" for which the Commission opted for "a rate different from the theoretical calculated rate"; 129.
Notes that the Court last investigated this matter in 1990 [32] and concluded in regard to the method of setting export refunds that "documentation of the facts, the Commission's consideration of the facts, the decisions taken and the outcome was not maintained, and, as a consequence, independent third party and audit and management control were virtually impossible" (Special Report 9/2003, paragraph 9); 134.
Notes with interest the Court of Auditors' investigation of the Commission's administration and the national authorities' implementation of the prefinancing regime, which is an important part of the export refund system, which in turn is a part of the common agricultural policy adopted by the Council; 141.
Notes that some 11 % of the refunds paid in 2000, some EUR 600 million, were paid out under the prefinancing regime (Special Report 1/2003 [34], paragraph 2); 143.
Notes that the Commission's own investigations in 1997 into the national authorities' checks on the regime revealed such significant shortcomings that the Commission imposed financial corrections of over EUR 166 million on the Member States (Special Report 1/2003, paragraph V), but did not subsequently carry out an in-depth analysis of the regime's procedures; 144.
Considers that financial corrections reflect not only the Member States' ability and willingness to implement a regime correctly, but also the possibility of implementing the regime correctly; believes in a general sense that many legal provisions concerning the common agricultural policy are so difficult to interpret, and the checking provisions in many cases so lacking in transparency, that the Member States' authorities do not have much opportunity to implement the regimes correctly; 145.
Is aware that the common agricultural policy is adopted by the Council, and that the Commission therefore has only a limited influence over it; regrets, however, that the Commission is not making a greater effort to make it clear to the Council that a detailed follow-up to the Court of Auditors' recommendations is an important step on the necessary road to improving the EU's financial management; calls, therefore, on the Commission to submit a proposal by December 2004 for the abolition of the pre-financing scheme; 150.
Deeply regrets that the Council has still not adopted the Commission proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (COM(2002) 293), which seeks to extend from 24 to 36 months the maximum period to which an expenditure correction may apply, and has received favourable opinions from both the Court of Auditors [35] and the European Parliament [36]; Support for less-favoured areas 151.
Recalls that the support scheme for agricultural holdings in less-favoured areas is one of 22 support measures for agriculture and that it has been in existence since 1975 and was radically overhauled in 1999; stresses that the overall budget for the scheme is EUR 2 billion a year, approximately 50 % of which comes from Community funds, accounting for 1 % of the overall annual budget and 12.5 % of the total budget for rural development measures, while 55,8 % of all farms in the EU receive support under this regime; 152.
Recalls that the term "less-favoured area" was first defined in 1975, when Community support for such areas was introduced, and that since that time only slight adaptations have been made to this definition (Special Report 4/2003 [37], paragraph 5), so that current Community legislation now distinguishes between three categories of less-favoured area, which are: - mountain areas, - other less-favoured areas, and - areas affected by specific handicaps; 153.
Notes two points of apparent concern: (a) it is the Member States' responsibility to classify areas as less-favoured; (b) in some Member States, these areas have been expanded considerably over the years [38]; 155.
Calls on the Commission to undertake, in its next follow-up report, a comprehensive and thorough review of the current classification of all less-favoured areas and, in addition, to draft a proposal for a periodic review of the situation of less-favoured areas and introduce an effective system not only to prevent the areas concerned from being extended but also allowing them to be reduced; 160.
Notes that the individual Member States use a very wide range of different indicators to establish the boundaries of less-favoured areas (17 indicators for productivity, 12 for economy and three for population) (Special Report 4/2003, paragraph 33 and Annex II), and that the Court noted during its audit on the spot that the wide range of different indicators may lead to discriminatory treatment of beneficiaries, particularly in border regions; 161.
Calls, in this connection, for a review, no later than 15 June 2004, of the suitability and relevance of the current series of indicators, restricting them where possible and for them to be defined (or redefined) in such a way that they provide fewer opportunities for "manipulation" by the Member States; 162.
Calls on the Commission to adapt and update the definition of "good farming practices", and to ensure that the Member States apply this condition consistently and supply the requisite documentation which proves that they have actually done so; points out, in this connection, that, in the 2004 budget, Parliament made available appropriations so that the use of environmental indicators might be further developed; 168.
Suggests that the Commission review the existing 22 agricultural support measures and consider whether some of them could be combined in the interests of more effective monitoring; The Structural Funds Implementation of the budget in 2002 172.
Draws attention to the following analysis: in 2002, implementation of commitment appropriations was close to 98 % (see table 1).
However, for payment appropriations the implementation rate was considerably lower, as was also the case in 2000 and 2001.
Structural Funds In 2002, the implementation rate for payments to structural actions was just below 75 %.
TABLE 2 Payments for structural actions, 2002 | Authorised appropriations | Implemented appropriations | Difference | Implementation rate | (EUR million) | (%) | New programmes (2000 to 2006) | 24289 | 22326 | 1964 | 91,9 | Old programmes (before 2000) | 7314 | 1173 | 6141 | 16,0 | Of which: | | | | | Objective 1 | 3388 | 609 | 2779 | 18,0 | Objective 2 | 1600 | 243 | 1357 | 15,2 | Objective 3 | 500 | 0 | 500 | 0,0 | Other actions | 240 | 80 | 160 | 33,2 | Community initiatives | 1478 | 181 | 1297 | 12,2 | Innovative actions/technical assistance | 108 | 61 | 47 | 56,2 | Total | 31603 | 23499 | 8104 | 74,4 | Source: Annual accounts of the European Communities for 2002. | In 2002, payments on old programmes represented reimbursements of actual expenditure in Member States.
Preaccession aid Preaccession aid (heading 7) consisted of three programmes: Phare (administrative assistance), ISPA (structural assistance) and Sapard (agriculture) [40].
For example, accreditation of the competent authorities did not take place until the second half of 2002 for Poland, Romania and Hungary.
However, of the outstanding commitments at the end of 2002, less than 12 % related to years earlier than 2000. 173.
Notes with satisfaction that implementation of commitment appropriations was higher in 2002 than in 2001 and 2000, but regrets that implementation of payment appropriations remained at an unsatisfactory low rate, leading to a very high surplus of the EU budget for the third year in a row; 174.
Is in particular worried about the continuing low implementation of payment appropriations for structural actions and preaccession aid, although the level of payment appropriations implemented in 2002 for these two headings in the budget was higher than in 2000 and 2001; 175.
Notes that the main reason for the low implementation rate for payment appropriations for structural actions in 2002 was the far slower than expected closure of the old programmes; notes the Commission's progress report to the discharge authority examining the causes of this delay and evaluating means of preventing similar delays in closure for the programmes for 2000 to 2006; 176.
Is surprised that the Commission has not published the guidance notes relating to the Sapard programme in all the languages of the new Member States, as requested in paragraph 81 of Parliament Resolution of 8 April 2003 [42] concerning discharge for the 2001 financial year; insists that the Commission remedies this situation at the earliest opportunity; Member Statesâ€™ forecasts 177.
Notes that a significant number of Member States failed to submit their forecasts for payment applications for the budget years 2002 and 2003 before the deadline of 30 April 2002 as required under the terms of Article 32(7) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 [43] on Structural Funds; observes further that the overall error rate for the forecasts for all programmes amounted to 73 %, with two thirds of this total being attributable to the excessively unrealistic forecasts coming from five Member States; 178.
Urges the Commission to consider introducing a sanctions mechanism in the Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 for the upcoming programme period (2007 to 2013), particularly in the case where the 2004 and 2005 forecasting exercises fail to demonstrate a continued improvement; 179.
Welcomes the Commission's announcement that it will provide Parliament every quarter with a breakdown of the situation as regards the application of the N+2 rule, as Parliament requested in paragraph 27 of its Resolution of 22 October 2003 [44] on Structural Funds; trusts that cooperation between the two institutions in connection with this "monitoring" activity will bear fruit, with particular regard to the identification of the reasons for the constant problems encountered in project realisation and of the best methods for managing projects; Reasons for underutilisation 183.
Welcomes the Commission's initiative to ask the Member States to submit yearly reports on the implementation of control activities in 2002 and expresses the wish to receive a summary report thereon; Structural Fund effectiveness 188.
Notes the findings of the review carried out by OLAF and the Regional Policy DG into the systems and procedures used by the Member States for reporting irregularities and the recovery of amounts unduly paid; notes, on the basis of those findings, that, in 2002 and 2003, the Member States were still uncertain as to the correct application of some of the provisions of Commission Regulations (EC) No 1681/94 [45] and (EC) No 438/2001 [46]; notes the follow-up and/or simplification measures announced by the Commission with a view to the elimination of such uncertainty; calls on the Commission to report back to Parliament on the progress made towards the attainment of that objective; Issues related to the future of the Structural Funds 190.
Shares the Commission's hope that delays can be avoided for the legislative proposals for the forthcoming programming period and that the procedure can be prepared by 1 January 2007 [48]; 192.
Notes that responsibility for implementing internal policies is divided among 13 directorates-general; 197.
Asks the Commission to devise procedures to enhance the consistency of the ex ante and mid-term evaluation processes so as to ensure that a more consistent information basis is created for ex post evaluation; 198.
Congratulates the Court of Auditors on its interesting analysis of selected annual activity reports and declarations for 2002 of certain directorates-general [52], and notes that: (a) all the directorates-general concerned claimed to have reasonable assurance that the funds for which they were responsible had been legally and regularly spent (6.11); (b) all the directorates-general examined included reservations concerning the regularity of payments for the multiannual research programme and the failure to implement internal control standards (6.19); 200.
Notes that the rates of utilisation of payment appropriations (Chapter B2-7) for transport policy, particularly security in this sector, are once again inadequate, although there are reasons for this, such as delays in the implementation of actions by contractors and stricter rules applied by the Commission, entailing a slowdown in payments; 203.
Expresses concern regarding the highly disappointing progress made with several TEN-transport projects, despite the high level of utilisation of payment appropriations; the Court of Auditors in its 2002 annual report indicated that some of the projects monitored in 2002 would have proceeded even without Community financial assistance, which may suggest that some projects are not of sound quality or that implementation mechanisms are inadequate; 206.
Notes that the Court puts forward the following recommendations, among others, with a view to improving controls: (a) more precise definition of "eligibility of costs" (6.27); (b) introduction of a standardised cost claim form (6.26); (c) coherent and consistent application of the TEN-T rules in all Member States (6.38); (d) checks to be more effective and better documented (6.40); (e) ex post financial and technical audits to complement on-the-spot checks prior to final payment (6.41); 208.
Considers that the Commission could introduce a coordination or synthesis system which will make it possible to obtain synergies from the remarks contained in the audit reports for each Directorate-General; 212.
Is concerned about the low number of officials in DG Environment dealing with infringement procedures, in particular as environment-related cases represent almost one-half of the infringement cases started in 2002 and over one third of all complaints related to bad application of EU law, and calls upon the Commission to significantly increase the number of officials in this sector in accordance with its task of being the guardian of the Treaties, thus responsible for the correct implementation of EU environmental legislation; 221.
Notes that, in the framework of the establishment of the budget for 2002, the Commission organised its activity around six priority objectives, namely the euro, sustainable development, development cooperation, the Mediterranean, enlargement, and the new governance, and that these objectives have guided the Commission's work planning, the process of drawing up the budget and the use of resources; while endorsing the priorities, notes that under Article 3(2) of the Treaty the promotion of gender equality is a fundamental principle of the EU and a horizontal objective of all Community actions and policies; calls on the Commission, therefore, to ensure that gender equality is henceforth one of the priority objectives of its strategic planning, in such a way as to ensure gender mainstreaming in the definition of income and expenditure under all policies included in the budget; 223.
Welcomes the fact that the Action Programme for equality between men and women (2001 to 2005) will be opened up in 2002 to the participation of the accession countries; stresses that, under the 2002 budget and, in particular, in the framework of Community assistance to the accession countries, gender mainstreaming should be applied to all measures; calls, therefore, on the Commission to submit a state-of-progress report on the projects and actions for promoting equality in those beneficiary countries of the Community's contribution, as well as on the level of that contribution; calls on the Commission, in addition, to draw up an interim evaluation report on the 2001 to 2005 action programme, including data on the funds allocated to the projects undertaken in the different fields of the programme; 224.
Considers not only that there should be more audits of the use of EU funds, but also, in particular, that auditing should be made more effective, and urges all the parties involved to do everything possible to ensure that: (a) common audit standards are introduced in the present and future Member States; (b) the national supreme audit institutions in the present and future Member States are provided with mechanisms which will make it possible to perform the same audit tasks as those performed by the Court of Auditors at Community level; (c) cooperation between national supreme audit institutions is encouraged; 229.
Takes the view that enlargement will make great demands in terms of the information to be provided by the Commission to the discharge authority and to the public, and that it can be improved if the Commission: (a) structures the information in the report on budgetary and financial management in the financial year (Article 128(3) of the Financial Regulation) in such a way that it corresponds to the various policy areas; (b) provides detailed information on implementation of the various funds in the individual Member States; (c) states clearly, in a concise overview, which DGs are involved in the implementation of the various policy areas; (d) compiles information in such a way that it can be used by national supreme audit institutions in their own audits; (e) publishes its audits of Member States' management and control systems; (f) adjusts in general to the fact that information must be compiled in such a way that it is accessible and comprehensible to all, not only to Member State finance ministries; 231.
Expects that the Commission will produce a global report, no later than 15 June 2004, on the successes and shortcomings of the 503 projects approved between 1998 and 2001 [55]; 236.
Calls on the applicant countries to draw up sustainable and viable environmental and financial strategies; 238.
Notes that, as a result of the complicated reorganisation of Commission departments dealing with external relations, the Court regards 2002 as "a transitional year"; considers that the reorganisation could have been more extensive since there are still six different DGs and various departments sharing responsibility for external relations [57]; 242.
Notes with satisfaction that the Court's audit concentrated on the supervisory and control systems designed to ensure the legality and regularity of transactions and welcomes the Court's findings that both "administrative procedures and organisational structures have been adjusted appropriately by both the EuropeAid Cooperation Office and the Humanitarian Aid Office to cater for the introduction of the new Financial Regulation which entered into force on 1 January 2003" (7.40); Controls relating to external measures 244.
Notes also that the Court attributes the lack of quality in the supervisory and control systems to the fact that no overall auditing strategy was established to ensure that sufficient information was available at senior management level (7.10); 246.
Stresses that major and recurrent implementation problems like the ones encountered in the TACIS region and in other regions should routinely be reported by the Commission to the Budgetary Authority and the Court; emphasises that these reports should include analyses of causes as well as accounts of action taken or planned in response to the problems - all in clear language and indicating how further succinct information on different aspects can be obtained; 250.
Notes that the 2002 annual report from the Humanitarian Aid Office - ECHO (COM(2003) 430), setting out the humanitarian actions financed by the Commission to a total, over the year in question, of EUR 537,8 million, provides large numbers of details which, albeit useful, do not allow the reader to form a global picture of Community action, since insufficient attention is paid to horizontal issues; 264.
Takes the view that no NGO or organisation should be able to bid exclusively or to receive 100 % of the appropriations entered against any one budget heading; 266.
Trusts that the evaluation of the food security instrument in 2004 will provide a sound diagnosis and that, in the case of integration into the overall development programme, there will be no devaluation or dilution of the food security objectives [64]; Transparency of the Commission's operations vis-Ã -vis the European Parliament 268.
Deeply regrets that, since 2000, the Commission has failed to submit an annual report to the European Parliament on the operations financed under Council Regulations (EC) No 975/1999 [65] and (EC) No 976/1999 [66] (on the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, Chapter B7-70, where the 2002 appropriation amounted to EUR 104000000) in breach of Article 18(2) and Article 19(2) of those Regulations; demands that the Commission provide the European Parliament immediately with the annual reports for 2001, 2002 and 2003, which, as laid down in the Regulations, should include "a review of any external evaluation exercises which may have been conducted"; calls on the Committee on Budgetary Control to review the Commission's failure in this regard and also to provide a qualitative analysis of the results achieved by the Commission's operations under this chapter of the budget; Administrative expenditure The invalidity pensions scheme of the European institutions 269.
Points out that the Court estimates that around EUR 10 million could be saved each year if monitoring systems were set up making early detection and treatment possible for people who are absent on sick leave repeatedly or for prolonged periods (Special Report 3/2003, paragraph 55); 275.
Recalls its resolution of 21 November 2002 [68] on the EIB Annual Report for 2001 which called on the EIB, the Court of Auditors and the Commission to amend the tripartite agreement; is satisfied that the new tripartite agreement signed on 27 October 2003 significantly improves the procedures involving the three institutions; is particularly satisfied with the clarification that the Court of Auditors is authorised to audit both the guarantee and the underlying transaction when the EIB provides loans guaranteed by the EU budget; recalls that such EIB loans guaranteed by the EU budget amounted to almost EUR 14 billion at year-end 2002; 280.
Fully supports the conclusions of the Court with regard to the Financial Mechanism (paragraphs 10.35 and 10.39 of the 2002 Annual Report), that final payments should be carried out only on the basis of appropriate certificates issued by the competent authorities of the Member States and that greater efforts are needed to identify suitable investments and to take into account overall project realisation, particularly in order to avoid damage to the environment; 281.
