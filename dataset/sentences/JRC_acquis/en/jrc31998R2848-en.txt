Beaudesson method 1.
The moisture content is determined by weighing before and after drying, the balance being calibrated in such a way that the reading given by the 10 g quantity used corresponds directly to the moisture content value in %. 2.
Procedure A 10 g quantity is weighted out in a pan with a perforated base and then put into the drying column, where it is supported by a spiral ring.
The oven is turned on for five minutes, during which time the warm air causes the sample to dry at a temperature of about 100 °C.
Brabender method 1.
Procedure The thermostat is set at 110 °C.
