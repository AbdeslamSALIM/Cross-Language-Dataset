The Committee may modify the form. 3.
The examination of requests shall in particular take into account: (a) the level of development or the geographical situation of the ACP State or States concerned; (b) cases where the application of the existing rules of origin would significantly affect the ability of an existing industry in an ACP State to continue its exports to the Community, with particular reference to cases where this could lead to cessation of its activities; (c) specific cases where it can be clearly demonstrated that significant investment in an industry could be deterred by the rules of origin and where a derogation favouring the realisation of the investment programme would enable these rules to be satisfied by stages. 4.
In the examination of requests, special account shall be taken, case by case, of the possibility of conferring originating status on products which include in their composition materials originating in neighbouring developing countries, least-developed countries or developing countries with which one or more ACP States have special relations, provided that satisfactory administrative co-operation can be established. 7.
Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 6, the derogation shall be granted where the value added to the non-originating products used in the ACP State or States concerned is at least 45 % of the value of the finished product, provided that the derogation is not such as to cause serious injury to an economic sector of the Community or of one or more Member States. 8.

The provisions of this Protocol shall apply mutatis mutandis in determining whether products may be deemed as originating in the ACP States when imported into Ceuta and Melilla. 3.
For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 3 and 4, the insufficient operations listed in Article 5 shall not be considered as working or processing. 6.

TITLE VII FINAL PROVISIONS Article 40 Revision of rules of origin In accordance with Article 7 of Annex V, the Council of Ministers shall examine annually, or whenever the ACP States or the Community so request, the application of the provisions of this Protocol and their economic effects with a view to making any necessary amendments or adaptations.
The Council of Ministers shall take into account among other elements the effects on the rules of origin of technological developments.
Article 41 Annexes The Annexes to this Protocol shall form an integral part thereof.
The first column gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and the second column gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter.
For each entry in the first two columns a rule is specified in columns 3 or 4.
Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column 1 or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column 2 is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in columns 3 or 4 apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column 1. 3.
Where, for an entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in both columns 3 and 4, the exporter may opt, as an alternative, to apply either the rule set out in column 3 or that set out in column 4.
The provisions of Article 4 of the Protocol concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products apply regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in the Community or in the ACP States.
Example: An engine of heading No 8407, for which the rule states that the value of the non-originating materials which may be incorporated may not exceed 40 per cent of the ex-works price, is made from %quot%other alloy steel roughly shaped by forging%quot% of heading No ex 7224.
Without prejudice to Note 3.2 where a rule states that %quot%materials of any heading%quot% may be used, materials of the same heading as the product may also be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.
However, the expression %quot%manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading No ...%quot% means that only materials classified in the same heading as the product of a different description than that of the product as given in column 2 of the list may be used. 4.
When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that any one or more materials may be used.
Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together.
The term %quot%natural fibres%quot% includes horsehair of heading No 0503, silk of heading Nos 5002 and 5003 as well as the wool fibres, fine or coarse animal hair of heading Nos 5101 to 5105, the cotton fibres of heading Nos 5201 to 5203 and the other vegetable fibres of heading Nos 5301 to 5305. 3.
The terms %quot%textile pulp%quot%, %quot%chemical materials%quot% and %quot%paper-making materials%quot% are used in the list to describe the materials not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns. 4.
The term %quot%man-made staple fibres%quot% is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of heading Nos 5501 to 5507.
However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may only be applied to mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials.
The following are the basic textile materials: - silk, - wool, - coarse animal hair, - fine animal hair, - horsehair, - cotton, - paper-making materials and paper, - flax, - true hemp, - jute and other textile bast fibres, - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave, - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres, - synthetic man-made filaments, - artificial man-made filaments, - current conducting filaments, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyphenylene sulphide, - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyvinyl chloride, - other synthetic man-made staple fibres, - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose, - other artificial man-made staple fibres, - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped, - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped, - products of heading No 5605 (metallized yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, - other products of heading No 5605.
Example: A yarn of heading No 5205 made from cotton fibres of heading No 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading No 5506 is a mixed yarn.
Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres that do not satisfy the origin rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used up to a weight of 10 per cent of the yarn.
Example: Tufted textile fabric of heading No 5802 made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and cotton fabric of heading No 5210 is only a mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric being made from yarns classified in two separate headings or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.
Example: If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading No 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading No 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is accordingly a mixed product. 3.
In the case of products incorporating %quot%yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether whether or not gimped%quot% this tolerance is 20 per cent in respect of this yarn. 4.
In the case of those textile products, which are marked in the list by a footnote referring to this Introductory Note, textile trimmings and accessories which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made up products concerned may be used provided that their weight does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the textile materials incorporated.
Textile trimmings and accessories are those classified in Chapters 50 to 63.
Any non-textile trimmings and accessories or other materials used which contain textiles do not have to satisfy the conditions set out in column 3 even though they fall outside the scope of Note 3.5. 3.
For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, the %quot%specific processes%quot% are the following: (a) vacuum distillation; (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(2); (c) cracking; (d) reforming; (e) extraction by means of selective solvents; (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerization; (h) alkylation; (i) isomerization. 2.
For the purposes of heading Nos 2710, 2711 and 2712, the %quot%specific processes%quot% are the following: (a) vacuum distillation; (b) redistillation by a very thorough fractionation process(3) (c) cracking; (d) reforming; (e) extraction by means of selective solvents; (f) the process comprising all the following operations: processing with concentrated sulphuric acid, oleum or sulphuric anhydride; neutralization with alkaline agents; decolorization and purification with naturally active earth, activated earth, activated charcoal or bauxite; (g) polymerization; (h) alkylation; (i) isomerization; (j) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, desulphurization with hydrogen resulting in a reduction of at least 85 per cent of the sulphur content of the products processed (ASTM D 1266-59 T method); (k) in respect of products falling within heading No 2710 only, deparaffining by a process other than filtering; (l) in respect of heavy oils falling within heading No ex 2710 only, treatment with hydrogen at a pressure of more than 20 bar and a temperature of more than 250 °C with the use of a catalyst, other than to effect desulphurization, when the hydrogen constitutes an active element in a chemical reaction.
For the purposes of heading Nos ex 2707, 2713 to 2715, ex 2901, ex 2902 and ex 3403, simple operations such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, any combination of these operations or like operations do not confer origin.

%gt%TABLE%gt% PROTOCOL 2 on the implementation of Article 9 1.
Both Parties are guided by the conviction that the implementation of Article 9 (4) and (5) would enable them to recognize, at an early stage, problems which could arise and, taking account of all relevant factors, avoid as far as possible recourse to measures which the Community would prefer not to adopt vis-à-vis its preferential trading partners. 3.
The following two procedures result from this: (a) The statistical surveillance mechanism Without prejudice to internal arrangements that the Community may apply to control its imports, Article 9 (4) provides for the institution of a mechanism intended to ensure statistical surveillance of certain ACP exports to the Community and thus facilitate the examination of occurrences such as to cause market disturbances.
These consultations will take place at the request of either Party. 5.
If the conditions of application of safeguard measures as provided for in Article 8 are fulfilled, it would be the responsibility of the Community, in accordance with Article 9(1) relating to prior consultations concerning the application of safeguard measures, to enter immediately into consultations with the ACP States concerned by providing them with all the information necessary for those consultations, especially the necessary data from which to determine to what extent imports of a specific product from an ACP State or States have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to the Community's domestic producers of like or directly competitive products or serious disturbances in a sector of the economy of the Community or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region of the Community. 6.
In this case, the interests of the least developed, landlocked and island ACP States will receive particular attention, in accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement.
The Community undertakes for an indefinite period to purchase and import, at guaranteed prices, specific quantities of cane sugar, raw or white, which originate in the ACP States and which these States undertake to deliver to it. 2.
The safeguard clause in Article 10 of the Convention shall not apply.
Without prejudice to Article 7, no change in this Protocol may enter into force until a period of five years has elapsed from the date on which the Convention enters into force.
In each 12-month period from 1 July to 30 June inclusive, hereinafter referred to as the %quot%delivery period%quot%, the sugar-exporting ACP States undertake to deliver the quantities referred to in Article 3 (1), subject to any adjustments resulting from the application of Article 7.
A similar undertaking shall apply equally to the quantities referred to in Article 3 (3) in respect of the period up to 30 June 1975, which shall also be regarded as a delivery period. 2.
The quantities to be delivered up to 30 June 1975, referred to in Article 3 (3), shall include supply en route from port of shipment or, in the case of landlocked States, across frontiers. 3.
Deliveries of ACP cane sugar in the period up to 30 June 1975 shall benefit from the guaranteed prices applicable in the delivery period beginning 1 July 1975.
The Community undertakes to purchase, at the guaranteed price, quantities of white or raw sugar, within agreed quantities, which cannot be marketed in the Community at a price equivalent to or in excess of the guaranteed price. 4.
If, during any delivery period, a sugar-exporting ACP State fails to deliver its agreed quantity in full for reasons of force majeure the Commission shall, at the request of the State concerned, allow the necessary additional period for delivery. 2.
Such reallocation shall be made by the Commission after consultation with the States concerned. 3.
If, during any delivery period, a sugar-exporting ACP State fails to deliver its agreed quantity in full for reasons other than force majeure, that quantity shall be reduced in respect of each subsequent delivery period by the undelivered quantity. 4.
It may be decided by the Commission that, in respect of subsequent delivery periods, the undelivered quantity shall be reallocated between the other States, which are referred to in Article 3.
Article 10 The provisions of this Protocol shall remain in force after the date specified in Article 91 of the Convention.
Declaration by the Community concerning sugar originating in Belize, St-Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla and Suriname a) The Community undertakes to adopt the necessary measures to ensure the same treatment as provided for in Protocol 3, for the following quantities of cane sugar, raw or white, originating in: %gt%TABLE%gt% b) Nevertheless, in respect of the period up to 30 June 1975, the quantities shall be as follows: %gt%TABLE%gt% 3.
Declaration by the Community on Article 10 of Protocol 3 The Community declares that Article 10 of Protocol 3 providing for the possibility of denunciation in that Protocol, under the conditions set out in that Article, is for the purposes of juridical security and does not represent for the Community any qualification or limitation of the principles enunciated in Article 1 of that Protocol(2). (1) Annex XIII to the Final Act of the ACP - EEC Convention. (2) Annex XXII to the Final Act of the ACP - EEC Convention.
Article 1 Within the limits referred to in Article 2, customs duties other than ad valorem duties applicable to beef and veal originating in the ACP States shall be reduced by 92 %.
The Commission shall ensure that a decision is taken by 15 November at the latest.
