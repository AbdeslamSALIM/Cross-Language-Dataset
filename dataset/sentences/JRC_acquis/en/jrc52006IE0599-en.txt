At its 426th plenary session, held on 20 and 21 April 2006 (meeting of 21 April) the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 57 votes with one abstention: 1.
Recommendations 1.1 In its opinions of 16 January 2002 and 24 September 2003, the EESC called upon all stakeholders to continue to work towards the goals of harmonising and integrating inland waterway transport in Europe.
The ministerial conference to be held in Romania in 2006 will have to indicate the extent to which action can now indeed also be taken in the political field. 1.5 The introduction of a uniform, integrated system of law must not jeopardise the high level of protection, safety and uniform application of the law which exists, particularly in respect of the Rhine.
Accordingly, the EESC plans to take part this year in the relevant hearings of the European Parliament and if possible also in the Ministerial Conference on Pan-European Inland Waterway Transport at the end of 2006 in Romania. 2.
The latter issue is being further expanded upon in the own-initiative opinion of September 2005 entitled Social policy within a pan-European system for regulating inland waterway transport. 2.2 In the second of the abovementioned opinions, the EESC calls upon all inland waterway stakeholders to step up their efforts to achieve integrated legal provisions and uniform law governing inland waterway transport.
Cooperation between the CCNR and the European Commission was given fresh stimulus by the conclusion of a cooperation agreement on 3 March 2003.
The Group also considered that the existing institutional framework was too weak to secure the political attention required to further develop this sector. 4.3 As already recommended by the EESC in its opinions of 16 January 2002 and 24 September 2003, the EFIN report sees the need for closer harmonisation of technical requirements, qualifications, certification procedures and market-access conditions for all European inland waterways.
respect what has already been achieved. 4.10 The Commission states that this process has already begun, referring to the Recommendation of 1 August 2003 from the Commission to the Council to negotiate membership of the two River Commissions, and to the EFIN report.
The success of the ministerial conferences on inland waterway transport held in 1991 and 2001 and the holding of another conference later this year in Romania indicate that the will exists.
