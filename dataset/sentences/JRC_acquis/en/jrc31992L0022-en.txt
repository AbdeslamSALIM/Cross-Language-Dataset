FIRE-RESISTANCE TEST 10.1.
This method permits testing of the materials and coverings used inside vehicles to be tested either individually or in combination up to a thickness of 13 mm.
Definitions 10.2.1.
Principle A sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the action of a defined low-energy flame for 15 seconds in a combustion chamer, the flame acting on the free edge of the sample.
The combustion chamber is placed on four feet, 10 mm high.
The dimensions are given in Figure 18.
The lower side of the sample shall be 178 mm above the floor plate; the distance of the front edge of the sample holder from end of the chamber shall be 22 mm; the distances of the longitudinal sides of the sample holder from the sides of the chamber shall be 50 mm (all inside dimensions) (see Figures 15 and 16). 10.4.3.
Gas burner The small ignition source is provided by a Bunsen burner having an inside diameter of 9,5 mm.
It is so located in the test cabinet that the centre of its nozzle is 19 mm below the centre of the bottom edge of the open end of the sample (see Figure 16). 10.4.4.
Test gas The gas supplied to the burner shall have calorific value of about 38 MJ/m³ (for example natural gas). 10.4.5.
Metal comb, at least 110 mm in length, with seven or eight smooth rounded teeth per 25 mm. 10.4.6.
Stop-watch, accurate to 0,5 sec. 10.4.7.
Fume cupboard The cumbustion chamber may be placed in a fume-cupboard assembly provided that the latter's internal volume is at least 20 times, but not more than 110 times, greater than the volume of the combustion chamber and provided that no single height, width, or length dimension of the fume cupboard is greater than 2¹/2 times either of the other two dimensions.
Before the test the vertical velocity of the air through the fume cupboard shall be measured 100 mm forward of and to the rear of the ultimate site of the combustion chamber.
It shall be between 0,10 and 0,30 m/s in order to avoid possible discomfort to the operator from combustion products.
Shape and dimension The shape and dimensions of samples are given in Figure 20.
The thickness of the sample corresponds to the thickness of the product to be tested.
In this case the material is tested over the product width; (b) for a sample having a width of 60 to 100 mm the length shall be at least 138 mm.
In this case the potential burning distance corresponds to the length of the sample, the measurement starting at the first measuring point; (c) samples less than 60 mm wide and less than 356 mm long, and samples 60 to 100 mm wide and less than 138 mm long cannot be tested in accordance with the present method, nor can samples less than 3 mm wide. 10.5.2.
When the material is supplied in set widths a length of at least 500 mm covering the entire width shall be cut.
Samples shall be taken in the same way from finished products when the shape of the product so permits.
If the thickness of the product is over 13 mm it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face a passenger compartment.
In the case of materials comprising superimposed layers of different composition which are not considered to be composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the passenger compartment shall be tested individually. 10.5.3.
Place the sample in the sample holder (item 10.4.2) so that the exposed side faces downwards towards the flame. 10.6.3.
The flame shall burn for at least one minute, for stabilization, before the first test is started. 10.6.4.
Push the sample-holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the sample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow. 10.6.5.
When running a series of tests or performing repeat tests make sure before starting a test that the temperature of the combustion chamber and sample holder does not exceed 30 oC. 10.7.
Interpretation of results Plastic coated (item 2.3 in Annex I) and plastic safety glazing (item 2.4 in Annex I) should be considered satisfactory from the point of view of burning behaviour (fire resistance) if the burn rate does not exceed 250 mm minute. 11.
