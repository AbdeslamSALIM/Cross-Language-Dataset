For the Commission Martin BANGEMANN Vice-President (1) OJ No L 42, 23. 2. 1970, p. 1. (2) OJ No L 220, 8. 8. 1987, p. 44. (3) OJ No L 262, 27. 9. 1976, p. 96. (4) OJ No L 192, 11. 7. 1987, p. 43.
Annex I is amended as follows: Items 1 to 1.1.5 are replaced by the following: Â´1.
TESTS ON COMPLETE HEADLAMPS Once the photometric values have been measured in accordance with the provisions of this Directive, at points Emax for the main beam and points HV, 50R, and B50L for the dipped beam, (or HV, 50L, B50R for headlamps designed for driving on the left), a complete headlamp sample shall be tested for stability of photometric performance in operation.
Test results 2.2.1.
The result expressed in milliradians (mrad) shall be deemed acceptable for a dipped-beam headlamp only where the absolute value D rI = [r3-r60] recorded on the headlamp is not more than 1,0 mrad (D rI 9 1,0 mrad). 2.2.2.
However, if that value is more than 1,0 mrad, but not more than 1,5 mrad (1,0 mrad %lt% D rI 9 1,5 mrad), a second headlamp shall be tested as described in 2.1 after being subjected three times in succession to the cycle described below, in order to stabilize the position of the mechanical parts of the headlamp on a base representative of the correct installation on the vehicle: - operation of the dipped-beam headlamp for one hour (the voltage being adjusted as specified in 1.1.1.2), - period of rest for one hour.
The headlamp type shall be deemed acceptable if the mean value of the absolute values D rI measured on the first sample and D rII on the second sample is not more than 1,0 mrad ( D rI + D rII 9 1,0 mrad ) ( D rI + D rII 2 9 1,0 mrad ) 3.
The headlamp shall be deemed acceptable if D r does not exceed 1,5 mrad.
