These measures impose double hull or equivalent design requirements for oil tankers delivered on or after 6 July 1996 aimed at preventing oil pollution in the event of collision or stranding.
All these categories, including the lowest one (3), are important for intra-Community trade. (13) The final date by which a single hull oil tanker is to be phased out is the anniversary of the date of delivery of the ship, according to a schedule starting in 2003 until 2007 for Category (1) oil tankers, and until 2015 for Category (2) and (3) oil tankers. (14) The revised Regulation 13G of Annex I of MARPOL 73/78 maintains the requirements for Category (1) tankers, after 25 years, to have wingtanks or double bottoms in protective locations not used for the carriage of cargo or to operate only with hydrostatically balanced loading. (15) That same Regulation introduces a requirement that Category (1) and (2) oil tankers may only continue to operate after the anniversary of the date of their delivery in 2005 and 2010 respectively subject to compliance with a Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS), adopted on 27 April 2001 by IMO in Resolution MEPC 94(46).
This Regulation shall apply to oil tankers of 5000 tons deadweight and above: - entering into a port or offshore terminal under the jurisdiction of a Member State, irrespective of their flag, or - flying the flag of a Member State. 2.
