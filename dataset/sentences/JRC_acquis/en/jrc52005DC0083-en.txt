Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty concerning the common position of the Council on the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions /* COM/2005/0083 final - COD 2002/0047 */ Brussels, 09.03.2005 COM(2005) 83 final 2002/0047 (COD) COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 251 (2) of the EC Treaty concerning the common position of the Council on the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions 2002/0047 (COD) COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSIONTO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENTpursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 251 (2) of the EC Treatyconcerning the common position of the Council on the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and Council on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions 1- BACKGROUND Date of transmission of the proposal to the EP and the Council (document COM(2002)[92] final – [2002/[0047]COD)[1]: | 20 February2002 | Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2]: | 19 September 2002 | Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading[3]: | 24 September 2002 | Date of adoption of the common position[4]: | 7 March 2005 | 2- OBJECTIVE OF THE COMMISSION PROPOSAL The proposal for a Directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions aims at harmonising the provisions of national patent law dealing with inventions which rely on computers for their performance.
As expressed in a statement by the Commission to be entered in the minutes of the Council adopting the common position (see below), the Commission considers that Article 6, read in conjunction with Recital 22, permits any acts as described by Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 91/250/EEC on the legal protection of computer programs by copyright, including any acts necessary to ensure interoperability, without the need for authorisation from the patent’s right holder.
Furthermore, Recital 21 recalls that a dominant supplier who refuses to allow the use of a patented technique to achieve interoperability is subject to the application of competition rules and in particular Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.
The application of these Articles therefore contributes to achieving the objectives laid out above, although it is of course important to note that competition law on its own cannot solve all potential problems in this area. . 3.2 Response to Parliament’s amendments at first reading Amendments accepted in full: 1, 2, 3, 34 (=115), 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 71, 92, 23, 26, 27.
Amendments accepted with minor modification: 85, 9, 86, 17, 19, 25.
Recitals 12 and 13 Council has moved the first part of recital 11 of the Commission’s proposal to recital 12 of the Commission’s proposal.
Recital 13 of the Commission’s proposal (deleted) Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 34 (=115).
Recital 14 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 85.
Recital 15 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 7.
Recital 16 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 8.
Recital 17 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 9.
Recital 18 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 86 with a slight modification to maintain conformity with the Articles and standard patent terminology (“obvious or non-technical” replaces “trivial”).
Recital 20 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 11.
Recital 22 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 13.
Article 3 of the Commission’s proposal (deleted) Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 15.
Article 3 Council restated and condensed Article 4 paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Commission’s proposal into a single paragraph according to Parliament’s amendment 16 and transferred the substance of Article 4(3) of the Commission’s proposal to Article 2(b) as noted above.
Article 6 The Council modified Article 6 in line with Parliament’s amendment 19 while also specifying the relevant Articles of Directive 91/250/EEC which are applicable in this context.
Article 7 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 71.
Article 9 Council accepted Parliament’s amendment 27.
Recital 21 The Commission supports the new wording as it reconfirms that an appropriate way to deal with potential competition issues between enterprises is through the established competition rules.
The application of Articles 81 and 82 therefore contributes to achieving objectives underlying the present directive.
The Commission can also accept the clarification in paragraph 2.
Article 6 It is logical to refer to the relevant interoperability provisions precisely so the Commission is in favour of this clarifying addition.
Article 10 Although the Commission would have preferred the swifter transposition envisaged by Parliament, it can accept twenty four months as the deadline for implementation. 4- CONCLUSION The Commission considers that Council’s common position maintains the balance aimed for in the original proposal and it can, therefore, accept it.
