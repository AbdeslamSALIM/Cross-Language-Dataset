Model B (See paragraphs 5.5, 14.5 and 23.5 of this Regulation) +++++ TIFF +++++ The above approval mark affixed to an engine/vehicle shows that the type concerned has been approved in the Netherlands (E 4), pursuant to Regulations No 24 and No 33 [1].
The approval numbers indicate that, at the dates when the respective approvals were given, Regulation No 24 included already the 03 series of amendments, but Regulation No 33 was in its original form. [1] The latter number is given as an example only. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 4 TEST AT STEADY SPEEDS OVER THE FULL-LOAD CURVE 1.
In the case of a test on a vehicle it should be established that the fuel flow is not less than that declared by the manufacturer. 3.1.5 The power of the engine measured at the test bench during the test at steady speeds of the full load curve may differ from the power specified by the manufacturer as follows: Maximum power ± 2 % at the other measurement points + 6 % - 2 %. 3.1.6 The exhaust device shall not have any orifice through which the gases emitted by the engine might be diluted.
In this case the steady state visible pollutants will also be measured with the engine rated at these other points, by the method described in Annex 4 to this Regulation, to enable the free acceleration absorption coefficient to be corrected in accordance with paragraph 3 of this Annex.
These values shall be recorded in Table 2 of Annex 2 to this Regulation.
The diagram below shows the six possible measuring points of the matrix and the range of power and speed governed by each point. +++++ TIFF +++++ | % of maximum rated speed | % of maximum torque at that speed | 1 | 100 | 100 | 2 | 90 | 100 | 3 | 100 | 90 | 4 | 90 | 90 | 5 | 100 | 80 | 6 | 90 | 80 | Each measuring point governs the power and speed area to the left of and below that point and is the measuring point for any engine rated in that area.
For example the measuring point at %quot%A%quot% which is for the 90 % full load line and 100 % rated speed applies to the rated power/speed area bounded by ABCD on the diagram. 2.3 If the test is a bench test the engine shall be disconnected from the brake, the latter being replaced either by the rotating parts driven when no gear is engaged or by an inertia substantially equivalent to that of the said parts (see paragraph 7.3 of Annex 1 to this Regulation). 2.4 If the test is carried out on a vehicle the gear-change control shall be set in the neutral position and the drive between engine and gear-box engaged. 2.5 With the engine idling, the accelerator control shall be operated quickly, but not violently, so as to obtain maximum delivery from the injection pump.
In establishment of their limit values the terms of ASTM D 3244 %quot%Defining a Basis for Petroleum Product Quality Disputes%quot% have been applied and, in fixing a maximum value, a minimum difference of 2R above zero has been taken into account; in fixing a maximum and minimum value, the minimum difference is 4R (R = Reproducibility).
Note 5: If it is required to calculate the thermal efficiency of an engine or vehicle, the calorific value of the fuel can be calculated from: specific energy (calorific value) (net) MJ/kg = (46,423 - 8,792 d2 +3,170 d) (1 — (x + y + s)) +9,420 s -2,499 x where: d is the density at 15 °C x is the proportion by mass of water (% divided by 100) y is the proportion by mass of ash (% divided by 100) s is the proportion by mass of sulphur (% divided by 100).

This effective length shall be indicated on the instrument. 2.3 The indicating dial of the opacimeter shall have two measuring scales, one in absolute units of light absorption from 0 to ∞ (m-1) and the other linear from 0 to 100; both scales shall range from 0 at total light flux to full scale at complete obscuration. 3.
The light source shall be protected against sooting by means that do not influence the optical path length beyond the manufacturer's specifications. 3.4 Receiver 3.4.1 The receiver shall consist of a photoelectric cell with a spectral response curve similar to the photopic curve of the human eye (maximum response in the range 550/570 nm; less than 4 % of that maximum response below 430 mm and above 680 nm). 3.4.2 The construction of the electrical circuit, including the indicating dial, shall be such that the current output from the photoelectric cell is a linear function of the intensity of the light received over the operating-temperature range of the photoelectric cell. 3.5 Measuring scales 3.5.1 The light-absorption coefficient k shall be calculated by the formula Ø = Øo e-kL, where L is the effective length of the light path through the gas to be measured, Øo the incident flux and Ø the emergent flux.
When the effective length L of a type of opacimeter cannot be assessed directly from its geometry, the effective length L shall be determined either by the method described in paragraph 4 of this Annex; or through correlation with another type of opacimeter for which the effective length is known. 3.5.2 The relationship between the 0-100 linear scale and the light-absorption coefficient k is given by the formula K = -1LLoge1 -N100 where N is a reading on the linear scale and k the corresponding value of the absorption coefficient. 3.5.3 The indicating dial of the opacimeter shall enable an absorption coefficient of 1,7 m -1 to be read with an accuracy of 0,025 m-1. 3.6 Adjustment and calibration of the measuring apparatus 3.6.1 The electrical circuit of the photoelectric cell and of the indicating dial shall be adjustable so that the pointer can be reset at zero when the light flux passes through the smoke chamber filled with clean air or through a chamber having identical characteristics. 3.6.2 With the lamp switched off and the electrical measuring circuit open or short-circuited, the reading on the absorption-coefficient scale shall be ∞, and it shall remain at ∞ with the measuring circuit reconnected. 3.6.3 An intermediate check shall be carried out by placing in the smoke chamber a screen representing a gas whose known light-absorption coefficient k, measured as described in paragraph 3.5.1, is between 1,6 m-1 and 1,8 m-1.
The value of k must be known to within 0,025 m-1.
In such cases the effective length L shall be that of a column of gas of uniform opacity which gives the same absorption of light as that obtained when the gas is normally admitted into the opacimeter. 4.1.2 The effective length of the light path is obtained by comparing the reading N of the opacimeter operating normally with the reading No obtained with the opacimeter modified so that the test gas fills a well defined length Lo . 4.1.3 It will be necessary to take comparative readings in quick succession to determine the correction to be made for shifts of zero. 4.2 Method of assessment of L 4.2.1 The test gas shall be exhaust gas of constant opacity or a light-absorptive gas of a gravimetric density similar to that of exhaust gas. 4.2.2 A column of length Lo of the opacimeter, which can be filled uniformly with the test gas, and the ends of which are substantially at right angles to the light path, shall be accurately determined.
The back pressure measured in the exhaust pipe at the opening of the probe shall not exceed 75 mm (water gauge). 2.1.2 The probe shall be a tube with an open end facing forwards in the axis of the exhaust pipe, or of the extension pipe if one is required.
To achieve this, the probe shall be placed as far downstream in the exhaust pipe as possible, or, if necessary, in an extension pipe so that, if D is the diameter of the exhaust pipe at the opening, the end of the probe is situated in a straight portion at least 6 D in length upstream of the sampling point and 3 D in length downstream.
If an extension pipe is used, no air shall be allowed to enter the joint. 2.1.3 The pressure in the exhaust pipe and the characteristics of the pressure drop in the sampling line shall be such that the probe collects a sample sensibly equivalent to that which would be obtained by isokinetic sampling. 2.1.4 If necessary, an expansion tank of compact design and of sufficient capacity to damp the pulsations may be incorporated in the sampling line as near to the probe as possible.
The design of the expansion tank and cooler shall not unduly disturb the composition of the exhaust gas. 2.1.5 A butterfly valve or other means of increasing the sampling pressure may be placed in the exhaust pipe at least three 3 D downstream from the sampling probe. 2.1.6 The connecting pipes between the probe, the cooling device, the expansion tank (if required) and the opacimeter shall be as short as is possible while satisfying the pressure and temperature requirements prescribed in Annex 8(3.8) and (3.9).
The back pressure measured in the exhaust pipe at the opening of the probe shall not exceed 75 mm (water gauge). 2.2.2 The probe shall be a tube with an open end facing forwards in the axis of the exhaust pipe, or of the extension pipe if one is required.
To achieve this, the probe shall be placed as far downstream in the exhaust pipe as possible or, if necessary, in an extension pipe so that, if D is the diameter of the exhaust pipe at the opening, the end of the probe is situated in a straight portion at least 6 D in length upstream of the sampling point and 3 D in length downstream.
If an extension pipe is used, no air shall be allowed to enter the joint. 2.2.3 The sampling system shall be such that at all engine speeds the pressure of the sample at the opacimeter is within the limits specified in Annex 8(3.8.2).
Whichever method is used, the back pressure measured in the exhaust pipe at the opening of the probe shall not exceed 75 mm (water gauge). 2.2.4 The pipes connecting with the opacimeter shall also be as short as possible.
FULL-FLOW OPACIMETER The only general precautions to be observed in steady-speed and free-acceleration tests are the following: 3.1 Joints in the connecting pipes between the exhaust pipe and the opacimeter shall not allow air to enter from outside. 3.2 The pipes connecting with the opacimeter shall be as short as possible, as prescribed in the case of sampling opacimeters.
The pipe system shall be inclined upwards from the exhaust pipe to the opacimeter, and sharp bends where soot might accumulate shall be avoided.
