CONCLUSIONS 9 COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Review of the application of the Simple Pressure Vessels Directive (87/404/EEC) in relation to the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC) SUMMARY The Directive 97/23/EC on Pressure Equipment contains an invitation to the Commission to carry out a review of the application of the Directive 87/404/EEC on Simple Pressure Vessels in order to ascertain the need for the integration of this Directive into the Pressure Equipment Directive.
This consultation was announced through various channels and was available on internet from the beginning of October 2004 until the end of January 2005.
The major product standard for simple pressure vessels is the EN 286 series (parts 1 to 4).
Furthermore, a transition to an integrated Directive would require the revision of all harmonised standards developed under the Simple Pressure Vessels Directive, focusing to EN 286 series.
Finally, integration of both directives would lead according to manufacturers for a certain transition period to an uncertain situation for simple pressure vessels manufacturers. 3.
The most important is the EN 286 series.
