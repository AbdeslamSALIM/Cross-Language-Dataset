Final report of the hearing officer in case COMP/38.381/B2 — De Beers (pursuant to Articles 15 and 16 of Commission Decision (2001/462/EC, ECSC) of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of Hearing Officers in certain competition proceedings — OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21 ) (Text with EEA relevance) Final report of the hearing officer in case COMP/38.381/B2 — De Beers (pursuant to Articles 15 and 16 of Commission Decision (2001/462/EC, ECSC) of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of Hearing Officers in certain competition proceedings — OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21) (2006/C 175/04) (Text with EEA relevance) The draft Decision presented to the Commission under Art. 9 of Council Regulation No 1/2003 concerns the trade relations of De Beers as regards rough diamonds.
It is addressed to De Beers SA (%quot%De Beers%quot%) as the parent company of, amongst others, City West and East limited (%quot%CWEL%quot%) and De Beers Centenary Aktiengesellschaft (%quot%DBCAG%quot%) (hereinafter %quot%the Parties%quot%).
Origin of the case: Merger Regulation and 17/62 of Council Regulation In the course of the investigation on the merger case M.2333 (De Beers/LVMH/Rapids World) which was concluded in July 2001, the Commission services became aware of the existence of a trade agreement (%quot%Trade Agreement%quot%) between De Beers and ALROSA Company Limited (%quot%ALROSA%quot%) for the sale of rough diamonds.
On 5 March 2002, following further investigation by the Commission, CWEL, DBCAG and ALROSA, in accordance with Articles 2 and 4 of No 17/62 of Council Regulation jointly applied to the Commission for negative clearance or, alternatively, for an individual exemption under Article 81(3) of the EC Treaty in respect of the Trade Agreement.
On 14 January 2003, the Commission issued a statement of objections (%quot%SO%quot%) under Article 82 EC addressed to De Beers, CEWL and DBCAG in respect of the Trade Agreement and granted them access to the Commission's file [1].
On 1 July 2003, a supplementary SO was addressed to the Parties, to the effect of adding Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement as an additional legal basis for the SO of 14 January 2003.
De Beers submitted written observations in response to the Commission's SO's and an oral hearing was held on 7 July 2003.
ALROSA participated at this oral hearing, as the oral hearing also addressed objections based on Article 81 which were separately addressed both to De Beers and ALROSA.
The Commission then received a complaint on 25 September 2003 against the Trade Agreement, alleging an infringement of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.
On 14 December 2004, CWEL and DBCAG on one side, and ALROSA on the other, submitted commitment proposals to the Commission in response to the Commission's statements of objections, which were deemed to constitute a preliminary assessment within the meaning of Art. 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003.
On 3 June 2005, the Commission published a notice according to Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in the Official Journal of the European Union.
The Notice informed the public of the Commission's perceived competition concerns, the corresponding remedies, and invited interested parties to submit comments by 4 July 2005 (%quot%the market test%quot%) [2].
In response to the Notice, the Commission received 21 observations from interested third parties.
On 27 October 2005 the Commission informed De Beers and ALROSA of these observations and handed over a non-confidential summary.
On 25 January 2006 De Beers submitted an amended commitment proposal.
In a Decision under Art. 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, violation of the competition rules is not established, but the Parties accept to remedy the concerns expressed by the Commission in a preliminary assessment.
This case has also been dealt with in the same manner, De Beers having submitted on 19 January 2006 a Declaration to the Commission to this effect after having received the results of the market test.
ALROSA was therefore informed of the essence of De Beers' amended commitment proposal insofar as it referred to them and was allowed to comment by 2 February 2006.
Therefore ALROSA's reply was expected to reach the Commission on 6 February 2006, which it did.
By letter of 6 February 2006, ALROSA expressed their views on the results of the market test.
