INITIATION OF AN ACCELERATED REVIEW (3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation.

It also examined whether the applicant had used any other subsidy schemes, or had received ad hoc subsidies in relation to the product concerned.
SUBSIDISATION (12) On the basis of the information contained in the applicant’s reply to the Commission’s questionnaire and further collected in the course of the investigation, the following schemes were investigated: - Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme, - Export Credit Scheme, - Export Oriented Unit Scheme/Special Economic Zones Scheme, - Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme, - Income Tax Exemption Scheme, - West Bengal Incentives Scheme. 2.1.
SCHEMES ORIGINALLY INVESTIGATED AND USED BY THE COMPANY 2.1.1.
Export Oriented Unit Scheme (EOUS)/Special Economic Zones Scheme (SEZS) (a) Legal basis (13) These schemes are based on the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act 1992 (No 22 of 1992) which entered into force on 7 August 1992 (Foreign Trade Act).
By the means of CENVAT-credit only an added value bears a definitive duty for the company, not the input materials. (30) Thus, only the exemption from basic customs duty, special additional customs duty, the sales tax reimbursement and the duty drawback on furnace oil constitute subsidies within the meaning of Article 2 of the basic Regulation.
Moreover, as set out in recitals 32 to 38, no proper verification system with regard to the final destination of the input materials was in place.
Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPBS) (51) The applicant had not availed itself of benefits under the DEPBS. 2.2.2.
Income Tax Exemption Scheme (53) It was established that the applicant did not, in the absence of taxable profits, receive the benefit of an income tax exemption under Section 10B of the Income Tax Act 1961 during the review investigation period. 2.3.
