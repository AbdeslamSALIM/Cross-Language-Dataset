2005/350/EC: Commission Decision of 7 May 2004 concerning the aid granted by Spain to olive pomace enterprises &amp;mdash; State aid C 21/02 (ex NN 14/02) (notified under document number C(2004) 1635) Commission Decision of 7 May 2004 concerning the aid granted by Spain to olive pomace enterprises — State aid C 21/02 (ex NN 14/02) (notified under document number C(2004) 1635) (Only the Spanish text is authentic) (2005/350/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, After giving notice to the interested parties to submit their comments in accordance with the above Article [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 14 December 2001, the Commission asked the Spanish authorities for information on the aid scheme for olive pomace enterprises. (2) By letter dated 4 January 2002, the Spanish authorities notified the Commission of the aid scheme for olive pomace enterprises described in the Decision to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty. (3) Since the aid scheme had already been adopted, it was transferred to the register of unnotified aid (aid No NN 14/02). (4) By letter of 12 March 2002, the Commission informed Spain of its decision to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 88(2) of the Treaty with respect to the aid scheme. (5) The Commission Decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities [2].
The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid. (6) By letter dated 15 April 2002, Spain submitted a series of comments.
By letter dated 2 April 2004, Spain submitted additional information. (7) The Commission has not received any comments from interested parties.
In determining rights, account is taken of the accredited volume of olive oil stocks at all stages of the production process in each branch of the industry on 3 July 2001, the volume of oil delivered to bottling plants for commercial distribution from that date until the date of entry into force of the MAFF Order of 14 November 2001 and a maximum standard price of ESP 125 (EUR 0,761266) per kilogram of stocks. (19) Beneficiaries must have adjusted or begun to adjust their production processes to the new specifications before the first deadline for the payment of interest and the production volume for the 2001/2002 marketing year must be similar to that for the previous three marketing years. (20) The maximum loans for the three branches are: - EUR 22537953,91 for extracting enterprises, - EUR 4507590,78 for refineries, - EUR 3005060,52 for bottlers. (21) The Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) (Official Credit Institute), in conjunction with financial institutions, offers loans on the following conditions: - loans are for one year, - the interest rate is the ICO reference rate for one-year loans at the time the loan is granted, - the margin of the financial institutions is 0,75 percentage points, - the risk is covered by the financial institutions, - the interest-rate subsidy provided by MAFF is of three percentage points, the beneficiaries having to pay a minimum of 1,5 %. (22) MAFF may also establish subsidies for guarantees provided, where appropriate, by the Sociedad Estatal de Caución Agraria (State Agricultural Guarantee Institute) where this is necessary for obtaining loans.
The subsidy for the guarantee is intended to cover the administration costs up to 1 % of the outstanding balance of the loan for which the guarantee is provided. (23) In initiating the procedure, the Commission took account of the following points. (24) The interest-rate subsidy for the loans constitutes aid granted by the State to olive pomace extracting, refining and bottling enterprises.
Beneficiaries also have to undertake to achieve a production level in the 2001/2002 marketing year similar to that in the previous three marketing years.
The oil was returned to the bottlers to be refined again to remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and then to be rebottled and relabelled before being returned to the market. (45) The stocks of olive pomace oil affected by the public measure were estimated at 50000 tonnes.
Consequently, the Commission is of the opinion that these measures must be considered selective State aid. (48) Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty apply to all agricultural products listed in Annex I subject to a common market organisation.
Articles 87 and 88 therefore apply to this aid. (49) According to Article 87(1), any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the common market. (50) In this case, the aid confers on beneficiaries an advantage that alleviates the normal burden on their budget.
Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty (56) Article 87(2)(b) provides that aid to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences is compatible with the common market.
Consequently, this aid is eminently sectoral and must be evaluated in accordance with Article 87(3)(c). (63) Article 87(3)(c) provides that aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or certain economic areas, where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, may be considered compatible with the common market. (64) The adjustment of production processes to the specifications set out in the Order of the Office of the Prime Minister of 25 July 2001 is a requirement for receipt of the aid.
In fact, the maximum loan entitlement per beneficiary is that recognised by the Olive oil Agency of MAFF, based on the accredited volume of olive oil stocks at all stages of the production process in each branch of the industry on 3 July 2001 and the volume of oil delivered to bottling plants for commercial distribution.
Therefore, these aids do not fulfil the conditions laid down by the above communication. (67) Spain, in its letter dated 2 April 2004, explained that the suspension of the market following a health alert was ordered by the Spanish administration on 3 July 2001 for reasons of food safety.
The Commission could, therefore, not normally consider the payment of aid to cover such losses as being in the common interest. (71) However in the present case, the Commission has taken into consideration the fact that until July 2001 no limit had been fixed by Community or national legislation for certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in olive pomace oil.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Spain.
