The inventory must be divided into two sections concerning: - perfume and aromatic raw materials, - other substances.
Introduction These lists are representative of the basic materials used in perfumes and aromatic compositions.
Such a system already exists in the 'acquis communautaire' - namely the Einecs inventory ('European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances'), (Official Journal of the European Communities No C 146A of 15 June 1990) and Elincs ('European List of Notified Chemical Substances'), whose most recent version was published in Official Journal of the European Communities No C 361 of 17 December 1994.
Orange oils from Brazil, Florida, California, etc., concentrated or otherwise, are all indicated under a single entry, i.e. 'sweet orange extractives', CAS 8028-48-6, Einecs 232-433-8.

Ethoxylated alcohols are named by completing the conventional alcoholic stem name with 'eth' followed by the average number of moles of ethylene oxide. 37.
The polyethylene glycol fraction of all other ethoxylated compounds that are not named by rule 6 or 36 is followed by the average number of moles of ethylene oxide. 38.
