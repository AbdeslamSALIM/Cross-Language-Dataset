Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated stability programme of Luxembourg, 2004-2007 /* SEC/2005/0013 final */ Brussels, 11.1.2005 SEC(2005) 13 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 On the updated stability programme of Luxembourg, 2004-2007 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No. 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that participating Member States, that is, those which have adopted the single currency, had to submit stability programmes to the Council and the Commission by 1 March 1999.
In accordance with Article 5 of this Regulation, the Council had to examine each stability programme based on assessments prepared by the Commission and the Committee set up by Article 114 of the Treaty (the Economic and Financial Committee).
Luxembourg’s first stability programme covering the period 1998-2002, was submitted on 16 February 1999 and assessed by the Council on 15 March 1999[2].
Updates have been presented every subsequent year, the most recent having been submitted on 30 November 2004.
Their evaluation is as follows: - The 2004 update of Luxembourg’s stability programme, covering the period 2004-2007, was submitted on 30 November 2004 after its approval by the government on 26 November.
This scenario is plausible: for the period 2004-2006, it is reasonably close to the autumn 2004 forecasts by the Commission services.
For the whole period, the real growth rates projected by the programme are consistent with the Commission services’ estimates of potential growth. - The general government balance having gone from a 0.8% -of-GDP surplus in 2003 to an estimated 1.4%-of-GDP deficit in 2004, the programme aims to reduce the deficit to 1.0% in 2005 and to stabilise it at about the same level in 2006 and 2007.
The debt ratio is forecast to decline somewhat over the time horizon covered by the update, from 5.0% of GDP in 2004 to 4.5% of GDP in 2007.
The update estimates real GDP growth at 4.4% in 2004, from 2.9% in 2003.
On the one hand, revenue projections in Luxembourg are traditionally cautious, and the 2004 budgetary outcome might be significantly better than currently estimated, which might perhaps entail a favourable base effect for the remaining years of the programme.
The debt ratio is extremely low and is even forecast to decline somewhat over the time horizon covered by the update, from 5.0% of GDP in 2004 to 4.5% of GDP in 2007.
