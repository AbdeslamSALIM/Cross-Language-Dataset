Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community - Generation, treatment and transboundary shipment of hazardous waste and other waste in the Member States of the European Union, 1997-2000 {SEC(2006) 1053} /* COM/2006/0430 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 1.8.2006 COM(2006) 430 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 259/93 of 1 February 1993 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community Generation, treatment and transboundary shipment of hazardous waste and other waste in the Member States of the European Union, 1997-2000 {SEC(2006) 1053} TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.
Generation of hazardous wastes 6 3.
Shipment of hazardous wastes into Member States 9 5.
Article 41 of the Regulation lays down that: 1. “Before the end of each calendar year, Member States shall draw up a report in accordance with Article 13(3) of the Basel Convention and send it to the Secretariat of the Basel Convention and a copy hereof to the Commission. 2.
It may request to this end additional information in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 91/692/EEC.” Pursuant to their obligation, most of the Member States have sent annual reports to the Commission on the supervision and control of shipments of waste.
The delay in delivering this report is due to the fact that information from some Member States arrived very late, and to a concentration of human resources in the Commission on the legislative revision of the Waste Shipment Regulation during the years 2002-2004.
On the basis of Article 41(2), the Commission in 1999 adopted a Decision[2] requiring additional information to be supplied by Member States in the form of a questionnaire.
The data on waste generation provided by Member States in their reports were, however, in most cases fragmentary, and few countries could present unbroken timelines (cf.
The available data for the years under review indicate an increase of about 10 % in the amount of hazardous waste generated within the Community as a whole, from ca. 36 million tonnes in 1997 to just over 40 million tonnes in 2000.
In the Netherlands, after a marked increase between 1994 and 1997, the generation of hazardous waste has dropped to some extent in the following years.
As regards the categories of hazardous waste according to the Y-codes used by the Basel Convention, information was supplied by only 9 Member States.
All Member States have submitted information on outbound shipment (“exports” in the Basel sense) of hazardous waste for at least two years within the period 1997-2000 (see Annex A, Table 5).
The quantity more than doubled from about 2.6 million tonnes in 1997 to 5.4 million tonnes in 2000.
Concerning the share of hazardous waste that was shipped for treatment to other countries - mostly neighbouring Member States -, the calculated figures vary between 0 and 25 % (Annex A, Figure 6).
The percentage was highest in Denmark, the Netherlands, and Portugal, which is comprehensible in the sense that they are all smaller countries without possibility to establish treatment capacity for all hazardous waste types inside their own borders.
As regards the categories of hazardous waste in terms of the Y-codes under the Basel Convention, it must be pointed out that many Member States did not specify these categories (see Annex A, Figure 9: “unknown”) or used a mixture of Y-codes (“mix”).
In 2000, about 4.5 million tonnes of waste (more than 80%) from 10 countries were recovered in this way (cf.
The shipments of waste for disposal out of Member States also doubled in the same period, but at a much lower level – from 400,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes.
In a middle group, consisting of Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden, the share of waste shipments for recovery lay between 40 and 60%.
The percentage of waste exported to countries outside EU/EFTA decreased from 11% in 1997 to 5% in 2000.
The countries exporting waste to non-OECD countries in 2000 were Germany, Italy and the Netherlands.
SHIPMENT OF HAZARDOUS WASTES INTO MEMBER STATES As part of their reports to the Basel Convention Secretariat, all Member States have submitted information on the import of hazardous waste for one or more years within the period 1997-2000 (see Annex A, Table 16).
Most of this increase again took place between 1999 and 2000.
The EU countries with the largest quantities of waste taken from abroad were Germany, Italy, Belgium, France and the Netherlands.
Their share of the total waste shipped to EU Member States rose from 82% in 1997 to 88% in 1999 and 2000.
Germany, Italy and Belgium alone accounted for 50% of total “imports” in 1997 and 67% in 2000.
Concerning the categories of hazardous waste shipped to Member States according to Y-codes, it must again be pointed out that for a large part of the waste no Y-code was declared (see Annex A, Figure 19: “unknown”) or the waste was placed in a group of mixed Y-codes (“mix”).
The German report for that year mentions as the largest single waste streams in this category construction and demolition waste from Luxembourg, and mixed wood waste and agricultural waste from the Netherlands.
The inbound shipments of hazardous waste for disposal also doubled in the same period, but at a much lower level – from 400,000 tonnes to 900,000 tonnes.
In Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden and the UK more than 80% of the waste coming from abroad was destined for recovery, while it was about 60% in Austria and Spain, and apparently less than 20% in Luxembourg (cf.
Annex A, Figures 23 and 24).
In 2000 Denmark, Portugal and Ireland were the only Member States that did not import waste from non-OECD countries. 5.
However, data were fragmentary concerning waste categories and total generation of hazardous waste.
This has to be taken into account when interpreting the data in the Annex to this Report. - The quantities of hazardous waste generated in the Community as a whole increased by about 10 % between 1997 and 2000, reaching a level of about 40 million tonnes per year.
The quantity of “exports” more than doubled from about 2.6 million tonnes in 1997 to 5.4 million tonnes in 2000, with a parallel rise in “imports” from 2.3 to 5.2 million tonnes. - About 90% of the hazardous waste shipped into Member States originated from other Member States.
