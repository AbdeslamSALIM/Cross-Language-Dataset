In the light of the Commission's considerable experience in applying those Articles to small and medium-sized enterprises active in the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products, it is appropriate, with a view to ensuring efficient supervision and simplifying administration without weakening Commission monitoring, that the Commission should make use of the powers conferred by Regulation (EC) No 994/98 also for small and medium-sized enterprises active in the production, processing and marketing of agricultural products, insofar as Article 89 of the Treaty has been declared applicable to such products.
Aid towards the costs of participation in trade fairs or of studies or consultancy services needed for the launch of a new or existing product on a new market should not normally constitute export aid. (13) In order to eliminate differences that might give rise to distortions of competition, to facilitate coordination between different Community and national initiatives concerning small and medium-sized enterprises and for reasons of administrative clarity and legal certainty, the definition of %quot%small and medium-sized enterprises%quot% used in this Regulation should be that laid down in Regulation (EC) No 70/2001. (14) In accordance with established practice of the Commission, and with a view to ensuring that aid is proportionate and limited to the amount necessary, thresholds should normally be expressed in terms of aid intensities in relation to a set of eligible costs, rather than in terms of maximum aid amounts. (15) In order to determine whether or not aid is compatible with the common market pursuant to this Regulation, it is necessary to take into consideration the aid intensity and thus the aid amount expressed as a grant equivalent.
In the interests of coherence with Community-financed support measures, the ceilings should be harmonised with those fixed in the agriculture guidelines and in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999. (18) It is appropriate to establish further conditions that should be fulfilled by any aid scheme or individual aid exempted by this Regulation.
Investments for the processing and marketing of agricultural products undertaken at farm level, not entailing an increase in capacity and having total eligible expenses below the limit set under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, should be examined according to the rules established for investments for the production of agricultural products.
On-farm investments for processing and marketing of agricultural products entailing an increase in production capacity, and/or having total eligible expenses above the limit set under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, should be examined according to the rules established for investments for the processing and marketing of agricultural products. (21) Where aid is granted to adapt to newly introduced standards at Community level, Member States should not be in a position to lengthen the adaptation period for farmers by delaying implementation of such rules.
For reasons of legal certainty, a reference to those provisions should be included in this Regulation, and therefore notification of those measures under Article 88 of the Treaty should not be necessary, insofar as it can be ascertained in advance that such aid is exclusively granted to small and medium-sized enterprises. (24) In order to ensure that the aid is necessary and acts as an incentive to develop certain activities, this Regulation should not exempt aid for activities in which the beneficiary would already engage under market conditions alone.
No aid should be granted retroactively in respect of activities which have already been undertaken by the beneficiary. (25) This Regulation should not exempt aid cumulated with other State aid, including aid granted by national, regional or local authorities, with public support granted within the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 or with Community assistance, in relation to the same eligible costs, when such cumulation exceeds the thresholds fixed in this Regulation. (26) In order to ensure transparency and effective monitoring, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 994/98, it is appropriate to establish a standard format in which Member States should provide the Commission with summary information whenever, in pursuance of this Regulation, an aid scheme is implemented or an individual aid outside such schemes is granted, with a view to publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall not apply to aid for individual investments with eligible expenses in excess of EUR 12,5 million, or where the actual amount of aid exceeds EUR 6 million.

If the beneficiary is a young farmer, this contribution shall be at least 55 % or 45 % respectively. 4.
Where the relocation in the public interest results in an increase in production capacity, the contribution from the beneficiary must be at least equal to 60 %, or 50 % in less favoured areas, of the expenses relating to this increase.
