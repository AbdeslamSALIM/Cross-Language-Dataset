A proposal for a new Regulation on Flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties, as part of the package on Food Improvement Agents, is included in the Commission Legislative Working Programme of 2005. | ( General context Article 1 of Directive 88/388/EEC restricts its scope to flavourings.
However, through Article 4 (c), maximum levels for certain undesirable substances are established in foods which contain flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties.
Regulation (EC) N 2065/2003 of the European Parliament and Council Regulation of 10 November 2003 on smoke flavourings used or intended for use in or on foods. 3.
Maximum levels for substances of toxicological concern The controls by the Member States will be more efficient as they will focus on foodstuffs who contribute the most to the intake of substances of toxicological concern and no longer to foodstuffs and beverages in general 5.
An unclear legal situation will result in loss of consumer confidence about the use of flavourings. 3.
Since the risks perception could be different between the Member States this would result in ineffective functioning of the internal market. 3.2 Social impact Differences in approach between Member States for safety assessment will lead to a confusing situation for the consumers, with different levels of protection and a loss of confidence in certain Member States and in the internal market. 4.
Amending Council Directive 88/388/EEC 4.1 Economic impact The introduction of the necessary amendments in the actual Directive would have a beneficial economic impact as explained in 5.
Control of the limits for substances of toxicological concern will focus on foods of highest risk resulting in a more efficient protection of the health of the consumers.
In order to insure continuing effective functioning of the internal market while protecting human health and the interests of consumers a regulation is considered the most appropriate tool. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | The Community may finance the establishment of a harmonised policy and system in the field of food flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties, including: development of an appropriate database for gathering and storing all information relating to Community legislation on flavourings, undertaking of studies necessary for the preparation and development of legislation on food flavourings, undertaking of studies necessary to harmonise procedures, decision-making criteria and data requirements, to facilitate work sharing between Member States and to develop guidance in these areas. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | ( Repeal of existing legislation The adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of existing legislation. | ( European Economic Area The proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area. | 1. 2006/0147 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91, Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 and Directive 2000/13/EC (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[2], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, Whereas: (1) Council Directive 88/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production[3] needs to be updated in the light of technical and scientific developments.
They should not mislead the consumer and their presence in food should, therefore, always be indicated by appropriate labelling. (7) Since 1999, the Scientific Committee on Food and subsequently the European Food Safety Authority has expressed opinions on a number of substances occurring naturally in source materials for flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties[6] which, according to the Committee of Experts on Flavouring Substances of the Council of Europe, raise toxicological concern.
Appropriate maximum levels should be established for the presence of these undesirable substances in foods which contribute most to the human intake of these substances, taking into account both the need to protect human health and their unavoidable presence in traditional foods. (9) Provisions should be established at Community level in order to prohibit or restrict the use of certain plant or animal materials which raise concern for human health in the production of flavourings and food ingredients with flavouring properties and their applications in food production. (10) Risk assessments should be carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter referred to as “the Authority”, established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety[7]. (11) In order to ensure harmonisation, the risk assessment and approval of flavourings and source materials that need to undergo an evaluation should be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No […]establishing a common approval procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings[8]. (12) Flavouring substances are chemically defined substances with flavouring properties.
That list will be proposed for inclusion in the list referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No […]. (13) Flavouring preparations are flavourings other than chemically defined substances obtained from materials of vegetable, animal or mineral origin, by appropriate physical, enzymatic or microbiological processes, either in the raw state of the material or after processing for human consumption.
It might be necessary to authorise the use of only certain parts of the material or to set conditions of use. (20) A flavouring or a source material which falls under the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed[11] should be authorised according to that Regulation, prior to its approval under this Regulation. (21) Flavouring substances or flavouring preparations should only be labelled as ‘natural’ if they comply with certain criteria which ensure that consumers are not misled. (22) Specific information requirements should ensure that consumers are not misled concerning the source material used for the production of natural flavourings.
This Directive needs to be adapted to the definitions of flavourings, smoke flavourings and the term ‘natural’ for the description of flavourings laid down in the present Regulation. (24) For the evaluation of the safety of flavouring substances for human health, information on the consumption and use of flavouring substances is crucial.
The financing of such measures is covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[14] and consequently the legal basis for the financing of the above measures will be Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. (28) Pending the establishment of the Community list, provision should be made for the evaluation and approval of flavouring substances which are not covered by the evaluation programme provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2232/96.
However the time periods provided for in that Regulation for the Authority to adopt its opinion and for the Commission to submit a draft Regulation updating the Community list to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health should not apply, because priority should be given to the ongoing evaluation programme. (29) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to lay down Community rules on the use of flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties in and on foods, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of market unity and high level of consumer protection, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
