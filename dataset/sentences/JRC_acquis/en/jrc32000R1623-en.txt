This Regulation lays down the detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 in particular regarding aid for the use of grapes, grape must and concentrated grape must (Title I), private storage aid (Title II) and distillation (Title III).
Without prejudice to Article 30 of this Regulation, operators who were subject to the obligations laid down in Articles 27 and 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 during the previous wine year shall be eligible for the measures provided for in this Regulation only where they provide evidence that they fulfilled their obligations regarding delivery or withdrawal under supervision during the wine year concerned.
This Chapter lays down the detailed rules for applying the aid scheme introduced by Article 35(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
The aid shall be granted to processors: (a) who are themselves producers or groups of producers and who process or have processed on their behalf the grapes they have harvested, and grape must and concentrated grape must obtained entirely from their own grape crop, into grape juice or other comestible products manufactured from such grape juice, or (b) who purchase from producers or groups of producers, either directly or indirectly, grapes produced in the Community and grape must or concentrated grape must, for the purpose of processing them into grape juice or other comestible products manufactured from such grape juice.
The raw materials used must have been obtained exclusively from grapes produced in the Community. 2.
The grape must and the must obtained from the grapes used must have a density at 20 Â°C of between 1.055 and 1.100 grams per cubic centimetre.
Processors who carry out processing operations on specified dates and who wish to receive aid under Article 35(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 shall submit a written statement to the competent authority, at least three working days before the beginning of those operations, containing in particular: (a) the information required under (a) and (b) in paragraph 1 of this Article, (b) the wine-growing zone in which the raw materials were obtained, in accordance with the classification in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, (c) the following technical information: (i) the quantity (in 100 kilograms of grapes or hectolitres of grape must or concentrated grape must), (ii) the density, in the case of grape must and concentrated grape must, (iii) the date of commencement and the probable duration of processing operations.

Processors who use no more than 50 tonnes of grapes, 800 hl of grape must or 150 hl of concentrated grape must each wine year to produce grape juice shall submit a statement to the competent authorities at the beginning of the wine year containing the information required under (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article.
Processors shall keep stock accounts showing in particular the following information taken from accompanying documents or the registers referred to in Article 70 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999: (a) the quantities, density and wine-growing zone of origin of the raw materials entering their premises each day and, where applicable, the name and address of the seller(s), (b) the quantities and density of raw materials used each day, (c) the quantities of grape juice obtained each day after processing, (d) the quantities of grape juice leaving their premises each day and the name and address of the consignee(s).
Where processors themselves carry out one of the operations referred to in Article 7(1) of this Regulation in their juice-manufacturing premises, possibly mixing the juice with other products, the information referred to in (d) in the preceding subparagraph shall not be required.
Where processors do not themselves carry out the operations referred to in paragraph 1, they shall indicate in the accompanying document referred to in Article 70(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 whether they have already submitted or intend to submit an application for aid to manufacture grape juice under this Regulation. 3.
Where processors dispatch the grape juice to a user within the Community intending to store it prior to bottling or use in the manufacture of other comestible products, (a) the storage undertaking shall send the document accompanying the grape juice to the competent authority at the place of unloading not later than 15 days after receiving the product, (b) the competent authority shall stamp the accompanying document referred to in point (a) only after verifying that a quantity at least equivalent to that of the consignment concerned has been dispatched, with an appropriate accompanying document, to a bottler or an undertaking manufacturing comestible products covered by this Regulation, and has been received by that user.
Where processors dispatch the grape juice to a user within the Community intending to bottle it, the latter shall forward a copy of the accompanying document to the competent authority of the place of unloading not later than 15 days after receiving the product.
Where processors dispatch the grape juice to a user within the Community manufacturing other comestible products made with this juice, (a) the manufacturer of these products shall send the document accompanying the grape juice to the competent authority not later than 15 days after receiving the product, (b) the competent authority shall stamp the accompanying document referred to in point (a) only if it has sufficient assurance that the grape juice is actually intended for the manufacture of the comestible products concerned.
In the cases covered by this Article, users shall keep stock accounts showing in particular: (a) the quantities of unpackaged grape juice entering their premises each day and the name and address of the consignor/processor, (b) the quantities of unpackaged grape juice leaving their premises each day and the name and address of the consignee(s).
