Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 74/2004 gave the possibility to Indian exporters/producers which met the criteria set out in the same Article not to be treated differently from the co-operating companies not included in the sample (‘newcomer status’).
PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) By Council Regulation (EC) No 74/2004, the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports into the Community of cotton-type bedlinen falling within CN codes ex 6302 21 00 (TARIC codes 6302 21 00 81, 6302 21 00 89), ex 6302 22 90 (TARIC code 6302 22 90 19), ex 6302 31 00 (TARIC code 6302 31 00 90) and ex 6302 32 90 (TARIC code 6302 32 90 19), originating in India.
Given the large number of co-operating exporting producers of the product concerned in India, a sample was selected in accordance with Article 27 of the basic Regulation and individual duty rates ranging from 4,4 % to 10,4 % were imposed on the companies included in the sample, while other co-operating companies not included in the sample were attributed a duty rate of 7,6 %.
