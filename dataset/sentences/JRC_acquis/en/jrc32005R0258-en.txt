Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%258/2005 of 14 February 2005 amending the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%348/2000 on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Croatia and Ukraine Council Regulation (EC) No 258/2005 of 14 February 2005 amending the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Croatia and Ukraine THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the "basic Regulation") and in particular Articles 11(3) and 11(7) thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Previous investigation and existing measures (1) The measures currently in force on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Croatia and Ukraine are definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 [2] and one undertaking accepted from an exporter in Croatia by Commission Decision 2000/137/EC [3].
The rate of duty applicable to imports from Croatia is 23 %, while the duty rate applicable to imports from Ukraine is 38,5 %. 2.
Further to Regulation (EC) No 1322/2004 [6], the existing measures on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes originating in Russia and Romania are temporarily not applied as from 21 July 2004.
Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (6) The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to all the other companies that made themselves known within the deadlines set out in the notice of initiation.
Replies were received from five Community producers, one importer, one exporting producer in Croatia, three exporting producers in Ukraine and three traders related to the Ukrainian producers. (7) The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for a determination of dumping and resulting injury and carried out verifications at the premises of the following companies: (a) Community producers: - Dalmine Spa, Italy, - Productos Tubulares SA, Spain, - Tubos Reunidos SA, Spain, - Vallourec %amp% Mannesmann, Germany, - Vallourec %amp% Mannesmann, France; (b) Unrelated importers in the Community: - Comercial de Tubos SA, Spain; (c) Exporting producer in Croatia: - Mechel Željezara Ltd, Sisak; (d) Exporting producers in Ukraine: - CJSC Nikopolsky seamless tubes plant Nikotube, Nikopol, - Dnipropetrovsk Tube Works (DTW), Dnipropetrovsk, - OJSC Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant (NTRP), Dnipropetrovsk; (e) Related traders in Ukraine: - Time Ltd, Dnipropetrovsk, - SGIP Interpipe, Dnipropetrovsk; (f) Related trader in Switzerland: - SEPCO, Lugano. 4.
Investigation period (8) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 (the investigation period or IP).
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 1999 to the end of the investigation period (the period considered). 5.
Product concerned and like product 5.1.
Product concerned (9) The products under review are: (a) seamless pipes, of iron or non-alloy steel, of a kind used for oil and gas pipelines, of an external diameter not exceeding 406,4 mm; (b) seamless tubes of circular cross-section, of iron or non-alloy steel, cold-drawn or cold-rolled, other than precision tubes; (c) other tubes of circular cross-section, of iron or non-alloy steel, other than threaded or threadable, of an external diameter not exceeding 406,4 mm, originating in Croatia and Ukraine (the product concerned), falling within CN codes ex73041010, ex73041030, 73043199, 73043991 and 73043993. (10) The investigation has shown that all these categories were sufficiently similar for them to constitute a single product, as in the original investigation.
Therefore, and for the purpose of the present anti-dumping investigation, all types of the product concerned are regarded as one product. 5.2.
Like product (11) As in the previous investigation, no differences were found between the product concerned and the seamless pipes and tubes produced and sold on the domestic market in Croatia. (12) Likewise, no differences were found between the product concerned and the seamless pipes and tubes produced by the Community producers and sold on the Community market.
Cooperation (13) As concerns Croatia, one exporting producer, Mechel Željezara Ltd, accounted for all exports of the product concerned to the Community.
Normal value (15) It was first established whether Mechel Željezara Ltd’s total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community.
In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative since the total domestic sales volume represented at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community. (16) Subsequently, by defining the product types in accordance with the CN codes under which the product is classified, it was examined whether the domestic sales of each product type were representative.
Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable product type exported to the Community.
It was found that all product types sold by the company for export to the Community had representative domestic sales. (17) An examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each product type could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the type in question.
In cases where the sales volume of a product type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the unit cost, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the unit cost, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that product type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not.
This was the case for two product types. (18) In the case where the volume of profitable sales of a product type represented 80 % or less but at least 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of such sales was below the unit cost, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of those types only.
This was the case for one product type. (19) For the fourth product type, less than 10 % of the domestic sales volume was profitable during the IP.
Export price (20) The investigation showed that the export sales of Mechel Željezara Ltd were solely made directly to unrelated customers in the Community. (21) Therefore, the export price was established on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable for the product concerned when sold to the first independent customer in the Community, in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. 1.4.
For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. (23) Accordingly, allowances claimed for differences in transport costs, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit costs and commissions were granted where applicable and supported by verified evidence. 1.5.
Dumping margin (24) In accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the adjusted weighted average normal value by product type was compared with the adjusted weighted average export price of each corresponding type of the product concerned. (25) This comparison showed the existence of dumping.
The dumping margin expressed as a percentage to the cif Community frontier price, duty unpaid, is as follows: Mechel Željezara Ltd. 38,9 %. (26) This dumping margin is below the dumping margin found during the original investigation.
Since the level of cooperation was high (all exports of the product concerned from Croatia to the Community), the residual dumping margin was set at the same level as the one established for Mechel Željezara Ltd, namely 38,9 %. 2.
It was found that the conditions as set in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation were fulfilled by both groups of companies and it was therefore considered justified to grant IT to both groups of companies. 2.3.
Analogue country (41) Pursuant to Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation, normal value for the exporting producers that were not granted MET has to be established on the basis of the prices or constructed value in an appropriate analogue country for products comparable to those exported by the Ukrainian exporting producers to the Community. (42) Croatia was the analogue country used in the original investigation.
In determining normal value for Ukraine, the same methodology as that described at recitals 15 to 19 was applied. (44) It was established that for the product type corresponding to CN code 73043199 (cold-drawn or cold-rolled tubes), there was no domestic production in Croatia.
However, in the case of one group of companies, during the IP the exported quantity to the Community of this product type represented around 40 % of its total exports of the product concerned to the Community. (45) On the basis of data available, it was concluded that the other product types subject to the investigation were not comparable to this product type and that constructing normal value for this particular product type on the basis of normal value for the other product types would not lead to a reliable figure.
Export price (46) Both groups of companies in Ukraine made all their export sales to the Community via a related trading company located in a third country.
The export price was, therefore, in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, constructed on the basis of the related trading companies' resale prices to the first independent customers in the Community. 2.6.
Comparison (47) For the purpose of a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences which were claimed and demonstrated to affect price comparability.
The adjustments in the export price in respect of inland transport in the exporting country, insurance, loading and ancillary costs were made on the basis of costs established in the analogue country. (48) The comparison between normal value and export price was made on an ex-works basis. 2.7.
Dumping margin (49) According to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the adjusted weighted average normal value by product type, taken from the analogue country producer Mechel Željezara Ltd, was compared with the companies' adjusted weighted average export price of each corresponding product type of the product concerned. (50) This comparison showed the existence of dumping.
The dumping margins expressed as a percentage to the cif Community frontier price, duty unpaid, are as follows: Dnipropetrovsk Tube Works, Dnipropetrovsk 91,0 % OJSC Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant, Dnipropetrovsk and CJSC Nikopolsky seamless tubes plant "Nikotube", Nikopol 97,3 %. (51) Since the level of cooperation was high (more than 80 % of the exports of the product concerned from Ukraine to the Community), the residual margin was set at the same level as the one established for the cooperating exporting producers OJSC Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant (NTRP) and CJSC Nikopolsky seamless tubes plant "Nikotube", namely 97,3 %.
No further producers of the product concerned made themselves known to the European Commission. 3.
Community consumption (57) Eurostat information, related to volumes and values for CN codes ex73041010, ex73041030, 73043199, 73043991 and 73043993 was used as the source of the import data.
Consumption decreased to 1103805 tonnes during the IP, which is slightly less than the consumption in 1999. | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Community consumption (tonnes) | 1104619 | 1130410 | 1233357 | 1103805 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 102 | 112 | 100 | 5.
Additionally, despite the measures in force, the volumes of imports from each of these countries were not negligible during the investigation period, as market shares for these countries were 2,1 % for Croatia and 3,4 % for Ukraine.
The shares of all imports ranged from 5,9 % for Croatia to 9,6 % for Ukraine in the IP. (62) The cumulative assessment was found to be appropriate in view of the conditions of competition both between imports originating in these countries, and between these imports and the like Community product.
Finally, the imports of both countries concerned and the like product follow the same price trends (see recitals 67 and 74). (63) One Croatian exporter claimed that no injury is caused by the Croatian imports since Croatian market share is minimal and therefore no cumulative assessment should take place.
Market share of imports concerned (65) As shown above, following the introduction of measures in 2000, the market share of imports from the countries concerned decreased significantly from 12,1 % in 1999 to 4,2 % in 2000 and then started to increase continuously up to 5,5 % in the IP. 5.3.
The prices of the Community industry were adjusted to ex-works prices, and the prices of the imports were cif Community frontier, import duty paid, anti-dumping duty unpaid, with adjustments made for the level of trade and handling costs, based on information collected during the investigation, notably from cooperating unrelated importers. (67) The comparison showed that during the IP, imports of the product concerned were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry’s prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter, as follows: Ukraine 34,1 % and Croatia: 23,3 %.
Even if the anti-dumping duties are taken into account, undercutting is still significant with 10 % for imports from Ukraine and 6,5 % for imports from Croatia.
Prices of imports, duty unpaid (Eur/tonne) | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Ukraine | 332 | 341 | 433 | 449 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 103 | 130 | 135 | Croatia | 461 | 465 | 516 | 523 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 101 | 112 | 113 | Ukraine and Croatia Average | 361 | 405 | 466 | 477 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 112 | 129 | 132 | 6.
Situation of the Community industry (68) In accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports on the Community industry included an evaluation of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry from 1999 (base year) to the IP. (69) The Community industry data below represent the aggregated information of the five cooperating Community producers. 6.1.
Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation (70) The evolution of production, production capacity and capacity utilisation is as follows: | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Production (tonnes) | 710029 | 911669 | 928231 | 797456 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 128 | 131 | 112 | Production capacity (tonnes) | 1117881 | 1183067 | 1140304 | 1094548 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 106 | 102 | 98 | Capacity utilisation | 63,5 % | 77,1 % | 81,4 % | 72,9 % | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 121 | 128 | 115 | (71) As shown in the table above, production during the period 1999 to 2001 increased to a peak in 2001 and then decreased significantly during the IP.
Although export sales increased and compensated to some extent for the decrease of sales in the Community, the reduction in the production and the decrease in the production capacity during the IP could not be avoided. 6.2.
Stocks (72) The figures below represent the volume of stocks at the end of each period. | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Stocks (tonnes) | 38753 | 49620 | 49062 | 59287 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 128 | 127 | 153 | (73) Stocks have increased during the period considered.
Sales volume, market shares, growth and average unit prices in the Community (74) The figures below represent the Community industry's sales to independent customers in the Community. | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Sales volume (tonnes) | 516529 | 573136 | 576850 | 504317 | Index (1999=100) | 100 | 111 | 112 | 98 | Market share | 46,8 % | 50,7 % | 46,8 % | 45,7 % | Index (1999=100) | 100 | 108 | 100 | 98 | Average sales prices (EUR/tonne) | 576 | 589 | 659 | 696 | Index (1999=100) | 100 | 102 | 114 | 121 | (75) The Community industry's sales volumes increased by 12 % from 1999 to 2001 and then dropped down significantly during the IP to a level even below that in 1999.
The development in sales volumes should be seen in the light of the level of consumption during the same period, which increased by 12 % from 1999 to 2001 and then decreased during the IP.
However, the demand did not decrease as much as the sales volume between 2001 and the IP. (76) Following the introduction of measures in 2000, the Community industry was able to regain lost market share.
Rather were they forced to reduce production capacity and work force in the IP, as increasing exports of the Community industry could not compensate the loss of sales on the Community market. (78) The Community industry's average sales prices increased in the period considered.
Profitability (79) The profit concept used below is profit before taxes, which represents the profit generated by sales of the product concerned on the Community market. | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Profitability on EC Sales | – 7,8 % | 0,1 % | 0,3 % | – 0,1 % | (80) Following the imposition of anti-dumping measures against imports of seamless pipes and tubes originating in Croatia and Ukraine, the Community industry could, as seen above, increase the prices to reach around break-even in 2000 and 2001.
However, the Community industry could not reach the level of profit which it could be expected to achieve in the absence of dumped imports (i.e. 5 %) as set out in the Regulation imposing the measures currently in force.
The profit level reached in 2001 was just above break-even, and was far from the level that would allow financing sufficiently reinvestment. 6.5.
Return on investments, cash flow, investments and ability to raise capital (82) The trends for the Return on Investments, the Cash flow and the Investments are shown in the following table. | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Return on investments | – 13 % | 0 % | 1 % | 0 % | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 202 | 204 | 198 | Cash flow | – 13978142 | 5273981 | 5910373 | 4959440 | Index 1999=100 | 100 | 238 | 242 | 235 | Investments | 19320730 | 32691925 | 33056929 | 21087534 | Index 1999=100 | 100 | 169 | 171 | 109 | (83) It is noted that the above figures for Return on Investments reflect to a large extent those on profitability.
The Cash Flow shows approximately the same trend as the profitability, namely a peak in 2001 and then a decrease again.
Employment, productivity and wages | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | IP | Number of employees | 2583 | 2776 | 2622 | 2472 | Index 1999=100 | 100 | 107 | 102 | 96 | Productivity (tonne/employee) | 275 | 328 | 354 | 323 | Index 1999 = 100 | 100 | 119 | 129 | 117 | Wages Index 1999=100 | 100 | 104 | 106 | 105 | (86) As seen above, the Community industry increased its productivity and the number of employees in 2000 and 2001 as production increased during that period.
However, in the IP, the number of employees was reduced significantly to a level below that in 1999.
Recovery from past dumping (88) Following the introduction of measures in 2000, the Community industry was able to regain lost market share and reach a more sustainable level in its average sale prices.
Magnitude of the actual margin of dumping (89) The dumping margins are specified in the dumping part (recitals 25 and 50).
Conclusion on injury (90) It is recalled that, following the imposition of anti-dumping measures against imports of the product concerned from Croatia and Ukraine, the Community industry immediately gained confidence.
Average prices of its Community sales increased by 14 % between 1999 and 2001 and sales volumes in the Community as well as production increased in the same period.
In consequence, the industry could make some necessary investments at that time and employed more work force. (91) However, the situation started to deteriorate substantially in the IP.
Sales in the Community decreased by 12 % from 2001 to the IP and the Community industry had to adjust significantly by reducing production, production capacity and employment.
The market share of the Community industry decreased further from 2001 to the IP to a level below that in 1999.
The fact that the ability of the companies to raise capital was not seriously affected is due to those companies being part of larger corporate groups and, accordingly, cannot be considered as a viable indicator for the sector of the product concerned. (93) In regard to the Community industry's financial situation, it improved from a loss-making situation in 1999, but only to reach a more or less break-even situation in 2000 and 2001 and fell back into a loss-making situation again in the IP. (94) As can be seen above, the indicators improved initially after 1999 when measures were imposed but all of them with the exception of the sales prices deteriorated again in the IP showing a clear injurious picture. (95) The continuous increase in selling prices which occurred during the whole period considered, could not lead to a satisfying profit situation as it was completely absorbed by rising production costs, notably raw material costs and labour costs per unit.
In consequence, the profit situation of the Community industry deteriorated and fell below break-even in the IP. (96) In view of the above, it is concluded that the Community industry has still suffered material injury during the IP within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES AND LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUATION OF DUMPING AND INJURY (97) The original measures were to expire on 18 February 2005.
Given all of the above, it is considered that there is no reason to doubt that the level of dumping found is of a lasting nature and a continuation of dumping is highly likely if the original measures were allowed to expire. (99) Despite the fact that the Community industry recovered to a certain extent from past dumping of imports originating in, inter alia, Croatia and Ukraine, it was also found that the Community industry still suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
The injury margins found in the investigation have increased as compared to the original investigation because the dumped imports continued to substantially undercut the Community industry's prices and this despite the fact that costs have risen worldwide.
Considering the effects of the dumped imports on profitability (recital 79) and market share of the Community industry (recital 74), which were again decreasing from 2001 to the IP, it is concluded that the circumstances leading to injury are of a lasting nature and that the expiry of the original measures would be likely to lead to the continuation of injury.
Known factors other than the dumped imports, which could at the same time have injured the Community industry, were also examined to ensure that the possible injury caused by these other factors was not attributed to the dumped imports. (101) Despite the measures in force, which first led to a reduction of imports in 2000, the exporting producers from Croatia and Ukraine subsequently increased their market share in the Community from 4,2 % up to 5,5 % during the period considered.
At the same time, from 2000 to the IP, the Community industry lost market share.
The increasing imports from the countries concerned, which significantly undercut Community industry's prices and the deteriorating situation of the Community industry coincide in time.
Therefore, those imports could have continued to contribute to the injury suffered by the Community industry. (102) Imports originating in other third countries, such as the Czech Republic, Poland and the Slovak Republic, which were during the investigation period not yet members of the Community, as well as imports from Romania or Russia could also have contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. (103) It has to be noted that anti-dumping duties ranging from 9,8 % to 38,2 % and undertakings were in force for imports from the abovementioned five countries during the whole period considered.
There is a review currently ongoing on the measures in force on imports from Russia and Romania (recital 4). (104) Imports from Russia accounted for a market share of 3,3 % during the investigation period.
The average import prices of these imports inclusive of anti-dumping duties were around 20 % lower than the prices of the imports from Croatia and Ukraine.
Imports from Romania accounted for a market share of 3,5 % in the IP.
Import prices from Romania, inclusive of anti-dumping duties are higher than the prices of the imports from Croatia and Ukraine, but still lower than the Community industry's prices.
Their market share altogether in the IP was 14,2 %.
Although those imports could also have contributed to the injury, it can be concluded from their price level that their contribution could have been only a minor one. (106) Having regard to the fact that imports from Croatia and Ukraine undercut substantially the Community industry prices, there is no indication that the abovementioned imports, which in the majority undercut the Community prices to a lesser extent, could break the causal link between the dumped imports from Croatia and Ukraine and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. (107) Imports from several other third countries altogether accounted for 8,9 % market share in the IP.
With regard to their high level of prices which are in the majority sufficiently above the Community industry prices, there is no indication that those imports could break the causal link between the dumped imports from Croatia and Ukraine and the material injury suffered by the Community industry. (108) Other Community producers, which did not cooperate in the investigation were facing the same problems as regards the increasing raw material costs forcing them to raise prices as much as possible.
Therefore, it is concluded that this factor could not break the causal link between the dumped imports from Croatia and Ukraine and the material injury suffered by the Community industry.
No other factors have been found in the course of the investigation that could have caused injury. (110) Based on the above analysis of the effects of all known factors on the situation of the Community industry, it is concluded that the causal link between the dumped imports from Croatia and Ukraine and the material injury to the Community industry, which has been established in the previous investigation, has not been broken.
A complete questionnaire reply was received from one importer, Comercial de Tubos, SA, Spain. (112) From the user industry, no questionnaire replies were received.
No supplier has made itself known during the investigation.
Interest of the Community industry (114) It is recalled that the Community industry consisted of five producers which employ approximately 2470 staff for the production and sales of seamless pipes and tubes.
Interest of suppliers (119) No supplier made himself known during the investigation.
Interest of users (120) In the previous investigation, it was concluded that any price effect resulting from anti-dumping measures would not be significant with respect to downstream industrial users.
Accordingly, neither the original investigation with an IP from 1 November 1997 until 31 October 1998 (and with a period considered from January 1997 until the end of the IP), nor the current review investigation were affected by any anti-competitive practices. 7.
Conclusion on Community interest (122) The maintenance of measures against imports of seamless pipes and tubes originating in the countries concerned would clearly be in the interest of the Community industry.
ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
Injury elimination level (124) In view of the conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury and Community interest, measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury being caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports. (125) The measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by these imports without exceeding the dumping margin found.
The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 5 % of turnover.
The non-injurious price has been obtained by adding the abovementioned profit margin of 5 % to the cost of production. (126) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average import price, as established for the undercutting calculations, with the average non-injurious price.
Amended measures (127) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that the anti-dumping duties in force against imports of the product concerned originating in Croatia and Ukraine should be amended.
Since the level of cooperation was high (more than 80 % of the exports of the product concerned from Ukraine to the Community), the residual margin for Ukraine should be set at the same level as that established for the cooperating exporting producers OJSC Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant (NTRP) and CJSC Nikopolsky seamless tubes plant "Nikotube". (128) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
If appropriate, the Regulation will accordingly be amended by updating the list of companies benefiting from individual duty rates. (130) The proposed anti-dumping duties are the following: Country | Company | Injury elimination margin | Dumping margin | Proposed anti-dumping duty | Croatia | All companies | 38,8 % | 38,9 % | 38,8 % | Ukraine | Dnipropetrovsk Tube Works (DTW), Dnipropetrovsk | 51,9 % | 91,0 % | 51,9 % | OJSC Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant (NTRP), Dnipropetrovsk and CJSC Nikopolsky seamless tubes plant "Nikotube", Nikopol | 64,1 % | 97,3 % | 64,1 % | All other companies | 64,1 % | 97,3 % | 64,1 % | (131) On the basis of the measures proposed, a new five-year period for the measures will start to run.
The newly established company appears not to have started production yet and is in the process of obtaining the assets from Mechel Željezara Ltd. (133) However, from the information submitted it appears that the production capacity of Valjaonice will remain unchanged compared to that of Mechel Željezara Ltd and that there is a clear intention by Valjaonice to continue the production of the product concerned.
This undertaking with regard to Mechel Željezara Ltd was also subject to the review. (136) Through the undertaking, Mechel Željezara Ltd undertook to sell to its independent customers up to a certain quantity of the product concerned for export to the Community at revised prices.
In addition, Mechel Željezara Ltd undertook that its prices per product group would fall into line with the price structure in use in the Community. (137) In accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation, the aim of an undertaking is to eliminate the injurious effect of dumped imports, which is achieved through the exporter raising its prices or ceasing exports at dumped levels.
Therefore, in this case, the undertaking accepted from Mechel Željezara Ltd is not considered as an appropriate and effective means of eliminating the injurious effect of dumping.
As stated above, Mechel Željezara Ltd has been liquidated recently.
Therefore, the undertaking is considered as being no longer valid. (138) Subsequent to the disclosure of the essential facts and considerations, on the basis of which it was concluded that the level of the existing anti-dumping margin should be amended, the Ukrainian companies OJSC Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant (NTRP), CJSC Nikopolsky seamless tubes plant "Nikotube" and their related trader/holding company "Interpipe" offered a joint undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. (139) These Ukrainian companies are producers of different types of steel products which can be sold together with the product concerned.
Comments were received and taken into consideration where appropriate, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 is hereby amended as follows: 1.
Article 2 shall be deleted.
