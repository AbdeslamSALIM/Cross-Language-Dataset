REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain zinc oxides originating in the People's Republic of China. (2) The request has been lodged on 27 June 2005 by Eurometaux on behalf of producers representing more than 45 % of the Community production of certain zinc oxides.
PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is zinc oxide (chemical formula ZnO) with a purity of not less than 93 % zinc oxide originating in the People's Republic of China, normally declared under CN code 28170000 (the product concerned).
This code is given for information only. (4) The product under investigation is zinc oxide (chemical formula ZnO) with a purity of not less than 93 % zinc oxide consigned from Kazakhstan (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned.
Should circumvention practices via Kazakhstan covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
PROCEDURE (8) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain zinc oxides consigned from Kazakhstan, whether declared as originating in Kazakhstan or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
For this purpose, duly substantiated claims should be submitted on the basis of claim forms provided by the Commission, and within the specific time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation. (15) As stated above, should circumvention practices via Kazakhstan covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
The latter claim form is only required to be submitted by companies involved in assembly operations, - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. (18) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
NON-COOPERATION (19) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. (20) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available.
If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 An investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of certain zinc oxide (chemical formula: ZnO) with a purity of not less than 93 % zinc oxide, falling within CN code 28170000 (TARIC code 2817000013) consigned from Kazakhstan whether declared as originating in Kazakhstan or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 408/2002.
Article 2 The Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 13(3) and Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.
