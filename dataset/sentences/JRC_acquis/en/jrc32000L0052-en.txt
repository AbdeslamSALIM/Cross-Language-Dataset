This Directive should not amend specific rules established for the same purpose in other Community provisions and should not apply to activities of undertakings covered by those provisions. (10) In view of the limited potential impact on competition and in order to avoid imposing an excessive administrative burden it is not necessary, at this time, to require enterprises with a total annual net turnover of less than EUR 40 million to maintain separate accounts.
For the purpose of this Directive: (a) 'public authorities' means all public authorities, including the State and regional, local and all other territorial authorities; (b) 'public undertakings' means any undertaking over which the public authorities may exercise directly or indirectly a dominant influence by virtue of their ownership of it, their financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it; (c) 'public undertakings operating in the manufacturing sector' means all undertakings whose principal area of activity, defined as being at least 50 % of total annual turnover, is in manufacturing.
