Consequently, the provisions on prices, inter-professional agreements and self-financing provided for in Articles 2 to 6 and 10 to 21 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 should not apply before 1 July 2004.
However, for the purposes of ensuring the same treatment for isoglucose and sugar, Articles 2 to 21 and 27 to 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 should only become applicable to isoglucose in the new Member States from 1 July 2004. (4) The Act of Accession defines a maximum supply need for the sugar-producing undertaking in Slovenia of 19585 tonnes.
In order to guarantee the supply of that undertaking with raw sugar for refining between 1 May and 30 June 2004, an appropriate share of the maximum supply need should be determined for that period. (5) There is a considerable risk of disruption on the markets in the sugar sector by products being introduced into the new Member States before their accession for speculation purposes.
Determination of the surplus stocks will be carried out by the Commission on the basis of trade developments, production and consumption trends in the new Member States during the period of 1 May 2000 to 30 April 2004.
Article 2 Isoglucose quotas For the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2004, the basic quantities of A and B isoglucose for the new Member States producing isoglucose shall be as follows: &gt;TABLE&gt; Article 3 Preferential import of cane sugar In order to cover its demand for the refining of raw cane sugar for the period from 1 May 2004 to 30 June 2004, Slovenia is authorised to issue licences during that period for "special preferential sugar" within the limit of 3264 tonnes, expressed in white sugar equivalent and under the conditions provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1159/2003(3).
