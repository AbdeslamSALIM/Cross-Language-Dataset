Communication from the Commission to the Council - Assessment of the action taken by Portugal in response to the Council Recommendation of 20 September 2005 with a view to bringing an end to the situation of excessive government deficit /* SEC/2006/0786 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 21.6.2006 SEC(2006) 786 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL Assessment of the action taken by Portugal in response to the Council Recommendation of 20 September 2005 with a view to bringing an end to the situation of excessive government deficit 1.
Against a backdrop of buoyant economic growth as from the middle of the decade, the general government deficit was gradually reduced to below 3% of GDP and the government debt ratio was put onto a downward path approaching 50% of GDP towards the end of the 1990s.
On 5 November 2002, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed[1] and, pursuant to Article 104(7) of the Treaty, addressed a recommendation to Portugal with a view to bringing that situation to an end by 2003 at the latest[2].
In June 2005 – after the general elections of spring 2005 and subsequent change in government – Portugal submitted an update of its stability programme, which announced a change in fiscal strategy and revealed the plans to bring the general government deficit below 3% of GDP in 2008.
The deficit would remain in excess of 3% of GDP for the years from 2005 to 2007, largely due to a discontinuation of reliance on one-off measures and a reassessment of government expenditure growth.
The Council, upon the corresponding Commission recommendation, placed Portugal in excessive deficit on 20 September 2005[4] and, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty, addressed a recommendation to Portugal with a view to bringing the deficit below 3% of GDP in a credible and sustainable manner by 2008 at the latest, by taking action in a medium-term framework[5].
The Council established a deadline of 19 March 2006 for Portugal to take effective action to reduce the general government deficit.
To achieve the target, the 2005 budget envisaged, inter alia, the implementation of one-off measures worth 1.4% of GDP.
The revised deficit target already reflected a corrective package worth some 0.6% of GDP adopted in mid-2005, the most sizeable measures of which were an increase in the standard VAT rate from 19 to 21% and a freeze on automatic promotions for government staff.
Budget balance in 2006 The 2006 budget law was approved by the Portuguese parliament on 30 November 2005 with a target for the general government deficit of 4.6% of GDP.
In terms of fiscal effort, the 2006 budget projects a reduction in the government structural balance (that is, the cyclically-adjusted balance, excluding one-off and other temporary measures) by 1.6% of GDP.
The tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by some 1 percentage point compared with the 2005 outturn.
The minimum tax base for social contributions by the self-employed was also increased in 2005 from 1 to 1.5 times the minimum wage.
In all, according to the budget, the primary-expenditure-to-GDP ratio is cut by 0.5 percentage points relative to the 2005 outturn.
The latter will be helped notably by privatisation proceeds amounting to 1.1% of GDP in 2006 and some ½% of GDP in both 2007 and 2008.
The impact of debt-increasing financial transactions (excluding privatisation proceeds) was 1.2% of GDP in 2005 and, according to the December 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme, in 2006 is planned to be about ½% of GDP and to further decline to some ¼% of GDP in 2007-2008, presumably in connection with a reduction of capital injection in government-owned companies.
In addition, the impact on debt of the difference between the cash- and accrual-based deficits is expected to go down from around 1% of GDP in 2006 (after 0.7% of GDP in 2005) to less than ¼% of GDP in 2007-2009. 2.3 Collection and processing of government data Portugal has recently taken measures concerning the collection and processing of general government data.
Following real GDP growth of 0.3% in 2005, the macroeconomic scenario underlying the update of the stability programme projects GDP growth to increase to 1.1% in 2006, 1.8% in 2007, 2.4% in 2008 and eventually 3% in 2009.
This scenario is more cautious than the one underlying the September 2005 Council recommendation in accordance with Article 104(7).
Budget balance in 2006 A full implementation of the 2006 budget would be consistent with the 1.5% of GDP improvement in the structural government balance (i.e., the change in the cyclically-adjusted balance, excluding one-off and other temporary measures) required by the Council for 2006, assuming that real GDP growth unfolds broadly in line with plans.
Table 2: Budget balances and debt In % of GDP | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | Budget balance in 2007 and beyond Assuming that all the plans outlined in the December 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme materialise, the achievement of the 2007 deficit target at 3.7% of GDP would imply a reduction of the cyclically-adjusted deficit, net of one-off and temporary measures, by some ¾% of GDP (see Table 2).
Beyond 2008, the pace of the adjustment towards the MTO implied by the programme is in line with the minimum annual improvement in the structural balance of 0.5% of GDP requested by the Council, though the MTO will not be achieved by 2009.
Under the customary no-policy-change assumption, the Commission services' spring 2006 economic forecast projects the general government deficit at 4.9% of GDP in 2007, based upon a growth rate for GDP of 1.1%.
According to the Commission services spring 2006 economic forecast, the government debt ratio is projected at 68.4% of GDP in 2006 and 70.6% of GDP in 2007.
Downward risks to the profile of GDP growth heighten the uncertainty. 3.3 Collection and processing of government data The quality of general government data has improved.
On 24 April 2006, following the 1 April reporting of government deficit and debt levels, Eurostat withdrew its reservations vis-à-vis the Portuguese data[16].
In particular, Portugal: - has achieved a general government deficit outturn in 2005 in line with plans; - has adopted a comprehensive package of corrective measures since mid-2005, including in the 2006 budget law, which, if fully implemented and effective, would achieve a reduction in 2006 of the cyclically-adjusted deficit, excluding one-off and other temporary measures, that is in line with the Council recommendation; - has set a nominal government deficit target of below 3% for 2008 and plans to gradually decrease the cyclically-adjusted deficit for the years 2007-2008, excluding one-off and other temporary measures, in line with the Council recommendation; - has implemented or initiated a number of measures of a permanent nature aiming to contain and reduce expenditure, and has kept the announced fiscal targets despite a more cautious re-assessment of GDP growth prospects; - plans to bring the government gross debt ratio onto a declining path as from 2008 by means of the envisaged return to primary surpluses, the inflow of large proceeds from privatisation and the scaling back of debt-increasing financial operations; - has improved the quality of general government data.
However, the correction of the excessive deficit by the 2008 deadline and the reduction in the debt ratio are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.
Particularly, as highlighted by the Commission services' spring 2006 forecast, the containment of expenditure in 2006 and the achievement of the deficit targets for 2007 and beyond crucially rely upon a quick translation into legislation and an effective implementation of all the announced corrective measures.
The Commission will continue to closely monitor budgetary developments in Portugal in accordance with the Treaty and the SGP, in particular in the light of the fragile situation of public finances.

[5] http://register.consilium.eu.int/pdf/en/05/st12/st12401.en05.pdf#page=2 [6] Respectively, OJ L 209 of 2.8.1997 and OJ L 174 of 7.7.2005. [7] Compared with the June 2005 stability programme, the nominal general government balances were “mechanically” revised down by some ¼ percentage point of GDP entirely due to a significant upward revision of the GDP series, in the context of a benchmark revision of national accounts undertaken in many EU Member States, by about 4½% implemented in August 2005.
A further revision in the GDP series in March 2006 resulted in an upward correction of its level by some 1½%.
However, part of that increase was due to a one-off contribution to the EU of some 0.15% of GDP following the upward revision of the Portuguese GNI series in August 2005. [12] It should be noted also that the earmarking of part of VAT receipts to the civil servants’ pension scheme (CGA) as from July 2005 (1% out of a 21% standard tax rate) has led to the reduction in social contribution paid by the State to CGA.
Without this earmarking, both the government expenditure and revenue ratios would be higher by almost 0.1% of GDP in 2005 and some 0.3% of GDP in 2006 (and thus would have no impact on the general government balance). [13] In addition, apparent changes in retirement behaviour since the announcement of the changes to retirement rules, specifically an upsurge in retirement applications, compound the uncertainty. [14] On the ground of the customary no-policy-change assumption, measures that have been outlined but not presented in sufficient detail for them to be properly assessed were not included in the Commission services forecast. [15] The stability programme says nothing about what the expenditure growth pattern would be in a no-policy-change scenario. [16] Eurostat News release N° 48/2006 [17] In the reporting of September 2005, the deficit figures for 2002 and 2004 were revised upwards by around 0.2% of GDP per year, to include expenditure arrears that had not been included in the previous reporting.
In the reporting of April 2006, the 2004 deficit was further revised upward by some ¼% of GDP to 3.2% of GDP, largely on the basis of more complete information from local government and the reclassification of loans as capital expenditure.
