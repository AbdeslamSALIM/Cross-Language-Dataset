Proposal for a Council Regulation fixing for the 2007 fishing year the guide prices and Community producer prices for certain fishery products pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 /* COM/2006/0703 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 20.11.2006 COM(2006)703 final Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION fixing for the 2007 fishing year the guide prices and Community producer prices for certain fishery products pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The immediate objective of this proposal is to enable the Council to discharge its regulatory obligation to determine the guide prices and the Community producer price for the fishing year 2007.
The wider objective of this proposal is thus to ensure the functioning of the price support and intervention mechanisms laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 during the fishing year in question. | 120 | General context Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 establishes a Common Organisation of the Markets in Fishery and Aquaculture Products, which pertains to the market- and trade-related aspects of the Common Fisheries Policy and thus also serves to implement the objectives enshrined in Article 33 of the Treaty.
In this context, Articles 18 and 26 of the said regulation obligates the Council to fix, by qualified majority upon a proposal from the Commission before the beginning of the year, both the guide prices for a specified number of fishery products of Community importance as well as the Community producer price for specified tuna products.
The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | 331 | The attainment of the Single Market in the field of fisheries products requires the fixation of guide prices.
A regulation is required to ensure direct applicability and uniformity throughout the Community. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 401 | Since this is a price-fixing exercise, the impact on expenditure is indirect and will largely depend on developments in the market situation and on quantities of fishery products landed. | 1.
Article 2 For the fishing year from 1 January to 31 December 2007, the Community producer prices as provided for in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 shall be as set out in Annex II to this Regulation.
