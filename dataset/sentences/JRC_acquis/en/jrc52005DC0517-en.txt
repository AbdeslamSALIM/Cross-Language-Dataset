Report from the Commission - Annual Report on research and technological development activities of the European Union in 2004 {SEC(2005) 1326} /* COM/2005/0517 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 24.10.2005 COM(2005) 517 final .
The main chapters are on the activities and results achieved in 2004 and on developments in research and technological development activities in the Member States of the European Union.
The new activities in FP6 on SSP (Scientific Support to Policy) and NEST (New and Emerging Science and Technology) have also proved to be successful with over 120 proposals selected for funding.
The report of the panel[4] was submitted by the end of June 2004.
The Commission gave an official reply to the report at the end of August 2004 and continued carrying out corrective measures as well as introducing an action plan for rationalisation and acceleration to improve the implementation of the framework programme.
The ‘Investing in research’ action plan, currently under way, has already come up with its first concrete results, such as the creation of some 25 Technology Platforms.
The Commission closely supports the preparation of the GEOSS implementation plan and coordinates the European position.
It contains 30 policy recommendations.
It is expected that a report on the second cycle will be adopted by CREST in March 2006.
The annual growth rate in R&amp;D intensity of 0,7% (average annual growth between 2000 and 2003) is far from sufficient to reach the 3% objective by 2010.
The number of researchers has been growing from 1997 to 2002 by 22,5% (or 105.000 full time equivalents).
From 1998 to 2001 the average annual number of PhD level graduates was 76,750, 44% of which were in Science and Engineering.
