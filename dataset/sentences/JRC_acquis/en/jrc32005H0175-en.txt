It also provides for the Commission to transmit annually a recommendation concerning a coordinated programme of inspections for the following year. (4) Commission Recommendation of 19 December 2003 concerning a coordinated programme for the official control of foodstuffs for 2004 [2], sets out certain recommendations for a coordinated programme of official controls, including the assessment of the bacteriological safety of cheeses made from raw or thermised milk.
That information should be sent to the Commission, at the latest by 1 May 2006, accompanied by an explanatory report which should include comments on the results and on the enforcement measures taken. 4.
Foodstuffs to be analysed under the coordinated programme for 2005 should be submitted to official laboratories complying with Article 3 of Directive 93/99/EEC.
The results of this investigation will be analysed and provided together with the results of the 2004 survey in order to have a general overview in this sector. 5.2.
The competent authorities of the Member States should take representative samples of these products, both at production and retail levels, including imported products, with a view to testing for the presence of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes and enumeration of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli.
However, the most recent version of standard ISO 6785 or EN/ISO 6579 is recommended for the detection of Salmonella, the most recent versions of standards EN/ISO 11290-1 and 2 are recommended for detection of Listeria monocytogenes, the most recent version of EN/ISO 6888-1 or 2 is recommended for the enumeration of Staphylococcus aureus and the most recent version of standard ISO 11866-2,3 or ISO 16649-1,2 is recommended for the enumeration of Escherichia coli.

The water protein ratio for boneless skinless chicken breast with no added water is 3,28 and for 2 % extraneous water (the limit for boneless skinless chicken breast) the water/protein ratio is 3,40.
For wholesale, each sample normally consists of one 10 kg box of frozen boneless skinless chicken breast product.
The (apparent) fat-free chicken content is calculated using the protein nitrogen content and a nitrogen factor for boneless skinless chicken breast (Section 9).
Health and safety 4.1.
Pre-training requirements 5.1.
Scales capable of weighing with accuracy better than ± 0,1 g. 6.2.
Note: No make of mincer is recommended, however, the mincer used should have sufficient power to mince frozen or quick-frozen chicken to produce a homogeneous mixture corresponding to that obtained from a mincer fitted with a 4 mm hole disc. 6.3.
Apparatus as specified in ISO 1442:1997 (BS 4401 — 3:1997), for the determination of water content. 6.4.
Apparatus as specified in ISO 937:1978 (BS 4401 — 2:1980), for the determination of protein content or equivalent. 6.5.
Apparatus as specified in ISO 936:1998 1998 (BS 4401 — 1:1998) for the determination of total ash. 6.6.
Apparatus as specified in BS 4401 — 4:1970 for the determination of total fat. 6.7.
Apparatus as specified in ISO 3496:1994 (BS 4401 — 11:1995) for the determination of hydroxyproline. 7.
In the case of a wholesale sample, take a 2 kg aliquot of the sample or, in the case of the retail, take all of it if less than 2 kg, and finely homogenise in a blender or food processor.
Note: The remaining 8 kg of the wholesale sample can be disposed of. 7.5.
Take two 50 g aliquots (for DNA if required) from the 2 kg and transfer to a suitably sized container.
Place the remainder in a clean, labelled plastic bag or for convenience divide into 200 g sub-samples.
Take a sample of the homogenised material and determine the moisture content in accordance with ISO 1442. 7.7.
Take a sample of the homogenised material and determine the nitrogen content in accordance with ISO 937 (or equivalent). 7.8.
Take a sample of the homogenised material and determine the ash content in accordance with ISO 936. 7.9.
Take a sample of the homogenised material and determine the fat content in accordance with BS 4401 — 4. 7.10.
Take a sample of the homogenised material and determine the hydroxyproline content in accordance with ISO 3496. 8.
Analytical quality control 8.1.
Chicken content using the nitrogen factor Based on Stubbs and More (The Analyst 1919, 44, 125) involves the analysis of the sample for nitrogen, moisture, fat and ash.
The data derived from the analysis is first used to calculate the apparent fat-free meat content as follows: Apparent Fat-Free Meat Content = Total Nitrogen/NF × 100 NF = nitrogen factor associated with the product analysed (3,85 for lean chicken breast meat, as recommended by AMC (The Analyst, 2000, 125, 1359-1366)).
The percent nitrogen contributed by any collagen in a sample is calculated from the hydroxyproline as follows: COLLAGEN NITROGEN = EXCESS HYDROXYPROLINE × 1,28 The percent collagen nitrogen is then subtracted from the percent total nitrogen and the apparent total chicken content calculated as above. 9.3.
Added water An estimate of the amount of added water can be made by subtracting the chicken content and all the added ingredients from 100 using the following equation: Added water % = 100 – (Apparent Total Chicken Content + Ash + Carbohydrate + Other Ingredients) Carbohydrate = 100 – (protein + fat + ash + moisture) Where total protein = total nitrogen × conversion factor (6,25) From the above, the added water can be estimated as follows: Added water % = 100 – (Apparent Total Chicken Content + Ash + Carbohydrate) 9.4.
Measurement uncertainty The average measurement uncertainty for the determination of chicken content is estimated at just less than 3 % chicken content at the 95 % confidence limit.
Therefore samples can be considered to be misdescribed if the determined meat content is 5 % less than that declared.
