If a POGI has branches located within the territories of the other participating Member States, the registered or head office located in a given participating Member State must consider the positions towards all these branches as positions towards residents in the other participating Member States.
Conversely, a branch located in a given participating Member State must consider the positions towards the registered or head office or towards other branches of the same institution located outside the participating Member States as positions towards residents of the rest of the world.
