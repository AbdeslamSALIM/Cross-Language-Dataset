An applicant should also demonstrate that an appropriate effort is being made to evaluate, commercialise and secure national regulatory approval of alternatives and substitutes; and that research programmes are in place to develop and deploy alternatives and substitutes. (3) The Commission received 79 proposals for critical uses of methyl bromide from nine Member States including Belgium (44070 kg), France (259097 kg), Germany (19450 kg), Ireland (1250 kg), Italy (1333225 kg), Poland (45900 kg), Portugal (50000 kg), Spain (986000 kg), the Netherlands (120 kg) and the United Kingdom (139285 kg).
A total of 2878397 kg was requested, comprising 2690275 kg (94 %) for pre-harvest uses and 188140 kg (6 %) for post-harvest uses of methyl bromide.
In accordance with Decision IX/6 and Article 3(2)(ii), the Commission determined that 50047 kg of stocks are available for critical uses. (7) Article 4(2)(ii) states that, subject to Article 4(4), the placing on the market and the use of methyl bromide by undertakings other than producers and importers shall be prohibited after 31 December 2005.
Therefore, in addition to producers and importers, fumigators that are registered by the Commission in 2006 would be allowed to place methyl bromide on the market, and to use it for critical uses, after 31 December 2005.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 [5] records methyl bromide as a biocidal substance that cannot be placed on the market after 1 September 2006.
Article 4 This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2006 and shall expire on 31 December 2006.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
