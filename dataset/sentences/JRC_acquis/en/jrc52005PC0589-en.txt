Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system {SEC(2005) 1514} /* COM/2005/0589 final - COD 2005/0239 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 23.11.2005 COM(2005) 589 final 2005/0239 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system (presented by the Commission){SEC(2005) 1514} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL - Grounds for and objectives of the proposal For more than ten years the EU has been pursuing a proactive maritime safety policy aimed at improving ship safety, safeguarding human life at sea and protecting the marine environment.
This was the Commission’s thinking in presenting the text which became Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system.
In particular this is to take account of the good results obtained by novel equipment such as automatic identification systems or to ensure cohesion between national policies, for example on plans for accommodating ships in distress in places of refuge. - General background The time limit for implementing national measures pursuant to Directive 2002/59/EC was 5 February 2004, but in view of the particular importance of some of the Directive’s provisions the Member States and the Commission worked together from the time of its adoption in June 2002 to ensure that it was implemented in good time.
Thus, for example, with regard to the “places of refuge” provided for in Article 20 of the Directive the series of inspection visits and meetings organised by the Commission with the assistance of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) highlighted common criteria and principles for harmonised and effective implementation of the Directive.
Similarly, the proposal to introduce an obligation to carry an automatic identification system (AIS) for fishing vessels of more than 15 metres is a response to the large number of collisions involving fishing vessels which have evidently not been identified by commercial vessels.
Today this system, managed by EMSA since October 2004, has to be established expressly as a Community reference system in order to ensure it is fully utilised and legally secure. - Provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal Directive 2002/59/EC of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC. - Coherence with other policies and objectives of the Union The enhancement of ship monitoring by means of SafeSeaNet, the laying down of measures concerning navigation in ice conditions and the implementation of a stronger framework for the accommodation of ships in distress in places of refuge will have a direct environmental impact by reducing the risks of accidents and pollution and by improving the action taken by the operational authorities in the event of pollution or a pollution risk.
From the social angle, having AIS on board fishing vessels will reduce the risks of accidents and loss of human lives in the fishing industry. 2) CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT - Consultation of the stakeholders Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents In May 2004 and February 2005 the Commission held a double round of consultative meetings with representatives of the Member States and the maritime industry on the basis of a detailed list of questions on the amendments envisaged.
The Commission had suggested applying the measure to fishing vessels of over 12 metres, raised to 15 metres in the proposal in order especially to take account of the thresholds applied in the common fisheries policy context.
Option 2 – Let the Member States act through regional cooperation bodies (such as Helcom for the Baltic or the Bonn Agreement for the North Sea).
Option 4 – Carry out a specifically targeted amendment of the Directive.
This impact analysis is part of the Commission’s Legislative and Work Programme and is available on the Commission’s Internet website: http://europa.eu.int/comm/secretariat_general/impact/index_en.htm . 3) LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL - Summary of the proposed action This amendment is intended to: - incorporate in Directive 2002/59/EC additional measures for better ship safety and environmental protection; - harmonise the implementation of the “places of refuge” plans to ensure they are applied uniformly in the different Member States, which will help in preventing serious pollution.
There is a need, in particular, to clarify the rules for applying these principles; - integrate in the Directive the principles defined in the work done by the Member States and the Commission to set up the Community maritime safety information exchange system SafeSeaNet.
Sharing the information will help improve the quality of the data and make processing easier; - implementing the “places of refuge” plans will make a decisive contribution to raising the present level of maritime safety in the European Union; - reducing the number of collisions involving fishing vessels, which are not currently required to be fitted with an AIS, will make possible better protection of fishermen; - the new harmonised rules for winter navigation in the Baltic are necessary for reducing the very high accident risk in that area; - improving the exchange of information on dangerous goods being carried by ships will enable all Member States to improve their ability to anticipate and prevent risks.
The proposal is therefore consistent with the subsidiarity principle. - The principle of proportionality The proposal complies with the principle of proportionality for the following reasons: - in fleshing out the existing provisions in more detail the proposal is in line with the proportionality principle.
It thus makes it possible to locate at source and communicate to any authority accurate and up-to-date information on ships in European waters, their movements and their dangerous or polluting cargoes, as well as marine incidents. (3) Accordingly, in order to guarantee operational use of the information gathered in this way, it is essential that the infrastructure necessary for the data collection and exchange referred to in this Directive and implemented by the national administrations be integrated into the Community information exchange system SafeSeaNet. (4) Of the information notified and exchanged pursuant to Directive 2002/59/EC, that concerning the precise characteristics of dangerous or polluting goods carried by sea is particularly important.
Considering the large number of collisions involving fishing vessels that have clearly not been seen by merchant ships or which have not seen the merchant ships around them, extension of this measure to include fishing vessels with a length of more than 15 metres is very much to be desired. (6) It would be useful to study what synergies might be possible between AIS and the positioning and communication systems used in the context of the common fisheries policy, such as the satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS).
Investigation of the possibilities of integrating these systems should take account of the needs and requirements of controlling fishing fleets, particularly as regards the security and confidentiality of the data transmitted. (7) Article 16 of Directive 2002/59/EC provides that Member States are to adopt special measures in respect of ships posing a potential hazard due to their behaviour or condition.
It therefore seems desirable to add to the list of these ships those which do not have satisfactory insurance cover or financial guarantees or which have been reported by pilots or port authorities as having deficiencies which may prejudice their safe navigation or create a risk for the environment. (8) In accordance with Article 18 of Directive 2002/59/EC concerning the risks posed by exceptionally bad weather, it seems necessary to take into account the potential danger to shipping from ice formation.
The authority concerned should be able to take any appropriate steps to ensure the safety of human life at sea and to protect the environment. (9) Article 20 of Directive 2002/59/EC provides in particular that the Member States must draw up plans to accommodate, if the situation so requires, ships in distress in their ports or in any other protected place in the best possible conditions, in order to limit the consequences of accidents at sea. (10) However, in the light of the guidelines on places of refuge adopted by the IMO after Directive 2002/59/EC was adopted and following the work carried out jointly by the Commission, the European Maritime Safety Agency and the Member States, it seems necessary to lay down precisely the basic provisions that the “place of refuge” plans must contain in order to ensure a harmonised and effective implementation of this measure and clarify the scope of obligations incumbent on the Member States. (11) In the event of a situation of distress at sea, that is to say, a situation that could give rise to loss of a vessel or an environmental or navigational hazard, a decision may have to be taken as regards the accommodation of a ship in distress in a place of refuge.
The authorities referred to in paragraph 2 shall meet regularly to exchange their expertise and improve the measures taken pursuant to this Article.
Communication systems set up pursuant to paragraph 1 must allow the information gathered to be used operationally and must satisfy, in particular, the conditions laid down in Article 14 of this Directive. 3.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) established by Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council*. 2.
The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months. 3.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities .
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework The proposal for amendment of Directive 2002/59/EC establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system comprises the following measures (expected results): - by implementing a clear and precise legal framework at the places of refuge it will be possible to ensure that the authorities responsible for designating a place of refuge will be clearly identified and have at their disposal whatever elements are necessary for taking their decision, including an accurate inventory of potential places of refuge along the coast, - some of the results of the SafeSeaNet project for an electronic system of information exchange on movements of ships and dangerous cargoes in Community waters will be integrated in Directive 2002/59/EC, - automatic identification systems (AIS) will be installed on board fishing vessels with a length of more than 15 metres, - there will be specific measures allowing coastal States to take appropriate measures to limit the potential threat to navigation from ice formation in certain northern sea areas of the European Union. 5.4.
Integration of SafeSeaNet The proposal takes note of the obvious success of the principle of cooperation between the Member States and the Commission called for by Article 23 of Directive 2002/59/EC.
The total estimated cost to the fishing fleet concerned (ships with a length of more than 15 metres) is around EUR 23 million.
