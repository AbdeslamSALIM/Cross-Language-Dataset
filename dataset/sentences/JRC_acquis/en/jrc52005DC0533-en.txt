For the latter, Community aid totalling EUR 24 billion (at current prices) has been allocated for the period 2004-06.
Budgetary Implementation 2.1.1.
Commitments In 2004 the available commitment appropriations for the Structural Funds totalled EUR 35 353 million, i.e. 32% of the EU budget.
The commitment appropriations for the ten new Member States amounted to EUR 3 812 million.
Commitments actually made totalled EUR 35 212 million, practically 100% of the available appropriations (reflecting the system of essentially automatic commitments).
Payments Payments on commitments in 2004 were the highest ever recorded for the Structural Funds, equivalent to EUR 31 516 million euros, or 99% of the available payment appropriations.
This represented a significant acceleration in the realisation of the current generation of programmes in the fifth year of the programming period.
For Objective 2, 100% of the available payment credits were used.
On the other hand, the figure for innovative measures and technical assistance decreased from 90% in 2003 to 78% in 2004.
For the FIFG the figure was 81% in 2004, down from 86% in 2003.
Programme Implementation 2.2.1.
EU 15 In 2004, an important event was the allocation of the performance reserve followed by the mid-term review.
Objective 3 A main message arising from the mid-term evaluation reports is that the strategy initially agreed for the ESF interventions remains relevant in the majority of the cases, and that it continues to contribute to the implementation of the European Employment Strategy.
Community Initiatives 2.2.4.1.
The additional ERDF funding for INTERREG for the new Member States totals EUR 479 million for the period 2004-2006.
Together with the indexation funds for the period 2004-2006, this has brought the ERDF budget for INTERREG III to some EUR 5.8 billion.
Leader+ The payments in 2004 for the 73 Leader+ programmes amounted to 238 Million EUR from EAGGF Guidance.
New results for the Urban Audit were published[3]. 2.2.4.4.
In 2004, 27 new decisions were adopted to incorporate changes as result of the mid-term review and the indexation or to draw up new Community Initiative Programmes (PIC) for the new Member States. 2.2.5.
Innovative Actions 2.2.5.1.
ERDF Some 139 programmes were approved with total amount of EUR 660 million, of which EUR 344 million under the ERDF.
