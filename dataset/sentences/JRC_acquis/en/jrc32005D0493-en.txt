Ltd and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd (Case No C.37.370 &amp;mdash; Sorbates) (notified under document number C(2003) 3426) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 1 October 2003 relating to a proceeding under Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement against Chisso Corporation, Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd, Hoechst AG, The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co.
Ltd and Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd (Case No C.37.370 — Sorbates) (notified under document number C(2003) 3426) (Only the English and German texts are authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2005/493/EC) On 1 October 2003, the Commission adopted a Decision relating to a proceeding under Article 81 of the EC Treaty and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 30 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 [1], the Commission herewith publishes the names of the parties and the main content of the Decision, as well as the penalties imposed, having regard to the legitimate interest of undertakings in the protection of their business interests.
SUMMARY OF THE INFRINGEMENT Addressees and nature of the infringement (1) This Decision is addressed to Chisso Corporation (hereinafter Chisso), Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd (hereinafter Daicel), Hoechst AG (hereinafter Hoechst), The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co.
Duration of the infringement (3) The undertakings participated in the infringement from at least 31 December 1978 until at least 30 November 1995 in the case of Nippon, and until at least 31 October 1996 for the other Parties.
Daicel, Chisso Nippon and Ueno all have market shares between […]* % and […]* % (in the EEA between […]* % and […]* %).
Therefore, they are placed in the second group. (22) On the basis of the foregoing, the appropriate starting amount for the fines to be imposed in this case resulting from the criterion of relative importance in the market concerned is, for each of the two groups, as follows: - first group: EUR 20 million, - second group: EUR 6,66 million.
Therefore, the starting amount of its fine determined in recital 22 should be increased by 100 % to EUR 40 million.
Duration (25) The Commission considers that Chisso, Daicel, Hoechst and Ueno infringed Article 81(1) of the Treaty and Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement from 31 December 1978 until 31 October 1996.
The starting amount of the fines determined for gravity for Chisso, Daicel, Ueno and for Hoechst, should therefore be increased by 175 %. (26) Nippon infringed Article 81(1) of the Treaty and Article 53(1) of the EEA Agreement from 31 December 1978 until 30 November 1995.
It committed a long-term infringement of 16 years and 11 months.
The starting amount of its fine determined in recital (22) for gravity should therefore be increased by 165 %. (27) The Commission accordingly sets the basic amounts of the fines for Chisso at EUR 18,315 million, for Daicel at EUR 18,315 million, for Hoechst at EUR 110 million, for Nippon at EUR 17,649 million and for Ueno at EUR 18,315 million.
Aggravating circumstances (28) Hoechst’s leading role in the cartel and its recidivist behaviour should therefore be considered as aggravating circumstances, justifying increases of 30 % and of 50 % respectively of the basic amount of the fine. (29) Daicel, alongside with Hoechst, was a driving force behind the cartel.
The fact that Hoechst played a leading role in the infringement does not mean that Daicel did not also do so.
Having regard to the foregoing, the basic amount of the fine should be increased, in the case of Daicel, by 30 %. (30) There are no aggravating circumstances relating to the infringement in Chisso’s case. (31) There are no aggravating circumstances relating to the infringement in Nippon’s case. (32) There are no aggravating circumstances relating to the infringement in Ueno’s case.
Application of the 1996 Leniency Notice (38) The 2002 Leniency Notice is clearly inapplicable to this case.
The dividing line for the application ratione temporis of the 1996 and 2002 Notices has been drawn in point 28 of the 2002 Notice, which reads as follows: "From 14 February 2002, this notice replaces the 1996 notice for all cases in which no undertaking has contacted the Commission in order to take advantage of the favourable treatment set out in that notice." (39) In this case, several undertakings, including Hoechst, had already "contacted" the Commission before that date.
In its submission made on 10 June 2003, Chisso further explains and describes its precarious financial position and provides the Commission with financial data. (48) The Commission notes that Ueno failed to produce consolidated figures.
Decision (49) In conclusion, the fines to be imposed pursuant to Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 should be as follows: - Daicel Chemical Industries Ltd: EUR 16,6 million - Hoechst AG: EUR 99,0 million - The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co.
Ltd: EUR 10,5 million - Ueno Fine Chemicals Industry Ltd: EUR 12,3 million (50) The undertakings listed shall immediately bring the infringements to an end, in so far as they have not already done so.
