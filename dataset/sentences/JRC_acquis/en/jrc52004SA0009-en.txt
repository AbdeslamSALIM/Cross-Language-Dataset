DG: Directorate-General.
Forests and woodlands cover 136 million ha (36 %) of the land area of the European Union of 15 Member States.
In 1998 the Council adopted an EU forestry strategy [3] based on two key principles: (a) forest management should be sustainable [4], (b) forests have a multifunctional (ecological, economic and social) role.
Since the year 2000, forestry measures, grouped in two categories of action, afforestation and other forestry measures, have been financed by rural development funds.
The Court's audit determined whether the forestry measures were based on forestry plans or equivalent instruments; how such measures were programmed and financed; how they were implemented and what their impact was.
In the absence of a commonly applied definition of "forest", the extent to which the objective is achieved is difficult to monitor (see paragraphs 15 to 18).
There is no clear responsibility for assessing the extent to which the financed projects contribute to the achievement of the EU strategy (see paragraphs 19 to 22).
The Commission's information on forestry actions in Member States is still incomplete (see paragraphs 23 to 36).
Because of the long contract period for forestry there is little freedom to manoeuvre: much of the money available has in practice already been allocated in the form of CAP accompanying measures (see paragraphs 37 to 39).
The system in place for implementing forestry measures is complex.
The audit found a number of weaknesses in the implementation of forestry measures (see paragraphs 43 to 58 and 62 to 64), such as: - varying interpretations were noted in prioritising the land to be afforested, - no clear Community guidelines on how to ensure compatibility with the environment, - unclear project selection criteria, - unsatisfactory arrangements for deciding on eligibility relating to land use, loss of income and whether beneficiaries were farmers, - weak on the spot checks to verify the correctness of claims, - a need to improve control procedures for public contract tendering.
As some of these local authorities claimed that they might not have sufficient financial resources, there is a risk that projects which have received considerable EU aid will fail in subsequent years (see paragraphs 59 to 61).
Increasing woodland area by grant-aided afforestation of agricultural land is very expensive mainly due to the compensation paid for loss of agricultural income over a period of 20 years.
Moreover, the results have not been very significant and could have been obtained more cheaply (see paragraphs 65 to 78).
In particular the Commission should reconsider how the afforestation measure can be better targeted, at a lower cost to the EU budget taking into account the changing public needs and the fact that the emphasis of Community legislation is now on sustainable environmental benefits (see paragraphs 79 to 87).
Forests and other wooded areas account for 136 million ha [5], which is about 36 % of the total EU surface area.
The EU has provided support for forestry since 1964.
A new impetus was given on 15 December 1998, when the Council adopted a Resolution [7] setting out an EU forestry strategy. 5.
Two guiding principles govern the Strategy: (a) forest management should be sustainable [9], (b) forests have a multifunctional (ecological, economic and social) role.
Some 1500 million euro were spent in the period 1992 to 1999 on afforestation of agricultural land.
For the period 2000 to 2006 the EU contribution is planned to be 2387 million euro for afforestation measures and 2420 million euro for other forestry measures [10] (see table).
Two distinct types of actions were set: (a) afforestation [12] (Article 31), (b) other forestry measures [13] (Articles 30 and 32). 9.
The audit of the Court 11.
The present audit covered the forestry measures of the rural development Regulation summarised in paragraph 8 above [16].
The principal objectives of the Court's audit were to determine: - whether the forestry measures are based on forestry plans or equivalent instruments, - how such measures were programmed and financed, - how they were implemented, - what was the impact of the measures as regards economy, efficiency and effectiveness. 13.
THE EU STRATEGY AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION Legal framework - with their many functions, forests are essential to rural areas and constitute a major component of an integrated rural development policy, particularly because of their contribution to income and employment and their ecological and social value, - forests and their diversity are an important part of the European natural environment and their protection and conservation falls within the scope of a number of Community policies and is the subject in particular of specific environmental issues such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy, Natura 2000 and the implementation of the Climate Change Convention, - for forest products, and in particular wood (as well as cork and resins), the rules of the Internal Market apply, including the normal EU competition rules on state aids, mergers and cartels. [17].
Conferences in Helsinki and Lisbon, in 1993 and 1998 respectively defined more explicitly the concept of sustainable forest management by drawing up a set of monitoring indicators.
For example, if the definition of forest area used by Ireland were to be applied, the total EU forested area would be roughly 5 % less, whereas if the Luxembourg definition were to be applied the forest area would be approximately 3 % [20] more.
The different responsibilities for implementation of the strategy under the rural development regulation are: (a) level I: the Strategy was proposed by the Commission [21] (and then adopted by the Council); this took account of the international commitments and the main concepts of sustainability and multi-functionality; (b) level II: in line with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States are responsible for planning and implementing national forest programmes or equivalent instruments; (c) level III: forestry measures are co-financed by Member States and the Community budget under the terms of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, which defines the structure and requirements of the forestry measures; (d) level IV: individual projects are authorised and managed by the national, regional or local authorities of the Member States. 20.
The audit found that neither the Commission nor the Member States assumed responsibility for assessing whether a project contributed to the achievement of the EU forestry strategy.
As indicated in paragraph 19(a) and as stipulated in the basic Regulation on support for rural development [24], from 1999, Member States were required to base their forestry rural development measures on national or subnational forest programmes or equivalent instruments. 24.
Because of the long contract period for forestry, there is little freedom to manoeuvre: much of the money available has in practice already been allocated in the form of CAP accompanying measures as detailed below. 38.
Afforestation contracts established before 2000 (when the measure was funded as an accompanying measure under the CAP reform) and running for a maximum of 20 years, have taken up considerable funds for the afforestation measure as part of rural development.
The seven years of the current programming period is ill-fitted for afforestation contracts which can and frequently do last 20 years.
The entitlement of the beneficiary, in particular, to an annual premium for each hectare to cover a supposed loss of income for a period of up to 20 years greatly exceeds the financing resources available in the programmes.
In addition, the sanction system which was based on IACS requirements [34] for area payments are considered no longer to be applicable with retroactive effect to 1 January 2000.
The system for the beneficiary is equally complex.
IMPLEMENTATION OF FORESTRY MEASURES Afforestation of agricultural land 43.
For the period 1992 to 1999, Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92 regulated afforestation of agricultural land.
For the period 2000 to 2006, afforestation of agricultural land as stipulated in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 consists of converting agricultural land into forests or woodland.
As a consequence, afforestation of agricultural land was refocused from promoting an alternative use of agricultural land under the Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92 to promoting the extension of woodland areas provided that it complies with Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
In other countries (Italy, Portugal), in which comparable climate conditions were found with similar environmental needs, conversion of high quality and high value agricultural land into forests was noted.
Administrative implementation (Unclear project selection criteria) 47.
Uncertain verification of previous land use 48.
Therefore, it is of the highest importance that reliable systems are in place to verify that the information provided to justify the level of compensation is correct [37]. 49.
The amount per hectare to be paid as compensation for loss of income for up to 20 years is set out in the RDP.
The issue has been raised by the Court in the past [39].
Several weaknesses were noted in this respect: - insufficient application of a risk analysis (Italy, Spain) and non-segregation of the duties between managing officials and officials in charge of on-the-spot checks (Italy, Ireland), - insufficient documentation of the checks carried out (Italy, Ireland, France), - unsatisfactory verification of expenditure incurred (Ireland, Spain, Portugal, France).
Other forestry measures 58.
Associations of these two owners may also benefit from aid. 60.
An amendment [44] of the basic Regulation now allows for investments in public forests with the aim of improving their ecological or social value (Article 30(1), second indent).
The audit showed that control procedures for public contract tendering for forestry actions should be improved particularly in view of the low level of competition in this area.
For the period 2000 to 2006, a further 2,38 billion euro of the EU budget were allocated to afforestation of agricultural land under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999. 66.
For example, the EU financing granted to one afforestation project, audited, totalled 847487 euro (75 % of the total cost) and was constituted as follows: establishment cost 137940 euro (16 %), maintenance cost for the five years 101748 euro (12 %) and the costs for loss of income for 20 years 607799 euro (72 %). 68.
For the period 1992 to 1999 under Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92 the afforestation of agricultural land was a CAP accompanying measure aiming to promote an alternative use of agricultural land.
Since 2000 the measure became part of the rural development support Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 aiming to promote the extension of woodland areas with due regard to environmental impact.
According to the official final evaluation of Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92, afforestation was made at a cost of 1,519 billion euro.
In this evaluation it is indicated that the plantations created represented 0,92 % (1041589 hectares) of the European forested area of 1998.
Therefore it is likely that the contribution to the increase in forestry resources will not be more significant under Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 than that obtained under Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92. 72.
In 1995, the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria increased the forested area in the EU by around 57 million hectares, from 79 million to 136 million hectares (+72 %).
Enlargement in 2004 will lead to another increase of the EU forests of around 24 million hectares from 136 million to 160 million hectares. 73.
Afforestation of agricultural land was discussed during a conference on the future of Rural Development which was held in November 2003 [46].
The Regulation stipulates that where support is granted for afforestation of agricultural land owned by public authorities, it shall cover only the cost of establishment [48], i.e.
Measures under Article 32 focus more on environmental benefits.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 79.
It is not helped by the fact that Member States define "forest" differently (see paragraphs 14 to 18). - The Commission should simplify and make more coherent the legal basis of EU forestry action and work towards a common understanding and interpretation of "forest". 80.
Due to this lack of clarity neither the Member State nor the Commission feel responsible for assessing whether a forestry project contributed to the achievement of the EU forestry strategy (see paragraphs 19 to 22). - Clarity should be sought in attributing responsibilities to the Member States and the Commission for the implementation of the EU forestry strategy when EU-financed forestry measures are used. 81.
Afforestation contracts established before 2000 and running for up to 20 years have taken up considerable amounts of funds which had been planned to be used for the implementation of afforestation measures as part of rural development.
Furthermore, a seven-year programming period is ill-fitted to the longer planning required for forest actions, of up to 20 years (see paragraphs 37 to 39). 84.
The use of varying financing arrangements (a mix of EAGGF Guidance and Guarantee funding) has led to a complex delivery system of rural development policy (see paragraphs 40 to 42). - The Commission should examine the financing arrangements with a view to simplification. 85.
Overall forestry action is not sufficiently targeted (see paragraphs 65 to 78). - The Commission should reconsider how the afforestation measure may be better targeted and at a lower cost to the budget, taking into account the changing public needs and the fact that the emphasis of Community legislation is now on environmental benefits.

The Commission welcomes this report whose timely presentation will allow appropriate consideration to be taken in the light of the forthcoming review of the EU forest strategy and the future rural development framework (COM(2004) 490 final).
The outcome of the policy can be monitored at Member State level and subsequently at EU level.
The national or regional authorities approve the individual projects on basis of the RDP.
European countries have developed a common approach to national forest programmes in the context of the Ministerial Conferences on the protection of forest in Europe (MCPFE) and significant progress has been made in drawing up programmes.
The Commission is aware of the fact that the system is complex and has consequently already introduced simplifications and proposed further substantial steps for the post 2006 rural development framework.
The proposal for the post 2006 rural development policy contains several elements for improved environmental targeting in the selection of land for afforestation. - Compatibility with the environment is a legal requirement.
Member States implement this obligation on basis of the regional conditions. - Most programmes include selection criteria, but it is recognised that in some cases there may be a need to improve the definition of these.
The authorities approving projects should require sufficient evidence from the municipalities that the maintenance work is ensured.
Nevertheless, the proposals for post 2006 rural development framework provide to limit the compensation for income loss to 10 years.
The proposals for post 2006 rural development framework further meet this recommendation by targeting afforestation more explicitly on environmental objectives and by requiring designation of areas suitable for (and thus limited to) afforestation for environmental reasons.
Sustainable forest management is based on the balanced integration of economic, social and environmental objectives.
Countries are developing appropriate mechanisms and structures for the participation of stakeholders in forest policy formulation and implementation processes, notably in the context of their national forest programmes.
The shared management and the Commission responsibilities for the implementation of the EU forestry strategy were established by the Council in its Resolution of 15 December 1998 on a forestry strategy for the European Union.
If the Commission audits reveal deficiencies in Member States’ management and control systems and/or non-conformity with Community rules in project implementation, financial corrections may be proposed within the Commission clearance of account procedure. 21 to 22.
See also reply to point 20.
The proposal for the post 2006 rural development framework contains a clearer demarcation of responsibilities between the Commission and Member States.
The Commission proposed in July 2004 (COM(2004) 490 final) to reinforce the evaluation requirements for the future rural development framework.
In response to this need, the European countries have developed a common approach to national forest programmes in the context of the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forest in Europe (MCPFE). 27.
In the absence of national forest plans in some Member States in 2000, it seemed justified to accept RDPs or OPs, a possibility which was provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 (Article 29).
This is due to the fact that the Commission examines all programmes submitted by the Member States before approving them. 31.
The rural development programmes provide information on the linkage between proposed measures and national/subnational forest programmes or equivalent instruments (Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 Annex II, point 9(3)(X)) in order to allow the Commission to check their coherence.
In addition, Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 obliges each Member State to submit, as part of the rural development programme, the information necessary to allow a check of compatibility with competition rules. 35.
Where the Regulations (EEC) No 2080/92 and (EC) No 1257/1999 provide for a long-term (up to 20 years) compensation for income losses by nature, this affects several programming periods.
Moreover, Member States will have to designate areas suitable for afforestation for environmental reasons (Article 47(5)).
A COMPLEX SYSTEM 40.
The sanctions to be applied are therefore those set out in Article 64 of Regulation (EC) No 445/2002, replaced by Article 73 of Regulation (EC) No 817/2004, which reads as follows: "Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.
The Commission services examine these questions during the approval procedure for rural development programmes.
The essential tool to verify this ex post is the reinforced monitoring and assessment of the results achieved also in terms of environmental delivery. 47.
The DG AGRI audit services apply, consistently, the approach indicated in the Guideline document provided to Member States to all rural development measures implying selections among applications eligible for financing due to limited funds available.
The national/regional definition of "agricultural land" must be part of the rural development programme. 49.
The only Community provision is in Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 (shall be specified by the Member State where farming takes place on a regular basis).
For the next programming period the Commission intends to review the calculation of payment levels (see also paragraphs 50 and 51). 53.
The definition of the status of "farmer" for the purposes of afforestation measures is to be provided by the Member State according to detailed criteria (Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 817/2004).
See also the reply to paragraph 53). 55.
When the Commission services during audits in Member States find weaknesses in the control systems, they are followed up by recommendations and may also result in imposing financial corrections. 57.
It should be noted that Regulation (EC) No 1783/2003 opened the measure to improve the ecological and social value of forest owned by public authorities.
The afforestation of agricultural land owned by public authorities would be eligible according to the proposals for post 2006 rural development proposal.
The authorities approving projects should require sufficient evidence from the municipalities that the maintenance work is ensured. 62.
See answer to paragraph 70. 70.
It is worth noting that the evaluation report of Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92 indicates also that concerning the contribution of the regulation to rural development "Overall this contribution appears to us to be significant and positive, and Regulation (EEC) No 2080/92 has fully played its role accompanying the reform of the common agricultural policy".
On top of the overall impact account should be taken on the significant effect in certain specific regions (like the planting of 100000 hectares of cork oaks in Spain and Portugal. 71.
This measure may have very positive effects in some specific regions or areas. 73.
The proposals for the post 2006 rural development framework provide for a better targeting and articulation of the entire bundle of forestry measures.
The current Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 is to be split.
Furthermore, the envisaged EU strategy guidelines will articulate the entire range of objectives for the forestry sector. 75.
Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 has proven difficult to implement.
Therefore the proposals for the post 2006 rural development framework contain a revision of and a more targeted approach to the current Article 32 measures.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS 79.
The approach adopted since 2000 following the rural development Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 is consistent with the EU forestry strategy, which provides the overall reference framework for forestry actions in the EU.
The EU forestry strategy provides the reference framework for forestry actions at EU level, including but not limited to rural development.
The definition of forest is within the competence of the Member States.
The national or regional authorities approve the individual projects on basis of the programme. - The Commission foresees, in the proposal for the future rural development framework, a clearer demarcation of responsibilities between the Commission and Member States. 81.
Nevertheless, the analysis had to include all information available on forestry actions, the ex ante evaluation, and involved a number of Commission services with DG AGRI being the lead service. - The proposals for post 2006 rural development framework contain as an essential feature a requirement for strategic planning and monitoring.
The proposals for post 2006 rural development framework will strengthen the strategy aspect of this assessment (including forestry), reinforce evaluation and focus clearly on the results achieved in relation to the strategic objectives. 83.
Nevertheless, the proposals for post 2006 rural development framework will provide to limit the compensation for income loss to 10 years and a reduction in the aid ceiling. 84.
Where audits by the Commission services detect weak and insufficient control systems, financial corrections are applied. - The implementation of the strategic, result-oriented approach for post 2006 period will contribute to a thorough selection of individual projects against efficiency criteria. - The Commission will take account of the Court's observations in the risk analyses covering all CAP aid schemes and leading to its audit work programme.
