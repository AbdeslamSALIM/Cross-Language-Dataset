2006/738/EC: Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 on State Aid implemented by Germany for Norddeutsche Landesbank %mdash% Girozentrale (notified under document number C(2004) 3926) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 on State Aid implemented by Germany for Norddeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale (notified under document number C(2004) 3926) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/738/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on the Member State and other interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) The subject of these proceedings is the transfer of three Land trust agencies (Landestreuhandstellen ("LTS")) to Norddeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale ("NordLB") by the Land of Lower Saxony.
There are a further six cases in which proceedings have been initiated against Germany in connection with transfers of assets to Landesbanks, and in particular to Westdeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale ("WestLB"). (2) By letter of 12 January 1993, the Commission asked Germany for information on a capital increase in WestLB resulting from the incorporation of the housing organisation Wohnungsbauförderanstalt ("WfA") and on similar increases in the own funds of the Landesbanks of other Länder.
It also asked which Landesbanks had benefited from a transfer of publicly owned promotion-related assets and for information on the reasons for those transactions. (3) Germany replied by letters dated 16 March and 17 September 1993.
The Commission requested further information by letters of 10 November and 13 December 1993, to which Germany replied by letter of 8 March 1994. (4) By letters of 31 May and 21 December 1994, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken e.V. ("BdB"), an association representing private banks established in Germany, informed the Commission among other things that, under a law adopted on 17 December 1991, the Land of Lower Saxony’s shares in assets used to promote housing, agriculture, trade and industry had been transferred to NordLB with effect from 31 December 1991.
This decision was annulled by the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on 6 March 2003 as insufficient reasons had been given for two of the factors used to calculate the appropriate remuneration, but it was confirmed in all other respects.
On 20 October 2004 the Commission, having become aware of an understanding between the complainant, WestLB and the Land of North-Rhine Westphalia, issued a new decision which took account of the Court's criticisms. (6) On 1 September 1999, following Decision 2000/392/EC, the Commission sent Germany a request for information on the transfers of assets to the other Landesbanks.
The Commission called on interested parties to submit comments. (10) By letter of 11 April 2003, Germany submitted its comments on the initiation of the procedure in the NordLB case. (11) By letter of 29 July 2003, the BdB submitted comments on all the decisions taken on 13 November 2002 to initiate the investigation procedure.
On 30 October 2003 Germany forwarded a reply by the Land Government of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB AG to the BdB's comments on the proceedings concerning the transfer of LTS to NordLB. (12) In response to the Commission’s request for further information dated 1 September 2003, Germany supplied additional information and replied to the BdB's comments on NordLB on 28 October. (13) On 7 April and 3 May 2004 the Commission sent Germany further requests for information, to which the latter replied by letters dated 27 May and 28 June 2004.
On 16 August and 9 September 2004 Germany sent further comments supplementing its previous position. (14) On 19 July 2004 the complainant (the BdB), the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB AG submitted a provisional understanding on the appropriate remuneration for the transferred assets.
The final version of the understanding on the transfer of the LTS assets to NordLB reached the Commission on 7 October 2004.
With a group balance-sheet total of EUR 193000 million (at 31 December 2003), it is one of Germany's largest banks.
It has a stock-exchange office in Frankfurt, branches in London, New York, Singapore, Stockholm, Helsinki and Shanghai, representative offices in Oslo, Tallinn and Beijing and subsidiaries in London, Zürich, Luxembourg, Riga, Vilnius and Warsaw. (21) In 2003 NordLB’s equity ratio was 11,5 % at institutional level and 10,1 % at group level; its core-capital ratio was 7,1 % at institutional level and 6,3 % at group level.
Its income-to-equity ratio stood at [...] [5] % in 2003. 2.
It granted promotional loans in its own name, but on the Land’s financial account. (23) The three LTS are not legally independent but are managed within NordLB as autonomous and — in operational, personnel and organisational terms — separate business divisions.
It looks after the EU’s Interreg Initiative and is recognised as a financial intermediary under the Joint European Venture (JEV). 3.
TRANSFER OF THE LTS AND ITS EFFECTS (a) THE TRANSFER (31) By the Act on the contribution of the promotion-related assets of the Land of Lower Saxony to the liable equity capital of Norddeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale, adopted by the Lower Saxony Parliament on 17 December 1991 [9], the Land’s Finance Ministry was empowered to transfer at their market value the Land’s shares of the promotion-related assets of the three LTS to NordLB as equity capital.
The Land also undertook to maintain the total market value of the transferred assets at not less than DEM 1500 million. (32) On the basis of this Act, the Land of Lower Saxony and NordLB concluded a transfer agreement on 20 December 1991 by which the Land transferred to NordLB as liable equity capital its entire shares of the respective promotion-related assets.
The table below shows the values established up to the end of 2003: Date | Value (DEM million) | 31.12.1991 | 1754,4 | 31.12.1992 | [...] | 31.12.1993 | [...] | 31.12.1994 | [...] | 31.12.1995 | [...] | 31.12.1996 | [...] | 31.12.1997 | [...] | 31.12.1998 | [...] | 31.12.1999 | [...] | 31.12.2000 | [...] | 31.12.2001 | [...] | 31.12.2002 | [...] | 31.12.2003 | [...] | (35) On the basis of Treuarbeit AG's report, NordLB applied to the German Banking Supervisory Authority (Bundesaufsichtsamt für das Kreditwesen — "BAKred") on 26 February 1992 asking for the special-purpose reserve of DEM 1500 million to be recognised for supervisory purposes as liable equity capital within the meaning of the second sentence of Section 10(2) KWG. (36) On 26 July 1993 BAKred provisionally recognised the DEM 1500 million as liable equity capital.
Before formally recognising the promotion-related assets of the LTS as core capital, BAKred allowed them to be used to cover liabilities, in so far as was necessary to comply with the solvency rules in force at the time. (37) From the time of the transfer, the sum of DEM 1500 million was shown under NordLB’s equity capital as a combined special-purpose reserve, while the difference vis-à-vis the value of the assets was booked as a provision for commitments arising from the transfer agreement. (38) Germany has stated that each year around DEM 100 million of the assets transferred was required to underpin promotion-related business.
Until BAKred granted its final recognition, only the portion of the assets that was actually necessary to comply with solvency rules was available for competitive business. (39) In detail, the following amounts were available for competitive business: 1992 | Value of assets available for competitive business, according to Germany (DEM million) | January | 120 | February | 101 | March | 145 | April | 109 | Mai | 71 | June | 0 | July | 0 | August | 0 | September | 0 | October | 19 | November | 63 | December | 162 | 1993 | Value of assets available for competitive business, according to Germany (DEM million) | January | 133 | February | 133 | March | 207 | April | 147 | May | 174 | June | 1143 | July | 1222 | August | 1071 | September | 1176 | October | 1204 | November | 1149 | December | 1197 | Irrespective of the use to which the assets may be put for the purposes of banking supervision, NordLB is committed by agreement to inform the Land before the beginning of each business year how much of the LTS promotion-related assets it plans to use ("earmarking of capital").
For 1992 NordLB notified the use of DEM 180 million.
In reality, however, an increase in own funds of around DEM 1400 million can expand the permissible credit volume by much more, as a bank's assets are normally not 100 % risk-adjusted.
In this context NordLB must determine the amount of remuneration for the following business year by 31 January.
Accordingly, the following amounts have been paid: Date | Earmarked capital (DEM million) | Interest rate | Remuneration paid (DEM million) | 31.12.1992 | 180 | 0,5 % | 0,9 | 31.12.1993 | 1400 | 0,5 % | 7 | 31.12.1994 | 1400 | 0,5 % | 7 | 31.12.1995 | 1390 | 0,5 % | 6,95 | 31.12.1996 | 1390 | 0,5 % | 6,95 | 31.12.1997 | 1390 | 0,5 % | 6,95 | 31.12.1998 | 1390 | 0,5 % | 6,95 | 31.12.1999 | [...] [10] | 0,5 % | [...] | 31.12.2000 | [...] | 0,5 % | [...] | 31.12.2001 | [...] | 0,5 % | [...] | 31.12.2002 | [...] | 0,5 % | [...] | 31.12.2003 | [...] | 0,5 % | [...] | (43) Under the transfer agreement, the Land of Lower Saxony also has the right to withdraw interest payments and amortisations that flow back to the promotion-related assets, in so far as the market value of the assets exceeds DEM 1500 million.
If this were to pose problems, a change in ownership structure would have to be discussed. (45) A draft agreement to be concluded between the two guarantors was annexed to the draft law of 15 October 1991.
Their value was estimated at DEM 900 million.
It was agreed that NordLB would withdraw DEM 450 million from LBS before it was hived off and that NSGV would inject the same amount into LBS.
The special reserve yielded cumulative interest before tax of 7,5 % per annum and was owned jointly by the guarantors in accordance with their internal relationship, i.e. 60 % by the Land and 40 % by NGSV. (ii) Silent partnership contribution of DEM 550 million (50) Germany states that on 10 October 1994 NSGV and NordLB concluded an agreement concerning a capital contribution under Section 10(4) KWG.
Under that agreement, NSGV undertook to make a capital contribution to NordLB in the form of a silent partnership amounting to DEM 550 million, with effect from 10 October 1994, in return for payment of a profit-linked remuneration the amount of which would be derived from the interest rate (specified in more detail) on 10-year bearer bonds amounting to 7,91 % plus a margin of 1,2 % per annum.
COMPLAINT AND OBSERVATIONS BY THE COMPLAINANT (THE BDB) (51) In BdB's view, the transfer of the LTS promotion-related assets and the associated increase in NordLB's capital distorted competition in favour of NordLB since the latter did not pay remuneration consistent with the market-economy investor principle. (52) The BdB submits that the application of the market-economy investor principle is not limited to enterprises which are loss-making or in need of financial restructuring.
Comparison with other equity instruments (55) The BdB comes to the conclusion that the transfer of the LTS promotion-related assets to NordLB — and the transfer of capital in all the other Landesbank cases — can be compared to an injection of share capital. (56) It argues that the promotion-related assets transferred cannot be compared with capital in the form of profit participation certificates, as profit participation rights constitute only additional capital.
An investor could not therefore expect to receive the same return on a silent partnership contribution as for equity instruments recognised for supervisory purposes for an unlimited period, in particular a injection of share capital. (57) Second, although it was asserted that the transferred capital was subordinate in liability to share capital pursuant to agreements between the Landesbanks' owners, this did not necessarily mean a lower risk for the investor.
These methods can be traced back to the following basic principle: Expected return on a risky investment = risk-free return + risk premium for the risky investment (60) To determine the risk-free return, the BdB uses the returns on long-term government bonds, fixed-rate securities issued by state bodies being the form of investment with the least or no risk.
The amount of this discount would be calculated using the WestLB method, on the basis of net refinancing costs (gross refinancing costs minus the applicable corporation taxes). (64) The Court of First Instance also upheld the premium applied by the Commission in Decision 2000/392/EC.
COMMENTS BY THE LAND OF NORTH RHINE-WESTPHALIA AND WESTLB (65) On 30 October 2003 Germany forwarded a response from the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia and WestLB to the Commission's decision to initiate the investigation procedure in which they disputed the statement that the assets transferred to the Landesbanks, including NordLB, could be compared to share-capital.
Yet the risk of investing in a Landesbank was well below the overall market risk because of the institutional liability (Anstaltslast) and guarantor liability (Gewährträgerhaftung) which it enjoyed and which were not challenged at the time. (67) Moreover, they argued that, in the specific case of the Landesbanks, it was a mistake to use as a benchmark the return expected at the time that the assets were transferred to the banks.
But for an investor to receive in 2003 the return expected in 1991, which was much higher than the returns actually achieved, flew in the face of all economic realities.
In 1992 the assets transferred represented only 34,89 % of the total equity of the NordLB group recognised for supervisory purposes.
It therefore performed not only the traditional public tasks of a Land bank, with the attendant costs, but also the function of a savings bank. (80) If, nevertheless, there were aid in this case, it was in any event existing aid since the promotion-related assets had been transferred on the basis of Anstaltslast, on which a final settlement was reached by the Brussels compromise of 17 July 2001. 5.
They arrived at an appropriate minimum remuneration of 10,03 % for the LTS promotion-related assets.
ASSESSMENT OF THE MEASURE (87) The first step in appraising the measure under the state aid rules of the EC Treaty is to assess whether it constitutes state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. 1.
If state assets of this kind, which have a commercial value, are transferred to an undertaking, then state resources within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty are involved. (89) In order to verify whether the transfer of state resources to a publicly owned undertaking favours the latter and is therefore liable to constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, the Commission applies the "market-economy investor principle".
The assessment under that principle will be made in paragraph 93 et seq.
The contributions by NSEV were, moreover, not comparable to the transfer of the LTS assets either in timing or in content. (102) Whereas the LTS assets were transferred to NordLB with effect from 31 December 1991, it was only with effect from 1 July 1994 that LBS was hived off from NordLB and the LBS special-purpose reserve of DEM 450 million was formed.
The silent partnership contribution of DEM 550 million took effect only from 10 October 1994.
Each year a payment of 7,5 % (before tax) is made for the LBS special-purpose reserve, while, according to the Federal Government, the silent partnership contribution yields interest of around 9,11 % (before tax).
By contrast, the LTS assets yield interest of 0,5 % after tax (around 1,2 % before tax).
So the remuneration for the LTS assets is much lower than that for the measures taken by the NSGV. (105) Given such marked differences between the transactions carried out by the Land and by NSGV, the question can ultimately be left open as to whether, at the time when the LTS assets were transferred to NordLB, NSGV was in fact bound by an obligation to inject into NordLB an amount of capital corresponding to its shareholding or whether this obligation was laid down only later. (106) It can therefore be concluded that there was no proportional, comparable capital injection by a private investor, so that the conditions underlying the Alitalia case are not met here.
Moreover, according to Germany, the Land ensured that NSGV also injected capital commensurate with its own holding in order to prevent NSGV from sharing in an increase in value brought about solely by the Land. (108) For the reasons set out in paragraph 102 et seq., no importance can be attached to the fact that the Land had shares in NordLB and NSGV’s capital injection cannot be regarded as a comparable investment.
However, only DEM 1500 million was entered as equity on NordLB's balance sheet.
However, the LTS assets could not be used in full as equity capital until recognised by BAKred.
Until the amount was provisionally recognised on 26 July 1993, the use of the promotion-related assets was tolerated by BAKred only in so far as was necessary in order to comply the solvency rules in force at the time.
The full amount of DEM 1500 million could be used only after it was provisionally recognised on 26 July 1993.
However, of this DEM 1500 million, only around DEM 1400 million — the exact amount fluctuates from year to year — can be used by NordLB to expand its competitive business activities since the remainder is needed for its promotion-related business.
Since the amount of around DEM 100 million each year cannot be used to expand business but improves the bank's appearance in the eyes of creditors, its economic function may be compared in that respect to at least that of a guarantee. (115) Since the amount of around DEM 100 million each year is also of economic use to WestLB, a market-economy investor would have asked for a remuneration to be paid on it.
The level of this remuneration will certainly be lower than that for the DEM 1400 million, which is of greater use to NordLB, since it can also be used under the solvency rules as own funds to expand its commercial business. (116) A final point to be made here is that the text of the understanding between the Land of Lower Saxony, NordLB and BdB states that remuneration is payable for the transferred assets only as of the end of the month in which they were finally recognised as core capital by BAKred, i.e. 30 November 1993.
Profit participation capital is additional capital which may, in principle, be taken into account only up to the extent of the core capital.
At 31 December 1991, NordLB is said to have had core capital of DEM 2043 million and additional capital of DEM 543 million.
Silent partnership contributions and "perpetuals" had been recognised as core capital in Germany since 1991.
In its view, an important factor here is that the LTS assets were transferred precisely not in the form of a silent partnership contribution but as a special-purpose reserve.
BAKred too recognised the transfer as a reserve and not as a silent partnership contribution under Section 10 KWG.
The fact that the German supervisory authority treated the transfer as a reserve suggests that the capital made available is more akin to share capital than to a silent partnership contribution. (126) In addition, there is no less risk that at least part of the transferred capital might be lost in the event of insolvency or liquidation than would be the case for a share-capital investment, as the LTS assets make up a considerable proportion of NordLB’s equity capital and NordLB has used a substantial amount of those assets to cover risk-bearing assets over many years. (127) For all these reasons, the Commission believes that, because of the peculiarities of the LTS capital, a comparison with perpetuals, profit participation certificates and silent partnership contributions is not a suitable way to determine the appropriate remuneration to be paid for the LTS capital.
Instead, the transfer of the LTS assets has most in common with a share-capital investment. (ii) Right to compensation and low liability risk (128) The liability in respect of the promotion-related assets is limited internally to the share of the Land of Lower Saxony in NordLB’s capital, and the Land is entitled to seek compensation from all of NordLB’s other guarantors.
Germany argues that an investor would have given this due consideration in his investment decision and his demand for remuneration. (129) However, the internal restriction on liability cannot justify any reduction in remuneration since, from NordLB's point of view, it remains the case that the advantage obtained by means of the capital transfer must be adequately remunerated in order to avoid distortions of competition.
Even if this were not the case, a market-economy investor would have insisted on remuneration in full since the bank was free to employ all the capital in its competitive business according to its economic discretion. (iii) Appropriate remuneration for the amount of DEM 1400 million (131) There are no doubt different ways of calculating the appropriate remuneration for the amount of DEM 1400 million which was available to NordLB each year for its competitive business.
Determination of a likely minimum remuneration for an investment in the share capital of NordLB (132) The expected return on an investment and the investment risk are key determinants in the decision of a market-economy investor to invest.
The arithmetic average of the historical capital costs is then compared with the future expected equity capital costs and hence with the investor's expected-return requirement. - Financing approach with compound annual growth rate: At the heart of this approach stands the use of the geometric rather than the arithmetic mean (compound annual growth rate). - Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): The CAPM is the best-known and most frequently tested model of modern finance, by which the return expected by an investor can be determined using the following equation: Minimum return = risk-free base rate + (market-risk premium × beta) The risk premium for the equity investment is obtained by multiplying the risk premium on the market by the beta factor (market-risk premium × beta).
The parties then determined the rate per annum, which reflects the trend tracked by the REXIO Performance Index in the period 1970-91 and, in this way, arrived at the risk-free basic interest rate of 7,15 % referred to above. (140) Since NordLB's capital injection was made available on a permanent basis, the method of determining the risk-free basic interest rate appears appropriate in this specific case.
The risk-free basic interest rate calculated thus appears appropriate here. (141) The beta factor of 0,72 was estimated on the basis of a KPMG report on adjusted beta factors for all listed credit institutions in Germany that is available to the Commission.
In the light of the report and of HLB's business profile, this beta factor is to be regarded as appropriate. (142) The Commission also regards the market-risk premium of 4,0 % as acceptable.
A market-economy investor could not expect to be remunerated in the same way as for a cash injection. (148) The Commission does not believe that the entire refinancing interest rate has to be taken into account.
Overall, the Commission accepts that NordLB incurs additional "liquidity costs" to the extent of "refinancing costs minus corporation tax". (149) On the basis of the REX10 Performance Index of Deutsche Börse AG, the risk-free interest rate stood at 7,15 % at the end of 1991.
Germany stated that NordLB’s individual refinancing rate at 31 December 1991 was [...] %.
In the understanding the parties used a long-term risk-free rate of 7,15 %.
On this basis, they arrive at a net refinancing rate of 3,57 % and hence a corresponding deduction for liquidity. (150) In view of that understanding and the fact that the amounts in question still fall below the range previously cited by Germany, the Commission sees no reason to regard 3,57 % as inappropriate and consequently uses this rate as a basis for determining the aid element. (v) Return premium on account of the particularities of the transfer (151) In practice, when remuneration is determined, atypical circumstances which depart from a normal investment in the share capital of the company concerned generally give rise to discounts or premiums.
The parties to the understanding also regard a premium of 0,3 % as appropriate to take account of the failure to issue new voting rights. (153) The size of the amount transferred and its effect on NordLB from the point of view of the Solvency Directive have already been mentioned (paragraph 40 et seq.).
This question is not addressed in the understanding between the BdB, the Land and NordLB. (159) In its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty, the Commission quoted a rate of 0,3 % per annum (after tax) as having been indicated by Germany as the appropriate commission on a bank guarantee (Avalprovision) for a bank like NordLB.
It seems inappropriate to increase this remuneration on account of a particularly large "guarantee", given that the amount involved is around DEM 100 million.
For the same reasons that no premium was applied on the remuneration of the capital available for competitive business, it is also doubtful whether this rate can be increased on the grounds that the LTS promotion-related assets were, in principle, available to NordLB without restriction. (160) The guarantee premium counts as operating expenses for NordLB and hence reduces the taxable profit.
As with the refinancing costs, the Commission assumes a single overall tax rate of 50 %, in this case in NordLB’s favour.
This remuneration was first paid for 1992. (163) In addition to the remuneration of 0,5 % per annum after tax, Germany argues that there is a further remuneration component, namely the Land’s right to withdraw interest payments and amortisations that flow back to the LTS promotion-related assets, in so far as the market value of the assets exceeds DEM 1500 million. (164) The Commission believes that a market-economy investor would not have consented to receive remuneration from income that depended on the behaviour of the bank administering the promotion-related assets.
The Commission therefore takes the view that any synergy effects do not constitute remuneration paid by NordLB for the transfer of the LTS. (166) Lastly, the "owner effect" is not a reason to assume a remuneration of more than 0,5 % per annum.
Since NSGV has not made a corresponding capital contribution, the Land should therefore have insisted on comprehensive direct remuneration.

(170) The aid element for the period from the granting of the aid up to the end of 2003 amounts to DEM 923,82 million.
COMPATIBILITY OF THE MEASURE WITH THE EC TREATY (171) It can therefore be stated that the transfer of the LTS promotion-related assets is caught by all the criteria laid down in Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty and thus involves state aid within the meaning of that Article.
NordLB is not described as an undertaking in difficulty whose viability must be restored with the support of state aid. (176) Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty, which allows exemptions from the Treaty's state aid rules under certain conditions, is also applicable, in principle, to the financial services sector.
Rather, it was made in order to enable the Landesbank to increase its capital in the light of the new capital requirements under the Solvency Directive so as to avoid an otherwise necessary reduction in its business volume and to enable it to expand in future.
CONCLUSION (183) The Commission finds that Germany has unlawfully implemented the new aid in question in breach of Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty. (184) The aid cannot be found compatible with the common market either under Article 87(2) or (3) or under any other provision of the Treaty.
The difference between the appropriate remuneration of 6,76 % per annum (after corporation tax and before investor tax) and the remuneration of 0,5 % per annum (after corporation tax and before investor tax) agreed by Norddeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale and the Land of Lower Saxony for the part of the transferred capital which Norddeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale was able to use to underpin its competitive business as of 1 January 1992 constitutes aid which is incompatible with the common market. 2.
The waiver of an appropriate remuneration amounting to 0,15 % per annum (after corporation tax and before investor tax) for the part of the capital transferred to Norddeutsche Landesbank — Girozentrale which could be used as a guarantee as from 1 January 1992 constitutes aid which is incompatible with the common market. 3.
Germany shall discontinue the aid referred to in Article 1(1) and (2) by not later than 31 December 2004. 2.
The aid to be recovered and specified in Article 1(1) and (2) comprises: (a) the amount specified in Article 1(3) for the period from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 2003; (b) an amount determined in accordance with the methods of calculation referred to in Article 1(1) and (2) for the period from 1 January 2004 to the time at which the aid is discontinued.
Article 3 Recovery shall be effected without delay and in accordance with the procedures of national law, provided that they allow the immediate and effective execution of the Decision.
Article 5 This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.

However, the principal reasoning holds. [17] The situation does not change if one takes into account the possibility of raising additional own funds up to the same amount of original own funds (a factor of 25 instead of 12,5 for original own funds). [18] According to documents provided by Germany, the corporation tax rate was 46 % in 1992, plus a solidarity surcharge of 3,75 %, i.e. 49,75 % in total.
