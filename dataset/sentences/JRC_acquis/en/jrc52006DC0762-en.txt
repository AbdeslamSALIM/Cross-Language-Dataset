The latest Commission and ECB regular convergence reports, adopted in October 2004, covered the ten Member States that joined the EU in May 2004 and Sweden[1].
The present report covers the other nine Member States with a derogation: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden[3].
This Article requires that the reports include an examination of the compatibility of national legislation with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB.
In particular, the Member State shall not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central rate against any other Member State’s currency on its own initiative for the same period”.
The relevant two-year period for assessing exchange rate stability in this report is November 2004 to October 2006.
The convergence criterion dealing with the government budgetary position is defined in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty as “the sustainability of the government financial position: this will be apparent from having achieved a government budgetary position without a deficit that is excessive as determined in accordance with Article 104(6)”.
The interest rate reference value was calculated to be 6.2 percent in October 2006.
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in the Czech Republic was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
The Act on the Czech National Bank (CNB) has been amended several times in recent years, notably in 2005 and 2006.
However, the incompatibilities highlighted in the 2004 Convergence Report have not been addressed.
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption, legislation in the Czech Republic, in particular the Czech National Bank Act, is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Growth in import prices has been largely limited by a trend appreciation of the koruna exchange rate in nominal effective terms.
The average inflation rate in the Czech Republic during the 12 months to October 2006 was 2.2 percent, below the reference value of 2.8 percent, and is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead.
The Czech Republic fulfils the criterion on price stability.
The Czech Republic is at present subject to a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (Council decision of 5 July 2004)[5].
The Council recommended the Czech Republic to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2008 in a credible and sustainable manner.
The widening of the government deficit after 2000 was largely due to transition-related one-offs, notably connected to restructuring in the enterprise and banking sectors, and increasing social expenditures.
While the government debt ratio has increased substantially compared to 2000, it remains relatively low at around 30% of GDP.
The general government deficit was 3.6 percent of GDP in 2005, and government debt was 30.4 percent of GDP[6].
The Czech Republic does not fulfil the criterion on the government budgetary position.
The Czech koruna is not participating in ERM II.
The Czech Republic does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.
The average long-term interest rate in the Czech Republic in the year to October 2006 was 3.8 percent, below the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Average long-term interest rates in the Czech Republic have been below the reference value since accession to the EU.
Since early 2005, yields on Czech government bonds have closely mirrored those of the euro area, with spreads not exceeding 35 basis points.
The Czech Republic fulfils the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
Estonia In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Estonia fulfilled two of the convergence criteria (on price stability and the government budgetary position) and that there was no reason to conclude that Estonia would not fulfil the interest rate criterion.
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Estonia was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption, legislation in Estonia (in particular, the Eesti Pank Act, the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia as well as the Currency Law and the Law on the Security for Estonian kroon) was assessed as not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
A draft Act amending the Eesti Pank Act was submitted to the Riigikogu (Parliament) in September 2005 and adopted on 7 June 2006.
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption, Article 111 of Estonia's Constitution is not formally compatible with the requirements of the Treaty and the ESCB Statute.
HICP inflation in Estonia recorded a strong trend deceleration over the past decade, bottoming out at 1.4 percent in 2003.
However, inflation picked up to 3 percent in 2004 and to 4.1 percent in 2005, and has remained at high levels since then.
Estonia's 12-month average inflation has been above the reference value since September 2004.

Estonia does not fulfil the criterion on price stability.
Estonia is not subject to a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.
Between 2000 and 2005, Estonia recorded an average general government surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP.
This general government gross debt ratio stood at 4.5 percent of GDP in 2005, the lowest of all the EU Member States.
Estonia fulfils the criterion on the government budgetary position.
Estonia fulfils the exchange rate criterion.
As a result of Estonia's low level of government indebtedness, no benchmark long-term government bond or comparable security is available to assess the durability of convergence as reflected in long-term interest rates.
On the basis of developments in the interest rate indicator and taking into account, inter alia, the low level of government debt, there is no reason to conclude that Estonia would not fulfil the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
Estonia's current account deficit has exceeded 10 percent of GDP since 2002.
Cyprus In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Cyprus fulfilled two of the convergence criteria (on price stability and long-term interest rates).
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Cyprus was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
However, a draft Law amending the Central Bank of Cyprus Law of 2002 and 2003 was submitted to Parliament on 12 October 2006 in order to address these issues and to ensure full compatibility with the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Pending the adoption of the new draft Law, legislation in Cyprus, in particular the Central Bank of Cyprus Law, is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute as regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption.
Inflation picked up in early 2006, but has moderated in recent months, to 1.7 percent in October 2006.
The average inflation rate in Cyprus during the 12 months to October 2006 was 2.3 percent, below the reference value of 2.8 percent, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead.
Cyprus fulfils the criterion on price stability.
Cyprus is at present not the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit, the decision on the existence of such deficit in Cyprus adopted by the Council on 5 July 2004[9] having been abrogated by the Council decision of 11 July 2006[10].
The general government deficit peaked at 6.3 percent of GDP in 2003, but was reduced markedly in the following years, to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2005[11].
Government debt decreased to 69.2 percent of GDP in 2005.
Cyprus fulfils the criterion on the government budgetary position.
Before ERM II entry, the Central Bank of Cyprus had been operating a system to contain fluctuations against the euro within a relatively narrow band of ± 2¼ percent from the central rate.
Since ERM II entry, the pound has remained close to the central rate and has not experienced severe tensions.
Cyprus does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.
The average long-term interest rate in Cyprus in the year to October 2006 was 4.1 percent, below the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Low yield spreads vis-à-vis the euro area testify to the low residual country risk priced in by markets.
Cyprus fulfils the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Additional factors have been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
The Cypriot current account deficit has widened in recent years, reaching 5.7 percent of GDP in 2005.
Latvia In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Latvia fulfilled two of the convergence criteria (on the government budgetary position and long-term interest rates).
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Latvia was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
The Law on the Bank of Latvia has been amended twice since the adoption of the 2004 Convergence Report (December 2005 and June 2006).
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption, legislation in Latvia, in particular the Law on the Bank of Latvia, is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Annual average inflation in Latvia has been mostly above 6 percent since 2004, reflecting the impact of external price shocks and adjustments in administered prices and indirect taxes as well as increasing capacity constraints in a context of prolonged very rapid real GDP growth.
The average inflation rate in Latvia during the 12 months to October 2006 was 6.7 percent, above the reference value of 2.8 percent, and it is likely to remain above the reference value in the months ahead.
Latvia does not fulfil the criterion on price stability.
At the same time, the tax burden on the economy continued to decline, from 32 percent of GDP in 1999 to 29 percent in 2005.
The general government position was balanced in 2005 and government debt was 12.1 percent of GDP[12].
Latvia fulfils the criterion on the government budgetary position.
Upon ERM II entry, Latvia unilaterally committed to maintain the lats in a range of ± 1 percent around the central rate.
Since ERM II entry, the lats has remained close to the central rate and has not experienced severe tensions.
Additional indicators, such as developments in short-term interest rates and foreign exchange reserves, do not point to pressures on the exchange rate.
Latvia does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.

Hungary In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Hungary fulfilled none of the convergence criteria.
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Hungary was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
The amendments did not however remove the incompatibilities raised in the 2004 Convergence Report.
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption as well as the prohibition of monetary financing, legislation in Hungary (in particular, the Magyar Nemzeti Bank Act, the Constitution Act and the Credit Institutions Act) is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
After declining from around 10 percent in the early-2000s to around 4 percent in 2003, HICP inflation picked up again in 2004, mainly due to increases in the prices of energy and food.
Inflation is expected to accelerate further due to the carry-over effects of several measures implemented in the course of 2006 as well as significant increases in administered prices and indirect taxes foreseen for 2007.
The average inflation rate in Hungary during the 12 months to October 2006 was 3.5 percent, above the reference value of 2.8 percent, and it is likely to remain above the reference value in the months ahead.
Hungary does not fulfil the criterion on price stability.
Hungary is at present the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (Council decision of 5 July 2004)[13].
The Council recommended Hungary to take action in a medium-term framework in order to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2008 in a credible and sustainable manner.
On 1 September 2006, Hungary presented an adjusted convergence programme on the basis of which, on 9 October 2006, the Council granted Hungary an additional year to correct its deficit (until 2009).
Hungary does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.
The average long-term interest rate in Hungary in the year to October 2006 was 7.1 percent, above the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Average long-term interest rates in Hungary have been above the reference value since EU accession.
Bond yield spreads with the euro area widened from a level of around 280 basis points in June 2006 to approximately 350 basis points in August 2006, and to around 375 basis points in October 2006.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
The current account deficit declined from a peak of 8.5 percent of GDP in 2004 to 6.8 percent of GDP in 2005, as a result of a smaller deficit in goods and services trade.
Malta In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Malta fulfilled one of the convergence criteria (on long-term interest rates).
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Malta was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Although the Central Bank of Malta Act was amended twice in 2005, the amending acts did not remove all the incompatibilities highlighted in the 2004 Convergence Report.
A new draft Act amending the Central Bank of Malta Act was submitted to Parliament on 13 November 2006 in order to address the remaining issues and to ensure full compatibility with the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Pending the adoption of the new draft Act, legislation in Malta, in particular the Central Bank of Malta Act, is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute as regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption.
HICP inflation in Malta has fluctuated around a level of some 2.5 percent over recent years, with some volatility, primarily due to the fact that Malta is an open economy vulnerable to external shocks (particularly in food and energy prices), and to changes in indirect taxes.
Inflation picked up considerably in autumn 2005, mainly reflecting a sharp rise in regulated prices for energy and related products.
The average inflation rate in Malta during the 12 months to October 2006 was 3.1 percent, above the reference value of 2.8 percent, and it is likely to return to a position close to the reference value in the months ahead.
Malta does not fulfil the criterion on price stability.
Malta is at present the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (Council decision of 5 July 2004)[15].
The Council recommended Malta to take action in a medium-term framework in order to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2006 in a credible and sustainable manner.
Malta's general government deficit has fluctuated at relatively high levels over the past years (including due to one-off operations), reaching a high of around 10 percent of GDP in 2003 and decreasing in the following years in the context of the government's fiscal consolidation programme.
The revenue ratio has followed an upward trend, whilst expenditure increased until 2003 but decreased thereafter.
General government debt increased significantly in the first half of the decade, peaking at around 75 percent in 2004.
The general government deficit was 3.2 percent of GDP in 2005 and government debt decreased slightly to 74.2 percent of GDP[16].
Malta does not fulfil the criterion on the government budgetary position.
During ERM II participation, the lira has remained stable vis-à-vis the central rate and has not experienced severe tensions.
Malta does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.
The average long-term interest rate in Malta in the year to October 2006 was 4.3 percent, below the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Average long-term interest rates in Malta have been below the reference value since EU accession.
Long-term yield spreads vis-à-vis the euro area have fluctuated at relatively moderate levels over the past years, hovering around 50 basis points in autumn 2006.
Malta fulfils the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
In particular, trade and FDI relations with other Member States are extensive and Malta’s financial system is substantially inter-linked with the financial systems of other countries, both in and outside the EU, via the establishment of financial intermediaries and the provision of cross-border services.
Malta's current account balance has been rather volatile over the past years, reflecting the small size and narrow sectoral base of the economy.
The current account deficit has increased significantly in recent years, reaching a level of 10.6 percent of GDP in 2005.
This increase reflected difficult market conditions in the dominant electronics and tourism sectors and, in 2005, a strong increase in the oil bill.
Poland In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Poland fulfilled none of the convergence criteria.
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Poland was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Amendments were made to the Act on the National Bank of Poland in 2004 and 2006, although none of them address the incompatibilities highlighted in the 2004 Convergence Report.
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption and the prohibition of monetary financing, legislation in Poland (in particular, the Act on the National Bank of Poland, the Constitution of Poland and the Law on the Bank Guarantee Fund) is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
Following high and volatile inflation in the 1990s, HICP inflation in Poland has decreased sharply to a very low level, averaging 2.1 percent over the period 2002-2005.
Growth in import prices has decelerated substantially since 2004, notably reflecting the appreciation of the zloty's nominal exchange rate in effective terms.
A slight pick-up in inflation from the current low level is expected on the back of improved cyclical conditions and planned increases in indirect taxes in the course of 2007-2008.
The average inflation rate in Poland during the 12 months to October 2006 was 1.2 percent, below the reference value of 2.8 percent, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead.
Poland fulfils the criterion on price stability.
Poland is at present the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (Council decision of 5 July 2004)[17].
The Council recommended Poland to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2007 in a credible and sustainable manner.
On 28 November 2006, the Council decided that the action taken by Poland in response to its recommendations of July 2004 was proving to be inadequate.
The general government balance was negative during the period 2000-2005, recording a deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP on average.
The general government debt ratio increased by around 6 percentage points between 2000 and 2005.
Poland does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.
The average long-term interest rate in Poland in the year to October 2006 was 5.2 percent, below the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Average long-term interest rates in Poland have been at or below the reference value since August 2005.
Polish long-term interest rates have fluctuated over the past years reflecting notably shifts in the inflation outlook and monetary policy stance as well as changes in market sentiment that impacted on country risk premia.
Spreads narrowed to around 100 basis points in spring 2006, but widened again to above 150 basis points in the summer.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
Poland's current account deficit temporarily widened to just above 4 percent of GDP in 2004, largely due to a surge in the income deficit which primarily reflected robust profits from FDI, but declined to 1.7 percent of GDP in 2005.
Slovakia In the 2004 Convergence Report, the Commission assessment was that Slovakia fulfilled one of the convergence criteria (on long-term interest rates).
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Slovakia was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
The Act on the National Bank of Slovakia was amended in 2004 and in 2005, without however addressing the incompatibilities highlighted in the 2004 Convergence Report.
As regards central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption as well as the prohibition of monetary financing, legislation in Slovakia (in particular, the Act on the National Bank of Slovakia and the Law on the Protection of Bank Deposits) is not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
The koruna's trend exchange rate appreciation in 2002-2005 exerted a moderating effect on inflation.
The average inflation rate in Slovakia during the 12 months to October 2006 was 4.3 percent, above the reference value of 2.8 percent, and it is likely to remain above the reference value in the months ahead.
Slovakia does not fulfil the criterion on price stability.
Slovakia is at present the subject of a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit (Council decision of 5 July 2004)[20].
The Council recommended Slovakia to take action in a medium-term framework in order to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2007 in a credible and sustainable manner.
The general government deficit was 3.1 percent of GDP in 2005, while government debt was 34.5 percent of GDP[21].
Slovakia does not fulfil the criterion on the government budgetary position.
The Slovak koruna has participated in ERM II since 28 November 2005, i.e.
Since ERM II entry, the koruna has remained above the central rate except for a limited period in the summer of 2006 when post-election uncertainty about the euro adoption date and fiscal uncertainties combined with broader pressures on the central European currencies led to significant downward pressures, which were countered by central bank action.
Slovakia does not fulfil the exchange rate criterion.
The average long-term interest rate in Slovakia in the year to October 2006 was 4.3 percent, below the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Average long-term interest rates in Slovakia have been below the reference value since EU accession.
The spread vis-à-vis euro area long-term benchmark bonds had been declining markedly since the adoption of the government's reform programme in 2002 and had become negative for several months in 2005, before turning positive again in 2006 in response to a pick-up in inflation and subsequent hikes in the key policy rates.
Slovakia fulfils the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments developments.
Slovakia's current account balance has been highly volatile in recent years reflecting swings in export performance driven by new FDI-related production capacities, in particular in the automotive sector.
Following a substantial improvement in 2003, the current account deficit widened to 8.6 percent of GDP in 2005.
The assessment on legal convergence concluded that legislation in Sweden was not fully compatible with Article 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
The Riksbank Act was amended in 2004 and 2006, without however addressing the incompatibilities highlighted in the 2004 Convergence Report.
Moreover, incompatibilities have been identified in the Law on the Exchange Rate Policy.
As regards central bank financial independence as well as central bank integration into the ESCB at the time of euro adoption, legislation in Sweden, in particular the Sveriges Riksbank Act, the Instrument of Government (the country’s Constitution) and the Law on the Exchange Rate Policy, is not fully compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the ESCB/ECB Statute.
A gradual pass-through of the strengthening of the krona exchange rate between 2002 and 2004 and the disinflationary impact of international competition and globalisation on the prices of imported manufactured goods have also contributed to low inflation.
Sweden fulfils the criterion on price stability.
In 2005, the surplus stood at 3.0 percent of GDP.
The Swedish krona is not participating in ERM II.
Apart from a rapid depreciation of the exchange rate immediately after abandoning a fixed exchange rate system in 1992, the krona/euro exchange rate has mostly moved in a relatively narrow range vis-à-vis the Deutsche mark and subsequently the euro.
Between November 2004 and October 2006, the krona depreciated against the euro by just below 3 percent.
The average long-term interest rate in Sweden in the year to October 2006 was 3.7 percent, below the reference value of 6.2 percent.
Average long-term interest rates in Sweden have consistently been below the reference value in recent years.
The spread vis-à-vis euro area long-term interest rates declined markedly since 2003, from around 50 basis points to currently minus 10 basis points, reflecting among other things a negative policy rate differential vis-à-vis the euro area.
Additional factors have also been examined, including product and financial market integration and balance of payments development.
Until these Member States indicate that they wish to participate in the third stage and join the single currency, they are not the subject of an assessment by the Council as to whether they fulfil the necessary conditions for euro adoption.

During this period, which will expire with the first fiscal notification of 2007, Poland can record revenues and expenditures incurred by funded pension schemes within the government sector, resulting in a lower general government deficit. [19] For 2006, the Commission services' autumn forecast projects a general government deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP (the figure excluding the mandatory funded pension scheme would be 4.2 percent of GDP). [20] Decision 2005/182/EC - OJ L 62, 9.3.2005, pp. 16-17. [21] For 2006, the Commission services' autumn forecast projects a general government deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP.
