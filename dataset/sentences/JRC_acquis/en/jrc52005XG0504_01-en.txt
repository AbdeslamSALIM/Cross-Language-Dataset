On 26 June 1997 the EU Programme for Preventing and Combating Illicit Trafficking in Conventional Arms was adopted by the General Affairs Council of the European Union, and on 12 July 2002 the European Council adopted a Joint Action on the European Union's contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons repealing Joint Action 1999/34/CFSP. 2.
In pursuing the objectives of the Joint Action, the EU played an active role at the UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (New York, 9 to 20 July 2001), ending with the adoption of a UN Programme of Action, as well as at the first biennial meeting held in New York from 7 to 11 July 2003.
The EU also has actively participated in the negotiations of the Protocol Against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 31 May 2001.
The EU has also fully participated in the meeting of the Open-ended working group on tracing of small arms and light weapons held in New York from 14 to 25 June 2004. 4.
The European Union adopted Common Position 2003/468/CFSP of 23 June 2003 on the control of arms brokering, which requires Member States to introduce ad hoc legislation in order to effectively control the activities of brokers. 5.
With its Law of 26 March 2003 (published on 7 July 2003) on the strengthening of the rules regarding the granting of export or transit licences, Belgium has incorporated into its national legislation the rules and operational provisions of the European Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.
From that point onwards, any application for an export or transit licence will be rejected having regard to the country of destination if it turns out in particular that: - exportation or transit will contribute to flagrant violation of human rights, - there is a clear risk that the outcome of the exportation will assist internal repression or if it is established that child soldiers are aligned with the regular armed forces, - the country is supporting or encouraging international organised crime and terrorism, - there is a serious risk of misuse of the equipment within the country of destination or a country has shown that it is not complying with the non-re-exportation clause. 14.
In effect, Article 10 of this Law amending the Law of 5 August on the importation, exportation and transit of arms, munitions and material specifically intended for military use and related technology, it lays down that: - no Belgian citizen or foreigner residing or trading in Belgium may negotiate, export or supply abroad or hold for that purpose, arms, munitions or equipment specifically intended for military use or related technology, or act as intermediary in such transactions without having for this purpose a licence issued by the Minister for Justice, - an intermediary shall be considered to be any person who, for payment or free of charge, sets up conditions with a view to the conclusion of a contract for the purpose of negotiating, exporting or supplying abroad, or holding for that purpose, weapons, munitions or material specifically intended for military use or related technology, whatever the origin or destination of the goods and irrespective of whether or not they enter Belgian territory, or any person who concludes such a contract where the transport is carried out by a third party.
The Firearms and Ammunition Act No 24/2004, which took effect on 1 May 2004 is based on and fully in line with the principles and provisions laid out in Council Directives 91/477/EEC and 93/15/EEC, and Commission Recommendations 93/216/EEC and 96/129/EC. 30.
Exports of firearms to all countries are also subject to the Control of Exports Act, 1983 and Orders made thereunder, and to the international obligations and responsibilities derived from membership of the UN, EU, OSCE and other entities which involve regulation of exports, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement.
Concerning the export of arms for military use, in 2003 Italy's relevant provisions of Law No 185/1990 have been modified by Law No 148 (adopted on 17 June 2003) as follows: - the required export authorisation (Articles 11 to 15 of Law No 185/1990) can be replaced by a "global licence of project", issued for a single operator.
Those agreements must also have provisions similar to those set forth in the Framework Agreement between France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom concerning measures to facilitate the restructuring and activities of the European defence industry, which took place at Farnborough on 27 July 2000, - with the same global licence of project, it may be authorised the supply of military items, developed or produced in the framework of joint programmes, to the abovementioned countries for national military use, - the global licence of project has a maximum validity of three years and can be extended, - the request for a global licence of project should include: (a) a description of the joint programme indicating the military item to be produced; (b) the indication of companies, where already identified, in the exporting or importing country.
In addition, in 2003 and in 2004 a number of normative acts were passed pursuant to this Law, strictly regulating the circulation of arms in Latvia, namely, Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No 167 of 15 April 2004, "Procedure for a common register of firearms and heavy pneumatic weapons", which provides the procedure for maintaining a common register of firearms and heavy pneumatic weapons of physical and legal persons in the Republic of Latvia (It should be noted that these Regulations do not apply to weapons of the national armed forces) and Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No 538 of 23 September 2003, "Regulations for Classification and use of weapons, ammunition, special devices, explosives, explosives equipment and pyrotechnic products".
Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No 647 of 11 November 2003, 'Regulations for the purchase, registration, recording, storage, transport, shipment, carrying, sale and collection of arms, ammunition and gas pistols (revolvers), as well as Regulations for Presentations' are also important elements of Latvia's export controls legislation. 36.
A new Law on the Control of arms and ammunition which was prepared in Lithuania in compliance with the Directive 91/477/EEC on the control of arms and ammunition, entered into force on 1 July 2003.
Currently, the "Law of 15 March 1983 on arms and munitions", as well as the Regulation of the Grand Duchy of 31 October 1995 relating to importation, exportation and transit of arms, munitions and equipment specifically intended for military use and related technology, constitutes the relevant legal basis in this area.
In addition, brokering activities related to the transfer of arms and weapons between Malta and any other country are controlled by the Military Equipment (Export Control) (Amendment) Regulations (Legal Notice 376 of 2003).
In addition, the transfer of arms and ammunition between Member States of the European Union is controlled in Malta by the Firearms and Ammunition (Movement in Member States and other Matters) Regulations (Legal Notice 56 of 2004).

Act No 190/2003 on Firearms and Ammunition together with two Decrees of the Ministry of Interior No 555/2003 and No 208/2004 are based on and fully in line with the principles and provisions set in Council Directives 91/477 EEC and 93/15/EEC, and Commission Recommendations 93/216/EEC and 96/129/EC.
