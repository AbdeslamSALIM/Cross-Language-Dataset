Amendment 3, 4 to 8, 12, 14 and 18: in order to ensure legal security and especially to have equal treatment of persons entering or leaving the Community with large sums of cash, the Council and the Commission prefer a single mandatory approach; rather than the EP amendments which offers Member States the possibility to use either a mandatory declaration or a system based on disclosure upon request of the competent authorities.
The threshold for making a declaration was lowered from € 15 000 to € 10 000.
The Commission can accept this. 4.
