This Directive shall not apply to: (a) foodstuffs exposed to ionising radiation generated by measuring or inspection devices, provided that the dose absorbed is not greater than 0,01 Gy for inspection devices which utilise neutrons and 0,5 Gy in other cases, at a maximum radiation energy level of 10 MeV in the case of X-rays, 14 MeV in the case of neutrons and 5 MeV in other cases; (b) the irradiation of foodstuffs which are prepared for patients requiring sterile diets under medical supervision.
Article 2 Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that irradiated foodstuffs can be placed on the market only if they comply with the provisions of this Directive.
At the latest 31 December 2000, the Commission shall, in accordance with Article 100a of the Treaty, submit a proposal intended to complete the positive list provided for in paragraph 1. 4.
Until entry into force of the Directive adopted on the basis of the proposal referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 3, any Member State may also authorise the treatment of foodstuffs for which authorisations have been maintained by another Member State in accordance with paragraph 4, where the conditions referred to in paragraph 4 are fulfilled. 6.
Member States shall forthwith notify the Commission and the other Member States of authorisations maintained under paragraph 4 or granted under paragraph 5 and of conditions attaching to them.
The records referred to in paragraph 1 must be kept for a period of five years. 3.
For the purpose of drawing up this list, the Commission may instruct experts to carry out, under its authority, evaluations and inspections of irradiation facilities in third countries in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 93/99/EEC.
Article 10 Materials used for packaging foodstuffs to be irradiated must be suitable for the purpose.
Article 11 Amendments to the Annexes to take account of scientific and technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 100a of the Treaty.
Article 13 The Scientific Committee for Food shall be consulted on any matter falling within the scope of this Directive likely to have an effect on public health.
The Commission shall examine the grounds referred to in paragraph 1 as soon as possible within the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs; it shall take the appropriate measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12.
Article 16 This Directive shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 17 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

DOSIMETRY Overall average absorbed dose It can be assumed for the purpose of the determination of the wholesomeness of foodstuffs treated with an overall average dose of 10 kGy or less that all radiation chemical effects in that particular dose range are proportional to the dose.
The overall average dose, %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% FD%gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% , is defined by the following integral over the total volume of the goods: %gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% FD%gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% = %gt%NUM%gt%1 %gt%DEN%gt%M %amp%int; p (x,y,z) d (x,y,z) dV where %gt%TABLE%gt% The overall average absorbed dose can be determined directly for homogenous products or for bulk goods of homogenous apparent density by distributing an adequate number of dosimeters strategically and at random throughout the volume of the goods.
PROCEDURES 2.1.
The reference position should be located at a convenient point in or on the product, where dose variations are low. 2.4.
STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION Recital 17 The Commission stresses that, once the new decision on the reform of the committee procedure has been adopted, it will propose to the legislator that the provisions governing committees in all previous acts should be adjusted to bring them into line with the new 'committee procedure` decision.
