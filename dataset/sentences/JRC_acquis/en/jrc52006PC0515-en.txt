BACKGROUND Date of transmission of the proposal to the EP and the Council(COM(2004)0142 – C6-0002/2004 – 2004/0048(COD) | 4 March 2004 | Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 9 February 2005 | Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading: | 28 September 2005 | Date of adoption of the common position: | 14 September 2006 | 2.
Of the 45 amendments adopted by the European Parliament on first reading, the Commission was able to accept 25 as such or with drafting amendments (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 42, 44 and 46).
It was able accept 11 in principle (5, 17, 21, 22, 23, 35, 37, 40, 41, 43 and 47) and one in part (2).
The Commission considered that 8 amendments were not acceptable (15, 24, 25, 26, 32, 38, 39 and 45).
The Council found that a significant number of objectives pursued by the EP were already taken into account in its common position, and took over certain amendments in their entirety (27, 36 and 44). 4.
DETAILED COMMISSION COMMENTS 4.1.
Article 16 of the Council’s common position has been recast in order to achieve a fair balance between the provisions to be included in the body of the text and those to be included in the annexes.
Amendments accepted by the Commission, but not incorporated in the common position - Amendment 2 : the Commission could only support this amendment in part: the text concerning the agreement on “working conditions of mobile staff engaged in cross-border services” is unacceptable since the Commission proposal does not concern working time and rest periods. - Amendments 3 and 4 : these amendments specify the objectives to be achieved and were acceptable to the Commission. - Amendments 5 and 37 : with regard to the role of the social partners, the Commission had indicated that it was necessary to differentiate between the TSIs (technical specifications for interoperability), which are technical requirements formulated by the European Railway Agency in accordance with the directives in force concerning interoperability and the Regulation establishing the Agency, and annexes to a directive which are subject to the co-decision procedure or, by delegation of responsibilities, to the Committee procedure.
It should be noted that not only did the Council not take over these amendments, it also restricted the application of the directive to drivers. - Amendment 14 : this is the logical consequence of simplifying the categories.
The new text of Article 34 makes it possible to take account of the various requirements: the need to set up registers before starting to certify drivers, the need to take account of existing drivers, and the need to take account of drivers undergoing training when the directive enters into force, etc. - Amendment 43 : the proposed amendment concerning the verification of physical fitness, as set out in Annex III 3.2, subparagraph 1, can be accepted as to the principle. 4.3.
Amendments rejected by the Commission and not incorporated in the common position - Amendment 15 : the term “period checks” is preferred in order to clearly indicate that, to keep the licence and complementary certificate, drivers must regularly undergo certain tests on safety grounds. - Amendments 24 and 25 : The terms “occupational physician” and “transport psychologist” are interpreted differently in different Member States.
The Commission is therefore unable to take up these amendments. - Amendment 26 : the purpose of this amendment is unclear.
The text of the common position is more precisely worded than the original proposal (see Articles 20 and 23) and may be to the EP’s satisfaction on this point. - Amendment 32 : Despite the fact that in principle the proposal appears to protect the investment made by an employer for training a driver, there are several problems here.
If a driver leaves as a result of the employer’s fault, why should another undertaking be required to pay for the training? - Amendment 39 : once the legislation has been adopted, it will be necessary to allow the Member States sufficient time to transpose the directive and amend their own national legislation accordingly.
A period of less than two years is considered to be unrealistic in this connection. - Amendment 45 : where safety is concerned, it should be stressed that, to obtain a harmonised complementary certificate in another Member State, a driver will have to undergo suitable training to acquire knowledge of the infrastructure, operating rules and language, and then be tested by an examiner accredited or recognised by the safety authority of the country in which the driver wishes to drive.
Amendments rejected by the Commission but incorporated in the common position - Amendment 38 : this amendment concerns the report to be drawn up by the Agency on the application of the directive.
