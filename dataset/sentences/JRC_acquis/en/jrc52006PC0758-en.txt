In accordance with Article 13 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the Dutch authorities received a notification (Reference C/NL/04/02) concerning the placing on the market of a carnation ( Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) genetically modified for flower colour. 2.
The notification covers import, distribution and retailing of Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38 as for any other carnation in the Community. 3.
In accordance with Article 14 of the Directive, the Dutch competent authority forwarded to the Commission its assessment report of the notification, which concluded that the genetically modified carnation ( Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) should be placed on the market for import, distribution and retailing as for any other carnation. 4.
A draft of the measures to be taken was submitted, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Decision 1999/468/EC, for opinion, to the Committee set up under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC. 8.
The Committee, consulted on 18 September 2006, has not delivered an opinion.

That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.2.38) for ornamental use should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled. (5) The competent authorities of certain Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.
