If the relevant requirements are satisfied, EC type-approval pursuant to Article 4 (3) and, if applicable, Article 4 (4) of Directive 70/156/EEC shall be granted. 4.2.
SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
Any vehicle in one of the categories M1, M2, M3, N1, O1 or O2 (3) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in 5.1: - if it satisfies the conditions set out in 5.3, or - if the ground clearance of the rear part of the unladen vehicle does not exceed 55 cm over a width which is not shorter than that of the rear axle by more than 10 cm on either side (excluding any tyre bulging close to the ground).
This requirement must be satisfied at least on a line at a distance of not more than 45 cm from the rear extremity of the vehicle. 5.3.
Any vehicle in one of the categories N2, N3, O3 or O4 (4) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in 5.1 provided that: - the vehicle is equipped with a special rear underrun protective device in accordance with the requirements of 5.4, or - the vehicle is so designed and/or equipped at the rear that, by virtue of their shape and characteristics, its component parts can be regarded as replacing the rear underrun protective device.
When the vehicle is unladen (5) the lower edge of the device must at no point be more than 55 cm above the ground; 5.4.2.
the width of the device must at no point exceed the width of the rear axle measured at the outermost points of the wheels, excluding the bulging of the tyres close to the ground, nor must it be more than 10 cm shorter on either side.
the section height of the cross-member must be not less than 10 cm.
It must be possible for the operator to vary the position of the device by applying a force not exceeding 40 daN; 5.4.5.
This requirement will be satisfied if it is shown that both during and after the application the horizontal distance between the rear of the device and the rear extremity of the vehicle does not exceed 40 cm at any of the points P1, P2 and P3.
The height must not, however, exceed 60 cm when the vehicle is unladen.
a horizontal force corresponding to 12,5 % of the maximum technically permissible mass of the vehicle but not exceeding 2,5 × 104N must be applied successively to both points P1 and to point P3; 5.4.5.3.
a horizontal force corresponding to 50 % of the maximum technically permissible mass of the vehicle but not exceeding 10 × 104 N must be applied successively to both points P2; 5.4.5.4.
the forces specified in 5.4.5.2 and 5.4.5.3 above must be applied separately.
EC TYPE-APPROVAL MARKING 6.1.
Every rear underrun protective device conforming to the type approved pursuant to this Directive as a separate technical unit shall bear an EC type-approval mark. 6.2.
