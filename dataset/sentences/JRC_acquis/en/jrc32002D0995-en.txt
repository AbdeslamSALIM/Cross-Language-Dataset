However, in accordance with Article 2, the provisions of the Decision apply without prejudice to the exemptions referred to in Article 16 of Directive 97/78/EC. (8) Those provisions together lay down a derogation from the Community rules for protecting animal health for small quantities of products of animal origin carried as personal luggage, or introduced under similar circumstances, by private individuals when entering the Community. (9) In 1996 outbreaks of classical swine fever were reported in Germany which subsequently led to an epidemic in the Netherlands.
They suggest amongst other things awareness campaigns at frontier points and reinforced controls on the luggage of travellers. (11) In 2001 a major epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease was reported in the United Kingdom, which also affected three other Member States.
However, without prejudice to Articles 20 and 22 of Directive 97/78/EC, and derogating from the requirements for veterinary certification, these controls shall not apply to: (a) products listed in Annex I; (b) products entering the Community from Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Andorra, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus, when carried by travellers by hand or in their luggage for their personal consumption, taking into account the nature of the product and the quantity thereof that could reasonably be consumed by an individual.
The information shall include at least the information provided for in Annex II, displayed by prominent notices placed in easily visible locations. 2.
