For type approval testing to either row B1 or B2 or row C of the tables in section 6.2.1 the emissions shall be determined on the ESC, ELR and ETC tests.
The ESC and ELR test procedures are described in Annex III, Appendix 1, the ETC test procedure in Annex III, Appendices 2 and 3.
Annex V describes the recommended analytical systems for the gaseous pollutants, the recommended particulate sampling systems, and the recommended smoke measurement system.
Table 1 Limit values - ESC and ELR tests %gt%TABLE%gt% For diesel engines that are additionally tested on the ETC test, and specifically for gas engines, the specific masses of the carbon monoxide, of the non-methane hydrocarbons, of the methane (where applicable), of the oxides of nitrogen and of the particulates (where applicable) shall not exceed the amounts shown in Table 2.

In the event that two or more engines share this primary criteria, the parent engine shall be selected using the secondary criteria of highest fuel delivery per stroke at rated speed.
Thus, the approval authority may select an additional engine for test based upon features which indicate that it may have the highest emission level of the engines within that family. 9.
PRODUCTION CONFORMITY 9.1.
Sections 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 of Annex X to Directive 70/156/EEC are applicable where the competent authorities are not satisfied with the auditing procedure of the manufacturer. 9.1.1.
Engines that are subject to testing only on the ESC and ELR tests or only on the ETC test for type approval to row A of the tables in section 6.2.1 are subject to those applicable tests for the checking of production conformity.
With the agreement of the authority, all other engines type approved to row A, B1 or B2, or C of the tables in section 6.2.1 are subjected to testing either on the ESC and ELR cycles or on the ETC cycle for the checking of the production conformity.
However, at the request of the manufacturer, the tests may be carried out on diesel or gas engines which have been run-in more than the period referred to in section 9.1.1.2, up to a maximum of 100 hours.
This implies tests, as described in section 4 of this Annex, with at least two of the reference fuels for each gas engine. 9.1.1.2.4.
This implies tests, as described in section 4 of this Annex, with at least two of the reference fuels for each gas engine. 9.1.1.2.5.

EXHAUST GAS DILUTION AND DETERMINATION OF THE PARTICULATES 2.1.
Introduction Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 and figures 11 to 22 contain detailed descriptions of the recommended dilution and sampling systems.
Partial Flow Dilution System A dilution system is described in figures 11 to 19 based upon the dilution of a part of the exhaust stream.
Flow controlled systems with concentration measurement (Figures 13 to 17) With these systems, a sample is taken from the bulk exhaust stream by adjusting the dilution air flow and the total dilute exhaust flow.
Flow controlled systems with flow measurement (Figures 18, 19) With these systems, a sample is taken from the bulk exhaust stream by setting the dilution air flow and the total dilute exhaust flow.
Accurate calibration of the flow meters relative to one another is required, since the relative magnitude of the two flow rates can lead to signicicant errors at higher dilution ratios (of 15 and above).
Figure 11 Partial flow dilution system with isokinetic probe and fractional sampling (SB control) %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000044EN.011701.TIF%quot%%gt% Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the transfer tube TT by the isokinetic sampling probe ISP.
The differential pressure of the exhaust gas between exhaust pipe and inlet to the probe is measured with the pressure transducer DPT.
This signal is transmitted to the flow controller FC1 that controls the suction blower SB to maintain a differential pressure of zero at the tip of the probe.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical, and the flow through ISP and TT is a constant fraction (split) of the exhaust gas flow.
Figure 12 Partial flow dilution system with isokinetic probe and fractional sampling (PB control) %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000044EN.011702.TIF%quot%%gt% Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the transfer tube TT by the isokinetic sampling probe ISP.
The differential pressure of the exhaust gas between exhaust pipe and inlet to the probe is measured with the pressure transducer DPT.
Under these conditions, exhaust gas velocities in EP and ISP are identical, and the flow through ISP and TT is a constant fraction (split) of the exhaust gas flow.
Figure 13 Partial flow dilution system with CO2 or NOx concentration measurement and fractional sampling %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000044EN.011801.TIF%quot%%gt% Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the sampling probe SP and the transfer tube TT.
The concentrations of a tracer gas (CO2 or NOx) are measured in the raw and diluted exhaust gas as well as in the dilution air with the exhaust gas analyser(s) EGA.
These signals are transmitted to the flow controller FC2 that controls either the pressure blower PB or the suction blower SB to maintain the desired exhaust split and dilution ratio in DT.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the tracer gas concentrations in the raw exhaust gas, the diluted exhaust gas, and the dilution air.
Figure 14 Partial flow dilution system with CO2 concentration measurement, carbon balance and total sampling %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000044EN.011802.TIF%quot%%gt% Raw exhaust gas is transferred from the exhaust pipe EP to the dilution tunnel DT through the sampling probe SP and the transfer tube TT.
The CO2 concentrations are measured in the diluted exhaust gas and in the dilution air with the exhaust gas analyser(s) EGA.
The CO2 and fuel flow GFUEL signals are transmitted either to the flow controller FC2, or to the flow controller FC3 of the particulate sampling system (see Figure 21).
FC2 controls the pressure blower PB, FC3 the sampling pump P (see Figure 21), thereby adjusting the flows into and out of the system so as to maintain the desired exhaust split and dilution ratio in DT.
The dilution ratio is calculated from the CO2 concentrations and GFUEL using the carbon balance assumption.

It is recommended that the opacimeter manufacturer provide the final Bessel filter constants for different sampling rates and that the customer use these constants for designing the Bessel algorithm and for calculating the smoke values. 2.1.
Therefore, a Bessel filter has to be created in such a way, that the filter response time (tF) together with the physical (tp) and electrical response time (te) of the individual opacimeter must result in the required overall response time (tAver).
Since tp and te are given values for each individual opacimeter, and tAver is defined to be 1,0 s in this Directive, tF can be calculated as follows: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% By definition, the filter response time tF is the rise time of a filtered output signal between 10 % and 90 % on a step input signal.

The scheme of the iteration procedure is presented below. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2000044EN.014201.TIF%quot%%gt% 2.2.
For determining the times of 10 % (t10) and 90 % (t90) of the output signal, a Bessel filter has to be applied to a step input using the above values of fc, E and K.
