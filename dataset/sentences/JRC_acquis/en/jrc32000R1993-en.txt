PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2000(2) (hereinafter referred to as %quot%the provisional duty Regulation%quot%) provisional anti-dumping duties were imposed on imports into the Community of styrene-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic rubber (hereinafter referred to as %quot%SBS%quot%) falling within CN codes ex 4002 19 00 and ex 4002 99 and originating in Taiwan. (2) As a result of a parallel anti-subsidy investigation, provisional countervailing duties were imposed under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1092/2000(3) on imports into the Community of SBS originating in Taiwan.
PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT (8) The product concerned is styrene-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic rubber, which is currently classifiable within CN codes ex40021900 and ex 4002 99. (9) One Community importer claimed that SBS imported from Taiwan has a different fluidity and resistance than SBS produced in the Community.
The investigation also showed that, although the quality of imports of SBS from Taiwan may have been lower for one company during the years 1995 and 1996 when this company started its production of SBS, the quality quickly attained a level comparable to the quality of SBS produced in the Community.
It is therefore concluded that dry and oil-extended SBS should be considered as one distinct product for the purpose of this investigation. (12) As no other arguments were presented, the findings set out in recitals 13 to 16 of the provisional duty Regulation are hereby confirmed.
An average calculation would thus not reflect the full degree of dumping, in the sense of Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. (15) The provisional findings as described in recital 25 of the provisional duty Regulation are therefore confirmed. (16) The definitive dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the cif import price at the Community border duty unpaid are the following: %gt%TABLE%gt% E.
Definition of the Community industry (17) Since no comments were received regarding the definition of the Community industry, the conclusions of recitals 31 and 32 of the provisional duty Regulation are hereby confirmed. 2.
Consumption in the Community (18) Since no comments were received on consumption in the Community, its assessment as indicated in recital 33 of the provisional duty Regulation is hereby confirmed. 3.
Economic situation of the Community industry (23) One Community importer pointed out that stocks and profitability have not been calculated for 1995.
Conclusion (25) On the basis of the above it was concluded that the Community industry is suffering material injury as set out in recital 55 of the provisional duty Regulation.
However, the investigation revealed that investments, as stated in recital 48 of the provisional duty Regulation, have fluctuated since 1995 and do not show an upward trend as claimed by the GOT.
However, the prices of raw materials, as stated in recital 73 of the provisional duty Regulation, have been fluctuating since 1995 and do not show any particular trend.
Conclusion (30) Given that no other arguments were received regarding the cause of the injury suffered by the Community industry, the conclusion that imports of SBS from Taiwan have caused injury to the Community industry, as stated in recitals 74 and 75 of the provisional duty Regulation, is hereby confirmed.
COMMUNITY INTEREST 1.
Interest of the Community industry (31) Since no comments were received regarding the interest of the Community industry, the conclusions of recitals 77 to 81 of the provisional duty Regulation are hereby confirmed. 2.
The impact of duties on several typical users was examined, where SBS accounted for 40 % of their cost of production.
It was found that the imposition of measures would bring down the profitability by 0,3 % in average for that part of their business relating to SBS. (34) Furthermore, as most Community users purchase the main part of their SBS from Community producers, they would not experience any price increase for the greater part of their purchases. (35) Finally, since no further evidence was provided by the Community importers, and since the Community users did not make any comments, the conclusion of recital 86 of the provisional duty Regulation is hereby confirmed. 3.
Injury elimination level (38) As explained in recital 91 of the provisional duty Regulation, a non-injurious level of prices was determined by adding to the sales price of the Community industry its average actual loss and by further adding a profit margin of 8 % which would cover the Community industry's cost of production and allow a reasonable profit to be obtained in the absence of dumped imports from the country concerned. 2.
Accordingly, the residual dumping margin was established on the basis of the product types with the highest specific dumping margins, i.e. 20 %.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of styrene-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic rubber, falling within CN codes ex40021900 and ex 4002 99 (TARIC codes: 4002190010, 4002 99 10 10 and 4002999091) and originating in Taiwan. 2.
Article 2 The amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duties on imports originating in Taiwan under Regulation (EC) No 1091/2000 shall be collected at the rate of the duty definitively imposed.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
