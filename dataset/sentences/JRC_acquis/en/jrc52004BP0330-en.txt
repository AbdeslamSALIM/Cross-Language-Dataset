Notes the Centre's acknowledgment of the improper carry-over of provisional commitments and its assurance that article 6 of the Centre's Financial Regulation will be properly applied in future; 5.
Shares the ECA's concern over the problem of the balance for the financial year 2002 (a deficit of EUR 1,6 million); notes also the adverse effects which the low level in payment appropriations may have on carrying out the Centre's work programme; takes the view that the difference between commitment and payment appropriations may not be such as to put at risk the proper implementation of the work programme; 7.
Reiterates the position taken in its resolutions [7] accompanying the discharge given to the agencies for 2001 as regards the implementation of the new Financial Regulation; invites the Commission and the agencies to continue their cooperation, in particular in the areas of accounting, internal audit, management and control procedures, so as to ensure that a coherent harmonised framework for the functioning of the agencies is established; 13.
Stresses that it is essential that the agencies be required to submit to the investigative powers of OLAF under the same conditions as the institutions [8]; invites the ECA to provide information, in time for adoption of the discharge resolution, on whether the Community bodies which acceded to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 [9] on internal investigations by OLAF did so in the same terms as those laid down in the annex to this Agreement; Financial Management 15.
Invites the Commission to make proposals in order to ensure that the Agencies benefit from appropriate support from the EPSO when organising selection procedures and that there is a mechanism in place to validate the outcome of such procedures externally before recruitment takes place.
