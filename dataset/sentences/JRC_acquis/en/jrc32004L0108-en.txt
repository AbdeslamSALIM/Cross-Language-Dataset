Certain components or sub-assemblies should, under certain conditions, be considered to be apparatus if they are made available to the end-user. (12) The principles on which this Directive is based are those set out in the Council Resolution of 7 May 1985 on a new approach to technical harmonization and standards [5].
Those requirements are given technical expression by harmonised European standards, to be adopted by the various European standardisation bodies, European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), European Committee for Electro-technical Standardisation (CENELEC) and European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
CEN, CENELEC and ETSI are recognised as the competent institutions in the field of this Directive for the adoption of harmonised standards, which they draw up in accordance with the general guidelines for cooperation between themselves and the Commission, and with the procedure laid down in Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services [6]. (13) Harmonised standards reflect the generally acknowledged state of the art as regards electromagnetic compatibility matters in the European Union.
Compliance with a harmonised standard means conformity with its provisions and demonstration thereof by the methods the harmonised standard describes or refers to. (14) Manufacturers of equipment intended to be connected to networks should construct such equipment in a way that prevents networks from suffering unacceptable degradation of service when used under normal operating conditions.
Should apparatus be incorporated into more than one identical fixed installation, identifying the electromagnetic compatibility characteristics of these installations should be sufficient to ensure exemption from the conformity assessment procedure. (21) A transitional period is necessary in order to ensure that manufacturers and other concerned parties are able to adapt to the new regulatory regime. (22) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to ensure the functioning of the internal market by requiring equipment to comply with an adequate level of electromagnetic compatibility, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
This Directive applies to equipment as defined in Article 2. 2.
Article 2 Definitions 1.
Article 3 Placing on the market and/or putting into service Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that equipment is placed on the market and/or put into service only if it complies with the requirements of this Directive when properly installed, maintained and used for its intended purpose.
Article 4 Free movement of equipment 1.
Without prejudice to Directive 98/34/EC, Member States shall notify those special measures to the Commission and to the other Member States.
Article 5 Essential requirements The equipment referred to in Article 1 shall meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I.
Compliance with a "harmonised standard" is not compulsory. 2.
The compliance of equipment with the relevant harmonised standards whose references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union shall raise a presumption, on the part of the Member States, of conformity with the essential requirements referred to in Annex I to which such standards relate.
CHAPTER II APPARATUS Article 7 Conformity assessment procedure for apparatus Compliance of apparatus with the essential requirements referred to in Annex I shall be demonstrated by means of the procedure described in Annex II (internal production control).
Article 8 "CE" marking 1.
Apparatus whose compliance with this Directive has been established by means of the procedure laid down in Article 7 shall bear the "CE" marking which attests to that fact.
The "CE" marking shall be affixed in accordance with Annex V. 2.
Without prejudice to Article 10, if a competent authority establishes that the "CE" marking has been unduly affixed, the manufacturer or his authorised representative in the Community shall bring the apparatus into conformity with the provisions concerning the "CE" marking under conditions imposed by the Member State concerned.
Article 9 Other marks and information 1.
The manufacturer shall provide information on any specific precautions that must be taken when the apparatus is assembled, installed, maintained or used, in order to ensure that, when put into service, the apparatus is in conformity with the protection requirements set out in Annex I, point 1. 4.
Article 10 Safeguards 1.
Where a Member State ascertains that apparatus bearing the "CE" marking does not comply with the requirements of this Directive, it shall take all appropriate measures to withdraw the apparatus from the market, to prohibit its placing on the market or its putting into service, or to restrict the free movement thereof. 2.
The Member State concerned shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of any such measure, indicating the reasons and specifying, in particular, whether non-compliance is due to: (a) failure to satisfy the essential requirements referred to in Annex I, where the apparatus does not comply with the harmonised standards referred to in Article 6; (b) incorrect application of the harmonised standards referred to in Article 6; (c) shortcomings in the harmonised standards referred to in Article 6. 3.
Where the measure referred to in paragraph 1 is attributed to a shortcoming in harmonised standards, the Commission, after consulting the parties, shall, if the Member State concerned intends to uphold the measure, bring the matter before the Committee and initiate the procedure laid down in Article 6(3) and (4). 5.
Article 11 Decisions to withdraw, prohibit or restrict the free movement of apparatus 1.
Article 12 Notified bodies 1.
The Commission shall publish in the Official Journal of the European Union the references of those standards. 3.
The Commission shall ensure that the list is kept up to date. 4.
If a Member State finds that a notified body no longer meets the criteria listed in Annex VI, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.
The Commission shall withdraw the reference to that body from the list referred to in paragraph 3.
CHAPTER III FIXED INSTALLATIONS Article 13 Fixed installations 1.
Apparatus which has been placed on the market and which may be incorporated into a fixed installation is subject to all relevant provisions for apparatus set out in this Directive.
However, the provisions of Articles 5, 7, 8 and 9 shall not be compulsory in the case of apparatus which is intended for incorporation into a given fixed installation and is otherwise not commercially available.
CHAPTER IV FINAL PROVISIONS Article 14 Repeal Directive 89/336/EEC is hereby repealed as from 20 July 2007.
Article 15 Transitional provisions Member States shall not impede the placing on the market and/or the putting into service of equipment which is in compliance with the provisions of Directive 89/336/EEC and which was placed on the market before 20 July 2009.
Member States shall adopt and publish the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 20 January 2007.
They shall apply those provisions as from 20 July 2007.
Article 17 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 18 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
