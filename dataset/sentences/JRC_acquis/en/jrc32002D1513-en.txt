In order to achieve this more effectively, and in order to contribute to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation, this programme will be structured around the following three headings, under which the four activities as set out in Article 164 of the Treaty will be undertaken: - focusing and integrating Community research, - structuring the European Research Area, - strengthening the foundations of the European Research Area.
In order to help the development of SMEs in the knowledge society and the use of the economic potential of SMEs in an enlarged and better integrated European Union, SMEs, including small and micro enterprises as well as craft enterprises, will be encouraged to participate in all areas and all instruments as set out in Annex III of the sixth framework programme, in particular in the context of the activities carried out in the priority thematic areas in the spirit of %quot%stairway of excellence%quot%.
International participation in these activities will be assured.
The detailed conditions under which entities from third countries and international organisations involved in research activities may participate in this programme, including the financial arrangements, are specified in the decision which will be adopted pursuant to Article 167 of the Treaty.
FOCUSING AND INTEGRATING COMMUNITY RESEARCH The activities carried out under this heading, which will represent the major part of the efforts deployed under this programme, are intended to integrate research efforts and activities on a European scale.

Horizontal research activities involving SMEs These specific activities are intended to help European SMEs in traditional or new areas to boost their technological capacities and develop their ability to operate on a European and international scale. 1.2.3.
Science and society Activities to encourage harmonious relations between science and society and the awareness of society in respect of innovation, as a result of new relations and informed dialogue between researchers, industrialists, political decision-makers and citizens. 3.
FOCUSING AND INTEGRATING COMMUNITY RESEARCH The activities carried out under this heading will represent the major part of the research efforts deployed under this programme, intended to contribute to the general objective of the Treaty of strengthening the scientific and technical bases of Community industry and encouraging it to be more competitive at international level, while promoting all the research activities deemed necessary by other Chapters of the Treaty.
In order to bring about European added value by assembling a critical mass of resources, this programme will focus on seven, clearly defined thematic priority areas where Community research efforts will be integrated by pulling them together and making them more coherent, on a European scale.
To complement efforts in the thematic priorities, specific horizontal research activities will address SMEs, innovation and international cooperation as well as respond to Community policy objectives and future and emerging research needs. 1.1.
Thematic priorities 1.1.1.
Work will focus on: (a) the new generations of wireless and mobile communications systems and networks; satellite communications systems; all-optical technologies; integration and management of communication networks, including interoperable network solutions; capacity-enhancing technologies necessary for the development of systems, infrastructures and services, in particular for audio-visual applications.
Aeronautics and space Objective The aim of activities carried out in this area is two-fold: to strengthen, by integrating its research efforts, the scientific and technological bases of the European aeronautics and space industry and encouraging it to become more competitive at international level; and to help exploit the potential of European research in this sector with a view to improving safety and environmental protection.
Actions envisaged Aeronautics Community aeronautical research activities including air transport systems will address research and technological development activities necessary in order to: (a) increase the competitiveness of the European industry with regard to civil aircraft, engines and equipment; (b) reduce the environmental impact of aviation, by reducing fuel consumption, CO2, NOX and other chemical pollutants and noise pollution; (c) increase aircraft safety in the context of the substantial rise in air traffic; (d) increase the capacity and safety of the air transport system, in support of a %quot%Single European Sky%quot% (air traffic control and management systems).
Sustainable development, global change and ecosystems Objective The activities carried out in this area are intended to strengthen the scientific and technological capacities needed for Europe to be able to implement sustainable development, emphasised by the G√∂teborg European Council, and integrating its environmental, economic and social objectives with particular regard to renewable energy, transport, and sustainable management of Europe's land and marine resources.
Where technology is concerned, as highlighted in the Commission Green Paper %quot%Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply%quot% and in the Commission's White Paper %quot%European transport policy for 2010: time to decide%quot%, two areas concerned as a matter of priority are energy and transport, which are responsible for over 80 % of total emissions of greenhouse gases and more than 90 % of CO2 emissions.
Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the 1992 United Nations framework Convention on climate change, the European Union is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 8 % compared with the 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012.
Other important commitments are contained in international instruments such as the 1992 UN Convention on biological diversity, the 1994 UN Convention to combat desertification in countries seriously affected by drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa, and the 1987 Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer as well as in the Union strategy for sustainable development, including the sixth environment action programme.
Actions envisaged The Community's RTD efforts will concentrate on activities in the following areas: I.
Citizens and governance in a knowledge-based society Objective The activities carried out in this area are intended to mobilise in a coherent effort, in all their wealth and diversity, European research capacities in economic, political, social sciences and humanities that are necessary to develop an understanding of, and to address issues related to, the emergence of the knowledge-based society and new forms of relationships between its citizens, on the one hand and between its citizens and institutions, on the other.
Justification of the effort and European added value At the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000, the European Union set itself the ambitious objective of becoming %quot%the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustained economic growth providing more and better jobs and greater social cohesion%quot%.
Horizontal research activities involving SMEs Carried out in support of European competitiveness and enterprise and innovation policy, these specific activities are intended to help European SMEs in traditional or new areas to boost their technological capacities and develop their ability to operate on a European and international scale.
In addition to these specific research activities for SMEs, SMEs will be encouraged to participate in all areas of this programme, in particular in the context of the activities carried out in the priority thematic areas.
STRUCTURING THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH AREA 2.1.
They will take the form of support for: (a) networking of stakeholders and users in the European innovation system and carrying out analyses and studies in order to promote exchanges of experience and good practice and to engage users better in the innovation process; (b) actions to encourage transregional cooperation regarding innovation and support for the setting-up of technology businesses, as well as for the preparation of regional and transregional strategies in this area, including the accession countries; (c) actions to experiment with new tools and new approaches concerning technological innovation addressing in particular critical points in the innovation process; (d) establishment or consolidation of information services and in particular electronic services, such as CORDIS, and assistance services relating to innovation (technology transfer, protection of intellectual property, access to risk capital); including the activities of innovation relay centres; (e) economic and technological intelligence activities (analyses of technological developments, applications and markets and processing and dissemination of information which may help researchers, entrepreneurs, and in particular SMEs, and investors in their decision-making); (f) analysis and evaluation of innovation activities carried out in the framework of Community research projects and exploitation of lessons that can be drawn from innovation policies.
Human resources and mobility Objective The activities carried out under this heading are intended to support the development of abundant world-class human resources in all the regions of the Community by promoting transnational mobility for training purposes, the development of expertise or the transfer of knowledge, in particular between different sectors; supporting the development of excellence; and helping to make Europe more attractive to third country researchers.
Actions envisaged These activities, which will be carried out in the whole field of science and technology, will take in particular the following forms: (a) support measures for universities, research centres, businesses including in particular SMEs and networks, for the hosting of European and third country researchers, including training of pre-doctoral researchers.
Such support will provide for a sufficiently long training period and focus on researchers with at least four years of research experience, while also addressing the needs of training in research management; (c) financial contribution to national or regional programmes in support of researcher mobility open to researchers from other European countries; (d) support for the creation and development of European research teams which are considered as having the potential to reach a high level of excellence, more particularly for leading edge or interdisciplinary research activities where such support can add value to national measures; (e) scientific prizes for work of excellence carried out by a researcher having received Union financial support for mobility.
Research infrastructures Objective The activities carried out under this heading are intended to help establish a fabric of research infrastructures of the highest level in Europe and to promote their optimum use on a European scale.
Justification of the effort and European added value The development of a European approach with regard to research infrastructures, and the carrying out of activities in this area at Union level, can make a significant contribution to boosting European research potential and its exploitation: by helping to ensure wider access to the infrastructures existing in the different Member States and increasing the complementarity of the facilities in place; by promoting the development or establishment of infrastructures ensuring a service on a European scale, as well as optimum construction choices in European terms and in terms of regional and transregional technological development.
