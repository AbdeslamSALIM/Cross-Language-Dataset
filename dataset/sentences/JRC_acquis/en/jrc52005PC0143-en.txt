BACKGROUND Date of transmission of the proposal to the EP and the Council (document COM(1999) 577 final â€“ 1999/0238 COD): | 10 November 1999. | Date of the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee: | 1 March 2000. | Date of the opinion of the European Parliament, first reading: | 6 July 2000. | Date of adoption of the common position: | 4 April 2005 | 2.
DEHP, DBP and BBP A result of the risk assessments was that DEHP[1], DBP[2], and BBP[3] are toxic for reproduction.
DEHP, DBP and BBP should therefore be banned in all toys and childcare articles. 3.2.
DINP, DIDP and DNOP On DINP[4] there are divergent opinions between the risk assessment under Council Regulation (EEC) 793/93 on the evaluation and control of risks of existing substances on the one hand and the SCTEE on the other.
The risk assessment under Regulation 793/93/EEC concluded that if DIDP would be used in soft PVC toys at the levels DINP and DEHP are currently used (35-45%), the situation would give cause for concern.
Regarding DNOP[6], for which no EU risk assessment has been made because it is not being intentionally used in toys and childcare articles, the SCTEE already said in 1998 that if DNOP were used in doses similar to those of DEHP and DINP, larger releases from the toys would occur and lower margins of safety would be expected.
In a new opinion of 8 January 2004, the SCTEE concluded that the data gaps were properly covered by the new data and that there is no safety concern with the use of ATBC as a plasticiser for PVC toys and childcare articles that are mouthed by small children. 3.4.
