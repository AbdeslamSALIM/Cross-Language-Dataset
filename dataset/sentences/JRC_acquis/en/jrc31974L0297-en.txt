GENSCHER ANNEX I (*) DEFINITIONS, APPLICATION FOR EEC TYPE-APPROVAL, EEC TYPE-APPROVAL, SPECIFICATIONS, TESTS, CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION (1.) 2.
APPLICATION FOR EEC TYPE-APPROVAL 3.1.
SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
TESTS Compliance with the requirements of item 5 shall be checked in accordance with the methods set out in Annexes II and III. 7.
However, if necessary, the vehicles shall be subjected to the test prescribed in item 5. (8.) (9.) ANNEX II FRONTAL IMPACT TEST AGAINST A BARRIER 1.
The last part of the track, for at least 5 m before the barrier must be horizontal, flat and stabilized. 2.2.
Barrier The barrier shall consist of a block of reinforced concrete at least 3 m wide, at least 1.5 m high and at least 0.6 m thick.
The collision wall must be perpendicular to the last part of the run-up track and be covered with plywood 2 cm thick.
At least 90 metric tons of earth must be banked up behind the concrete block.
The concrete and earth barrier may be replaced by obstacles, having the same frontal area and producing equivalent results. 2.3.
Measuring instruments 2.6.1.
speed of vehicle : within 1/100, 2.6.1.2.
The distance referred to in item 3.1 must be measured to within ± 5 mm. 3.
Mounting of the steering control 2.1.1.
During the first test, the steering control shall be turned so that its most rigid spoke is perpendicular to the point of contact with the body block ; if the steering control is a steering wheel, the test shall be repeated with the most flexible part of the steering wheel perpendicular to this point of contact.
Measurement of forces 2.4.1.
Speed The body block must strike the steering control at a speed of at least 24 71 km/h and as near to this speed as possible. (1)These dimensions correspond to the 50th percentile body block with the specifications of the National Centre for Health Statistics, series 11, No 8, United States of America Centre for Health, Education and Welfare, 12 May 1967. 2.7.
Measuring instruments 2.7.1.
speed-of body block : within 2/100, 2.7.1.2.
measurement of force : the measuring range shall be 3 920 daN.
The force must be recorded without distortion for phenomena having frequencies up to 1 000 cycles, with an accuracy of 2 75 % of the maximum measuring range or ± 5 % of the real value, 2.7.1.5.
transverse sensitivity : below 5 % of the measuring range. 3.
