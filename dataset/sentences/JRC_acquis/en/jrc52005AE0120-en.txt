Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on compensation in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services (COM(2004) 144 final &amp;mdash; 2004/0050 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on compensation in cases of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services (COM(2004) 144 final — 2004/0050 (COD)) (2005/C 221/03) On 28 April 2004 the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 71 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
Introduction 1.1 The present proposal forms part of the third railway package, which was adopted by the European Commission on 3 March 2004.
The other components are: - Amendment of Directive 91/440/EEC: liberalisation of international rail-passenger transport (COM(2004) 139 final). - Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on international rail passengers' rights and obligations (COM(2004) 143 final). - Proposal for a Regulation on compensation and quality requirements for rail-freight services (COM(2004) 144 final), and - Commission Communication on further integration of the European rail system (COM(2004) 140 final). - Commission staff working paper on gradually opening up the market for international passenger services by rail (SEC(2004) 236). 1.2 The first railway package (also called the infrastructure package) came into force on 15 March 2001 and had to be transposed into national legislation by 15 March 2003.
By May 2004 five countries' notification had still not been received and two Member States had transposed only some of the provisions into national law. 1.4 The second railway package was published in the Official Journal of the European Community on 30 April 2004 and has to be transposed into national law by 30 April 2006.
New entrant railway undertakings account for only 3 to 4 % of the market, and, in several Member States, there are no competitors. 2.3 The proposed regulation obliges railway undertakings and customers to stipulate quality requirements in the transport contracts and, in the case of non-compliance, to make compensation payments.
In the case of delays of block trains, compensation is fixed at no less than 5 % and no more than 25 % of the transport price.
In the case of lack of information about delays, compensation is at least 5 % of the transport price. 2.5 The contractual parties are obliged to stipulate compensations for a train cancellation by the railway undertaking or the freight customer.
For example, Article 11 of Directive 2001/14/EC provides for bonuses in infrastructure charges if an undertaking takes steps to help minimise disruption and improve the performance of the system. 3.7 In promoting rail freight transport, it is vital to avoid discriminatory treatment of the different competing transport modes. 3.8 This raises the question of what comparable Community provisions are in place for air freight transport and road freight transport.
