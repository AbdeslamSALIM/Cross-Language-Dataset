The Parties shall commence consultations immediately. 2.
Should the consultations referred to in paragraph 1 above fail to lead to agreement within 30 days of the Community’s request for consultations, the Community may utilise the right to take action concerning safeguard measures pursuant to the provisions of the PCA. 3.
Any amendment to the combined nomenclature (CN) made in accordance with the procedures in force in the Community concerning the products covered by this Agreement or any decision relating to the classification of goods shall not have the effect of reducing the quantitative limits set out in Annex II. 2.
The procedures for control of the origin of the products referred to above are laid down in Protocol A.
