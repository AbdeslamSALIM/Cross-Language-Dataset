2005/315/EC: Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 on the aid scheme implemented by Italy for firms investing in municipalities seriously affected by natural disasters in 2002 (notified under document number C(2004) 3893)Text with EEA relevance Commission Decision of 20 October 2004 on the aid scheme implemented by Italy for firms investing in municipalities seriously affected by natural disasters in 2002 (notified under document number C(2004) 3893) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2005/315/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) On 6 and 29 March 2003 the Commission received two complaints concerning the prolongation of Law No 383 of 18 October 2001 in certain municipalities in Italy seriously affected by natural disasters in 2002. (2) On 20 March 2003 the Commission asked the Italian authorities for information on the extension.
After requesting on 2 and 21 May 2003 that the deadline for replying be extended, the Italian authorities replied on 10 June 2003.
By letters of 5 November and 16 December 2003, the Commission respectively agreed to the request and sent a reminder. (6) Italy sent its comments by letter of 18 February 2004, received on 23 February, and by letter of 10 September 2004, received on 15 September.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID SCHEME Legal basis (7) Article 5(e) of Decree-Law No 282 of 24 December 2002, converted into statute by Law No 27 of 21 February 2003, prolongs the benefits provided for in Article 4(1) of Law No 383 of 18 October 2001 solely for firms investing in municipalities seriously affected by natural disasters in 2002.
Recipients (12) Any firm in any sector that has invested in the municipalities affected by the natural disasters is eligible.
Form and intensity of the aid (13) The measure in question prolongs Law No 383 of 18 October 2001 until the second tax year following that in progress on 25 October 2001 and is confined to investments made up to 31 July 2003.
In the case of real estate investment, the extension applies to investments made up until the third tax year following the one taking in 25 October 2001 and no later than 31 July 2004.
It was unable to conclude from the operational arrangements that: - the aid recipient is a firm that has suffered damage, - the damage was caused exclusively by the natural disasters listed in one of the Prime Ministerial decrees referred to in paragraph 7, - the aid for the firm is confined solely to making good the damage caused by the natural disasters, to the exclusion of any overcompensation for the damage incurred by an individual recipient.
Analysis of the measure as investment aid (20) As regards the admissibility of the derogations in Article 87(3)(a) and/or (c) of the Treaty, the Commission considered in its decision initiating the procedure whether the measure could qualify for exemption as investment aid. (21) As regards the derogations, the Commission first expressed doubts as to whether the aid available under the scheme is granted solely in areas eligible for regional aid under the Italian regional aid map for the period 2000 to 2006.
It also doubted whether: - the concept of investment defined in the scheme is that provided for in point 4.4 of the guidelines on national regional aid and in Article 2(c) of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001, - the aid intensity under the scheme, which should be calculated by reference to all the items of expenditure making up the standard base, as defined in point 4.5 of the guidelines on national regional aid and in Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001, complied with the regional ceilings specified in the Italian regional aid map for the period 2000 to 2006 or the aid intensities laid down in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 for SMEs, - the rules on the cumulation of aid in points 4.18 to 4.21 of the guidelines for national regional aid and in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 had been complied with, - the principle of the necessity of aid referred to in point 4.2 of the guidelines on national regional aid and in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 had been met, - in order to ensure that the productive investment aided is viable and sound, the recipientâ€™s contribution to its financing is a least 25 %, as provided for in point 4.2 of the guidelines on national regional aid and in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001, - the rules laid down in the Community guidelines on State aid in the agriculture sector and in the guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture had been complied with.
Under Article 1 of the Decree of 29 October 2002, aid was to be granted solely in the municipalities affected by flooding and in which evacuation orders or orders banning traffic on the main access routes had been issued.
The same is true when a Member State grants aid to firms operating in the service and distribution industries [8]. (36) Accordingly, the measures under examination are, in principle, prohibited by Article 87(1) and can be regarded as compatible with the common market only if they qualify for one of the derogations laid down in the Treaty. (37) The Commission considers, however, that aid granted under the scheme does not constitute State aid if the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 [9] or the de minimis rules in force when the aid was granted are met.
The disasters and the areas concerned were specified and defined in administrative instruments. (45) As the Italian authorities also confirmed in their letter of 10 September 2004, the measure is based on a macroeconomic approach.
Article 2 Italy shall withdraw the aid scheme referred to in Article 1 in so far as it is continuing to produce effects.
Article 3 Individual aid grants under the scheme referred to in Article 1 shall be compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(2)(b) of the Treaty to the extent that they do not exceed the net value of the damage actually suffered by each of the recipients as a result of the natural disasters referred to in Article 5(e) of Decree-Law No 282 of 24 December 2002, with account being taken of insurance payments or of amounts received under other measures.
Article 4 Individual aid grants under the scheme referred to in Article 1 that do not meet the conditions set out in Article 3 shall be incompatible with the common market.
Italy shall take all necessary measures to recover from the recipients the aid referred to in Article 4. 2.
Italy shall order all the recipients of the aid referred to in Article 4 to repay, within two months of the date of notification of this Decision, the aid unlawfully granted plus interest.
Article 6 Within two months of the date of notification of this Decision, Italy shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to comply herewith by completing the questionnaire attached to this Decision.
Article 7 This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.
