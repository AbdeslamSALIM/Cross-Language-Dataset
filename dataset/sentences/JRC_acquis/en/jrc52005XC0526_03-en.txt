Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ethyl alcohol originating in Guatemala and Pakistan (2005/C 129/05) The Commission has received a complaint pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection of dumped imports from countries non members of the European Community ("the basic Regulation") [1], as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004 [2], alleging that imports of ethyl alcohol, originating in Guatemala and Pakistan ("the countries concerned"), are being dumped and are thereby causing material injury to the Community industry. 1.
Complaint The complaint was lodged on 11 April 2005 by the Committee of Industrial Ethanol Producers of the EU (CIEP) ("the complainant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 30 %, of the total Community production of ethyl alcohol. 2.
Product The product allegedly being dumped is ethyl alcohol, whether denatured or undenatured, having an alcoholic strength by volume of 80 % vol or higher originating in Guatemala and Pakistan ("the product concerned"), normally declared within CN codes 22071000 and ex22072000.
Procedure Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the Community industry and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission hereby initiates an investigation pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. 5.1.
In order to enable the Commission to select a sample, all Community producers are hereby requested to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i): - name, address, e-mail address, telephone, and fax, and/or telex numbers and contact person, - the total turnover in euro of the company during the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005, - the precise activities of the company with regard to the production of the product concerned, - the value in euro of sales of the product concerned made in the Community market during the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005, - the volume in tonnes of sales of the product concerned made in the Community market during the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005, - the volume in tonnes of the production of the product concerned during the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005, - the names and the precise activities of all related companies [4] involved in the production and/or selling of the product concerned, - any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, - an indication of whether the company or companies agree to their inclusion in the sample, which implies replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of their response.
It should be noted that any information submitted pursuant to Article 21 will only be taken into account if supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. 6.
Non-cooperation In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. 9.
