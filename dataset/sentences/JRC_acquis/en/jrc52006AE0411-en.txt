At its 425th plenary session, held on of 15 and 16 March 2006 (meeting of 15 March), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 130 votes in favour and six abstentions. 1.
One cubic metre of wood binds on average 800 kg of carbon dioxide.
Increased use of wood energy would replace non-renewable energy reserves and at the same time reduce fossil fuel emissions.
A European specification and classification for quality of solid wood fuels — CEN/TS 14961 — has been published. 1.3 The EESC believes that it is important that sustainable use of timber should increase in every country and that the fuel market be opened up to the industry's by-products, timber obtained from the forest for energy production and processed woodfuels.
A carbon dioxide tax on fossil fuels and a low VAT rate on woodfuel would boost demand for wood energy.
This would make it possible to set operational objectives and to measure the results of different instruments. 1.10 The EESC considers that increased use of wood as fuel is important in some regions in the control of forest fires caused by humans in cultivated conifer monocultures.
General 2.1 The European Union does not have a common energy policy.
In recent years decisions have been taken concerning the market in electric energy (96/92/EC [2]) and natural gas (98/30/EC [3]), security of supply, greater use of renewable energy forms and environmental issues connected with energy production.
There has been a failure to achieve a uniform level of taxation of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels that would appreciably encourage use of renewable energy. 2.2 The 1997 White Paper [4] sets the target of increasing the use of renewable energy from 45 Mtoe in 1995 to 135 Mtoe in 2010.
The objective was set for the EU15 and corresponds to an increase in the proportion of renewable energy from 5.2 % to 12 % by 2010.
The intermediate target was 2 % by 2005 but the outturn was only 1.4 %. 2.6 The directive on taxation of energy products and electricity (2003/96/EC [9]) enables Member States to exempt woodfuels from taxation or to apply a lower tax rate.
Tax concessions cannot be granted after 31 December 2012 and under the directive the tax concessions granted cease to apply by 2018. 2.7 A directive on emissions trading in the EU (2003/87/EC [10]) was adopted in the autumn of 2003.
The situation varies considerably across Member States. 2.14 On 30 September 2005 the European Parliament adopted a resolution setting the objective of increasing the proportion of renewable energy to 20 % by 2020.
In many EU countries there are also good examples of labelling schemes for wood energy which guarantee that energy production is controlled and inform consumers about respect for environmental criteria. 2.16 Forestry resources in Europe (stem volume in cubic meters without residuals) increased by approximately 30 % when the 10 new Member States joined the EU in 2004.
The EU's total forest and woodland area currently amounts to 140 million hectares and there is about 22 million hectares in the accession countries.
The net annual increment (growth) of the growing stock (gross increment less natural loss of trees) in the EU is 560 million m3.
In 2002 fellings amounted to 350 million m3, of which 41 million m3 was traditional felling for firewood.
Net imports of roundwood into the EU amount to about 25 million m3.
Together, industry and households use 62 % of the annual increment, of which more than 7 % is traditional firewood for use in the home.
A good 10 % of total growth is in protected forests or otherwise outside commercially exploited areas. 2.16.1 This means that almost 30 % of growth is still unexploited, and EU forest stock is therefore still growing, as it has been for the past 50 years.
Part of this unused timber (170 million m3) is low-grade timber, which can only be used for energy production.
Each year 173 million m3 of logging residue and other wood from felling suitable for energy production are left in forests.
Taking into account technical, economic and ecological constraints, an estimated 70 million m3 of this amount, in the form of felling residue and stumps, could be used. 2.16.2 By-products of the forestry industry (black liquor, bark, sawdust, etc.) and recovered wood offer the greatest potential and are already exploited effectively in many countries, particularly in the context of an integrated forest industry.
Use of by-products and recovered wood for energy purposes could amount to 30-50 % of roundwood use (equivalent to 100-167 million m3 of roundwood). 2.16.3 This implies that the EU's sustainable energy wood potential is about 267 million m3; part of the industrial by-products included in this amount is already exploited.
This amount of wood is equivalent to 50 Mtoe of energy.
Thus EU forests have an unused wood energy potential of at least 100 million m3.
The FAO/UNECE Timber Committee is currently developing arrangements for monitoring use of woodfuels and testing a data collection system in ten countries. 2.16.4 In 2001 only 101.3 Mtoe of total energy consumption of 1,668 Mtoe in the EU (EU25) was produced using renewable energy forms.
In eleven countries, the proportion was over 75 %.
From the point of view of cutting emissions, it is particularly important to use energy production methods where the unit cost of emissions is low. 3.7 Using fossil fuels simply for electricity generation is a poor environmental solution.
Ethanol from lignocellulosics, gasification and subsequent production of synthetic diesel are other likely sources of energy. 3.10 The new Member States offer considerable potential for expanding the forestry industry and using wood as a raw material for production of wood-based products and energy. 3.11 Biomass fuel markets are usually local or regional markets, owing to, for example, transport costs.
International politics and development 4.1 In 2005 the energy market was hit by higher oil prices and a deficiency in oil product processing capacity.
The EU's emissions trading scheme is one component of the European Union's climate strategy, and is only partly linked to the Kyoto Protocol. 4.3 Emissions trading within the European Union started on 1 January 2005.
At the moment, the Commission is working on an action plan for sustainable forestry in the European Union, which is due to be completed in 2006. 4.5 Since 1998 the European Union's forest area has increased by 20 % and the number of private forest owners from 12 to 16 million.
Woodfuels and their promotion 5.1 Wood plays an important role in energy supply in countries with large tracts of woodland.
Since only just over 50 % of forestry potential is exploited industrially, efforts will have to be made to harness by-products from logging and to tap into this unused potential for energy production.
It also helps to underpin good, sustainable forest management practices, particularly when regenerating forest and thinning young forest stands. 5.2 Wood is a renewable raw material and wood products also act as carbon reservoirs.
Recycling of wood products continues to grow. 5.3 At the end of their various recycling processes, wood products can be used to produce energy.
