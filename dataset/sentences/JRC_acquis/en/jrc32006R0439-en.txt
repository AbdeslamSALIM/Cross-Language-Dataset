Commission Regulation (EC) No 439/2006 of 16 March 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of chamois leather originating in the People’s Republic of China Commission Regulation (EC) No 439/2006 of 16 March 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of chamois leather originating in the People’s Republic of China THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 [1] of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 7 thereof, After consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Initiation (1) On 25 June 2005, the Commission announced by way of a notice (notice of initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of chamois leather originating in the People’s Republic of China (the PRC). (2) The proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged in May 2005 by The British Leather Confederation (the complainant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 70 %, of the total Community production of chamois leather.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set in the notice of initiation.
All parties who so requested within the above time-limit and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be heard. (4) In view of the anticipated large number of exporting producers and importers involved in the investigation, the application of sampling techniques was envisaged in the notice of initiation, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. (5) In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, exporting producers and importers were requested to make themselves known and to provide information as specified in the notice of initiation.
In addition, since no exporting producers in the PRC provided the necessary information or made requests for MET or for IT within the time-limits set in accordance with the basic Regulation, it was decided that findings in respect of the assessment of dumping would be made on the basis of Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Replies were received from three Community producers mentioned in the complaint. (10) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a preliminary determination of dumping, resultant injury and Community interest.
Verification visits were carried out at the following companies: Community producers - Marocchinerie e Scamoscerie Italiane (MESI), Italy, - Hutchings %amp% Harding Ltd, UK, - Beaven Ltd, UK. (11) In the absence of any claims for MET or IT and of the need to establish a normal value for exporting producers in the PRC, a verification visit to establish normal value on the basis of data from an analogue country took place at the premises of the following company: - Acme Sponge %amp% Chamois Co., Inc., USA. (12) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 (investigation period or IP).
The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 2001 to the end of the IP (period considered).
Product concerned (14) The product concerned is chamois leather, or combination chamois leather, whether or not cut to shape, including chamois and combination crust chamois leather (chamois leather) originating in the PRC (the product concerned), currently classifiable within CN codes 41141010 and 41141090.
Like product (15) On the basis of information available from the complainant, no differences were found between the product concerned and chamois leather produced and sold in the USA, which served as analogue country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the PRC. (16) On the basis of information available from the complainant, no differences were found between the product concerned and chamois leather produced and sold in the Community by the Community industry. (17) It is therefore provisionally concluded that, in accordance with Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation and for the purpose of this investigation, chamois leather produced and sold on the domestic market of the PRC, that produced and sold in the USA and that produced and sold by the Community industry on the Community market have the same basic physical characteristics and uses and are therefore considered to be alike to the product concerned.
Normal value 3.1.
Analogue country (20) Pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, normal value was established on the basis of the prices or constructed value in an analogue country.
No comments or objections were received from any parties in this respect. (21) Nevertheless, through contacts with associations or Chambers of Commerce which could be identified in third countries, the suitability of other countries which were considered as possibly having chamois leather production was examined.
Export price (25) In the absence of cooperation by exporting producers in the PRC, the export price was established on the basis of Eurostat data on the quantity and value of imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the PRC, this being the best information available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Dumping margin (27) The dumping margin was established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average export price, in accordance with Article 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation.
Community consumption (31) Consumption was established by adding the Community sales of the cooperating Community producers, the estimated sales of the non-cooperating Community producers in the Community and total imports as set out in Eurostat, duly adjusted where evidence existed of incorrect import statistics for certain countries.
As for the imports, the Eurostat figures were expressed in tonnes and therefore a conversion rate was used in order to express them in square feet.
Apparent consumption in the Community | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Square feet (in thousands) | 19872 | 20424 | 21565 | 20582 | 20873 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 103 | 109 | 104 | 105 | 4.
Volume of the imports from the country concerned and market share (32) The volume of imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC derived from Eurostat and expressed in square feet using the methodology described in recital 31, increased from approximately 2,1 million square feet in 2001 to 6,6 million square feet in the IP. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Volume of imports (in thousands of square feet) | 2130 | 1627 | 5037 | 6273 | 6607 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 76 | 236 | 295 | 310 | (33) During the period considered, imports from the PRC increased their share of the Community market from 10,7 % in 2001 to 31,7 % in the IP.
This rapid increase in market share took place against a background of relatively small growth in consumption. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Market share | 10,7 % | 8,0 % | 23,4 % | 30,5 % | 31,7 % | (i) Import prices (34) Price information for the imports concerned was derived from Eurostat data based on the import volumes established using the methodology described in recital 31 above.
Source: Eurostat. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Prices in EUR/square feet of chamois leather | 0,63 | 0,79 | 0,50 | 0,69 | 0,66 | Index | 100 | 125 | 80 | 109 | 104 | (ii) Price undercutting and price depression (35) For the purpose of calculating the level of price undercutting in the IP, the prices of the product concerned sold by the Community industry producers were compared to the prices of imports on the Community market during the IP on the basis of a weighted average price for all types of chamois leather, based on Eurostat figures.
The prices of the imports concerned were on a CIF basis with an appropriate adjustment for quality differences found, the customs duties and post importation costs. (36) This comparison showed that during the IP, the products concerned originating in the PRC were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter, by 30 %. 5.
Over the same period, the Community industry continuously decreased its production by a total of 20 % and its capacity utilisation rate dropped from 71,2 % in 2001 to 57 % in the IP.

This is fully reflected in their market share which decreased continuously from 41,1 % in 2001 to 32,3 % during the IP. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Sales of the Community industry (in thousand square feet) | 8163 | 8166 | 7478 | 6423 | 6746 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 100 | 92 | 79 | 83 | Market share | 41,1 % | 40,0 % | 34,7 % | 31,2 % | 32,3 % | (iii) Stocks (40) The figures below represent the volume of stocks at the end of each period. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Stocks (in thousand square feet) | 4508 | 3321 | 3157 | 4298 | 4243 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 74 | 70 | 95 | 94 | (41) Stocks decreased sharply by 26 percentage points in 2002 and then they continually increased until the IP.

In the IP, prices fell again by a further 3 percentage points..

In 2004 and the IP, their return on investment was negative reflecting thus their loss making situation.

It should be, however, noted that the losses encountered in 2004 and the IP established a rather unfavourable context in this respect.
However, this turned negative in 2004 and the IP reflecting thus the significant losses registered during these years.

Conclusion on injury (55) The examination of the above mentioned factors shows that between 2001 and the IP, the dumped imports increased sharply in terms of volume and market share.
Moreover in the IP, the sales prices of the Community industry were substantially undercut by 30 % by those of the imports concerned. (56) During the period considered almost all injury indicators developed negatively.
Production and capacity utilisation decreased (– 20 % and – 14 percentage points respectively), whereas in light of the increase in Community consumption of 5 % during the same period, these indicators could have been expected to develop in a rather positive manner.
The sales volume and prices have also fallen considerably (– 17 % and – 10 % respectively). (57) The Community industry lost significant market share during the period considered at a time when total Community consumption grew from approximately 19,8 million square feet to nearly 20,9 million square feet.
The Community industry suffered a dramatic decline in profitability (– 10 percentage points), cash flow (– 20,6 % of turnover) and return on investments (– 37 percentage points). (58) In the light of the foregoing, it is provisionally concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury, characterised by severe price depression, declining profitability as well as declining returns on investment, within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
Effects of the dumped imports (60) Imports from the PRC have increased considerably during the period concerned, by 4,5 million square feet in terms of volume, and by 21 percentage points in terms of market share.
Prices of imports originating in the PRC significantly undercut Community industry prices by 30 %. (61) The effects of dumped imports can be illustrated by the fact that over the period considered, the producers in the PRC increased their market share at the expense of the Community industry. (62) Overall, between 2001 and the IP, the Community industry’s loss of market share of 8,8 percentage points was totally absorbed by the increase in market share of imports of the PRC. (63) The loss of market share and insufficient price levels of the Community industry also coincided with the injurious situation of the industry evidenced by the significant losses, the sharp deterioration in its cash flow and return on investment and the unfavourable development of employment. (64) These factors, coupled with the fact that the Community industry was not able to take advantage of the slightly growing Community market, due to the depressed prices, had the effect that in spite of investments geared towards modernising the production facilities, it suffered material injury during the period.
Effects of other factors 3.1.
Imports from other countries (65) The imports in volumes and prices from the main other countries are shown in the table below.
Imports from third main countries | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Turkey (thousands square feet) | 353 | 380 | 237 | 893 | 1677 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 1,01 | 0,73 | 0,33 | 0,81 | 0,52 | Other countries excluding those mentioned above: In volume (thousands square feet) | 1732 | 2078 | 1933 | 1825 | 2485 | Average prices (EUR/square feet) | 1,14 | 0,93 | 0,79 | 0,91 | 0,60 | (66) The imports from Turkey increased substantially throughout the period considered representing an increase of 6,2 percentage points in market share.
However, the investigation showed that a significant part of these imports in 2003, 2004 and the IP was made by one cooperating Community producer.
The remaining quantities imported from Turkey represent a low and rather steady market share of around 2 % during the period considered with the exception of the IP when they reached 6 %.
As for the prices of these quantities, they were lower than those of imports from the PRC in 2002, 2003 and the IP but higher in 2001 and 2004.
Performance of other Community producers (68) Non-cooperating Community producers of the product concerned held a market share of around 24 % during the IP, down from almost 40 % in 2001.
During the period considered, their sales volume decreased substantially by 36 %.
Exports by the Community industry (69) As for the exports of the Community industry, as shown in the table in recital (41) above, they increased by 7 % during the period considered, in contrast to sales on the EU market which decreased by 17 % during the same period.
COMMUNITY INTEREST (73) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, the Commission considered whether, despite the conclusion on injurious dumping, the imposition of the anti-dumping measures would be contrary to the interests of the Community as a whole.
The production activity is currently only at 57 % of its production capacity. (76) The imposition of measures is expected to prevent a continuing distortion of the market and a deterioration of prices.
PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
Injury elimination level (83) In view of the conclusions reached with regard to dumping, injury, causation and Community interest, provisional measures should be imposed in order to prevent further injury to the Community industry by the dumped imports. (84) The provisional measures should be imposed at a level sufficient to eliminate the injurious effect caused to the Community industry by the dumped imports, without exceeding the dumping amounts found.
Consequently, on the basis of the information available, it was preliminarily found that a profit margin of 5 % of turnover could be regarded as an appropriate level which the Community industry could be expected to obtain in the absence of injurious dumping. (86) The required price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison, at the same level of trade, of the weighted average import price, as established for the price undercutting calculations, with the non-injurious price of products sold by the Community industry on the Community market.
Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the total CIF import value. (87) On this basis, the injury elimination margin found was 62 %. 2.
Provisional measures (88) In the light of the foregoing, it is considered that, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, provisional anti-dumping duties should be imposed in respect of imports of chamois leather originating in the PRC at the level of the injury elimination margin found as this was lower than the dumping margin found.
A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of chamois leather and combination chamois leather, whether or not cut to shape, including chamois and combination crust chamois leather originating in the People’s Republic of China, falling within CN codes 41141010 and 41141090. 2.
The rate of the provisional anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, for products produced by all companies in the People’s Republic of China shall be 62 %. 3.
The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provision of a security equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. 4.
Article 2 Without prejudice to Article 20 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96, interested parties may request disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which this regulation was adopted, make their views known in writing and apply to be heard orally by the Commission within one month of the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
