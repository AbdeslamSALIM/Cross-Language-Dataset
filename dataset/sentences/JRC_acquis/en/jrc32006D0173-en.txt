PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 [2], imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating, inter alia, in India.
The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty ranging between 0 and 62,6 % on imports of PET film originating in India. (2) On 22 August 2001, the Commission, by Decision 2001/645/EC [3], accepted undertakings offered by five Indian producers: Ester Industries Limited (Ester), Flex Industries Limited (Flex), Garware Polyester Limited (Garware), MTZ Polyfilms Limited (MTZ) and Polyplex Corporation Limited (Polyplex). (3) On 22 November 2003 [4], the Commission initiated a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 limited to the form of the definitive anti-dumping measures.
WITHDRAWAL OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF UNDERTAKINGS (4) As set out in recitals 22 to 25 of Regulation (EC) No 365/2006, and after having consulted all parties concerned, the undertakings in their current form are not appropriate to counteract the injurious effect of dumping, since they present both considerable monitoring and enforcement difficulties and unacceptable risks.
The interested parties were given the opportunity to comment. (6) These comments are addressed in recitals 27 to 31 of Regulation (EC) No 365/2006.
Article 2 This Decision shall take effect on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Done at Brussels, 13 February 2006.
