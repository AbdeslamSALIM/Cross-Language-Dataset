Distillation as referred to in paragraph 1 must be performed using apparatus which complies with the principles of the diagram in Annex III. 3.
The routine methods which may be used to check the TVB-N limit are as follows: - microdiffusion method described by Conway and Byrne (1933), - direct distillation method described by Antonacopoulos (1968), - distillation of an extract deproteinized by trichloracetic acid (Codex Alimentarius Committee on Fish and Fishery Products (1968)). 4.
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 8 March 1995.
For the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission ANNEX I SPECIES CATEGORIES FOR WHICH A TVB-N LIMIT VALUE IS FIXED A.
This procedure is applicable to TVB-N concentrations from 5 mg/100 g to at least 100 mg/100 g. 2.
The concentration is stated in terms of mg/100 g. 3.
Perchloric acid solution = 6 g/100 ml. 4.2.
Sodium hydroxide solution = 20 g/100 ml. 4.3.
Hydrochloric acid standard solution 0,05 mol/l (0,05 N).
Note: When using an automatic distillation apparatus, titration should take place with a hydrochloric acid standard solution 0,01 mol/l (0,01 N). 4.4.
Boric acid solution = 3 g/100 ml. 4.5.
Phenolphtalein solution = 1 g/100 ml 95 % ethanol. 4.7.
Instruments and accessories 5.1.
High-speed blender with revolutions between 8 000 min P1 and 45 000 min P1. 5.3.
Fluted filter, diameter 150 mm, quick-filtering. 5.4.
Burette, 5 ml, graduated to 0,01 ml. 5.5.
Exactly 10 g +/ P 0,1 g of the ground sample are weighed in a suitable container, mixed with 90,0 ml perchloric acid solution as stated in section 4.1, homogenized for two minutes with a blender as described in section 5.2, and then filtered.
The extract thereby obtained can be kept for at least seven days at a temperature between approximately 2 °C and 6 °C. 6.2.
Steam distillation 50,0 ml of the extract obtained according to section 6.1 are put in an apparatus for steam distillation as described in secton 5.5.
The distillation outflow tube is submerged in a receiver with 100 ml boric acid solution as specified in section 4.4, to which three to five drops of the indicator solution as described in 4.7 have been added.
The volatile bases contained in the receiver solution are determined by titration with standard hydrochloric solution as specified in secton 4.3.
The pH of the end point should be 5,0 +/ P 0,1. 6.3.
The applied method is correct if the difference of the duplicates is not higher than 2 mg/100 g. 6.4.
Instead of the extract, 50,0 ml perchloric acid solution as specified in section 4.1 are used. 7.
Calculation of TVB-N By titration of the receiver solution with hydrochloric acid as in 4.3, the TVB-N concentration is calculated with the following equation: TVB-N (expressed in mg/100 g sample) = (V1 PV0) × 0,14 × 2 × 100 M V1 = Volume of 0,01 M hydrochloric acid solution in ml for sample; V0 = Volume of 0,01 M hydrochloric acid solution in ml for blanc; M = Weight of sample in g.
The applied method is correct if the difference between duplicates is not higher than 2 mg/100 g. 2.
Check the equipment by distilling solutions of NH4Cl equivalent to 50 mg TVB-/100 g. 3.
Standard deviation of reproducibility Sr = 1,20 mg/100 g.
Standard deviation of comparability SR = 2,50mg/100 g.
