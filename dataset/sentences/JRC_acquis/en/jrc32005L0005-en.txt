General survey of the sampling procedure for cereals, dried vine fruit and roasted coffee TABLE 1 Subdivision of lots into sublots depending on product and lot weight Commodity | Lot weight (ton) | Weight or number of sublots | No of incremental samples | Aggregate sample weight (kg) | Cereals and cereal products | ≥ 1500 | 500 tonnes | 100 | 10 | &gt; 300 and &lt; 1500 | 3 sublots | 100 | 10 | ≥ 50 and ≤ 300 | 100 tonnes | 100 | 10 | &lt; 50 | — | 3-100 [1] | 1-10 | Dried vine fruit (currants, raisins and sultanas) | ≥ 15 | 15-30 tonnes | 100 | 10 | &lt; 15 | — | 10-100 [2] | 1-10 | Roasted coffee beans, ground roasted coffee and soluble coffee | ≥ 15 | 15-30 tonnes | 100 | 10 | &lt; 15 | — | 10-100 [2] | 1-10 | 4.4.
Sampling provisions for cereals and cereal products (lots &lt; 50 tonnes) and for roasted coffee beans, ground roasted coffee, soluble coffee, dried vine fruit (lots &lt; 15 tonnes) For cereal lots under 50 tonnes and for roasted coffee beans, ground roasted coffee, soluble coffee and dried vine fruit lots under 15 tonnes the sampling plan has to be used with 10 to 100 incremental samples, depending on the lot weight, resulting in an aggregate sample of 1 to 10 kg.
For very small lots (≤ 0,5 tonnes) of cereals and cereal products a lower number of incremental samples can be taken, but the aggregate sample uniting all incremental samples shall be also in that case at least 1 kg.
The weight of an incremental sample should be at least 100 grams, resulting in an aggregate sample of at least about 1 kg.
TABLE 4 Minimum number of incremental samples to be taken from the lot Form of commercialisation | Weight of lot (in litres) | Minimum number of incremental samples to be taken | Bulk (grape juice, wine) | … | 3 | Bottles/packages grape juice | ≤ 50 | 3 | Bottles/packages grape juice | 50 to 500 | 5 | Bottles/packages grape juice | &gt; 500 | 10 | Bottles/packages wine | ≤ 50 | 1 | Bottles/packages wine | 50 to 500 | 2 | Bottles/packages wine | &gt; 500 | 3" | [1] Depending on the lot weight — see table 2 of this Annex.
