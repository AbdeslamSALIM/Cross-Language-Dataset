Provision should therefore be made to allow producers, during a limited period, to submit a special premium application in respect of 2004 for animals eligible on 31 December 2004 which will be slaughtered at the beginning of 2005. (3) The extent of the risk of disturbances on the beef and veal market connected with the unusual slaughter increase depends on the existing slaughter capacities in each Member State.
Obviously, it would no longer be possible to establish, with regard to an animal that is slaughtered after 31 December 2004, whether that animal fulfilled this weight criterion at the latest on that date.
Steers shall be eligible to the premium on 31 December 2004 within the meaning of Article 4(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
Done at Brussels, 29 October 2004.
