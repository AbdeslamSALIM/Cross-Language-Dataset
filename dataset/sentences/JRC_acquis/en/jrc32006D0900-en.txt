2006/900/EC: Commission Decision of 20 October 2005 on the State Aid implemented by Finland for investment aid to Componenta Corporation (notified under document number C(2005) 3871) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 20 October 2005 on the State Aid implemented by Finland for investment aid to Componenta Corporation (notified under document number C(2005) 3871) (Only the Finnish and Swedish versions are authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/900/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [1], Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 10 March 2004 from Metalls Verkstadsklubb vid Componenta Alvesta AB, Sweden, the Commission was informed that the City of Karkkila had made a financial transaction with Componenta Corporation Oyj in Karkkila, Finland which it suspected contained state aid.
By letter dated 22 June 2004 Finland provided the Commission with the information requested. (2) By letter dated 19 November 2004 the Commission informed Finland that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the suspected aid. (3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2].
The Group employs around 2200 people. (6) The suspected aid was provided to Componenta in December 2003 and consisted of two operations.
In one case it was provided through the purchase by the city of Karkkila (hereinafter called Karkkila) of 50 % of the shares in the real estate company Karkkilan Keskustakiinteistöt Oy (hereinafter called KK), which was jointly owned (50/50) by Karkkila and Componenta.
In the other case Karkkila granted KK an interest-free loan, which was used by KK to reimburse a loan of the same amount that it had been granted by Componenta in 1996.
The total sum of the deal was EUR 2383276,5 (EUR 713092,5 for the shares and EUR 1670184 in the form of the loan repayment) [3]. (7) The price for the shares was based on the estimated net value of the company (assets minus liabilities) and by dividing this amount by 2, since Componenta owned 50 % of KK.
The price for the shares was set somewhat lower at EUR 713092,5. (8) The sales agreement between Karkkila (Buyer) and Componenta (Seller) furthermore stated the following: a. %quot%The Seller agrees to invest in the extension of Componenta Karkkila Oy’s production facilities in the territory of the City of Karkkila as specified in Appendix 1 of this contract.
According to the information from the company the total cost of closing production in Sweden and investing in Finland amounted to EUR 13 million. (11) Finland argued that the transaction between Componenta and Karkkila was market-based and that no aid was involved.
The aid amount would be the difference between the price a private investor would be willing to pay for the shares and the EUR 2,4 million transferred from Karkkila to Componenta. (12) The Commission furthermore considered that the clauses of the sales agreement referred to above provided a strong indication that the transaction was not market-based, and that it was instead intended as a form of compensation for Componenta’s new investments in the territory of Karkkila, which were linked to the closure of the Alvesta foundry. (13) After taking over Componenta’s shares in KK, Karkkila decided to liquidate KK and transfer the land to the city.
Finally, as regards the value of land designated for parks, a valuation of EUR 456000 was considered by the real estate agent to be the market value. (15) The Commission requested Finland to make a market valuation of all the land owned by KK at the time of the sales agreement.
Finland replied that this was not needed, since Karkkila and Componenta had used a real estate agent to estimate the unit value of land similar to the land involved in the transaction and that a market evaluation had therefore already been done. (16) As regards the condition in the sales agreement stipulating that Karkkila would buy the shares in KK from Componenta only if Componenta invested in new production facilities (thereby moving its foundry from Alvesta, Sweden to Karkkila), Finland denies allegations by the Commission that this clause is a sign that the transaction was not market-based.
Otherwise, Karkkila would not %quot%need%quot% to conclude the transaction. (17) Asked by the Commission whether Componenta had tried to find another buyer for the shares, Finland replied that it had not, since Karkkila had the right of first refusal to redeem the shares at the market price in the event of Componenta wanting to sell its shares in KK. (18) Finally, as regards the loan transaction, Finland confirms that the repayment of Componenta’s shareholder loan by new funds from Karkkila to KK was an integral part of the share transaction between Karkkila and Componenta and that the %quot%total purchase price%quot% consisted of the payment for the shares and the repayment of the loan. (19) In this respect, Finland argues that the loan transaction too was market-based, since the total amount provided to Componenta for the shares and the loan, EUR 2,37 million, was less than the market value of half of KK.
Furthermore, Finland argues that KK’s financial situation had improved since 1996 when the loan was granted to KK by Componenta.
Existence of aid (22) In its decision to open the formal investigation the Commission stated that the aid amount would be the difference between the price a private investor would be willing to pay for the shares and the purchase price of EUR 2,37 million. (23) The Commission notes that the total purchase price consisted of two parts.
First, Componenta received EUR 0,7 million in cash in return for its shares and, second, it was repaid EUR 1,67 million that it had provided as a loan to KK.
Therefore, in total Componenta received EUR 2,37 million in the transaction concerned.
The conditional clause (24) The Commission notes that one alternative for Componenta had been to move its foundry activities from Karkkila to Alvesta.
However, the fact that the issue of buying the shares in KK and providing a loan to KK was contractually linked with Componenta’s investment decision and that the city even had the right to cancel the entire transaction if Componenta did not make the promised investments in Karkkila proves that the decision of the city to perform the transaction with Componenta was not based only on the market value of KK, but took other considerations into account as well. (26) However, according to the market economy investor principle, as established by the Court, a market economy investor takes his decisions having regard to the foreseeability of obtaining a return and leaving aside all social, regional policy and sectoral considerations.
To accept boosting tax revenue and improving general welfare in the municipality as being market economy investor considerations would be to mix the roles of the city as a public authority and as commercial co-owner of KK. (27) The Commission also notes that that the Karkkila City Board at its meeting on 1 September 2003 stated that the transaction with Componenta was directly linked to its investment decision in Karkkila and that when Karkkila bought the shares of KK, Componenta would have the funds to make the investment in its Karkkila plant. (28) These observations further support the Commission’s findings below that the transaction was not market-based.
The issue is whether this price was market based. (30) Finland justified the price of the shares in KK in terms of the net value of the assets owned by KK.
Had it financed its activities by normal loans with interest, the situation would have been even worse.
The Finnish argumentation for the valuation of the shares is summarised in the table below: Table 1 Value of KK according to Finland: Land type | Value according to Finland (Euro) | For detached houses | 1031565 | For terraced houses and apartment blocks | 1136849 | Asemansuo | 2358158 | Parks and communal land | 491738 | Other area (Haapala) | 49678 | Total land value | 5067988 | Book equity of KK | -231595 | Debts of KK | -3340475 | Net value KK | 1495918 | Net value 50 % of KK | 747959 | Price paid by city | 713092 | Aid | 0 | (36) The considerations of the Commission Communication on State aid elements in sales of land and buildings by public authorities [5] do not apply directly, because the transaction does not concern individual pieces of real estate, but shares in a company.
The expert notes that such land was sold in Karkkila for between EUR 9,43 and EUR 14,76 per square metre in 2003, but also notes that the price used by Karkkila is close to the going value for land, without providing any further details. (40) However, the Commission notes that there was no actual external valuation made of the specific land to be used for detached houses that was owned by KK.
In the view of the Commission it is evident that the value of land at the retail stage is considerably higher than when land is sold in large quantities (such as in this case, where KK owned 80 plots for detached houses) where the buyer's intention is not to use it, but to sell it on at a later date. (41) Therefore, an evaluation whereby the estimated retail value for one type of land is simply multiplied by the total amount of land owned by KK contains two errors.
Since this concerns one large piece of land, it can be assumed that the estimate made by the real estate expert for Asemansuo was the retail value, and the figure provided by the real estate expert can therefore be considered as plausible by the Commission.
Finland has not provided any explanation for the substantial deviation from the expert report. (45) As regards land intended for gardens and communal areas, valued at EUR 491738, the Commission questions whether it should be given much value at all, since such land, which cannot be exploited for productive use, will not provide any financial return, and a market economy investor would therefore not be willing to pay any significant amount for this. (46) Based on the above observations, the Commission considers that the valuation of the land owned by KK was not correctly done and did not comply with the valuation criteria in the Commission Communication on State aid elements in sales of land and buildings by public authorities. (47) Taking just the overvaluation of Asemansuo, the total value of KK’s land, and thus of the value of the company, if calculated on the basis of asset value, is reduced by EUR 876158 to EUR 619760. (48) The Commission furthermore considers that the value of the land intended for detached houses, terraced houses and blocks of apartments, and communal land and gardens was considerably overvalued, being based on the two errors outlined above, namely that the specific land at stake was not valued and secondly, that the valuation did not indicate what a market investor selling all the land at once would receive at the time of the transaction.
The total value of the land was, according to Finland, EUR 2660152.
Consequently, even calculating the value of the shares in this way, the entire amount paid for the shares in KK by Karkkila was aid to Componenta.
Table 2 Commission estimate of aid linked to the price of the shares in KK: | Euro | Net value KK according to Finland | 1495918 | Reduction based on real estate expert valuation of Asemansuo | 876158 | Estimated net value of KK after this correction | 619760 | Further overvaluation of land according to the Commission | At least 619760 | Net value of KK, based on asset value | 0 | (49) Since an investor buying the shares in KK could not expect a return on the capital and since the land was overvalued, the Commission concludes that the net value of the shares in KK was zero.
The evaluation should estimate the wholesale value of all the land owned by KK at the time of the transaction and, therefore, how much KK could have received if all its land was sold at that time on market terms.
The loan repayment (52) The other part of the financial transaction between Karkkila and Componenta was that Karkkila granted KK an interest-free loan of EUR 1,67 million, which KK used to immediately repay a loan it had been granted by Componenta in 1996.
That means that the total amount of the two loans was EUR 3,34 million. (53) Finland claims that KK was in a good financial position in 2003.
However, as stated in the previous section, the Commission’s assessment is that the KK land was not worth this much. (54) The annual reports of KK for the years 2001 to 2003 provide the following key figures: (amount in Euro) | Sales/income | Result | Cash (year end) | Own capital (year end) | 2000 | 19,883 | -14,817 | 94,147 | -207,052 | 2001 | 25,127 | -16,180 | 65,576 | -223,233 | 2002 | 50,015 | -1,879 | 53,425 | -225,113 | 2003 | 48,044 | -6,481 | 28,256 | -231,595 | (55) From this table it is clear that the demand for land was very limited during those four years.
The partial or total repayment of these loans should therefore be done equally to both lenders (Componenta and Karkkila) in order to avoid giving an advantage to one of them. (59) Since in the transaction at issue Componenta was fully repaid for the loan it had granted, it has to be assessed whether KK, in a normal market situation, would have been able to repay not only its loan to Componenta but also its loan to Karkkila, in order to ensure that no advantage was granted to Componenta.
The issue is thus whether KK would have been able to raise EUR 3,34 million on the market, to be used to repay its two shareholder loans. (60) If KK had not been financed by interest-free loans, but had, instead, had to pay the market interest rate on its loans of EUR 3,34 million, its annual interest payments would have been at least EUR 265000 per year.
This calculation is based on a Commission reference rate for 2003, plus 4 % points, which the Commission normally add for a company in difficulty (3,95 % + 4 % =7,59 % multiplied by 3,4 million). (61) Given the company's income over the past years and its cash situation, KK would have to sharply increase its annual income in order to service an interest-bearing debt of this amount.
This would mean that if KK had to sell land for at least EUR 300000 per year to service its debt and to cover some minimal administrative costs, it would after ten years, for example, have basically no assets left, but still owe the principal of EUR 3,34 million. (64) Therefore, the Commission concludes that even on the basis of a simple calculation it is evident that KK would not have been able to replace its two interest-free loans with a loan at the market rate.
Given the state of its finances, it is even unlikely that KK would be able to receive a smaller market-based loan, allowing it to repay part of its interest-free loans. (65) The Commission’s conclusion is that the transaction whereby KK received an interest-free loan of EUR 1,67 million from Karkkila, which KK immediately used to repay Componenta, did not comply with the market economy investor principle and is state aid to Componenta.
Appraisal of the compatibility of the aid in the light of the doubts expressed by the Commission (67) The Commission notes that its doubts on whether the transaction between Karkkila and Componenta was market-based have been confirmed, and that Componenta received aid of EUR 2383276,5. (68) The Commission also notes that this state aid was illegal, since it was not notified to the Commission. (69) The Commission further notes that the activities of Componenta involve trade between Member States and that state resources include financial assistance granted by regional and local authorities [6]. (70) The Commission therefore concludes that the aid, the existence of which has been established above, falls under the prohibition of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, since it was granted through state resources, threatens to distort competition by favouring an undertaking (Componenta), and affects trade between Member States. (71) The only exception to this prohibition is where the aid falls under one of the derogations stated in Article 87 of the Treaty.
Componenta had sales in 2003 of EUR 178 million, whereas the definition of an SME stipulates sales of no more than EUR 40 million.
Furthermore, the company’s average number of employees in 2003 was 1595, as against a maximum of 250 employees under the SME criteria. (73) The Commission furthermore concludes that the aid cannot be approved on the basis of any of the other derogations provided for in the Treaty, and in particular Article 87.
CONCLUSION (74) The Commission finds that Finland has unlawfully implemented aid for a total sum of EUR 2383276,5 in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
The aid has been illegally granted by the City of Karkkila, Finland to Componenta Oyj, Finland, in two parts. (75) The first part totals EUR 713092.5 in the form of a price above market price paid to Componenta Oyj for its shares in Karkkilan Keskustakiinteistöt Oy.
The aid amount would then be reduced by the corresponding proven value of the shares in Karkkilan Keskustakiinteistöt Oy sold to Karkkila City.
