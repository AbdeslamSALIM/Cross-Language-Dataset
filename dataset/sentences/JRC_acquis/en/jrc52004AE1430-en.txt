Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the &amp;lsquo;Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 on measures to provide information on, and to promote, agricultural products in third countries, and Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;2826/2000 on information and promotion actions for agricultural products on the internal market&amp;rsquo;(COM(2004) 233 final &amp;ndash; 2004/0073 (CNS)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 on measures to provide information on, and to promote, agricultural products in third countries, and Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000 on information and promotion actions for agricultural products on the internal market" (COM(2004) 233 final â€“ 2004/0073 (CNS)) (2005/C 120/08) On 21 April 2004, the Council of the European Union decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Articles 36 and 37 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
At its 412th plenary session on 27 and 28 October 2004 (meeting of 27 October 2004) the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 171 votes to one, with six abstentions. 1.
Gradual implementation only started in 2001 for third countries and in 2002 for the internal market. 2003 was the first year in which the system was fully operative.
For reasons of administrative simplification, the current degressive co-financing rates for multi-annual programmes should be eliminated and EU co-financing should be set at 50 %. 2.9 The acceptance of parafiscal taxes as a source of financing already implies that de facto, certain organisations cover 50 %.
That said, a minimum contribution of, say, 20 % from the organisation in question should be obligatory. 2.10 The Committee feels that it should be possible to support measures to promote flowers and plants on third-country markets in the same way as on the internal market. 2.11 It is an administrative burden and serves no objective purpose to subject Member States' financial contributions under this scheme to the Treaty rules on state aid.
