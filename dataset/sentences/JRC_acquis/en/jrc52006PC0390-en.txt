Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 89/391/EEC, its individual Directives and Council Directives 83/477/EEC, 91/383/EEC, 92/29/EEC and 94/33/EC with a view to simplifying and rationalising the reports on practical implementation /* COM/2006/0390 final - COD 2006/0127 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.07.2006 COM(2006) 390 final 2006/0127 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Directive 89/391/EEC, its individual Directives and Council Directives 83/477/EEC, 91/383/EEC, 92/29/EEC and 94/33/EC with a view to simplifying and rationalising the reports on practical implementation (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM BACKGROUND | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal This proposal aims to simplify and rationalise the provisions of the Community Directives concerning protection of the health and safety of workers at work that oblige the Member States and the Commission to draw up reports on their practical implementation.
At the moment, the different time intervals imposed by the various directives mean that evaluation exercises are carried out almost continuously, resulting in disproportionately high administrative costs. | 120 | General context A considerable number of Community Directives concerning protection of the health and safety of workers at work require the Member States to report to the Commission at regular intervals on the practical implementation of the Directives, indicating the social partners’ opinions.
Moreover, the proposal states that the structure of the report will be defined by the Commission, in cooperation with the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work. | 140 | Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union This proposal is consistent with the objectives of the European Union's other policies, particularly as regards improving the regulatory framework with the aim of making businesses more competitive.
The government representatives within this same committee have also expressed their support for an initiative aiming to reduce the adminstrative burden associated with the need to produce multiple reports. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | Use of external expertise was not necessary. | 230 | Impact assessment Option 1: Do nothing at this stage.
A financial statement is attached to this proposal. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 305 | Summary of the proposed action A new Article 17a entitled "Implementation reports" is added to Directive 89/391/EEC: It requires the Member States to submit to the Commission, every five years, a single report on the practical implementation of Directive 89/391/EEC and its individual Directives, indicating the social partners' points of view.
Article 2 of the proposal provides for the inclusion of a new Article on an implementation report in the directives that are not individual directives within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, namely Directives 83/477/EEC, 91/383/EEC, 92/29/EEC and 94/33/EC, requiring the Member States to submit their implementation reports to the Commission in the form of a specific chapter of the single report provided for under Article 17a (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, and this will serve as a basis for the evaluation to be carried out by the Commission in accordance with Article 17a (4).
Article 3 of the proposal repeals the provisions of the directives currently in force that deal with implementation reports. | 310 | Legal basis Article 137(2) of the EC Treaty. | 320 | Subsidiarity principle The subsidiarity principle applies in so far as the proposal concerns a field, the protection of the health and safety of workers at work, which does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. | The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the reasons below. | 323 | The directives' provisions cannot be amended or repealed at national level. | The objectives of the proposal can be better achieved by Community action for the following reasons. | 324 | This proposal amends a Community legal act in force and repeals certain provisions of several directives in the field in question, which could not be achieved by the Member States themselves.
On the other hand, it is a question of harmonising and rationalising the procedure for the preparation and submission of national reports on the practical implementation of the directives and the report to be produced by the Commission. | 325 | The proposal will improve the system for evaluating the health and safety at work Directives. | 326 | It will allow a significant reduction in the administrative burden resulting from the multiple obligations provided for in each directive. | 327 | The principle of subsidiarity is maintained, since the proposal amends existing Community provisions so as to improve and simplify their application. | The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons. | 331 | The proposal does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of simplifying and rationalising the existing legal framework in order to establish a single practical implementation report. | 332 | It is expected that the administrative burden on the Commission, the national authorities and the social partners will be significantly reduced. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instrument: directive. | 342 | Other instruments would not be adequate for the following reasons.
Since it is a question of amending a directive and repealing the provisions of several directives, the only suitable method is the adoption of a directive. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS | 409 | The proposal has no implications for the Community budget. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | 510 | Simplification | 511 | The proposal simplifies the legislative framework, the administrative procedures applicable to (national or European) public authorities and the administrative procedures applicable to bodies and private individuals. | 512 | Currently, most of the existing Directives concerning protection of the health and safety of workers at work require the Member States to prepare and submit to the Commission, at different intervals, national practical implementation reports, indicating the social partners’ points of view, and require the Commission to prepare its own report on the implementation of the directives.
This proposal simplifies and rationalises the exercise by harmonising the intervals for the submission of national reports to the Commission and requiring only one practical implementation report, which will include a general section and specific chapters on the aspects particular to each directive. | 513 | The national authorities will have to prepare and submit only one report on the implementation of the directives every five years.
The Commission will also see a considerable simplification of its tasks, as it will receive and have to process only one report from each Member State every five years, rather than multiple reports from each of them. | 514 | The tasks of the social partners will also be simplified in that their contributions will be limited to a single practical implementation report every five years. | 516 | The proposal forms part of the Commission programme updating and simplifying the Community acquis. | 520 | Repeal of existing legislation The adoption of this proposal will mean that some legislative provisions must be repealed. | 560 | European Economic Area This draft instrument has to do with an area covered by the EEA Agreement and must therefore be extended to the European Economic Area. | 570 | Detailed explanation of the proposal by chapter or by article This proposal simplifies the obligations imposed respectively on the Member States to report on the practical implementation of the directives and on the Commission to prepare a report based on the national reports, by harmonising the intervals for the preparation of reports and their submission to the Commission and requiring a single practical implementation report, which will include a general section and chapters specific to each directive in question.
Article 2 of the proposal provides for the inclusion of a new Article on an implementation report in the directives that are not individual directives within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, namely Directives 83/477/EEC, 91/383/EEC, 92/29/EEC and 94/33/EC, requiring the Member States to submit their implementation reports to the Commission in the form of a specific chapter of the single report provided for under Article 17a (1), (2) and (3) of Directive 89/391/EEC and this will serve as a basis for the evaluation to be carried out by the Commission in accordance with Article 17a (4).
Article 3 of the proposal repeals the provisions on the practical implementation reports in the directives concerned.
This does not necessarily imply the adoption of legislative, regulatory or administrative acts at Member State level. | 1. 2006/0127 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL amending Council Directive 89/391/EEC, its individual Directives and Council Directives 83/477/EEC, 91/383/EEC, 92/29/EEC and 94/33/EC with a view to simplifying and rationalising the reports on practical implementation (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof, Having regard to the Commission's proposal[31], presented after consultation of the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[32], after consultation of the Committee of the Regions, Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions[33], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[34], Whereas: 2.
