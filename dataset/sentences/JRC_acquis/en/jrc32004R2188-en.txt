By letter dated 14 June 2004, Nepal has submitted a request for the renewal of this derogation. (4) The request submitted by Nepal has been considered by the Commission and has been found to be duly substantiated. (5) When the validity of Regulation (EC) No 1615/2000 was extended, it was considered that its expiry should coincide with the ending of the current GSP scheme, which was due to end on that date.
However, Council Regulation (EC) No 2211/2003 [6] extended the validity of the GSP scheme for a further year, until 31 December 2005. (6) On 18 December 2003, the Commission published a Green Paper on the future of rules of origin in preferential trade arrangements [7] which opened a wide-ranging debate on the subject.
However, no decisions have yet been taken and no new rules will be in place before 31 December 2004. (7) A prolongation of the derogation should not prejudge or prejudice the outcome of discussions on possible new rules of origin for GSP.
It shall apply from 1 January 2005.
Done at Brussels, 20 December 2004.
