For a number of whitefish species, for example, average first-sale prices stagnated or even decreased between 2000 and the first half of 2005[2].
Rising costs The recent rise in fuel prices has significantly added to operating costs for fishing vessels.
Between January 2003 and December 2005 prices for Maritime Bunker Fuels increased significantly [10].
Prices for the fuel used in long range fishing (380 CST) remained relatively stable in 2004; however, these prices nearly doubled in 2005.
It is also crucial to put these rescue and restructuring measures in a longer-term perspective so that the fishing industry can adapt to the new situation marked by high fuel prices.
The purpose of restructuring must be to ensure the profitability of the enterprise within the meaning of paragraph 37 of these guidelines by reducing operational costs without increasing current overall fishing effort and capacity.
The power of the new engines of more than 130 kW covered by such State aid will be verified on the basis of the “NOx certificate”[17].
Compatibility of certain operating aid The current difficulties in the fishing industry have been aggravated by the recent increase in fuel prices.
For the Community, which has adopted an eco-system-based approach to fisheries management in the 2002 reform of the CFP, this is not only highly desirable for stock conservation reasons but also will contribute to rebuilding economic profitability in the fishing industry.
The newly created Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo, which is set to start its activities in 2006, will provide the Community with a great opportunity to improve control of fishing activities and enforcement of fishing regulations across the Union.
This Communication aims to set a framework for stakeholders, Member States and the Community institutions to participate in delivering both short-term rescue measures for fishing enterprises in difficulty and the structural adjustments in the fishing industry that are necessary for its long-term sustainability and prosperity.

[2] See Graph 1. [3] Other factors, such as climate change and pollution, possibly also contribute to stock depletion, although to a much lesser degree than over-fishing.
