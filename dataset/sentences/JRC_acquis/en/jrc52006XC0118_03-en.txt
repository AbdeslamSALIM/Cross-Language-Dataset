In a letter received on 4 November 2005, the Kingdom of the Netherlands notified under Article 95(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community a request for derogation to Directive 98/69/EC [1].
The Kingdom of the Netherlands intends to adopt a new decree which would set more stringent emission limits for diesel vehicles of 5 milligrams per kilometre for particulate matter.
This new national provision would apply as from 1 January 2007 on diesel passenger cars and some light commercial vehicles (category M1 and N1, class 1, as defined by Annex II to Directive 70/156/EC [2]). 2.
The Kingdom of the Netherlands therefore deems it necessary to derogate from Directive 98/69/EC and to introduce new national provisions setting a limit value of 5 milligrams per kilometre for particulate matter emissions from diesel passenger cars and some light duty vehicles entering into force on 1 January 2007. 6.
