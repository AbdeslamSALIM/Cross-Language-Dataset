2006/639/EC: Commission Decision of 23 November 2005 on the State Aid which Italy is planning to implement for Fincantieri (notified under document number C(2005) 4433) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 23 November 2005 on the State Aid which Italy is planning to implement for Fincantieri (notified under document number C(2005) 4433) (Only the Italian version is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/639/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 of 29 June 1998 establishing new rules on aid to shipbuilding [1], Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above [2] and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 31 July 2003, Italy notified the Commission of the aid.
By letters dated 16 September 2003, 6 November 2003, 1 December 2003, 4 February 2004, 12 February 2004, 26 February 2004, 5 April 2004, 25 May 2004, 23 June 2004 and 8 July 2004, it provided the Commission with further information. (2) By letter dated 22 October 2004, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the aid. (3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union [3].
It forwarded them to Italy, which was given the opportunity to react; its comments were received by letter dated 12 April 2005. (5) Other letters were received from Italy dated 25 November 2005, 18 May 2005 and 12 October 2005.
The extension was requested for Fincantieri, for the delivery of five cruise ships, for a total contract value of € 2,1 billion and an aid amount of € 243 million. (7) Fincantieri is a state-owned company operating eight shipyards (Monfalcone, Marghera, Sestri Ponente, Ancona, Palermo, Castellammare, Muggiano, Riva Trigoso) in Italy.
Fincantieri agreed to this and Italy requested an extension of the delivery limit so that the ships could still qualify for operating aid. (10) In their notification the Italian authorities referred to the Commission's decision of 5 June 2002 [4] authorising a similar extension of the delivery date for a cruise ship under construction at Meyer Werft, Germany.
Italy emphasised the similarities between the two cases in terms of (i) the reason given for the extension (the impact of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks), (ii) the relevant market (cruises) and (iii) the commercial dependency existing between the shipyard and the shipowner (Carnival is Fincantieri's largest customer). (11) By decision dated 20 October 2004 the Commission granted the extension of the delivery limit for four of the ships, but expressed doubts that it could grant the extension for the fifth.
The doubts concerned ship 6079 with planned delivery in October 2005.
This ship was originally intended to be delivered in 2005 but the delivery date was changed to December 2003 in late 2000; otherwise the ship would not have been eligible for operating aid. (12) The aid amount that Italy would grant to Fincantieri if the Commission were to extend the delivery limit for ship 6079 is approximately € 33 million (9 % of the contract value of the ship). (13) There were chiefly two reasons for initiating the formal procedure.
Furthermore, for the shipyard at Marghera, the outfitting planned for 2003 would have amounted to around 40 % more than the yard had ever done before.
The Commission therefore had doubts as to whether the production plan for Fincantieri in general, and for Marghera in particular, was realistic. (15) For these two reasons the Commission doubted that all five ships could have been delivered in 2005.
The delivery of this ship was postponed in relation to the December 2000 production plan owing to the decision to build ship 6077 at Marghera.
As regards the Commission's estimation that the December 2000 production plan would have involved, in 2003, twice as much outfitting work as Fincantieri had ever done in any other year, Italy refutes that statement and claims that in almost all the yards the December 2000 production plan would have relied on the "standard capacity" of the yard in question, and only in certain cases would peak capacity have been reached. (25) In reply to the Commission statement that for the Marghera shipyard the outfitting planned for 2003 would have amounted to around 40 % more than the yard had ever done before, Italy states that the workload (including outfitting) scheduled for the Marghera yard in the plan dating from 2000 was absolutely consistent with the capacities and capabilities actually demonstrated by the yard since it had previously managed to deliver four ships in 15 months, as was planned for 2003. (26) Italy was also offered the opportunity to comment on the essential elements of the report by the independent expert whom the Commission consulted when it assessed the information provided by Italy prior to the launch of the formal investigation procedure. (27) In its reply dated 18 May 2005 Italy commented on three main aspects of the expert's report. (28) First, according to Italy, the expert based his assessments on total delivery in the year 2003, without taking account of the production cycle, in other words the gradual increase in compensated gross tonnage (cgt) that occurs throughout the construction period.
The Court of Justice of the European Communities has consistently held that the criterion of trade being affected is met if the recipient firm carries out an economic activity involving trade between Member States. (35) The Commission notes that the question of extending the delivery limit is decisive for determining whether the ship in question qualifies for contract-related operating aid under Article 3 of the Shipbuilding Regulation.
The Commission notes that the Council adopted the Shipbuilding Regulation on that basis on 29 June 1998. (37) The Commission notes that, according to the Shipbuilding Regulation, "shipbuilding" means building of self-propelled seagoing commercial vessels.
Consequently, the last delivery date for a vessel qualifying for operating aid was, in principle, 31 December 2003. (40) Article 3(2) stipulates, however, that the Commission may grant an extension of the three-year delivery limit when this is found justified by the technical complexity of the individual shipbuilding project concerned or by delays resulting from unexpected disruptions of a substantial and defensible nature in the working programme of a yard due to exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the company.
It should be noted that Italy bases its request for extension of the delivery limit on such exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances. (41) The Commission notes that the Court of First Instance interpreted a similar provision in its judgment of 16 March 2000 [5], in which it stated that the provision in question must be given a restrictive interpretation.
Appraisal of the compatibility of the aid in the light of the doubts expressed by the Commission and the comments submitted by Italy and Fincantieri (42) The Commission first points out that the present Decision concerns one ship, but the assessment is based on the entire production planned by Fincantieri in December 2000.
The Commission therefore considered it necessary to verify that Fincantieri would have been technically able to deliver the ships in question by the end of 2003. (43) The additional information provided by Italy and Fincantieri in response to the doubts raised by the Commission in its decision initiating the formal procedure was analysed by the Commission and by an independent technical expert [6] at the Commission's request.
The Commission therefore considers that the Palermo yard would not have been able to fulfil the December 2000 plan as regards outfitting, and Italy has not given any reply on this point. (49) The Commission also notes that the information provided by Italy and Fincantieri shows that it was not clear in December 2000 whether the outfitting of ship 6077 was intended to take place at ATSM or at Ancona.
Outfitting by the Fincantieri group (53) In the decision initiating the formal procedure, the Commission estimated that delivery of all five ships plus all the other ships planned would have involved twice as much outfitting work as Fincantieri had ever done before, and that for the Marghera shipyard the outfitting planned for 2003 would have amounted to around 40 % more than the yard had ever done before. (54) Italy replied, for one thing, that the hull erection capacity was sufficient.
This argument is however not relevant, since the Commission did not question the ability to construct the hulls. (55) Fincantieri and Italy also question the Commission's estimates of the amount of outfitting in relation to previous years and argue for example that the increase was not more than 20 %.
The Commission's view, supported by the expert's assessment, is that Italy, although providing some figures on how it had planned to accomplish all the outfitting, has not given a proper reply to this important point. (58) In its letter dated 12 October 2005, Italy comments on this point made by the expert, stating that delivery of two ships within a period of two months was feasible, and that for example nine months had been set aside for ship 6078, compared with seven months for 6079, so as to be able to work on 6079 if necessary.
However, this took place in shipyards that were able to work in the normal way, outfitting one ship at a time. (60) The fact that Marghera managed in the past to deliver four ships in 15 months does not dispel the Commission's doubts, since they mainly concern the two planned deliveries within two months.
Nevertheless, when ships are built in different locations, and even with different production methods, it is clear that this learning curve is much less significant than when there is repeated production in the same yard. (64) The Commission notes that the three sister ships 6077, 6078 and 6079 would not have been built at the same yards and with the same production methods under the December 2000 plan.
It also notes that according to Italy ship 6079 is in fact not the third in a series but the fifth, and that labour savings of 16 % and 8 % for the first and second sister ships had already been achieved.
Another such example would be contracts with subcontractors, which should have been concluded before the end of July 2001 according to the process description presented by Italy, and in any event before September 2001.
Expected delivery of the ship (68) The Commission finally notes that according to a press release issued on 20 June 2005 by the ship operator (Holland America Line), the vessel in question (ship 6079), to be named MS Noordam, is to be delivered in January 2006.
CONCLUSION (69) The Commission has analysed the information provided by Italy following the Commission decision to open a formal investigation into the technical ability to deliver all the ships that were scheduled for delivery in 2003 according to Fincantieri's December 2000 plan, and in particular hull 6079.
In the Commission's view the information that Italy has provided has not dispelled the doubts it raised concerning the feasibility of the December 2000 plan submitted by Italy.
The doubts concerning the ability to deliver ship 6079 by the end of 2003 have therefore been confirmed. (71) The Commission notes that it has already authorised an extension of the delivery limit for four ships produced by Fincantieri, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the Shipbuilding Regulation.
Article 2 Italy shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.
Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.
