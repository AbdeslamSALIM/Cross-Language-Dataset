The main objective of the new Partnership Agreement is to strengthen cooperation between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco, thereby creating a framework of partnership in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and reasonable exploitation of fisheries resources in Moroccan fishing zones, in the interests of both parties.
The Partnership Agreement also provides for cooperation between the two sides with a view to promoting the economic integration of Community operators into the fishing industry in Morocco.
Of this, annual financial support of EUR 13 500 000 is to be put towards defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Morocco, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing.
The fishing opportunities provided for in the Agreement have been laid down: (1) for the small-scale fishing category: 20 seiners for fishing pelagic species in the north, 20 vessels for small-scale fishing in the south, 30 bottom longliners for small-scale fishing in the north, and 27 pole-and-line vessels; (2) 22 trawlers and bottom longliners for demersal fishing; (3) an annual quota of 60 000 tonnes for industrial pelagic fishing.
Shipowners’ fees have been fixed for each category, and could contribute an additional annual income of around EUR 3 million for Morocco.
The Commission proposes on this basis that the Council adopt the conclusion of this new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Morocco by Regulation. 2005/0280 (CNS) Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION on the conclusion of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 in conjunction with Article 300(2) and the first subparagraph of Article 300(3) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament, Whereas: 1.

The Community fleet has benefited from a fisheries agreement with Morocco since 1988, as renewed in 1992 and 1995.
It covered a number of categories of fishing, and provided fishing opportunities for 629 Community vessels in 1995, and 516 in 1999.
The Partnership Agreement also provides for cooperation between the two sides with a view to promoting the economic integration of Community operators into the fishing industry in Morocco.
The Agreement provides for: - 20 seiners for fishing for pelagic species in the north, - 20 vessels for small-scale fishing in the south, - 30 bottom longliners for small-scale fishing in the north, - 27 pole-and-line vessels, - 22 trawlers and bottom longliners for demersal fishing.
An annual quota of 60 000 tonnes is also provided for industrial pelagic fishing.
Of this financial contribution, annual financial support of EUR 13 500 000 is to be put towards defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Morocco, with a view to introducing responsible and sustainable fishing.
The new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Community and the Kingdom of Morocco aims to: ( promote sustainable fishing activities and provide a binding framework for all parties concerned (the Community, the Member States, Community operators and third countries) to attain this objective; ( protect and develop Community fishing activities in the waters of third countries and improve their political and social impact both in Europe and, in this particular case, in Morocco.
The new Agreement therefore takes account of the environmental and economic situation in Morocco, and will be implemented by the two sides taking into account Moroccan environmental and development objectives. 5.3.
The aim of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco is to open up access by Community vessels to the Moroccan fishing zone for the categories of fishing provided for in the Agreement: (1) for small-scale fishing: 20 seiners for fishing pelagic species in the north, 20 vessels for small-scale fishing in the south, 30 bottom longliners for small-scale fishing in the north, and 27 pole-and-line vessels; (2) for demersal fishing: 22 trawlers and bottom longliners; (3) for industrial pelagic fishing: an annual quota of 60 000 tonnes.
The global financial contribution was fixed at EUR 36 100 000 per year.
These fishing opportunities may, however, be increased by mutual agreement provided that the conclusions of the scientific meeting referred to in Article 3 confirm that such an increase does not endanger the sustainable management of Moroccan resources.
The financial contribution will increase proportionally in this case, but may not exceed EUR 72 200 000.
The following indicators will be used in the context of the ABM for the purposes of monitoring implementation of the agreement: ( monitoring the utilisation rate of the fishing opportunities; ( gathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the agreement; ( contribution to employment and value added in the Community; ( contribution to stabilising the Community market; ( contribution to the general objectives of reducing poverty in Morocco, including the contribution to employment, development of infrastructure and support for the state budget; ( number and type of concrete results expected through the use of the percentage of the financial contribution allocated to responsible fishing in the Moroccan fishing zone (Article 7 of the Protocol); ( number of Joint Committee and technical meetings; 5.4 Method of implementation (indicative) Show below the method(s)[11] chosen for the implementation of the action.

The main results of this evaluation will soon be available on the DG FISH website. 6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation To prepare for negotiations of the agreement, the consultant carried out an ex-ante evaluation to study the possible developments in future relations between the European Community and Morocco, in particular in relation to the access conditions for the Community fleet to Moroccan fishing zones.
For demersal and industrial pelagic fishing the estimated turnover is EUR 54 million, with a gross value-added of EUR 29.5 million. - The economic impact of the activities of European vessels under the Agreement, in terms of employment, which, based on the coefficient of 1.1 shore-based jobs[12] to 1 job on board, may be estimated as follows: EC jobs on board | 639-717 | (estimate) | Total number of jobs on board Community vessels | 1 353-1 467 | (estimate) | Shore-based jobs | 1 488-1 614 | 1.1 shore-based job for each job on board | Total EC jobs | 3 480 – 3 798 | The fisheries agreement with Morocco would therefore help support around 3 500 Community jobs, the vast majority in areas dependent on fisheries (particularly the Canary Islands and Andalusia).
Under accompanying measures, the Protocol provides for EUR 1 250 000 per year over its lifetime to support the programme of withdrawal of driftnets.
Monitoring and supervision: The Agreement will help promote monitoring of fishing activity in Moroccan waters. 6.2.2 Ex-ante estimate of the economic value of the Agreement and the Community’s financial contribution In accordance with the Council conclusions on the Commission Communication, the Community’s financial contribution granted under the Agreement is a single allocation established on the basis of the fishing opportunities made available, the identification of measures to encourage the development of sustainable fisheries by the third country and the impact of the Partnership Agreement, in particular as regards the integration of European operators into the fishing industry of Morocco.
SMALL-SCALE FISHING | DEMERSAL FISHING | PELAGIC FISHING | TOTAL | North pelagic species (%lt%90GT) | North bottom longline (%lt%40GT) | South line, pole, trap (%lt%80GT) | Tuna | Number of vessels | 20 | 30 | 20 | 27 | 22 | 119 | Estimated volume of catches per fleet/year | 35 000 t | 9 750 t | 2 500 t | 10 800 t | 22 000 | 60 000t | Estimated value of catches per fleet/year | EUR 52 500 000 | EUR 28 500 000 | EUR 7 500 000 | EUR 10 800 000 | EUR 44 000 000 | EUR 24 000 000 | EUR 167 300 000 | As regards the shipowners’ contribution, there is a general increase in fees compared to the same categories of fishing in the earlier Agreement.
In order to be able to compare real fees under the two agreements (in particular for categories 1, 2, 3 and 5), it was necessary to convert the unit cost per GT, as provided for in this Agreement, into GRT (as in the earlier Agreement).
Fishing category | Fee EUR per GT per quarter | Fee in GRT equivalent (ratio 1.40) | Fee 1995/99 (EUR per GRT per quarter) for the corresponding fishing category | Change | 1 | 67 | 93.8 | 61 | +53% | 2 | 60 | 84 | 61 | +37% | 3 | 60 | 84 | 48 | +75% | 5 | 53 | 74.2 | 52 | +43% | 4 | 25 (EUR/tonne) | n.a. | 20 (EUR/tonne) | +25% | 6 | 20 (EUR/tonne) | n.a. | n.a. | n.a. | Generally speaking, the overall contribution of shipowners should be around EUR 3.4 million per year. 6.2.3 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) In view of the time that has elapsed between the expiry of the previous Agreement (1999) and the 2005 negotiations, and the major changes made to the negotiating strategy and the stakes, an ex-post evaluation, stricto sensu, did not appear relevant to the conclusion of the new Partnership Agreement.
According to assessments by experts, the present situation of stocks could allow an increase in fishing effort, giving the following fishing opportunities: a quota of 120 000 tonnes for industrial pelagic fishing, a fleet of 22 vessels for demersal fishing, around 25 small-scale fishing vessels targeting small pelagic species in the north, 20 vessels for small-scale fishing in the south, between 30 and 35 bottom longliners for small-scale fishing and 32 pole-and-line vessels. 6.2.4 Terms and frequency of future evaluation Before renewing the Protocol, an ex-post evaluation covering the entire period of application (2006-10) will be carried out to measure the indicators relating to the results (catches and value of catches) and the impacts (jobs created and maintained, relationship between the cost of the Protocol and the value of the catches etc.).

Industrial pelagic fishing is managed by limiting the number of vessels fishing simultaneously. [4] Differentiated appropriations. [5] Non-differentiated appropriations. [6] Planned for 2006. [7] Expenditure that does not fall under Chapter 11 01 01 of the Title 11 concerned. [8] In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol, the fishing opportunities may be increased by mutual agreement provided that the conclusions of the scientific meeting confirm that such an increase will not endanger the sustainable management of Moroccan resources.
In this case the financial contribution shall be increased proportionately and pro rata temporis .
