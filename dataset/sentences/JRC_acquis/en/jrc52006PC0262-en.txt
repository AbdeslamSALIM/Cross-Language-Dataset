Amended Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles (codified version) (presented by the Commission pursuant to Article 250 (2) of the EC Treaty) /* COM/2006/0262 final - COD 2003/0059 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 2.6.2006 COM(2006) 262 final 2003/0059 (COD) Amended Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles (Codified version) (presented by the Commission pursuant to Article 250 (2) of the EC Treaty) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
On 28 March 2003 the Commission presented a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive codifying Council Directive 93/31/EEC of 14 June 1993 on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles[1].
The changes made in this amended proposal, compared with the initial proposal, are the following: Recital 1 is replaced by the following: “Council Directive 93/31/EEC of 14 June 1993 on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles* laid down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of two-wheel motor vehicles as regards their stands.
Recital 5 is changed as follows: “This Directive is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC.
Consequently the provisions laid down in Directive 2002/24/EC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.” Recital 6 is replaced by the following: “Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely the granting of component type-approval in respect of the stand for a type of two-wheel motor vehicle, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. ê 93/31/EEC Recital 4 (adapted) (2) Ö This Directive is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Directive 2002/24/EC.
Consequently the provisions laid down in Directive 2002/24/EC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to this Directive.
