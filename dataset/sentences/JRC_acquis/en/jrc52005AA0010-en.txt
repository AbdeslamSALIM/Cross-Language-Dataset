On the other hand, the proposed revision does not provide solutions to certain management needs as indicated in paragraphs 21, 26, 29, 30, 32 and 39.
In this context, the explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal sets out as the guiding principles for the revision, to ensure stability of rules and, in particular, of the budgetary principles as laid down in Article 2 of the Financial Regulation [7]. 10.
However, in addition to editorial changes, the draft revision contains proposals for amendments to 74 articles — 40 % of the current articles — affecting almost every title of the Regulation.
Notwithstanding that Article 184 of the Financial Regulation provides for its review every three years, there is a need to limit modifications to those which are strictly necessary, in order to maintain the stability in the financial rules. 15.
The Court's Opinion focuses on Titles I to VI of the Common Provisions since the proposed amendments to Title VII "Presentation of the Accounts and Accounting" of Part One of the Regulation (Common Provisions) and Part Three (Transitional and Final Provisions) are mostly of a technical nature and consist of updating provisions in the light of the accounting changes that have taken effect since 1 January 2005.
Budgetary principles 16.
However, the proposed changes affect the principles of: - budgetary unity (Article 5a: interest generated by prefinancing), - annuality (Article 149: the carrying over of non-differentiated EAGF [9] appropriations; Article 160a: making research appropriations available again; Articles 12 and 150: advance commitment of expenditure for humanitarian aid and the EAGF), - universality (Article 18: earmarking of revenue from contributions from Member States for external aid programmes and from the sale of equipment), - specification (Article 23: transfers from the "provisions" titles; transfers of administrative appropriations; notification procedure; Articles 26, 45 and 46: adaptations due to the abolition of the reserve relating to loans and loan guarantees to third countries), - transparency (Article 29): extension of the deadline for publishing the budget. 18.
Principle of annuality 19.
As a result of the approval of financial discipline measures for direct payments under the common agricultural policy [11], the Commission proposes that the possibility of carry-over should be extended to include non-differentiated appropriations (Article 149).
Principle of universality 21.
Contrary to the principle laid down in Article 7 of the Financial Regulation, commitment appropriations for transactions relating to purchase or construction of buildings do not cover the total cost of the legal commitments entered into, because administrative appropriations are non-differentiated appropriations under Article 179 of the same Regulation.
Principle of specification 23.
Principle of transparency 24.
The proposed amendment of Article 29 extends the deadline for publication of the budget by one month compared with the current Regulation.
Implementation of the budget 27.
The proposed changes to Title IV of the Financial Regulation aim, in particular: - to clarify and define more precisely the roles and responsibilities of the persons involved in the various methods of implementing the budget: shared, decentralised, joint, centralised and indirect management (Articles 52 to 57), - to define clearly the responsibilities of the Authorising Officers and Accounting Officers in respect of accounting information (Articles 60 and 61), - to align the rules on the financial responsibility of the financial actors more precisely with the rules laid down in the provisions concerning persons employed by the Communities (Article 66), - to ensure better protection of the financial interests of the Community via the strengthening of the rules for the recovery of amounts receivable (Articles 72 and 73).
In order for the Accounting Officers to be in a position to certify that the accounts present a true and fair view as provided by Article 123 of the current Financial Regulation, such validation should cover the effective functioning of systems over the period concerned and thus the reliability of the data produced and not only the introduction or modification of such systems as is the current practice.
The proposed amendment to Article 66 relegates to the Staff Regulations the requirement on liability for payment of compensation.
Interinstitutional cooperation 33.
The amendments also aim to: - dispense with the requirement for each Institution to keep its own database concerning tenderers excluded from participation in a procurement procedure (Article 95), by providing for the possibility of several Institutions sharing a common database, - extend to other fields the simplified regime for appointing experts in the research area (Article 97), - clarify the cases where procurement procedures may be suspended or the performance of contracts halted in the event of fraud (Article 103). 36.
Cases of exclusion 37.
The appointment of experts 38.
Interinstitutional cooperation 39.
The creation of common databases of cases of exclusion to be shared between different Institutions (proposed amendment to Article 95 of the Financial Regulation) is an example of interinstitutional cooperation.
The non-profit principle 42.
Moreover, the amendment to Article 109 proposes to apply the non-profit principle at the level of an action rather than at the level of each beneficiary individually.
In addition, only part of the strict conditions imposed by the current implementing rules as regards certain exceptions has been included in the proposed amendments: - a rule excluding the grant of surplus revenue to the members of beneficiary organisations, leading to their personal enrichment, - a limitation, in the case of flat-rate amounts, to contributions lower than 5000 euro, as the Commission intends to provide more detail in the implementing rules.
Non-cumulation principle 46.
However, recent audits by the Court on this subject identified the risk of aid exceeding 100 % of the costs funded and, in the area of research, non compliance with the applicable threshold for State aid [26].
The Court concludes that it would be preferable to continue to apply the principle of "one measure — one Community aid": - by providing that the rate of subsidy may cover aspects of several Community policies — provided that the rate does not exceed 100 % of the eligible costs incurred and/or the thresholds applicable under the State aid rules, - by improving interdepartmental coordination of Community interventions.
Procurement contracts 49.
