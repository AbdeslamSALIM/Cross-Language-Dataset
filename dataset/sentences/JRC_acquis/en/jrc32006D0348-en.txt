2006/348/EC: Commission Decision of 3 January 2006 on the national provisions notified by the Republic of Finland under Article 95(4) of the EC Treaty concerning the maximum admissible content of cadmium in fertilisers (notified under document number C(2005) 5542) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 3 January 2006 on the national provisions notified by the Republic of Finland under Article 95(4) of the EC Treaty concerning the maximum admissible content of cadmium in fertilisers (notified under document number C(2005) 5542) (Only the Finnish and Swedish texts are authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/348/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95(6) thereof, Whereas: I.
This derogation wass applicable until 31 December 2005. (5) Directive 76/116/EEC, as amended, has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 relating to fertilisers [3]. (6) Article 35(2), of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 states that derogations from Article 7 of Directive 76/116/EEC that were granted by the Commission under Article 95(6) of the Treaty shall be construed as derogations from Article 5 of the present Regulation and shall continue to produce their effects notwithstanding the entry into force of this Regulation. (7) Recital 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 announces that the Commission will address the issue of unintentional cadmium content in mineral fertilisers and will, where appropriate, draw up a proposal for a Regulation and will present it to the European Parliament and the Council. (8) Work is in progress to prepare a Commission proposal on cadmium in fertilisers. 2.
The accession of Finland (9) Finland acceded to the European Union on 1 January 1995.
Article 84 of and point 2 of Annex X to the Act of Accession provide that Article 7 of Directive 76/116/EEC, in so far as it concerns the cadmium content of fertilisers, shall not apply to Finland before 1 January 1999 and that the provisions of Directive 76/116/EEC will be reviewed in accordance with Community procedures by 31 December 1998. (10) Article 2 of the Act of Accession provides that "from the date of accession, the provisions of the original Treaties and the acts adopted by the institutions before accession shall be binding on the new Member States and shall apply in those States under the conditions laid down in those Treaties and in this Act".
Article 168 of the Act of Accession stipulates that "the new Member States shall put into effect the measures necessary for them to comply, from the date of accession, with the provisions of directives and decisions within the meaning of Article 189 (now Article 249) of the EC Treaty (â&#x20AC;Ś), unless a time limit is provided for in the list of Annex XIX or in any other provisions of this Act". (11) Directive 98/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [5], subsequently amended Directive 76/116/EEC as regards the marketing in Austria, Finland and Sweden of fertilisers containing cadmium.
Article 1 provides that, inter alia, Finland may prohibit the marketing on its territory of fertilisers containing cadmium at concentrations in excess of that which were fixed nationally at the date of accession and that this derogation applies for the period from 1 January 1999 until 31 December 2001. (12) On 7 December 2001, the Republic of Finland notified existing national legislation, deviating from the provisions of Directive 76/116/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to fertilisers.
After careful consideration, Decision 2002/398/EC granted a prolongation of the derogation from Directive 76/116/EEC until 31 December 2005. 3.
National provisions (13) The Decision of Finland's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry on fertilisers [6] No 45/1994 of 21 January 1994, inter alia, lays down a limit value for the cadmium content in fertilisers, including EC-designated fertilisers.
According to Section 3, it is prohibited to place on the Finnish market phosphorus mineral fertilisers with a cadmium content exceeding 50 mg for each kilogram of phosphorus.
The Finnish authorities request an extension of the current derogation provided by Decision 2002/398/EC. (15) By letter of 30 June 2005, the Commission informed the Finnish authorities that it had received the notification under Article 95(4) and that the six months period for its examination according to Article 95(6) started on 8 June 2005, the day following the one when the notification was received. (16) By letter of 10 August 2005, the Commission informed the other Member States about the request received from Finland.
This Decision allows Finland to maintain the application of national provisions incompatible with those concerning the composition of EC-denominated fertilisers contained in Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003. (19) As already indicated, Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 prevents Member States from restricting the marketing of EC-denominated fertilisers because of their composition, but the rules governing composition do not set any limit value for cadmium content.
This means that pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003, EC-denominated fertilisers complying with the requirements of that Regulation can be placed on the market regardless of their cadmium content. (20) In the light of the abovementioned, it is clear that the national provisions notified by Finland, in so far as they prohibit the placing on the market of EC-denominated phosphorus mineral fertilisers with a cadmium content exceeding 50 mg for each kilogram of phosphorus, are more restrictive than those contained in Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003. (21) The national provisions notified by the Finnish authorities were adopted before Finland acceded to the European Union.
By Directive 98/97/EC Finland was authorised to continue to apply the above national provisions until 31 December 2001.
Decision 2002/398/EC extended the derogation until December 2005. (22) As required by Article 95(4), as interpreted in the light of Articles 2 and 168 of the Act of Accession, Finland notified the Commission of the actual wording of the national provisions adopted before the accession to the European Union that it intends to maintain, accompanying the request by an explanation of the reasons which, in its opinion, justify the maintenance of those provisions. (23) The reasons provided by the Finnish authorities are those already submitted in the past and that lead the Commission, in Decision 2002/398/EC, to grant a derogation until 31 December 2005.
Although work is in progress, legislation would not be adopted at Community level before the end of the year. (24) The notification submitted by Finland on 7 June 2005 in order to obtain approval for maintaining national provisions derogating from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 is therefore to be considered admissible under Article 95(4) as interpreted in the light of Articles 2 and 168 of the Act of Accession. 2.
Assessment of merits (25) In accordance with Article 95 of the Treaty, the Commission has to ensure that all the conditions enabling a Member State to avail itself of the possibilities of derogation provided for in this article are fulfilled. (26) In particular, the Commission has to assess whether the provisions notified by the Member State are justified on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 30 of the Treaty, or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment. (27) In addition, pursuant to Article 95(6) of the Treaty, where it considers that the national provisions are justified, the Commission must check whether or not those national provisions are a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between Member States and whether or not they constitute an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. (28) Finland has based its request on the need of protection of human health and the environment.
In support of its request, Finland makes reference to the conclusions of a Finnish study published in April 2000 [8] which contains an assessment of the risks posed by cadmium-containing fertilisers. 2.1.
This conclusion can be reached both by using mean extractable cadmium concentrations [9] and 90 percentile values in the five Finnish cultivation zones for the year 1987.
While the average cadmium intake from food alone does not pose a risk in Finland, some sectors of the population are at risk because of high dietary intake, increased absorption and/or smoking. (33) The risk assessment submitted by the Finnish authorities has been carried out according to the procedures and the methodology established at Community level, which are considered to ensure a high degree of reliability of the information obtained. (34) The Commission already examined the information contained in the risk assessment in the context of Decision 2002/398/EC which allowed Finland to maintain their national provisions until 31 December 2005. (35) No other scientific and technical data was provided by Finland in 2005.
The concept enshrined in Article 95(6) is intended to prevent the national provisions based on the criteria set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 being applied for inappropriate reasons, and in reality constituting economic measures to be introduced to impede the import of products from other Member States in order to indirectly protect national production. (41) As already established, there is concern with regard to the protection of the environment and human health due to the application on soil of cadmium-containing fertilisers.
The derogation shall apply until harmonised measures on cadmium in fertilisers are applicable at Community level.
