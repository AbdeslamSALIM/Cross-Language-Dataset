whereas this surplus consists of various elements, the most important being the under-spending of EUR 4729 million, C.
whereas the highest difference between result and initial budget in 2003 once again occurred in the Structural Funds with the balance of expenditure amounting to EUR 3134 million, D.
whereas in internal policies, generally, the percentage uptake has also risen although, in spite of this, a total of EUR 159 million was left over, 1.
Recalls that, in addition to this amount, the 2003 budget was previously reduced by an amount of EUR 5000 million by Amending Budget No 6/2003 following a large overestimation of payments in the Structural Funds; notes that Member States' contributions to the EU budget have therefore already been reduced by that amount; points out that in consequence the real surplus of the 2003 budget due to under-spending amounts to nearly EUR 10500 million; 3.
Deeply regrets the fact that with this the positive development of the last years, the surplus having fallen from EUR 15000 million in 2001 to EUR 7000 million in 2002, has come to an end; 4.
Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission. [1] OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1. [2] OJ L 53, 23.2.2004. [3] OJ C 105, 30.4.2004, p. 9. [4] OJ C 172, 18.6.1999, p. 1.
