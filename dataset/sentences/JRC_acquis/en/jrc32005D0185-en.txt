Having examined all relevant factors taken into account in its report in accordance with Article 104(3) and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission concluded in its opinion of 24 June 2004 that there exists an excessive deficit in the Czech Republic. (5) Article 104(6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. (6) The overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
The general government deficit reached 12,9 % of GDP in 2003 (5,9 % of GDP excluding a major one-off operation related to imputed state guarantees) in the Czech Republic, above the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value.
The general government deficit is likely to remain above 3 % of GDP in 2004.
In particular, according to the Commission Spring 2004 forecast, the deficit is projected to reach 5,9 % of GDP in 2004, while the convergence programme of the Czech Republic forecasts a deficit of 5,3 % of GDP.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the Czech Republic.
