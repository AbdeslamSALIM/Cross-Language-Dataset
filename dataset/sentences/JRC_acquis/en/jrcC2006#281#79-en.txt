Case F-82/06: Action brought on 21 July 2006 — Duyster v Commission Action brought on 21 July 2006 — Duyster v Commission Parties Applicant: Tineke Duyster (Oetrange, Luxembourg) (represented by: W.H.A.M.
Having doubts as to the legal characterisation of that final letter, the applicant challenged it on 13 February 2006, simultaneously by means of a complaint and a legal action (F-18/06).
The Commission, first, raised a plea of inadmissibility in that action and, second, declared the complaint to be inadmissible by decision of 11 May 2006.
In this case, the applicant submits that the effect of the above is that there is no legal remedy against the decision contained in the letter of 17 November 2005 and that no compensation can be awarded as regards the statements of the Appointing Authority contained in it.
As regards the substance of the case, the applicant puts forward very similar pleas to those which she put forward in Case F-18/06. [1] OJ C 154, 1.7.2006. [2] OJ C 217, 3.9.2005 (case initially registered before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities under number T-249/05 and transferred to the Civil Service Tribunal of the European Union by order of 15.12.2005). --------------------------------------------------
