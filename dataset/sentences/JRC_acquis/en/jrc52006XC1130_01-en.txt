Interested parties may submit their comments within one month of the date of publication of this summary and the following letter, to: European Commission Directorate General for Fisheries DG FISH/D/3 %quot%Legal Issues%quot% B-1049 Brussels Fax: (32-2) 295 19 42 These comments will be communicated to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Aid of 50 % of the acquisition costs of the share, with a maximum of GBP 7500 in case of an existing vessel and GBP 15000 in case of a new vessel, with a maximum of 25 % of the value of the vessel, was granted to persons over 18 years old that do not yet own a share in a fishing vessel.
According to the United Kingdom, the scheme has been applied from 1982 until 14 January 2005.
However, Article 15 of that Regulation stipulates that the powers of the Commission to recover aid is subject to a limitation period of ten years, that the limitation period begins on the day on which the aid is awarded to the beneficiary and that that limitation period is interrupted by any action taken by the Commission.
The Commission considers that the limitation period was interrupted by its request for information sent to the United Kingdom on 24 August 2004.
Accordingly, the limitation period applies to aid granted to beneficiaries before 24 August 1994 and the Commission assesses below only aid granted by decisions taken between 24 August 1994 and 14 January 2005.
The measures appear to be State aid in the sense of Article 87 of the EC Treaty.
With regard to the aid granted for the acquisition of a share in a used vessel, according to the 1994, 1997 and 2001 Guidelines, the aid may be deemed compatible with the common market when the aid is intended to enable sea-fishermen to acquire part ownership or to replace a vessel after its total loss and the vessel is not older than 20 years and can be used for at least another 10 years.
The 2004 Guidelines are more strict and refer to the conditions laid down in Article 12(3)(d) an 12(4)(f) of Regulation (EC) No. 2792/1999, which contain additional requirements with regard to the age of the beneficiary and the overall length of the vessel.
Under the 2001 Guidelines reference is made to the conditions of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999, where it is stated that an entry of new capacity should be compensated by the withdrawal of a capacity without public aid which is at least equal to the new capacity introduced in the segments concerned.
Until 31 December 2001, where the objectives were not yet respected, the withdrawal of capacity should at least be 30 % more than the new capacity introduced.
Further condition is that the aid may only be granted where the Member State has submitted the information concerning the application of the Multi-annual Guidance Programme (MAGP) as required under Article 5 of that Regulation and has complied with its obligations under Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 concerning the characteristics of fishing vessels, has implemented the arrangements under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 and has complied with the overall MAGP-objectives.
As the scheme makes no reference to the reference level for the size of the fishing fleet nor to the hygiene and safety requirement and there is no obligation for the registration of the vessel in the fleet register, the Commission at this stage has serious doubts on the compatibility of the aid for the acquisition of a share in a new vessel granted in the period after 1 July 2001.
In view of the foregoing analysis the Commission has decided not to raise any objections to this aid scheme as far as it concerns the aid granted for the acquisition of a share in a new vessel granted before 1 July 2001.
However, with regard to the aid granted under the scheme for the acquisition of a share in a new vessel after 1 July 2001 and all aid granted for the acquisition of a share in second hand vessels, the Commission has, at this stage, serious doubts on the compatibility with the common market.
In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, all unlawful aid can be subject to recovery from the recipient.
TEXT OF LETTER %quot%(1) The Commission wishes to inform the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that, having examined the information supplied by your authorities on the measure referred to above, it has decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88 (2) of the EC Treaty. 1.
