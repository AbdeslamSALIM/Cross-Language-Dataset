As a result, the impact of aviation on the climate is on the rise: whilst the EU’s total emissions controlled under the Kyoto Protocol fell by 5.5% (-287 MtCO2e) from 1990 to 2003[1], its greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation increased by 73% (+47 MtCO2e), corresponding to an annual growth of 4.3% per year.
If the growth continues as up to now, emissions from international flights from EU airports will by 2012 have increased by 150 % since 1990.
Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is the most important greenhouse gas because of the large quantities released and its long residence time in the atmosphere.
Recent EU research results indicate that this ratio may be somewhat smaller (around 2 times).
ICAO’s 188 member countries have not been able to agree on regulatory standards or emissions charges applicable to CO2 emissions, and an attempt to identify and agree a suitable efficiency indicator for aircraft has failed.
As part of this process, more than 200 ASAs between EU Member States and non-EU countries have already been amended to open the possibility of taxing fuel supplied to EU and non-EU carriers on an equal basis.
In the present context the two instruments also differ in terms of environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency and potential for wider application . 6.2.
Therefore, if aviation were to achieve the same environmental goal under emissions trading and emissions charges, the economic costs for the sector and for the EU as a whole would be lower if this was done under the EU ETS rather than under a charging system for aviation only. 6.3.
The results will feed into the ongoing review of the existing framework for the EU ETS[13] due to report by 30 June 2006.
The Commission will aim to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2006 ; - invites the Council and the European Parliament to consider the policy and design recommendations in this communication, including questions of timing, in preparation for a future legislative decision.
