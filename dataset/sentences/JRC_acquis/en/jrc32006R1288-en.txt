Previous investigation and existing measures (1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 [3], imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film (the product concerned) falling within CN codes ex39206219 and ex39206290, originating in India.
The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty, ranging between 3,8 % and 19,1 % imposed on imports from individually named exporters, with a residual duty rate of 19,1 % imposed on imports of the product concerned from all other companies.
The original investigation period was 1 October 1997 to 30 September 1998. (2) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 [4], maintained the definitive countervailing duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 on imports of PET film originating in India, following an expiry review pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (3) The Council, by Regulation (EC), No 366/2006 [5], amended Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 [6] following a partial interim review of the level of anti-dumping duty in force against five Indian producers and imposed an anti-dumping duty ranging from 0 % to 18 %.
Request for a partial interim review (4) A request for a partial interim review of Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999, limited to the level of countervailing duty imposed on Garware was lodged by the following Community producers: DuPont Teijin Films, Mitsubishi Polyester Film GmbH, Nuroll SpA and Toray Plastics Europe (the applicants).
The investigation period ran from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005. (8) The Commission officially advised the exporting producer concerned, the Government of India (GOI) and the applicants of the initiation of the partial interim review.
Introduction (13) On the basis of the information contained in the review request and the replies to the Commission's questionnaire, the following schemes, which allegedly involve the granting of subsidies, were investigated: (a) Nationwide schemes (i) Advance Licence Scheme/Advance Release Order; (ii) Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme; (iii) Special Economic Zones/Export Oriented Units Scheme; (iv) Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme; (v) income tax schemes - Export Income Tax Exemption Scheme, - Income Tax Incentive for Research and Development; (vi) Export Credit Scheme; (vii) Duty-Free Replenishment Certificate. (14) The schemes (i) to (iv) and (vii) above are based on the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act 1992 (No 22 of 1992) which entered into force on 7 August 1992 (the Foreign Trade Act).
A five-year plan relating to export and import policy for the period 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2007 was published by the GOI (EXIM policy 2002-07).
Nationwide schemes 1.
De facto, no strict deadlines to apply for DEPBS exist, because the time periods mentioned in Chapter 4.47 HOP I 2002-07 are always counted from the most recent export transaction included in a given DEPBS application. (28) The company brought to the Commission's attention that this scheme would soon be discontinued and be replaced by an allegedly WTO compatible scheme with effect from 1 April 2006.
In addition, the DEPBS credit confers a benefit upon the exporter, because it improves the liquidity of the company. (30) Further, the DEPBS is contingent in law upon export performance, and therefore deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation. (31) This scheme cannot be considered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.
The company submitted that the rate applicable to the DEPBS has been reduced from 11 % to 8 % with effect from 26 May 2005, i.e., this alleged change falls outside the review investigation period; therefore, the effects and relevance of this change could not be verified and this claim must be rejected in accordance with Article 5 of the basic Regulation. (34) Fees necessarily incurred to obtain the subsidy were deducted from the credits received to arrive at the subsidy amount as the numerator, pursuant to Article 7(1)(a) of the basic Regulation. (35) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, the subsidy amount has been allocated over the total export turnover during the review investigation period as the appropriate denominator, as the subsidy is contingent on export performance and it was not granted by reference to the quantities manufactured, produced, exported or transported.
Garware benefited from this scheme during the investigation period and obtained a subsidy of 10,3 %. 3.
Therefore, it is deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation. (43) The scheme cannot be considered a permissible duty drawback system or substitution drawback system within the meaning of Article 2(1)(a)(ii) of the basic Regulation.
The subsidy obtained by Garware is 1,8 %. 5.
Export Credit Scheme (ECS) (a) Legal basis (48) The details of the scheme are set out in Master Circular IECD No 5/04.02.01/2002-03 (Export Credit in Foreign Currency) and Master Circular IECD No 10/04.02.01/2003-04 (Rupee Export Credit) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which is addressed to all commercial banks in India. (b) Eligibility (49) Manufacturing-exporters and merchant-exporters are eligible for this scheme.
Garware availed of benefits under the ECS and obtained a subsidy of 1,2 %. 7.
The scheme has been amended several times since its introduction and the 1993 scheme was operative from 1 October 1993 to 31 March 2001, whereas the latest amendment, the 2001 scheme, was introduced on 31 March 2001 and foreseen to be operative up to 31 March 2006.
The total amount that may be refunded is restricted to 100 % of the fixed capital investment.
In addition, this exemption/refund confers a benefit upon the company, as it improves its liquidity. (61) The company submitted that the sales tax was abolished on 1 April 2005 and that the GOM has since introduced a value added tax regime, under which the company is obliged to pay the full rate.
In accordance with Article 5 of the basic Regulation, this claim has to be rejected. (62) The scheme is only available to companies which have invested within certain designated geographical areas within the jurisdiction of the State of Maharashtra.
Amount of countervailable subsidies (64) The amount of countervailable subsidies determined in accordance with the basic Regulation, expressed ad valorem, for the investigated exporting producer is 14,9 %.
This amount of subsidisation exceeds the de minimis threshold mentioned under Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation. (in %) | Scheme | DEPB | EPCG | ECS | PSI of GOM | Total | Garware | 10,3 | 1,8 | 1,2 | 1,6 | 14,9 | (65) It is therefore considered that, pursuant to Article 19 of the basic Regulation, the measures currently in force are no longer sufficient to counteract the countervailable subsidies which are causing the injury to the Community industry.
