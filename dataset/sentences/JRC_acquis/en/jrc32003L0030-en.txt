From an ecological point of view, the White Paper therefore calls for dependence on oil (currently 98 %) in the transport sector to be reduced by using alternative fuels such as biofuels. (6) Greater use of biofuels for transport forms a part of the package of measures needed to comply with the Kyoto Protocol, and of any policy package to meet further commitments in this respect. (7) Increased use of biofuels for transport, without ruling out other possible alternative fuels, including automotive LPG and CNG, is one of the tools by which the Community can reduce its dependence on imported energy and influence the fuel market for transport and hence the security of energy supply in the medium and long term.
Some countries are already using biofuel blends of 10 % and higher. (9) Captive fleets offer the potential of using a higher concentration of biofuels.
It is noted that in the case of biodiesel for diesel engines, where the processing option is esterification, the standard prEN 14214 of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) could be applied.
The blending of biofuel with fossil fuels could facilitate a potential cost reduction in the distribution system in the Community. (23) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the introduction of general principles providing for a minimum percentage of biofuels to be marketed and distributed, cannot be achieved sufficiently by the Member States by reason of the scale of the action, and can therefore be achieved better at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
The percentage by volume of bio-ETBE that is calculated as biofuel is 47 %; (g) "bio-MTBE (methyl-tertio-butyl-ether)": a fuel produced on the basis of biomethanol.
Member States shall monitor the effect of the use of biofuels in diesel blends above 5 % by non-adapted vehicles and shall, where appropriate, take measures to ensure compliance with the relevant Community legislation on emission standards. 4.
For percentages of biofuels, blended in mineral oil derivatives, exceeding the limit value of 5 % of fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) or of 5 % of bioethanol, a specific labelling at the sales points shall be imposed.
Article 5 The list contained in Article 2(2) may be adapted to technical progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 6(2).
Article 8 This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 9 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
