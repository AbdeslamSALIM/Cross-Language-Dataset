Proposal for a Council Decision authorising certain Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to certain labour-intensive services in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 28(6) of Directive 77/388/EEC /* COM/2006/0410 final */ EN Brussels, 24.7.2006 COM(2006) 410 final Proposal for a COUNCIL DECISION authorising certain Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to certain labour-intensive services in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 28(6) of Directive 77/388/EEC (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Context of the proposal | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposalThe purpose of this proposal for a Decision is to implement the provisions of Directive 2006/18/EC of 14 February 2006 (OJ L 51, 22.2.2006, p. 12), which extends the experiment of reduced rates for labour-intensive services until 31 December 2010 and allows all Member States to take part in the experiment under the same conditions. | 120 | General context1.
On 14 February 2006, the Council adopted Directive 2006/18/EC amending Directive 77/388/EEC with regard to reduced rates of value added tax, and in particular Article 28(6) thereof.
Paragraph 6 was added by Council Directive 1999/85/EC of 22 October 1999 (OJ L 277, 28.10.1999, p.34) and applied initially until 31 December 2002.
The provisions were then extended by Directive 2002/92/EC of 3 December 2002 (OJ L 331, 7.12.2002, p.27) until 31 December 2003 and by Directive 2004/15/EC of 10 February 2004 (OJ L 52, 21.2.2004, p.61) until 31 December 2005.
Pending the outcome of that assessment, Directive 2006/18/EC extends the experiment of reduced rates for labour-intensive services until 31 December 2010.
Decision 2000/185/EC of 28 February 2000 (OJ L 59, 4.3.2000, p. 10) authorised certain Member States to apply reduced rates for labour-intensive services specified in the Decision until 31 December 2002.
Decision 2000/185/EC was extended until 31 December 2003 by Decision 2002/954/EC (OJ L 331, 7.12.2002, p.28) and until 31 December 2005 by Decision 2004/161/EC (JO L 52, 21.2.2004, p. 62).
Member States wishing to avail themselves for the first time of the possibility provided for in Article 28(6) of Directive 77/388/EEC and those wishing to amend the list of services to which they had applied that provision in the past had to submit a request to the Commission, together with the relevant particulars for the purpose of assessment, by 31 March 2006.
It therefore imposes no obligation. | 332 | Given the limited scope of the derogations provided for in the Decision, the special measure is proportionate to the aim pursued.
CHAPTER 2 Article 10 In accordance with the first and fourth subparagraphs of Article 28(6) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Member States referred to in Articles 11 to 19 are hereby authorised to apply the reduced rates provided for in the third subparagraph of Article 12(3)(a) during the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2010 to the services referred to in those Articles.
Article 18 Slovenia is authorised for the renovation and repairing of private dwellings, excluding materials which form a significant part of the value of the supply, as referred to in point 2 of Annex K to Directive 77/388/EEC.
CHAPTER 3 Article 20 This Decision shall apply from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010.
