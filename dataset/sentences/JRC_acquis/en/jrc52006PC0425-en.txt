Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, and Council Directive 2001/112/EC {SEC(2006) 1044} {SEC(2006) 1045} /* COM/2006/0425 final - COD 2006/0144 */ EN Brussels, 28.7.2006 COM(2006) 425 final 2006/0144 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, and Council Directive 2001/112/EC (presented by the Commission) {SEC(2006) 1044} {SEC(2006) 1045} EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 1.
Context of the proposal Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Commission announced in the White Paper on Food Safety a proposal amending the framework Directive 89/107/EEC on food additives to lay down specific provisions in respect of food enzymes.
Moreover, there are divided opinions among Member States in relation to the categorisation of enzymes into food additives or processing aids according to their function in the food process or in the final food.
Therefore, the proposal provides for an initial period of 24 months, after the date of application of the implementing measures foreseen in the common procedure Regulation, during which applications can be submitted.
A transitional period is also foreseen for the proposed labelling requirements. 2006/0144 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, and Council Directive 2001/112/EC (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, Whereas: (1) The free movement of safe and wholesome food is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests. (2) A high level of protection of human life and health should be assured in the pursuit of Community policies. (3) Enzymes other than those used as food additives are not currently regulated or are regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States.
However, when these food enzymes are used as such in food, they are covered by this Regulation. (6) Food enzymes should be approved and used only if they fulfil the criteria laid down in this Regulation.
Food enzymes should be safe when used, there should be a technological need for their use and their use should not mislead the consumer. (7) Some food enzymes are permitted for specific uses, such as in fruit juices and certain similar products and certain lactoproteins intended for human consumption and for certain authorised oenological practices and processes.
Where the food enzyme contains or consists of a genetically modified organism (“GMO”) within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC [7], the unique identifier assigned to the GMO under that Regulation should also be included in the specifications. (9) With a view to harmonisation, the risk assessment of food enzymes and their inclusion in the Community list should be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No […] of the European Parliament and of the Council of […] establishing a common authorisation procedure for the food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings [8]. (10) Under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [9], the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) is to be consulted on matters likely to affect public health. (11) A food enzyme which falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed [10] should be authorised in accordance with that Regulation, prior to its approval under this Regulation. (12) A food enzyme already included in the Community list under this Regulation and prepared by production methods or from starting materials significantly different from those covered by the Authority’s risk assessment, or different from those covered by the authorisation and the specifications under this Regulation should be submitted to the Authority for an evaluation with emphasis on the specifications.
The Authority should evaluate without delay all applications for food enzymes for which sufficient information has been submitted during that period. (14) In order to ensure fair and equal conditions for all applicants, the Community list should be drawn up in a single step.
That list should be established after the risk assessment of all food enzymes for which sufficient information has been submitted during the initial two-year period has been completed. (15) A significant number of applications is expected to be submitted during the initial two-year period.
In addition, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 authorises the use of urease, beta-glucanase and lysozyme in wine subject to the conditions laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 of 24 July 2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes [12].
The financing of such measures is covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules [15] and consequently the legal basis for the financing of the above measures will be Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. (22) Member States are to carry out official controls in order to enforce compliance with this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. (23) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to lay down Community rules on food enzymes cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of market unity and high level of consumer protection be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
