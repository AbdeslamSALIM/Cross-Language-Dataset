BACKGROUND The Commission forwarded the above proposal for a Directive, which is based on Article 118A of the Treaty (now Article 137), to the Parliament and to the Council on 8 February 1993 (COM(1992) 560 final – 1992/0449 (COD)).
The Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 30 June 1993.
The Committee of the Regions stated in a letter dated 13 January 2000 that it would not deliver an opinion.
The European Parliament adopted an opinion at first reading on 20 April 1994.
The Commission accepted 23 amendments proposed by the Parliament of the 24 applicable to optical radiation.
The Council adopted its common position unanimously on 18 April 2005.
This opinion sets out the Commission’s position on the European Parliament’s amendments in accordance with Article 251(2), third subparagraph, point c) of the EC Treaty. 2 .
This proposal constitutes the fourth phase of the general approach adopted by the Council, namely to introduce a separate individual Directive for each physical agent [1]. 3 .
It considers that nine of these amendments (1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) will extend and improve the text of the common position and strengthen the provisions of the common position regarding health surveillance; it also considers that acceptance of the other two amendments (4 and 13) will make it easier to reach a compromise quickly.
As regards the other ten amendments adopted which aim to exclude risks arising from the exposure of workers to natural radiation from the common position (20, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 32) the Commission considers that it should meet the wishes of Parliament but points that workers exposed to risks arising from natural optical radiation (chiefly the sun) will not be covered by the Directive. 3.2.
Parliament’s amendments on second reading 3.2.1.
Amendments accepted 3.2.1.1.
Amendment 2 (“details concerning the establishment of minimum requirements”) (Recital 5) The Commission accepts this amendment which requires the use of the indicative rather than the conditional in a sentence which points out that the Directive must not (instead of “ should not ”) serve to justify any regression in relation to the situation which already prevails in each Member State. 3.2.1.3.
Amendment 3 (“complementarity with the “products” directives”) (Recital 11) This amendment adds to the recital by stipulating that it is not necessary for employers, when carrying out risk assessments, to repeat measurements already undertaken by manufacturers of optical radiation sources, provided that the equipment has been properly and regularly maintained.
Amendment 6 (“measures to be taken if there is any possibility that the exposure limit values may be exceeded”) (Article 5, paragraph 2, introductory part) This amendment stresses the importance of the mechanism to be put in place where the assessment of the risks to which workers are liable to be exposed shows any possibility that the exposure limit values may be exceeded.
The Commission accepts the amendment. 3.2.1.6 Amendment 8 (“reference to prevention and early diagnosis of adverse health effects and medical surveillance procedures”) (Article 8, paragraph 1) This amendment specifies the objectives of the Directive relating to the health of workers and indicates the need to place the emphasis on prevention and early diagnosis.
The Commission therefore accepts this amendment. 3.2.1.7 Amendment 9 (“provisions regarding medical surveillance”) (Article 8, paragraph 1 a (new)) This amendment specifies that surveillance of the health of workers exposed to the risks covered by the Directive should be carried out by qualified personnel in accordance with national law and practice.
This amendment is in accordance with the spirit of the framework Directive and is accepted by the Commission. 3.2.1.8 Amendment 10 (“strengthening of the provisions to allow the competent medical authority to have access to the results of the risk assessment”) (Article 8, paragraph 2) This amendment specifies that an employer must also facilitate the access of the authorities responsible for medical surveillance to the results of the risk assessment carried out pursuant to framework Directive 89/391 and Article 4 of the proposal for a Directive, where such results may be useful for the medical surveillance.
The Commission therefore accepts this amendment. 3.2.1.9 Amendment 11 (“a worker must undergo a medical examination in certain circumstances, particularly in the case of exposure above the exposure limit values”) (Article 8(3)) This amendment introduces the requirement that a worker exposed to the risks covered by the proposal for a Directive must undergo a medical examination in certain cases, particularly where exposure exceeds the exposure limit values.
The Commission can accept this amendment, in the interests of reaching a compromise quickly, even though it does not seem to be in line with the interinstitutional agreement concerning the quality of drafting of Community legislation (see also amendment 4). 3.2.1.12 Amendments 20 and 28 (Article 4, paragraph 3), 23 and 31 (Article 5, paragraph 3) (“deletion of the reference to assessment of the risks in case of exposure to natural sources”) The Commission has noted that the Parliament does not wish the risks arising from exposure of workers to natural radiation to be included in the scope of the proposal.
Nevertheless, it wishes to point out that this acceptance does not mean that it considers that exposure to natural optical radiation is not a risk to workers working outside. 3.2.1.13 Amendments 22 and 30 (Article 4, paragraph 1), amendment 29 (Article 4, paragraph 4), amendments 25 and 32 (Article 6, introductory part and point c)) (“deletion of the reference to natural optical radiation and inclusion of a reference to artificial radiation”) The Commission can accept these amendments for the same reason as under 3.2.1.12. 3.2.1.14 Amendment 26 (“addition of a reference to artificial radiation and deletion of the reference to the possibility of assigning an exposed worker to alternative work”) (Article 8, paragraph 3) As regards the point concerning exposure to artificial radiation, the Commission can accept this amendment for the same reasons as under 3.2.1.12.
It also deletes the second sentence of recital 13 and adds “artificial” in Article 1, paragraphs 1 and 2. [1] See statement in the Council minutes of 25 June 2001.
