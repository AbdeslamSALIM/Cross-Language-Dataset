The Agency should also be empowered to request that a registration be submitted if it has grounds for suspecting that the release of a substance from the article may present a risk to human health or the environment and the substance is present in those articles in quantities totalling over 1 tonne per producer or importer per year.
This recast follows the rules set out within the Interinstitutional Agreement of 28 November 2001 on a more structured use of the recasting technique for legal texts [12] concerning recasting techniques. (74) In relation to Annex XVII Member States should be allowed to maintain for a transitional period more stringent restrictions, provided that these restrictions have been notified according to the Treaty.
A substance should therefore be added to Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC if it meets the criteria for classification as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction categories 1, 2 or 3, as a respiratory sensitiser, or in respect of other effects on a case-by-case basis.
Waste, as defined in Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste [27] is not a substance, preparation or article within the meaning of Article 3 of this Regulation. 3.

On 5 November 2003, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Regulation concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 67/548/EEC in order to adapt it to the REACH Regulation.
The proposal is based on Article 95 of the EC Treaty. 2.
The Economic and Social Committee delivered its Opinion on 31 March 2004 [1]. 3.
The European Parliament delivered its Opinion at first reading on 17 November 2005. 4.
On 13 December 2005, the Council reached a Political agreement by unanimity on a compromise text with a view to adopting its Common Position. 5.
Thus around 200 amendments from the European Parliament's Opinion at first reading have been reflected either in full, in part or in principle in the Common Position.
Recitals In general, the Common Position is in line with around 20 amendments by the European Parliament, which correspond to the approach taken in the legal provisions (Articles and Annexes).
In addition, the Common Position takes on board the spirit of certain amendments: Concerning amendment 11 (partly linked to amendments 59 and 364 on Article 1(2)) that introduces a "duty of care" for manufacturers, importers and downstream users to use or place substances on the market in such a way that they do not damage human health or the environment, the Council considers that the provisions of Article 1, as amended to state that chemical substances shall not adversely affect human health or the environment, are sufficient.
As regards amendments 3, 416 and 419, which refer to the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European Chemicals industry as well as the compatibility of the REACH Regulation with WTO requirements, the Council considers that REACH is in line with all WTO obligations and in itself should stimulate innovation and thereby maintain or enhance competitiveness.
In general, several amendments included in the Common Position cover the spirit of amendments 22 and 363, which put the emphasis on the need to pay special attention to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).
Other amendments to recitals have not been reflected since they would not be compatible with the approach taken by the Council in its Common Position (amendments 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15, 17, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 52, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 90, 361and 424).
Definitions in Article 3 have been adjusted to take account of the approach taken by the Council in its Common Position.
Substances that are intentionally released from articles will in principle be treated like all other substances and registered according to the phase-in periods of 3, 6 and 11 years.
The information submitted depending on tonnage, must be as follows: - Low volume phase-in substances (those manufactured or imported in quantities of between 1 and 10 tonnes per manufacturer or importer per year): where a phase-in substance in this tonnage range meets simple criteria highlighting it as potentially of concern, the full Annex VII information is to be provided by the registrant.
In other cases, only the physicochemical information listed in Section 5 of Annex VII together with the information that is available to the registrant would need to be provided.
Registrants of all non-phase-in substances would have to provide the full Annex VII information. - Only one test for reproductive toxicity is proposed for Annex VIII (additional standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 10 tonnes or more per manufacturer or importer year). - No significant changes have been introduced to Annexes IX and X (additional standard information requirements for substances manufactured or imported in quantities of 100 tonnes or more and 1000 tonnes or more per manufacturer or importer per year, respectively).
In line with the above considerations, the Common Position reflects completely, in principle or in part the following amendments: 88, 89, 97, 99, 104, 108, 109, 112, 116, 117, 118, 119, 373, 380, 381, 382, 386, 387 and 436.
The Common Position does not take on board some amendments which would not be in line with the approach outlined above (Amendments 90, 96, 105, 106, 110, 113, 114, 121, 374, 375, 422, 469rev, 433, 549, 575rev, 584, 593, 594, 595, 596, 611 and 960).
More specifically, concerning amendments 96, 106, 108 and 549, which aim to reduce the number of animal tests, the Council fully shares the objective expressed in these amendments but considers that this objective is taken into consideration within the framework of Article 13(2) that lays down that test methods will be revised as appropriate to refine, reduce or replace animal tests.
The fact that 30 of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading have been reflected in the Common Position either in full, in principle or in part (amendments 27, 123, 125, 126, 128, 130, 131, 132, 134, 136, 137, 138, 142, 143, 147, 148, 149, 151, 153, 154, 358, 367, 369rev, 370, 371, 379 and 384) shows that the European Parliament and the Council share the same objectives, particularly in relation to reducing testing on vertebrate animals and facilitating data sharing.
The Common Position does not take on board two amendments stipulating that sharing of costs should be proportionate to the production volume (amendments 150 and 155).
Other amendments have not been reflected since they would not be in line with the approach taken by the Council (amendments 129, 135, 139, 140, 150, 152, 155, 156, 368, 383 and 385).
Based on this approach, most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading (amendments 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 366 and 710) are reflected in the Common Position.
This is clearly expressed in recitals 8 (special account should be taken of the potential impact of REACH on SMEs), recital 34 (guidance), Article 73 (reduced fees for SMEs) and Article 76 (Agency assistance).
The Agency will be able to decide how best to discharge these obligations, including the possibility of using external sources. - A minimum number of compliance checks should be performed.
On the basis of the approach adopted, the Common Position reflects in full, in principle or in part amendments 171, 174, 175, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 187, 188, 190, 191, 192, 193, 195, 196, 197, 199, 201, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 211, 213, 470rev, 729, 730, 733, 739, 744, 745 and 746.
The Common Position does not reflect the amendments which would give full responsibility for substance evaluation to the Agency (amendments 170, 202, 203, 742 and 743) although the Common Position has been moved significantly in this direction.
In line with this approach, the Common Position incorporates in full, in principle or in part amendments 215, 216, 217, 219, 223, 226, 227, 229, 235, 236, 237, 241, 242, 243, 245, 470rev, 471 and 568.
In general, a number of amendments (218, 220, 222, 224, 225, 228, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 238, 239, 240, 244 and 246) have not been reflected in the Common Position since this would not be in line with the approach taken by the Council.
In line with this approach, the Common Position reflects in full, in principle or in part amendments 247, 569, 570, 571, 572, 789 and 985.
The amendments 248 and 251 are not reflected in the Common Position.
In line with what has been outlined above, the Common Position reflects in full, in principle or in part amendments 258, 259, 260, 261, 265, 266, 270, 285, 288, 291, 293, 294, 418, 796 and 801.
All the amendments stipulating that the Agency should have overall responsibility for the management of REACH (in particular amendments 253, 256 and 795) or that part of the amendments putting emphasis on the Agency as the main authority in the field of REACH (amendments 260, 261, 262, 263 and 796) have not been incorporated in the Common Position.
Furthermore, amendments 267, 269, 360 and 1037 have not been included since it would not be appropriate to involve the European Parliament directly or indirectly in the appointment of members of the Management Board.
In general the Common Position does not take on board the following amendments: 252, 253, 254, 256, 257, 264, 267, 269, 271, 272, 273, 275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 292, 295, 795 and 1037.
In line with this approach, it was not considered appropriate to incorporate amendments 298, 300 and 808.
As in case of amendment 306, the Council considers that the principle of amendment 362 would be covered by the Member States' helpdesk, which would be of great help to SMEs.
Regarding amendment 822 on the preparation of the establishment of the Agency, the Commission and the Council have committed themselves in a joint statement to provide the necessary support towards setting up of the Agency.
The Common Position does not take on board the following amendments: 321, 328, 329, 337, 351, 393, 401, 574, 831, and 965.
CONCLUSION The Council considers that its Common Position, which is the result of extensive preparatory work and negotiations since 2003 and which is fully supported by the Commission, is wholly in line with the different objectives of REACH.
This convergence is well reflected in the Common Position. [1] OJ C 112, 30.4.2004, p. 92 [2] OJ L 145, 31.5.2001, p.43 --------------------------------------------------
