CHAPTER II CHARGES Article 3 Charges shall be levied by the Agency for all services, including the supply of goods, which it provides to applicants, except for: (a) certification tasks; (b) the transmission of documents and information, in whatever form, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council [2]; (c) the documents available free of charge on the Agency website.
The Agency shall also levy charges when an appeal is lodged against one of its decisions pursuant to Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002.
The charges payable when an appeal is lodged pursuant to Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 shall take the form of a fixed-rate sum, the amount of which is specified in the Annex.
Article 5 The charges shall be payable by the applicant or, where appropriate, the person lodging an appeal.
CHAPTER III FEES Article 6 1.
The Annex shall be re-examined, and revised if necessary, within 14 months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
The fees shall be established at levels such that: Σ R = x D where: Σ R= annual amount of fees levied by the Agency D= annual expenditure included in the Agency’s budget x= percentage of annual expenditure directly or indirectly attributable to certification tasks. 2.
In such a case, the fees shall be established during that period in such a way that: Σ R = xD - Cp where: Cp= share of the contribution referred to in Article 48(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 used to finance certification tasks carried out by the Agency.
Article 10 Without prejudice to Article 9, where a certification task is conducted, fully or in part, outside the territories of the Member States, the fee invoiced to the applicant shall include the costs of transport outside those territories.
For that task, or part thereof, the amount of the fee due shall be determined according to the formula: R = F + (nh * t) + S + V where: R= fee due F= fixed part, depending on the kind of operation carried out (see Annex) nh= number of hours invoiced (if applicable, see Annex) t= hourly rate (if applicable, see Annex) S= specific costs V= additional transport costs .
Article 11 At the request of the applicant, a certification task may be carried out in a special way, with the agreement of the Executive Director.
For tasks which give rise to the payment of a variable part, 30 % of the total amount of the fee due (including any fixed part) shall be payable before the task concerned starts, and 40 % of the amount shall be payable as the task proceeds, in quarterly instalments.
The balance of 30 % shall be payable in exchange for issue of the certificate or approval. 7.
That amount shall be equivalent to the fixed fee D set out in the Annex. 9.
CHAPTER IV TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS Article 13 From 1 June 2005, the fees shall be demanded and levied by the Agency only.
Article 14 For the purposes of the application of this Regulation, and at the latest 30 days before the date of application of Articles 1 to 13, the Agency shall confirm in writing to the Commission that it is able to assume the tasks imposed on it by this Regulation, and in particular to calculate and to invoice the amounts of fees due by the applicants and to reimburse the Member States.
Article 15 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Articles 1 to 13 shall apply from 1 June 2005.
