Introduction 4 2.
Summary of implementation to 31 March 2006 4 3.
This work was completed by January 2005, in time for the 2005 financial year to start on the right basis.
Since January 2005: - The opening balances have been checked and validated by the authorising services. - The expenses to be accrued at the beginning and end of each year have been estimated by every service. - All systems have been examined by the Commission's Accounting Officer to ensure that they are capable of recording and communicating the required accounting information. - The Commission's accounts were prepared, and consolidated with those of 8 other institutions and 16 agencies.
Despite the efforts made by Commission services to check and recheck the opening balances and the accrued expenses, the Court of Auditors is likely to find further errors, which must where possible be corrected in the final accounts which are due by 31 July 2006.
The risk of error is exacerbated by the inadequate number of qualified accounting staff in the Commission to absorb quickly such a large reform, by the delays incurred in some services, leading to hurried work, and by delays in developing certain accounting and reporting tools in the IT system and in updating documentation and training courses.
SUMMARY OF IMPLEMENTATION TO 31 MARCH 2006 The transition to a new accounting system in the European Commission has so far been successful.
On 1 January 2005, the Commission moved the general accounting of the EU from cash-based to accrual-based accounts, a system which has already given the European Commission greater day-to-day control over its finances and provides it with better financial information.
The accrual-based accounting system continued to be developed throughout 2005; development and improvement will continue in 2006 and 2007 to include progressively the European Development Fund, Delegations, the Agencies and a single datawarehouse.
A detailed action plan was established for the two years 2005 and 2006, and adapted and extended in the light of experience.
The plans for 2006 and 2007 are presented graphically in annex.
The principal accounting projects still in progress are ABAC-EDF and ABAC-Delegations, which are now planned to be fully operational at the beginning of the 2007 (Delegations) and 2008 (EDF) financial years.
The main issues arising during 2005 are presented in this report.
The final statements are due to be approved by the Commission by 31 July 2006.
Some checks on the data will continue until the final accounts are closed, some accounts must still be reconciled in the general accounts, and one Directorate-General has been requested to redo its estimates.
The provisional annual accounts were delivered on 31 March 2006, the date set in the Financial Regulation.
The last validation was received in January 2006.
The major work in 2005 for the transition has been to finalise the opening accrual balances as at 1 January 2005, which proved to be an arduous task for DG Budget and all services alike.
Guidelines on estimating the value of claims on EC funding not yet submitted by beneficiaries ('cut-off') were sent to the Directorates-General on 16 August 2005, after consultations with them as to the most appropriate basis for this estimation.
By 31 January 2006, the last Directorate-General had prepared its individual methodology and cut-off bookings for the opening balance sheet, and by 17 March, the last DG had presented the information necessary for the year-end cut-off bookings.
Some corrections will be required before the final accounts are approved on 31 July 2006, in particular concerning one DG which will be requested to rework its cut-off estimates.
Although all DGs did the work requested of them, there were considerable delays before the information was complete, as shown in Table 1.
During 2005, this data was moved to the Commission's central system (SAP/CFM and FM).
Certain financial instruments were uploaded to the new system in July, with the remaining instruments being moved in November 2005.
Specific briefing sessions for authorising officers were provided in the first quarter of the year; - Continued delivery of ABAC and SI2 courses after the completion of the intensive phase, as well as the courses on private and public-sector accounting, even though at times training material and documentation did not keep pace with system changes.
A new IT consolidation tool (SAP ECCS) was developed and tested in November, using test reporting packages received from 15 participating Institutions/Agencies.
Change of budgetary year As from July 2005, all Directorates-General and services collaborated with DG Budget in reducing to a few days the period during which financial operations are interrupted while a new financial year is opened.

(***) Additional runs concern DGs which had not carried out the required preparatory work in time for the earlier run | CONTROL ENVIRONMENT AND VALIDATION OF LOCAL SYSTEMS Communication and accounting quality.
DG Budget's validation team of 8 persons has undertaken a programme of in-depth checks of systems laid down by the authorising officers to supply or justify accounting information, as required under article 61.1 (e) of the Financial Regulation, commencing with those assessed as presenting the higher risks.
The progress report published in July 2005 notes the overall satisfactory situation in 27 Directorates-General.
The final report, adopted on 28 February 2006, describes progress made in all DGs, but there remain significant problems in the systems of two DGs (AIDCO and EAC), which led the Accounting Officer to suspend the validation of their systems until improvements were completed.
IT DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE GENERAL BUDGET The ABAC modules were progressively improved through releases in April, June and November 2005, and in March 2006.
The ABAC system generally performed well, but some delays in the implementation of the IT development programme resulted in services being unable to make certain accounting corrections until March 2006.
A feasibility study completed in 2005 showed that the new version of the SAP FM module, BCS (Budget Control System ) could be used to replace the version currently used for the central budget management, and that it was capable of incorporating the local budgetary lines required to provide departments with a more detailed system for managing their budgets.
These local lines are currently managed in Si2.
The introduction of BCS is now expected by end- 2006.
For ABAC Contracts , 2005 was focused on the provision of functions requested by the User Group and on completing deployment of the system in all the DGs.
Five agencies will start using ABAC in 2006 on a pilot basis, the rest in 2007 and 2008.
In cooperation with DG AIDCO, a gap analysis was also carried to see what developments were still needed in ABAC and CRIS.
Training the future users in the 46 ACP delegations remains a challenge.
It is important to underline that although the new IT support tools are currently being developed, the EDF annual accounts for 2005 were nevertheless drawn up in compliance with accrual based accounting principles.
Furthermore, to ensure the comparability of the information in the annual accounts, the EDF Accounting Officer has restated the opening financial statements for the financial year 2005 on a full accrual accounting basis.
The accounting information provided by the current IT accounting system (OLAS) was adapted where necessary, in order to present accrual-compliant data.
The first definitive results of the system in place were tested and documented when the Commission's accounting officer prepared the provisional accounts on the due date of 31 March 2006.
However, although so far the transition has been managed successfully and comprehensive tests have been conducted, the verification work on local systems at the end of 2005 highlighted concerns on three systems where validation was not possible.
Moreover, Commission departments were under considerable pressure in 2005 to deliver new, complicated processes within ambitious deadlines.
Work on improving the consistency checks within the accounting system will undoubtedly extend at least until the approval of the final consolidated accounts by 31 July 2006.
As regards the three local systems which could not be validated, two are planned to become compliant by end- 2006 (AIDCO and RELEX).
In 2005, a major project was launched concerning the creation of a data model and its data dictionary for ABAC. [1] The Commission has presented half-yearly progress reports up to and including 31 May 2005.
