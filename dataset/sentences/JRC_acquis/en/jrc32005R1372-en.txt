Measures in force (1) In September 2000, by Regulations (EC) No 1994/2000 [2] and No 1993/2000 [3], the Council imposed definitive countervailing duties ranging from 1 % to 8,2 % and definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of styrene-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic rubber ("SBS") originating in Taiwan. (2) The level of definitive anti-dumping duties established for the exporting producers in Taiwan, expressed as a percentage of the CIF frontier value, was as follows: - Lee Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp., Taipei 5,3 % - Chi Mei Corp., Tainan 9,1 % - Non cooperating exporting producers 20,0 % 2.
Present investigations (3) On 28 May 2004, pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation, the Commission announced by a notice ("notice of initiation") published in the Official Journal of the European Union [4], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of SBS originating in the Republic of Korea ("Korea") and Russia. (4) On the same day, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union [5], the initiation of an interim review, pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, of the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1993/2000 on imports of SBS originating in Taiwan. (5) The anti-dumping investigation was initiated following a complaint lodged on 13 April 2004 by the European Chemical Industry Council ("CEFIC" or "the complainant") on behalf of producers representing 100 % of the Community production of SBS.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notices of initiation. (8) In view of the large number of importers of SBS into the Community listed in the complaint and the request, the notices of initiation envisaged the use of sampling for importers for the determination of injury, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. (9) In order to enable the Commission's services to decide whether sampling would be necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all importers were asked to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide, as specified in the notices of initiation, basic information on their activities related to SBS during the sampling period ( 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004).
No replies were received from users. (12) The Commission's services sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping, resulting injury and Community interest.
Provisional measures (14) Given the need to further examine certain aspects of injury, causality and Community interest, in particular in view of the interrelation with the parallel interim review of the anti-dumping duties applicable to imports of SBS originating in Taiwan, no provisional anti-dumping measures were imposed on imports of SBS originating in Korea and Russia.
Subsequent procedure (15) The Commission's services continued to seek and verify all information deemed necessary for definitive findings, in particular with regard to imports of SBS from Taiwan. (16) Subsequently, all parties were informed about the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend: - the termination of the proceeding against imports of SBS originating in Korea and Russia; and - the repeal of Regulation (EC) No 1993/2000 imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of SBS originating in Taiwan. (17) They were also granted a period within which they could make representations subsequent to this disclosure.
Investigation period (18) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 ("investigation period" or "IP").
The examination of trends in the context of the injury analysis covered the period from 1 January 2000 to the end of the IP ("period considered").
Product concerned (19) The product concerned is styrene-butadiene-styrene thermoplastic rubber, currently classifiable within CN codes ex40021900, ex40029910 and ex40029990. (20) SBS is a triblock copolymer mainly made from monomer styrene and butadiene.
Like product (22) The product concerned and the SBS manufactured and sold domestically in Korea, Russia and Taiwan, as well as the SBS manufactured and sold in the Community by the Community industry were found to have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and the same basic uses.
The Commission's services subsequently identified those types of SBS sold on the domestic market by the companies having overall representative domestic sales and that were identical to or directly comparable with the types sold for export to the Community. (25) For each type sold by the exporting producers on their domestic markets and found to be directly comparable with the types of SBS sold for export to the Community, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
Domestic sales of a particular type of SBS were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable type of SBS exported to the Community. (26) The Commission's services subsequently examined whether each type of SBS sold domestically in representative quantities could be considered as being sold in the ordinary course of trade in accordance with Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the SBS type in question.
In cases where the sales volume of the relevant SBS type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not.
In cases where the volume of profitable sales of the SBS type represented 80 % or less of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type. (27) In cases where the volume of profitable sales of any product type represented less than 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, it was considered that this particular type was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic price to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value.
Comparison (31) The normal value and export prices were compared on an ex-works basis.
The investigation showed that the total domestic sales of the Korean company were representative.
Furthermore, the total domestic sales volume of each type of SBS sold by the company represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of comparable types of SBS exported to the Community and could therefore be considered as representative. 6.1.
Normal value (34) To determine the normal value, domestic prices could be used for two product types.
For five product types, less than 10 % of the domestic sales were profitable during the IP.
Export price (35) As exports of the product concerned were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export prices were established on the basis of the prices paid or payable for the product concerned when sold for export to the Community in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. 6.3.
During the verification visit, the company had the opportunity to demonstrate that quantity discounts affected prices.
Therefore, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, the claim was rejected. 6.4.
Russia (40) Questionnaire replies were received from three related companies and were considered together. 7.1.
Normal value (41) The investigation showed that all Russian domestic sales were representative and that only one specific product type was sold to the EU.
As conflicting information about the quantity of certain raw materials purchased in relation to the quantity of raw materials produced in the IP were reported, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(5) and Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the Commission's services used facts available, in this case the highest quantity of purchased raw material reported by the companies, to establish the cost of raw materials for the determination of the cost of production.
However, the total revised cost of production did not alter the finding that domestic prices were the appropriate basis for establishing the normal value. (43) Considering the division of tasks between the companies concerned, the cost of production had to be determined by summing up the relevant costs of the producing company, JSC Voronezhsyntezkauchuk, with the relevant costs of JSC SIBUR. (44) After the companies were informed of the decision not to impose provisional measures, they claimed a correction of the established normal value on the grounds that they had reported their domestic sales prices including Russian VAT by mistake.
Export price (45) As exports of the product concerned were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established on the basis of the prices paid or payable for the product concerned when sold for export to the Community in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. 7.3.
Comparison (46) As all sales were made ex-works, adjustments were only made in respect of handling and credit costs where applicable and justified. (47) After the companies were informed of the decision not to impose provisional measures, they claimed an adjustment for differences in physical characteristics according to Article 2(10)(a) of the basic Regulation stating that the SBS produced by them was of a lower quality compared to the product manufactured by the Community industry.
Therefore, the claim was rejected under Article 2(10)(a) of the basic Regulation. 7.4.
Dumping margins (48) The dumping margin established, expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community frontier, duty unpaid is the following: - SIBUR group, Russia: 31,7 % 8.
Normal value (50) For one company, the investigation showed that all domestic sales were representative and that only one specific product type was sold to the EU.
It was found that there were sufficient domestic sales of the relevant type of SBS and that these sales could be considered as representative.
Therefore, actual domestic prices could be used to determine the normal value. (51) For the other cooperating company, the investigation showed that total domestic sales were representative.
Furthermore, the total domestic sales volume of eight types of SBS sold by the company represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of comparable types of SBS exported to the Community and could therefore be considered as representative.
However, one type of SBS sold to the EU was not sold on the domestic market. (52) To determine the normal value, domestic prices could be used for eight product types.
Export price (53) As exports of the product concerned were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export prices were established on the basis of the prices paid or payable for the product concerned when sold for export to the Community in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. 8.3.
The claim was therefore rejected in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. (56) Furthermore, this company claimed an adjustment for currency conversions in accordance with Article 2(10)(j) of the basic Regulation.
This company did not demonstrate that the conditions of Article 2(10)(j) of the basic Regulation were fulfilled and therefore the claim was rejected. (57) For the other company, adjustments were made in respect of transport, insurance, handling, loading, packing and credit costs where applicable and justified. (58) That company also claimed an adjustment for differences in physical characteristics according to Article 2(10)(a) of the basic Regulation, on the grounds that some sales to the EU of a lower quality type of the product concerned had no equivalent on the domestic market.
Dumping margins (59) The dumping margins established, expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community frontier, duty unpaid are the following: - Lee Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp., Taipei: –1,8 % - Chi Mei Corp., Tainan: 16,2 % D.
Definition of the Community industry (60) The following Community producers supported the complaint: - Dynasol Elastomeros S.A., Madrid, Spain; - Kraton Polymers International Ltd., London, United Kingdom; - Polimeri Europa S.p.A., Milan, Italy; - SA Petrofina NV Brussels, Belgium (formerly Atofina Elastomers N.V.); (61) As these four complainant cooperating Community producers represent 100 % of the Community production of the product concerned, it is considered that the complainant producers constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation. 2.
However, the Community consumption reached a peak in 2002 and then sharply decreased by 9 %. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Community consumption (tonnes) | 193756 | 191827 | 198741 | 188562 | 180195 | Index | 100 | 99 | 103 | 97 | 93 | 3.
Imports of SBS from the countries concerned 3.1.
Cumulation (64) The Commission considered whether the effects of imports of SBS originating in Korea, Russia and Taiwan should be assessed cumulatively in accordance with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation. (65) This Article provides that the effects of imports from two or more countries simultaneously subject to anti-dumping investigations are to be assessed cumulatively only if it is determined that (a) the margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation and that the volume of imports of each country is not negligible and (b) a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in the light of the conditions of competition between imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like Community product. (66) With regard to Korea and one Taiwanese exporting producer, the investigation has shown that either de minimis or no dumping was found.
Therefore, in accordance with Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation, those imports concerned could not be cumulatively assessed.
On the contrary, as indicated above, the dumping margins established for Russia and the other cooperating Taiwanese exporter are well above de minimis level, and the volume of imports from said countries is not negligible in the sense of Article 5(7) of the basic Regulation, the cumulated market share attaining 5,3 %. (67) In order to determine the appropriateness of a cumulative assessment in view of the conditions of competition between imported products from the two companies and between imported products and the like Community product, the Commission's services analysed the "exporters" market behaviour in terms of trends of export volumes and prices. (68) Similar trends in export volumes were identified for Taiwan and Russia, with an increase of 77 % for Russia and 151 % for Taiwan between 2001, the year following the imposition of measures on Taiwan, and the IP.
In fact, these countries decreased their respective average unit selling prices of SBS by 18 % and 6 % from 2001, after measures were imposed on Taiwanese imports and import volumes from Russia started to become significant, until the end of the IP.
In addition, a similar level of undercutting was determined for imports from both countries. (70) The investigation also showed that imports from the countries concerned into the Community used the same sales channels, as in the vast majority, said imports are traded through distributors, rather than sold to final customers. (71) Furthermore, as explained above, it was found that the product concerned imported from the countries concerned and produced by the Community industry share the same basic physical and chemical characteristics, and are to be considered alike in terms of interchangeability and substitutability.
Thus, it was established that exports of the product concerned from the countries concerned compete with each other and with SBS manufactured by the Community industry. (72) On the basis of the above, it was concluded that all conditions justifying the cumulation of imports of SBS originating in Russia and Taiwan were met. 3.2.
The corresponding market share increased from 1,5 % in 2000 to 5,3 % during the IP. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Imports (tonnes) | 2834 | 4979 | 4966 | 8919 | 9523 | Index | 100 | 176 | 175 | 315 | 336 | Market share | 1,5 % | 2,6 % | 2,5 % | 4,7 % | 5,3 % | 3.3.
Prices (74) The weighted average price of dumped imports of SBS originating in Russia and Taiwan declined by 12 % between 2000 and the IP. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Weighted average CIF Community frontier price (EUR/tonne) | 1145 | 1179 | 1086 | 1023 | 1004 | Index | 100 | 103 | 95 | 89 | 88 | 3.4.
Based on the evidence found, it was considered that this quality difference justified an estimated adjustment of 5 %, which was added to the CIF Community frontier price of the cooperating exporting producers. (77) During the IP, the weighted average undercutting margin was around 15 % for Russia and for the Taiwanese producer found to dump. (78) When assessing the above figures, it should be borne in mind that — despite the quality adjustment made — SBS from various sources is largely interchangeable and, consequently, price is an important criteria for selecting a source of supply.
Production (79) Production in volume by the Community industry decreased by 4 % during the period considered.
After an increase in 2002, the production decreased in 2003 and during the IP. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Production (tonnes) | 259698 | 253113 | 271964 | 253679 | 249566 | Index | 100 | 97 | 105 | 98 | 96 | 4.2.
Capacity of production and capacity utilisation rates (80) The production capacity was established on the basis of the nominal capacity of the production units owned by the Community industry, taking into account technical interruptions in production as well as the fact that in certain cases part of the capacity had been used for other products manufactured with the same production lines. (81) SBS production capacity remained stable during the period considered.
Indeed, after a slight increase in 2001 and 2002, it decreased in 2003 to the same level as in 2000 and remained at that level in the IP. (82) Capacity utilisation rates diminished by 4 percentage points from 79 % to 75 %.
As production capacity itself remained stable, this decline in capacity utilisation is merely due to the decrease in the production volumes of the Community industry. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Capacity of production (tonnes) | 329574 | 337524 | 338014 | 329173 | 330774 | Index | 100 | 102 | 103 | 100 | 100 | Capacity utilisation | 79 % | 75 % | 80 % | 77 % | 75 % | 4.3.
Stocks (83) During the period considered stocks increased by 60 %.
The stock increase seems to have two reasons, one being the decrease in sales and the other being a variety of new types of SBS produced which needed more time to be marketable. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Stocks (tonnes) | 44971 | 44325 | 59077 | 63997 | 71875 | Index | 100 | 99 | 131 | 142 | 160 | 4.4.
Investments (84) In the period considered the Community industry invested around EUR 60 million, mainly consisting of plant and machinery (around 48 %) and research and development projects (23 %).
After a sharp decrease in the years 2001 and 2002, investments increased again in 2003 and the IP, but still remained below that of the year 2000.
The increase in 2003 and the IP was due to maintenance and modernisation required for the development and introduction of new types of SBS, which was necessary for the Community industry in order to remain competitive.
Over the period considered the annual investments decreased overall by 11 %. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Investments (EUR '000) | 16464 | 12969 | 8914 | 11760 | 14698 | Index | 100 | 79 | 54 | 71 | 89 | 4.5.
Sales and market share (85) SBS sales by the Community industry on the Community market declined by 15 % from 2000 to the IP.
As Community consumption only decreased by 7 % during the period considered, the sharp decrease in sales by the Community industry resulted in a significant loss of market share, which indeed passed from 89 % to 82 %. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Sales in the EU (tonnes) | 172080 | 166680 | 161486 | 155050 | 146907 | Index | 100 | 97 | 94 | 90 | 85 | Market share | 89 % | 87 % | 81 % | 82 % | 82 % | 4.6.
Prices (86) The Community industry's average unit selling price was more or less at the same level during the IP compared to 2000, decreasing by only 1 %.
Indeed the Community industry's unit selling price first increased by 6 % between 2000 and 2001 and subsequently decreased by 7 % from 2001 to the IP. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Weighted average price (EUR/tonne) | 1350 | 1434 | 1363 | 1348 | 1330 | Index | 100 | 106 | 101 | 100 | 99 | 4.7.
Profitability and cash flow (87) During the period considered the weighted average profitability on net turnover of the Community industry for its sales of the like product on the Community market decreased from 2,2 % to 1,2 %.
It first sharply increased from 2,2 % in 2000 to 9,3 % in 2001 which coincided with the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing measures on imports of SBS from Taiwan and subsequently constantly decreased from 2001 onwards. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Weighted average profitability on net turnover | 2,2 % | 9,3 % | 8,9 % | 1,5 % | 1,2 % | (88) The cash flow generated was EUR –0,7 million during the IP.
However, the cash flow situation deteriorated sharply from 2002 to the IP. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Cash flow (in EUR '000) | –7362 | 10005 | 33050 | 4639 | –714 | 4.8.
Return on net assets (89) Return on net assets for the product concerned decreased by 5 % during the period considered.
After a first increase to 0,3 % in 2001 and 2,8 % in 2002, it sharply decreased to –8,5 % in 2003 and –11,2 % in the IP. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Weighted return on net assets | –6,2 % | 0,3 % | 2,8 % | –8,5 % | –11,2 % | 4.9.
Employment and wages (91) Employment in the Community industry decreased by 7 % during the period considered.
Wages remained stable over the period considered: total wages slightly increased by 1 %, which is considerably less than the European inflation rates during that period. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Employees | 627 | 642 | 596 | 614 | 581 | Index | 100 | 102 | 95 | 98 | 93 | Weighted average salary (EUR '000/year) | 75 | 75 | 73 | 73 | 76 | Index | 100 | 100 | 97 | 97 | 101 | 4.11.
Productivity (92) Productivity of the Community industry increased by 4 % during the period considered.
This increase shows that the Community producers not only adapted the number of people employed in relation to the decrease in sales but also managed to improve their efficiency. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Productivity (tonnes/employee) | 414 | 394 | 456 | 413 | 430 | Index | 100 | 95 | 110 | 100 | 104 | 4.12.
Consequently, the market share of the Community industry fell by 8 percentage points. 4.13.
Conclusion on injury (96) The cumulated volumes of dumped imports from Russia and Taiwan have increased, both in absolute terms and in terms of market share, representing a cumulated market share of 5,3 % in the IP.
Moreover, the weighted average price of dumped imports from Russia and Taiwan decreased by 12 % over the period considered.
While total Community consumption of SBS decreased by 7 %, the volume of the Community industry's sales decreased by 15 %, with a corresponding loss in market share of 7 percentage points.
Production volume decreased by 4 %; production capacity stagnated and capacity utilisation diminished by 4 percentage points.
The average unit selling price decreased by 1 % and profitability on net turnover by 1,1 percentage point during the period considered.
Employment decreased by 7 % whereas productivity increased by 4 %.
Finally, average salaries increased by 1 %, less than the European inflation rates during the period considered. (98) Based on the above, it is considered that the Community industry is in a difficult economic and financial situation and has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation.
Effect of the dumped imports (100) Dumped imports from the countries concerned increased by 3,8 % in market share during the period considered while the price of those imports decreased by 12 % and undercut the prices of the Community industry by 15,3 % during the IP.
While the volume of dumped imports slightly decreased between 2001 and 2002, and then massively increased in 2003 (+ 80 %), the sales of the Community industry showed a gradual decrease over the whole period considered.
This increase was particularly strong in 2003 and the IP, as the market share of the dumped imports went from 2,5 % in 2002 to 4,7 % in 2003 and 5,3 % in the IP.
During the same period, the Community industry slightly increased its market share from 81 % in 2002 to 82 % in 2003 and the IP.
Furthermore it is also noted that the Community industry reached its highest profitability in 2001 and 2002, at the time when its loss of market share took place.
It is acknowledged that these prices were somewhat depressed from 2003 onwards as the Community industry could not pass on some cost increases.
However, the impossibility to pass on these cost increases cannot or only to a very limited extent be attributed to the dumped imports, in particular since it should be noted that non-dumped imports showed a higher undercutting than the dumped imports.
Moreover, the market share of the dumped imports remained always below 5,3 %, while the non-dumped imports had a market share of around 12 %.
Therefore, it could not be concluded that the dumped imports had played a determining role in the injurious situation of the Community industry. 3.
This may have partially affected the situation in the Community industry, as the production of SBS is a capital intensive activity for which the volume of sales has a direct influence on profitability. (104) However, the decrease in consumption can only be considered as one of a number of causes of the injurious situation of the Community industry as it was shown that imports from Korea, Russia and Taiwan increased in the period considered, thus taking over part of the Community industry's market share. 3.2.
On a cumulated basis, they increased by 56 % in terms of volume and 5,2 percentage points in terms of market share during the period considered, reaching a market share of 12,8 % in the IP.
Moreover, the undercutting margin that could be calculated for non-dumped Korean and Taiwanese imports was higher (17,4 %) than for dumped imports (15,3 %).
This substantial undercutting together with the significant volumes of non‐dumped imports strongly contributed to the pressure on prices observed on the EC market. (111) On this basis, it was concluded that the volume and price effect of the non-dumped imports from Korea and Taiwan were such that they can be considered to have substantially contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry, and that the dumped imports from Russia and Taiwan played a less important role than the non-dumped imports. 3.4.
Imports from other third countries (112) Imports from all other third countries had a market share of 0,4 % in the Community during the IP and it was concluded that their impact on the injurious situation suffered by the Community industry was not significant. 3.5.
Costs of raw materials (113) It was noted that the costs of raw materials have increased during the period considered.
It was therefore not the increase of raw material costs in the Community as such but rather the coincidence between the pressure on price exerted by imports and the increase of the costs which had a negative effect on the profitability of the Community industry. (114) Given the above, it was concluded that the variations in the costs of raw materials in the Community were not, as such, a factor which caused injury to the Community industry. 4.
However, a more detailed analysis, in particular based on the development of trends over the period considered did not allow a causal link to be established as there was no clear coincidence in time between the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry and the effects of the dumped imports. (116) It was also found that, to the extent that a coincidence in time existed between, on the one hand, the increase of dumped imports from Russia and Taiwan, in terms of volumes and market share, and, on the other hand, the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry, which materialised in a loss in market share and a decrease in profitability, such a coincidence in time also existed for non-dumped imports, which had a steeper increase in volume than the dumped imports during the period considered. (117) Moreover, the non-dumped imports from Korea and Taiwan had during the IP a significantly higher volume than the dumped imports, leading to a significantly higher market share (12,8 % vs. 5,3 %).
The non-dumped imports were thus a prevailing factor in the injurious situation of the Community industry. (118) It was also found that the decrease in consumption in the EC contributed to the injury suffered by the Community industry. (119) The Community industry contested these conclusions, arguing that the impact of other factors was not such as to break the causal link between the dumped imports from Russia and Taiwan and the injury suffered by the Community industry.
Indeed, the investigation showed that the cooperating companies sold 75 % of their production of SBS to well-established third country markets.
In addition, it was noted that export prices had steadily increased from 2002 until the IP, by about 10 % and 15 %.
CONCLUSION (125) In view of the fact that no dumping was found for imports of SBS originating in Korea and for one company in Taiwan and that the injury suffered by the Community industry could be significantly attributed to other factors, such as the volumes and prices of imports not sold at dumped prices and a contraction in demand, the causal link between dumping and injury insofar as dumped imports originating in Russia and Taiwan are concerned could not be sufficiently established.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
