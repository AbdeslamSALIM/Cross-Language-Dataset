Within any transverse vertical plane, %quot%screen zone%quot% means a continuous surface such that, if a sphere of 165 mm diameter is projected in a longitudinal horizontal direction through any point of the zone and through the centre of the sphere, nowhere in the protection area is there any aperture through which the sphere can be passed.
