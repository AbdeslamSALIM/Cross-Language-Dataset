Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). [2] OJ L 203, 3.8.1999, p. 28. [3] OJ L 229, 9.9.2000, p. 3. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX I LIST OF VARIABLES Structural statistics on labour costs Table A — National data Table B — National data by size class of enterprise Table C — Regional data For the variables listed below, either Table A only or all three tables must be provided.
References ESA 95: 11.32 to 11.34; SBS: code 16140 (A.11 + A.121 + A.131 corresponds to the SBS variable "number of employees in full-time units") B.
The total number of hours actually worked (B.1) is recorded separately for full-time employees (B.11), part-time employees (B.12) and apprentices (B.13).
References ESA 95: 11.26 to 11.29; SBS: code 16150 (number of hours worked by employees) C.
The total number of paid hours (C.1) is recorded separately for full-time (C.11), part-time employees (C.12) and apprentices (C.13).
The total annual number of hours worked by full-time employees (before corrections for days not actually worked) results to be (A.11) × (a+b).
If one subtracts the total annual number of hours not actually worked which is defined by (A.11) × c × (d + e + f + g + h) one gets (B.11), the total annual hours actually worked by full-time employees: (B.11) = (A.11) × [(a+b) – c (d + e + f + g + h)].
References ESA 95: 4.02 (code D.1), SBS: code 13310 (personnel costs) D.11 Wages and salaries Wages and salaries include bonuses, pay for piecework and shift work, allowances, fees, tips and gratuities, commission and remuneration in kind.
A full breakdown of employer’s social contributions by component is provided by Figure 3 in Annex I.
Some countries, for example, use the observable unfunded social benefits paid, less eventual employees' social contributions, as an estimate for D.122.
Variable D.122 includes in particular imputed employers’ social contributions for pensions and health care.
Payments not linked to a collective agreement are included in D.11112.
Reference ESA 95: 4.37(a) (code D.39) [1] The coverage of Section L of NACE Rev.1.1 is optional.
The transmission codes for the economic activities of NACE Rev. 1.1, the country or region according to the NUTS classification in force and the size classes of enterprises are set by Eurostat in an implementation paper. [2] To avoid double counting, the hours worked by persons employed by employment agencies are to be included in the NACE category of the employment agency (NACE Rev.1.1, 74.50) and not in the NACE category of the enterprise for which they actually work. [3] An outworker is a person who agrees to work for a particular enterprise or to supply a certain quantity of goods or services to a particular enterprise by prior arrangement or contract with that enterprise, but whose place of work is not within it (Reference ESA 95: 11.13(g)).
An average based on quarterly figures on employees is also admissible. [5] Unpaid hours worked as a component of "hours actually worked" often have to be estimated, for example from household survey data. -------------------------------------------------- Appendix to Annex II Illustrative examples for the classification of certain labour cost items D.11111: Direct remuneration, bonuses and allowances paid in each pay period (see also ESA 95, 4.03 (a-c, e, g, k), code D.11) Payments that belong under labour cost item D.11111 have the following characteristics: They are: cash transactions from an employer to an employee.
The income in kind is equal to the difference between the market price and the reduced price | D.11141 | Free or subsidised housing | Employer pays employees’ housing costs in full or in part.
Again, the income in kind is arrived at by comparing with the market price | D.11142 | Use of a car owned by the employer | Employer meets the running costs for a car owned by the employer and made available to the employee for business as well as private use (The income in kind refers to the value of the use of the private car) | D.11143 | Free or subsidised petrol | Employer pays all or part of the employee's private fuel costs associated with the use of a car owned by the employer.
The income in kind is equal to the cash value of this benefit | D.11143 | Share purchase schemes | Share-based payments in kind where shares are granted to employees as part of their compensation packages.
The employee receives the shares without delay at a price below the market price (Stock appreciation rights are cash-settled forms of share-based compensation and should come under D.11112) | D.11144 | Stock options | Share-based payments in kind where shares are granted to employees as part of their compensation packages.
The employee receives the right to buy shares at a well-defined point of time in the future for a price already fixed in the present (Stock-appreciation rights are cash-settled forms of share-based compensation and should come under D.11112) | D.11144 | Free or subsidised parking at work | Employer provides parking facilities for employees at reduced or zero cost to the employee.
The income corresponds to the cash value of this benefit | D.11145 | Free or subsidised travel to and from work | Employees' travel costs to and from work are paid in full or in part.
The income in kind is equal to the cash value, as above | D.11145 | Free or subsidised meals | Meals are provided by the employer at reduced or zero cost to the employee.
The income in kind is equal to the cash value, as above | D.11145 | D.121: Employers’ actual social contributions (see ESA 95, 4.08 (code D.121), and 4.12(b)) Examples: Payments that fall under variable D.121 Item | Description | Further breakdown | Employers’ payments to an insurance scheme for disability | Regular funded payments of the employer into the insurance scheme | D.1211 | Employers’ statutory payments to pension funds | The employer pays during occupation into a pension scheme involving a social-security fund, an insurance enterprise or an autonomous pension fund | D.1211 | Enhanced employer pension contributions | Employer pays an extra contribution to the employee's pension scheme | D.1212 | D.122: Employers’ imputed social contributions (see ESA 95, 4.10 (code D.122), and 4.12(c)) Examples: Payments that come under variable D.122 Item | Description | Further breakdown | Payments during maternity leave | Employer pays directly to the employee during maternity as compensation for loss of earnings | D.1221 | Employers’ imputed social contributions for pensions of civil servants | The employer does not make payments into a pension scheme during the person’s employment.
Table C is not required for those countries where NUTS 1 corresponds to the national level.
For a subset of variables listed in Annex I, only table A is required.
These variables are marked in Annex I.
The transmission codes for - the economic activities of NACE Rev. 1.1, - the size classes for enterprises and - the countries or regions are set by Eurostat in an implementation paper.
Two codes are to be used to identify confidential records: "1": if the data for an individual record in Table A, B or C are confidential [1]; " ": if the data are not confidential, insert a space " " (not a zero or a dash "–").
Variables The variables requested are defined in Annex I.
Figures should be inserted without spaces, points or commas (for example, 13967 is correct; the following are incorrect: 13 967 or 13.967 or 13,967).
For the euro-zone countries, the figures should be expressed in euros.
