In 2003 horizontal aid represented 79 % of all aid; within this percentage, 14 % was allocated to research and development [12].
Suitable periodic adaptations are therefore necessary [17], while maintaining clarity and transparency of the legal reference framework. 2.2.7 In terms of globalisation of markets special attention should be given on the one hand to the multilateral reference framework of the WTO and on the other to that of Europe's main trading partners. 2.2.8 In the United States of America, the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) grants small and medium-sized enterprises, through a number of federal public programmes, various forms of aid for innovation, to which must be added the aid granted by the individual states as well as the federal initiative known as the Small Business Innovation Research Programme â€” SBIR. 2.2.8.1 The SBA runs a series of programmes: - Basic Loan Program, providing guarantees (up to 75 %) for loans which can amount to as much as 2 million dollars per enterprise - SBA Investment Program, for Angels Capital and Venture Capital investments - Certified Development Company "504" Loan Program, with aid for innovation and modernization up to 4 million dollars - Microloan Program, with short term aid up to 35000 dollars through intermediaries - Prequalification Loan Program, with aid up to 250000 dollars, through intermediaries - Export Working Capital Program, with 90 % guarantee, up to a maximum of 1.5 million dollars - SBA Express, with aid up to 350000 dollars and 50 % guarantee - SBA Community Express, with aid up to 250000 dollars and 75 % guarantee - SBA Secondary Market Program and SBA Asset Sales Program, to facilitate access to the shares market - SBA Women's Network for Entrepreneurial Training Initiative, to train women entrepreneurs. 2.2.8.2 The SBIR initiative, concerned with the granting of public aid to innovation and research in smaller enterprises, provides seed capital assistance for feasibility studies, of amounts up to 100000 dollars in the first phase and up to 750000 dollars in the second phase in which prototypes are being developed; for the third phase, no action by the SBIR funds is envisaged, but mechanisms for finding public and private funds come into play for the marketing phase. 2.2.9 Recent recommendations by the EURAB, a consultative body set up by the European Commission which brings together the European academic and business worlds, have emphasised the need to adopt a similar mechanism at Community and Member State level to supplement the actions of the RTD&amp;D framework programme, stressing that "This may require a revision of EU rules for state aid." [18] 2.2.10 In Japan, the Agency for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises provides various types of public support for innovation, such as: - the Start Up programme, which covers part of the costs of practical application of R&amp;D, technological assessment, acquisition of patents (50 % reduction of registration and renewal costs for 3 years); - the Creative Technologies R&amp;D programme; - the Local Revitalisation R&amp;D programme; - the programme to promote cooperation between industry, the academic world, government and other public officials; - the Small Business Innovation Research System, the Japanese SBIR, which has the aim of promoting the development of SMEs' technological capacity, granting public aid for their creative activities and financing the marketing of the research results; - the programme which supports with public funds the introduction and development of information technologies in enterprises; - the "Subsidies for SMEs Business Innovation" programme; - the "Subsidies for Strengthening SMEs Business Resource" programme; - the "Credit Guarantees Exemption" programme; - measures to reduce interest rates on credits provided by the Japan Finance Corporation for Small and Medium Enterprise (JASME), the National Life Finance Corporation (NLFC) and the Shoko Chukin Bank; - the tax concessions plan for SMEs; - the investments plan up to 300000 Yen, by the "Small and Medium Business Investment and Consultation Companies"; - the incentives plan set up by the law on "Promotion of Improvement of Employment Management in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises for Securing Manpower and Creating Quality Jobs". 2.2.11 With regard to the Multilateral WTO Agreements, the concept of "specific state aid" is defined as a subsidy which may be granted only to an enterprise, an industry or a group of industries in a state granting the subsidy.
