Pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 the Portuguese Government has decided to amend, commencing on 1 January 2006, the public service obligations imposed on scheduled air services operated on the following routes: - Lisbon/Ponta Delgada/Lisbon - Lisbon/Terceira/Lisbon - Lisbon/Horta/Lisbon - Funchal/Ponta Delgada/Funchal - Porto/Ponta Delgada/Porto - Lisbon/Santa Maria/Lisbon - Lisbon/Pico/Lisbon 2.
Except in cases of force majeure, the number of flights cancelled for reasons directly attributable to the carrier must not exceed 2 % of the number of flights scheduled for the relevant season; cancellation means that a flight scheduled to take place and on which at least one seat was booked fails to take place.
In the event of temporary interruption of the air services due to unforeseen circumstances, cases of force majeure or other reasons, the programmed capacity must be increased by at least 60 % from the moment when services can be resumed until all the traffic backlog accumulated during the interruption in services has been cleared.
Punctuality: Except in cases of force majeure, delays of more than 15 minutes directly attributable to the carrier may not affect more than 15 % of flights.
If the total number of services offered per week on any given route by all operators combined is more than 6 (six), there must be at least one service a day.
The fares and tariffs specified in point 1(b) and (f) and in point 2(a), (b) and (c) will be revised annually on 1 April, beginning in 2006, on the basis of the inflation rate for the previous year published in the Grandes Opções do Plano [Major Planning Options] and notified, by 28 February 2005, by INAC (the Portuguese Civil Aviation Institute) to the carriers operating the routes in question.
A no-show penalty may be set, not exceeding 10 % of the relevant economy class reference fare.
