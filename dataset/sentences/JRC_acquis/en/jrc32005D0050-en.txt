The Commission therefore adopted Decision 2004/545/EC of 8 July 2004 on the harmonisation of the radio spectrum in the 79 GHz range for the use of automotive short-range radar equipment in the Community [5]. (5) However, automotive short-range radar technology in the 79 GHz range band is still under development and is not immediately available on a cost-effective basis, although it is understood that the industry will promote the development of such a technology in order to make it available at the earliest possible date. (6) In its report of 9 July 2004 to the European Commission under the mandate of 5 August 2003, CEPT identified the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band as being a temporary solution which would enable the early introduction of automotive short-range radar in the Community to meet the objectives of the e-Safety initiative, since technology is considered sufficiently mature for operation in that band.
Therefore, Member States should take the appropriate measures based on their particular national radio spectrum situation to make sufficient radio spectrum available on a harmonised basis in the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band (21,65 to 26,65 GHz), while protecting existing services operating in that band from harmful interference. (7) According to footnote 5.340 of the Radio Regulations of the ITU, all emissions are prohibited in the band 23,6 to 24,0 GHz, in order to protect the use on a primary basis of this band by the radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research passive services.
The 22,21 to 24,00 GHz frequency range is also needed to measure spectral lines of ammonia and water as well as continuum observations for the radio astronomy service. (10) The bands 21,2 to 23,6 GHz and 24,5 to 26,5 GHz are allocated to the fixed service on a primary basis in the ITU Radio Regulations and are extensively used by fixed links to meet the infrastructure requirement for existing 2G and 3G mobile networks and to develop broadband fixed wireless networks. (11) Based on studies of compatibility between automotive short-range radar and fixed services, earth exploration satellite services and radio astronomy services, CEPT has concluded that an unlimited deployment of automotive short-range radar systems in the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band will create unacceptable harmful interference to existing radio applications operating in this band.
However, to allow an early implementation of automotive short-range radar in 24 GHz, a limited amount of transmitters with manual deactivation can be allowed as, with such a limited deployment, the probability of causing harmful interference to the radio astronomy service is expected to remain low. (24) The temporary introduction of automotive short-range radar in the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band has an exceptional character and must not be considered as a precedent for the possible introduction of other applications in the bands where ITU Radio Regulations footnote 5.340 applies, be it for temporary or permanent use.
Furthermore, automotive short-range radar should not constrain the future development in the use of the 24 GHz band of applications which are protected by footnote 5.340. (25) The placing on the market and operation of 24 GHz automotive short-range radar equipment in a stand-alone mode or retrofitted in vehicles already on the market would not be compatible with the objective of avoiding harmful interference to existing radio applications operating in this band, since it could lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of such equipment.
Article 3 The 24 GHz range radio spectrum band shall be designated and made available as soon as possible and no later than 1 July 2005, on a non-interference and non-protected basis, for automotive short-range radar equipment put into service in the Community which complies with the conditions laid down in Articles 4 and 6.
The 24 GHz range radio spectrum band shall remain so available until the reference date, subject to the provisions of Article 5.
After that date, the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band shall cease to be available for automotive short-range radar equipment mounted on any vehicle except where that equipment was originally installed, or is replacing equipment so installed, in a vehicle registered, placed on the market or put into service before that date in the Community.
Emissions within the 23,6-24,0 GHz band that appear 30o or greater above the horizontal plane shall be attenuated by at least 25 dB for automotive short-range radar equipment placed on the market before 2010 and thereafter by at least 30 dB.
The continued availability of the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band for automotive short-range radar applications shall be kept under active scrutiny to ensure that the main premise of opening this band to such systems remains valid, which is that no harmful interference is caused to other users of the band, in particular through the timely verification of: (a) the total number of vehicles registered, placed on the market or put into service equipped with 24 GHz automotive short-range radar in each Member State, to verify that this number does not exceed the level of 7 % of the total number of vehicles in circulation in each Member State; (b) whether adequate information has been made available by Member States or by manufacturers and importers regarding the number of 24 GHz short-range radar-equipped vehicles for the purpose of monitoring effectively the use of the 24 GHz band by automotive short-range radar equipment; (c) whether the individual or cumulative use of 24 GHz automotive short-range radar is causing or is likely to cause within a short period of time harmful interference to other users in the 24 GHz band or in adjacent bands in at least one Member State, whether or not the threshold referred to in (a) has been reached; (d) the continuing appropriateness of the reference date. 2.
In addition to the review process in paragraph 1, a fundamental review shall be carried out by 31 December 2009 at the latest to verify the continuing relevance of the initial assumptions concerning the operation of automotive short-range radar in the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band, as well as to verify whether the development of automotive short-range radar technology in the 79 GHz range is progressing in such a way as to ensure that automotive short-range radar applications operating in this radio spectrum band will be readily available by 1 July 2013. 3.
The Member States shall assist the Commission to carry out the reviews referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 by ensuring that the necessary information is collected and provided to the Commission in a timely manner, in particular the information set out in the Annex.
Automotive short-range radar equipment put into service in the Community shall ensure protection of the radio astronomy stations operating in the radio spectrum band 22,21 to 24,00 GHz defined in Article 7 through automatic deactivation in a defined exclusion zone or via another method providing equivalent protection for these stations without driver intervention. 3.
By way of derogation to paragraph 2, manual deactivation will be accepted for automotive short-range radar equipment put into service in the Community operating in the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band before the transition date.
Article 8 This Decision is addressed to the Member States.
