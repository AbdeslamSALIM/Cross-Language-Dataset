On 21 April 2004 , the Biological Hazards panel of the European Food Safety Authority adopted an opinion in which it concludes that insufficient additional argument exists to modify the SSC opinion.
To address practical problems, the rules should be amended regarding holdings producing lambs for further fattening, the introduction of ewes of unknown genotype to infected holdings, and the time period during which derogations are to apply for the destruction of animals in holdings or breeds in which the frequency of the ARR allele is low. (5) Scrapie eradication measures, as advised in the opinion of the SSC of 4 April 2002 , were inserted in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003(2).
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
Points 3 and 4 of the Annex to the present Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2005 .
