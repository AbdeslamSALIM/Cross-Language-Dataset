Common Position (EC) No 24/2005 of 18 April 2005 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) (19th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) Common Position (EC) No 24/2005 adopted by the Council on 18 April 2005 with a view to adopting Directive 2005/…/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (optical radiation) (19th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (2005/C 172 E/02) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 137(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], presented after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at Work, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [3], Whereas: (1) Under the Treaty the Council may, by means of directives, adopt minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to guarantee a better level of protection of the health and safety of workers.
Next, on 6 February 2003, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2003/10/EC on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (noise) (17th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [6].
Thereafter, on 29 April 2004, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2004/40/EC on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (electromagnetic fields) (18th individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) [7]. (4) It is now considered necessary to introduce measures protecting workers from the risks associated with optical radiation, owing to its effects on the health and safety of workers, in particular damage to the eyes and to the skin.
Directive 89/391/EEC shall apply fully to the whole area referred to in paragraph 1, without prejudice to more stringent and/or more specific provisions contained in this Directive.
Article 2 Definitions For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply: (a) optical radiation: any electromagnetic radiation in the wavelength range between 100 nm and 1 mm.

[12] Four years after the entry into force of this Directive. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX I NON-COHERENT OPTICAL RADIATION The biophysically relevant exposure values to optical radiation can be determined with the formulae below.
Blue light strictly speaking covers only the range of approximately 400 to 490 nm.
Coefficients used as calculation tools within the tables 2.2 to 2.4 are listed in table 2.5 and corrections for repetitive exposure are listed in table 2.6.
Notes: dP power expressed in watt [W]; dA surface expressed in square meter [m2]; E (t), E irradiance or power density: the radiant power incident per unit area upon a surface, generally expressed in watts per square metre [W m-2].
Values of E(t), E come from measurements or may be provided by the manufacturer of the equipment; H radiant exposure, the time integral of the irradiance, expressed in joules per square metre [J m-2]; t time, duration of the exposure, expressed in seconds [s]; λ wavelength, expressed in nanometres [nm]; γ limiting cone angle of measurement field-of-view expressed in milliradians [mrad]; γm measurement field of view expressed in milliradians [mrad]; α angular subtense of a source expressed in milliradians [mrad]; limiting aperture: the circular area over which irradiance and radiant exposure are averaged; G integrated radiance: the integral of the radiance over a given exposure time expressed as radiant energy per unit area of a radiating surface per unit solid angle of emission, in joules per square metre per steradian [J m-2 sr -1].
Parameter | Valid spectral range (nm) | Value | Tmin | 315 %lt% λ ≤ 400 | Tmin = 10 -9 s | (= 1 ns) | 400 %lt% λ ≤ 1050 | Tmin = 18 · 10 -6 s | (= 18 μs) | 1050 %lt% λ ≤ 1400 | Tmin = 50 · 10 -6 s | (= 50 μs) | 1400 %lt% λ ≤ 1500 | Tmin = 10 -3 s | (= 1 ms) | 1500 %lt% λ ≤ 1800 | Tmin = 10 s | | 1800 %lt% λ ≤ 2600 | Tmin = 10 -3 s | (= 1 ms) | 2600 %lt% λ ≤ 10 6 | Tmin = 10 -7 s | (= 100 ns) | [1] If the wavelength of the laser is covered by two limits, then the more restrictive applies. [2] When 1400≤λ%lt%105 nm: aperture diameter = 1 mm for t ≤ 0,3 s and 1,5 t0,375 mm for 0,3 s %lt% t %lt% 10 s; when 105≤λ%lt%106 nm: aperture diameter = 11 mm. [3] Due to lack of data at these pulse lengths, ICNIRP recommends the use of the 1 ns irradiance limits. [4] The table states values for single laser pulses.
In case of multiple laser pulses, then the laser pulse durations of pulses falling within an interval Tmin (listed in table 2.6) must be added up and the resulting time value must be filled in for t in the formula: 5,6 · 103 t 0,25 [5] If the wavelength or another condition of the laser is covered by two limits, then the more restrictive applies. [6] For small sources subtending an angle of 1,5 mrad or less, the visible dual limits E from 400 nm to 600 nm reduce to the thermal limits for 10s≤ t%lt%T1 and to photochemical limits for longer times.
The photochemical retinal hazard limit may also be expressed as a time integrated radiance G = 106 CB [J m-2 sr-1] for t %gt% 10s up to t = 10000 s and L = 100 CB [W m-2 sr-1] for t %gt% 10000 s.
The column with wavelength band names is only meant to provide better overview for the user. (The notation G is used by CEN; the notation Lt is used by CIE; the notation LP is used by IEC and CENELEC.) [7] For wavelength 1400 — 105 nm: aperture diameter = 3,5 mm; for wavelength 105 — 106 nm: aperture Diameter = 11 mm [8] For measurement of the exposure value the consideration of γ is defined as follows: If α (angular subtense of a source) %gt% γ (limiting cone angle, indicated in brackets in the corresponding column) then the measurement field of view γm should be the given value of γ. (If a larger measurement field of view is used, then the hazard would be overestimated).If α %lt% γ then the measurement field of view γm must be large enough to fully enclose the source but is otherwise not limited and may be larger than γ. [9] If the wavelength or another condition of the laser is covered by two limits, then the more restrictive applies. -------------------------------------------------- STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I.
The European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee delivered their opinions on 20 April 1994 and 30 June 1993 respectively.
The European Parliament confirmed its first reading on 16 September 1999 [1].
The Council adopted a Common Position on 18 April 2005, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty.
In addition, Amendment 4 was partly taken up in Article 2(e).
Amendment 10 is reflected in spirit in the text of Article 5(6), even though the Council did not consider it appropriate to refer to an exclusive aim of preventive measures for particularly sensitive risk groups.
Amendment 12 was accepted in spirit in Article 5(1), where the Common Position now refers to the elimination or reduction to a minimum of the exposure.
Amendment 13 was partly accepted in Article 5(5).
However, Article 8 of the Common Position includes a number of provisions concerning arrangements for health surveillance, - amendments 18, 19 and 20 were redundant as the Common Position does not include a special provision for derogation or exemptions, - the Council considered the standard provision in Article 11 on a Committee to assist the Commission to be appropriate and therefore did not accept amendment 21, - amendment 27 was redundant as the Common Position does not include a special provision for hazardous activities, - amendments 34, 35 and 36 were not adopted as the Annexes had been restructured in line with the ICNIRP Recommendations.
The Council also considers that, having regard to the preparation of separate texts in respect of each of the four physical agents, it has taken account of the principal objectives pursued by the European Parliament in its amendments to the original Commission proposal.
