It constitutes a basic act in accordance with Article 49 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
The Hercule II programme should cover in particular activities in the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting.
The Hercule programme constitutes a basic act in accordance with Article 49 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom)No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
The public procurement contracts targeted by the Hercule programme cover the sectors “information support”, “technical assistance” and “training, seminars and conferences”. - In this context, it is judged appropriate to merge OLAF’s budget lines starting in 2007, with the exception of the “AFIS” budget line (No 24 02 03).
An analysis carried out by OLAF of the risk of fraud reached the following conclusions: 1) the certainty of an increase in the smuggling of counterfeited cigarettes in the future; 2) the emergence of the production of counterfeited cigarettes on European territory; 3) the need for the competent national authorities to promote greater cooperation; 4) the identification of certain external borders as being “high-risk” in terms of their being routes for the import of counterfeited cigarettes onto the EU's internal market; 5) the heightened need for cooperation and support for the anti-fraud activities of the Member States in this field is illustrated by the signature by some Member States and the Commission of an agreement with a cigarette manufacturer on taking more rigorous action against the counterfeiting and smuggling of cigarettes. - Accession countries which signed the Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005 and the candidate countries can participate in the programme on the basis of a memorandum of understanding to be drawn up in accordance with the respective framework agreements.
