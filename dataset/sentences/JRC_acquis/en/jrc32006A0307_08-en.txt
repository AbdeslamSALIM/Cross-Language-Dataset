Growth slowed down strongly in 2001 but recovered quickly, reaching 4,4 % in 2004.
However, due to the very strong rise in expenditure, these surpluses rapidly declined since the beginning of this decade and turned into a deficit in 2004. (3) In its opinion of 18 January 2005, the Council endorsed the budgetary strategy presented in the previous update of the stability programme, covering the period 2004-2007. (4) As regards budgetary implementation in 2005, the general government deficit is currently estimated at -2,3 % of GDP in the Commission services' autumn 2005 forecast as against a -1,0 % of GDP target set in the previous update of the stability programme.
While government revenues, which were projected by the previous update to increase by 1,2 percentage points of GDP, actually rose by only 0,2 of a percentage point of GDP, in part due to large and unexpected VAT reimbursements, government expenditure increased by 1,4 percentage points of GDP (of which 0,8 of a percentage point is accounted for by public investment) instead of 0,8 of a percentage point of GDP as planned. (5) The programme broadly follows the model structure and data provision requirements for stability and convergence programmes specified in the new code of conduct [2]. (6) According to the programme's macroeconomic scenario, real GDP growth should accelerate from an estimated 4,0 % in 2005 to 4,4 % in 2006 and to 4,9 % in both 2007 and 2008.
The time profile and the level of the primary balance are similar to those of the total balance, with an improvement from a -2,1 % of GDP primary deficit in 2005 to a 0,1 % primary surplus at the end of the period.
The programme's MTO is similar to the minimum benchmark aiming at providing a sufficient safety margin in order to guarantee that the 3 % threshold set for the general government deficit is not breached.
However, the improvement in the structural deficit planned by the programme only amounts to 0,3 of a percentage point of GDP in 2006, despite favourable overall economic conditions. (11) The general government debt is estimated at 6,4 % of GDP in 2005.
As long as this objective has not been achieved, the government is committed to taking all the necessary corrective measures in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the integrated guideline on safeguarding economic sustainability in view of the projected costs of ageing population. (14) The National Reform Programme of Luxembourg, submitted on 17 November 2005, identifies the following challenges with significant implications for public finances: (i) securing economic stability, and (ii) safeguarding economic sustainability.
While the global strategy of deficit reduction through expenditure restraint presented in the programme is commendable, the Council is of the opinion that the Luxembourg authorities should: - strengthen the effort of budgetary adjustment in 2006 and identify and implement the necessary measures for 2007 and 2008, and - improve long-term sustainability, in particular by containing increases in public expenditure through reform in the pension system.
