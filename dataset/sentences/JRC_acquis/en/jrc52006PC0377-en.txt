On the other hand, regarding agricultural duties, taking into account that the quantity of recent sugar imports from Croatia is lower than the quantity established in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, for which the duty is set at ‘0’, no financial impact is foreseeable on budgetary income. | [1] OJ L 26, 28.1.2005, p. 3.
