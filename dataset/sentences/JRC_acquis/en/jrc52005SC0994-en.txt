Recommendation for a Council recommendation to Portugal with a view to bringing an end to the situation of an excessive government deficit /* SEC/2005/0994 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 20.7.2005 SEC(2005) 994 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL RECOMMENDATION TO PORTUGAL with a view to bringing an end to the situation of an excessive government deficit (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The excessive deficit procedure for Portugal On 9 June 2005, Portugal submitted the most recent update of its stability programme covering the period 2005-2009.
This update reveals the plans for a general government deficit in excess of the 3% of GDP reference value of the Treaty for the years from 2005 to 2007.
Over the same years, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to further increase from a reported figure of 61.9% in 2004 to a peak of 67.8% of GDP in 2007.
In its opinion of 4 July 2005, the Committee concluded “that the planned budgetary developments in Portugal in 2005 are such that both criteria in the second paragraph of Article 104 are not respected”.
This opinion, adopted by the Commission on 20 July 2005, has been addressed to the Council, according to Article 104(5) of the Treaty.
In the case of Portugal, unless there are special circumstances, the correction of the excessive deficit should therefore be completed by 2006.
The rate of economic growth has decreased sharply since 2000, to the point of becoming clearly negative in 2003.
The economy returned to moderate positive economic growth in 2004 and is expected to remain on a gradual but still moderate upward trend for the years to come.
As revealed in the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme, after a reported deficit of 2.9% of GDP in 2004, the planned 2005 deficit-to-GDP ratio is 6.2% of GDP, already supported by a corrective package of some 0.6% of GDP adopted in mid-2005.
Assuming no additional measures in 2005, and, in line with the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme, GDP growth accelerating to 1.4% in 2006 from 0.8% in 2005, bringing the deficit below 3% of GDP in 2006 would require an adjustment, in structural terms, of almost 3% of GDP from 2005.
In addition, the budgetary adjustment needs to be framed within a comprehensive reform strategy, including the reform of the public administration and of the private sector social security system, aiming at tackling the deep-rooted structural problems that have ridden the Portuguese economy for several years, which were also highlighted in the report according to Article 104(3) approved by the Commission on 22 June.
The high level of government debt and its upward trend since the year 2001 are a cause for concern.
The Council recommendation has to establish a deadline of four months at the most for effective action to be taken by Portugal to correct the excessive deficit as well as a deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit, which should be completed in the year following its identification unless there are special circumstances.
The economy returned to moderate positive economic growth in 2004 and is expected to remain on a gradual upward trend for the years to come.
As revealed in the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme, after a reported deficit of 2.9% of GDP in 2004, the planned 2005 deficit-to-GDP ratio is 6.2% of GDP, already supported by a corrective package of some 0.6% of GDP adopted in mid-2005.
Assuming no additional measures in 2005, and GDP growth accelerating to 1.4% in 2006, bringing the deficit below 3% of GDP in 2006 would require an adjustment, in structural terms, relative to 2005, of almost 3% of GDP. (9) All in all, in view of the current cyclical weakness in Portugal and the size of the required adjustment to bring the deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value by 2006, special circumstances appear to exist, which allow an extension of the deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit beyond 2006.
However, the nature of these revisions, and the current allocation of institutional responsibilities point to the need for further improvement in processing government account data. (14) The Commission and the Council, in accordance with article 10 of CR 1467/97, shall monitor the implementation of action taken by Portugal in response to this recommendation.
HEREBY RECOMMENDS: - The Portuguese authorities should put an end to the present excessive deficit situation as rapidly as possible in accordance with Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97; - The Portuguese authorities should bring the general government deficit below 3% of GDP in a credible and sustainable manner by 2008 by taking action in a medium-term framework.
