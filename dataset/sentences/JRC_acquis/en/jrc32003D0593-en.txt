ANNEX In the Annex to Decision 2003/43/EC, the following Tables and note shall be added: %quot% TABLE 2 Classes of reaction-to-fire performance of gypsum plasterboard products %gt%TABLE%gt% Note: End Use Application The gypsum plasterboards shall be mounted and fixed using one of the two following methods: (a) Mechanically fixed to a supporting substructure The boards, or (in the case of multi-layer systems) at least the outermost layer of boards, shall be mechanically fixed to a metal substructure (made from components detailed in EN 14195) or a timber substructure (in accordance with EN 336 and ENV 1995-5).
When the substructure provides supporting members in one direction only, the maximum span between the supporting members shall not exceed a dimension equal to 50 times the thickness of the boards.
When the substructure includes supporting members in two directions the maximum span in either direction shall not exceed a dimension equal to 100 times the thickness of the boards.
The mechanical fixings shall be screws or nails, which shall be fixed through the thickness of the boards into the substructure at centres not exceeding 300 mm measured along the length of each supporting member.
In either case the screw or nail fixings or the adhesive 'dabs' shall be positioned at maximum 600 mm vertical and horizontal centres.
