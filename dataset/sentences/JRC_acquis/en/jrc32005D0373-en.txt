PROCEDURE (1) By letter of 23 December 2002, registered as received on 3 January 2003, Portugal notified under the Multisectoral Framework on regional aid for large investment projects [2] (hereinafter the Multisectoral Framework) its intention to grant investment aid to Infineon Technologies-Fabrico de Semiconductores, Portugal, SA (hereinafter Infineon Portugal).
By letter of 17 January 2003, it informed Portugal that the notification was considered incomplete and raised a series of questions.
Following a reminder from the Commission, Portugal submitted additional information by letter of 6 May 2003, registered as received on the following day.
By letter of 9 July 2003 (C(2003) 2004 fin), the Commission informed Portugal that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the aid.
The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid measure. (3) By letters Nos 2531 of 6 August 2003 (registered as received on 13 August) and 2540 of 7 August 2003 (registered as received on 19 August), Portugal gave its reaction to the decision to initiate the procedure. (4) The Commission received comments from four interested parties.
The beneficiary (5) Infineon Portugal is a wholly owned subsidiary of Infineon Technologies NV, which is itself controlled by Infineon Technologies AG (hereinafter Infineon).
Infineon went public in March 2000 and is a spin-off from Siemens AG comprising its semiconductor activities. (6) Infineon Portugal belongs to the memory products segment and designs, develops, manufactures and markets semiconductor memory products.
It is a back-end unit active in the assembly, final testing and packaging of 64 MB, 128 MB and 265 MB DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory).
According to the Portuguese authorities, the Infineon plant located in Portugal is the only back-end unit in the DRAM production sector in Europe. (7) Portugal has submitted the following data on turnover and employment for Infineon, broken down by the world, EEA and Portuguese markets. (in million EUR) | | Worldwide | EEA | Portugal | Turnover | Workforce | Turnover | Workforce | Turnover | Workforce | 1998 | 3178 | 21861 | 1861 | 14401 | […] | 1999 | 4237 | 24541 | 2444 | 15695 | 2000 | 7283 | 29166 | 3259 | 17656 | 2001 | 5671 | 33813 | 3005 | 21821 | 2002 | 5207 | 30423 | 2395 | 20306 | 2.
The investment was aimed at increasing the company’s competitiveness by extending production from 16 MB and 64 MB DRAMs to 256 MB and 512 MB DRAMs.
It launched a new product, Chip Sized Package, a smaller type of memory. (10) Prior to completion of the investment project, Infineon Portugal produced some 2 million chips per week.
After completion, its production capacity increased to 5 million chips per week.
The capacity increase resulting from the project was therefore 150 %. (11) According to the Portuguese authorities, Infineon has a 3,5 % share of the semiconductor market and a 12,8 % share of the DRAM market (data for 2002). (12) Total eligible investment costs amount to EUR 141036103 (at 2000 prices).
The project costs are given in the following table. (in EUR) | | Total costs | Eligible costs | | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | […] | Total | 141472781 | 141036103 | (13) According to the Portuguese authorities, the project has led to the creation of 252 direct jobs and 30 indirect jobs in the region.
In their opinion, it also safeguarded 596 jobs, corresponding to all existing jobs at Infineon Portugal. 3.
Aid measures (14) According to the Portuguese authorities, the beneficiary applied for State aid in April 1999.
The aid consists of a loan granted under scheme N 667/99 [6] and a tax incentive granted under scheme N 97/99 [7]. (15) The loan totals EUR 56414441 and is interest free.
The loan was approved by the Portuguese authorities on 21 November 2001 and no payments have as yet been disbursed. (16) In addition, Infineon Portugal will benefit from a tax incentive of up to EUR 20450235.
It is to be used by Infineon according to the following schedule: EUR 795000 in 2004, EUR 1327000 in 2005, EUR 15331235 in 2006, EUR 1462000 in 2007 and EUR 1535000 in 2008.
The net aid intensity of the aid (amount of aid in nge/total eligible costs) is therefore 29,4 % (EUR 41504299/EUR 141036103). 4.
Grounds for initiating the formal investigation procedure (19) On 9 July 2003 the Commission informed Portugal that it had decided to initiate the formal investigation procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the proposed State aid.
It expressed doubts about: (a) the company’s eligibility for regional investment aid, in particular as regards the financial strength of Infineon Portugal; (b) whether the application for financial support made by the beneficiary to the Portuguese authorities preceded the implementation of the project and whether the aid had already been disbursed; (c) the calculations provided by Portugal on the nge and the aid intensity; (d) the application of several reduction factors to the maximum aid intensity allowable under the Multisectoral Framework, namely the competition factor (T) and the capital-labour factor (I).
COMMENTS FROM PORTUGAL (23) In its comments on the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Portugal provided evidence to the effect that the aid application had been submitted before work started on the project (letter of April 1999 from the beneficiary to the Portuguese Government requesting financial assistance for the investment).
They also provided clear evidence that the aid had not yet been disbursed (declarations by Infineon Portugal’s auditors, by the Portuguese Investment Agency and by the Finance Ministry). (24) The Portuguese authorities also provided balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for Infineon Portugal for the period between 1998 and 2002. (25) Portugal submitted corrected figures for the total costs and eligible costs of the investment.
The Commission itself acknowledged that these subsidies led to a "dramatic decline" in DRAM prices in the Community in the period from 1998 to 2001 and imposed a countervailing duty of 34,8 % on Korean DRAMs.
For these reasons, Portugal considers that the assessment of market development in value terms does not give a correct picture of the market. (29) The Portuguese authorities also provided information on Infineon’s share of the DRAM market (12,8 % in 2002) and gave an estimated share of 17,1 % for 2003.
They concluded that its market share after completion of the investment project did not exceed 40 %. (30) Concerning the Commission’s request that Portugal justifies the number of jobs safeguarded by the investment, it was claimed that, given its previous scale of production and type of products, the Portuguese plant would not have managed to remain competitive without the investment and would have been forced out of the market (an estimate of the cost of closing down the plant was provided).
Moreover, the increase of 150 % in total output as a result of the investment required extensive retraining to adapt the existing workforce to the new production processes.
The example was given of a company in the DRAM sector which had to shut down its activity in Portugal after failing to invest in sustainable competitiveness. (31) Portugal concluded that the Commission should take into account the 596 jobs that would be safeguarded, corresponding to all existing jobs before the investment took place.
State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty (32) Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty lays down that, save as otherwise provided, aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the common market. (33) The financial measures to be taken by the State, namely a loan of EUR 56414441 and a tax incentive of EUR 20450235, have been notified by Portugal as aid measures.
In 2001 and 2002 profits fell to EUR 15,7 million and EUR 4,4 million respectively.
In 2001, 2002 and 2003 the group made losses of EUR 591 million, EUR 1021 million and EUR 435 million respectively.
The net cash position of Infineon in 2000 was EUR 875 million, falling to EUR 568 million in 2001 and to EUR 177 million in 2002.
In the two last quarters, i.e. 1 June 2003 to 30 September 2003 and 1 October 2003 to 31 December 2003, the company registered profits of EUR 49 million and EUR 34 million respectively. (36) These figures show that, at the time of the investment, Infineon was a profitable company with a sound cash position and adequate equity.
Notification requirement (38) The project cost of EUR 141,5 million exceeds the EUR 50 million threshold laid down in point 2.1(i) of the Multisectoral Framework.
The cumulative aid intensity is 29,4 % of the eligible investment costs, which is over 50 % of the applicable regional aid ceiling of 32 %.
The Commission therefore regarded the aid as notified aid. (40) As regards the incentive effect of the aid, Portugal submitted a letter from Siemens to the Portuguese authorities dated 9 April 1999, which explained in detail the planned investment and requested financial assistance for its implementation.
This letter was sent by Siemens and not by Infineon Portugal since the spin-off of Infineon from Siemens had not yet produced any practical effects in Portugal.
The product concerned (41) According to Portugal, the investment concerns the production of DRAMs (Dynamic Random Access Memory).
Assessment under the Multisectoral Framework (48) The Commission would first note that the aid complies with point 4.2 of the Guidelines on national regional aid [10] as the beneficiary’s contribution to the financing of the investment exceeds 25 % and does not contain any aid. (49) In order to determine the maximum allowable aid intensity for a proposal to grant aid, the Commission must, under the Multisectoral Framework, identify the maximum aid intensity (regional aid ceiling) which a company could obtain in the assisted area concerned within the context of the authorised regional aid system valid at the moment of notification. (50) Vila do Conde is situated in Grande Porto, a region lacking a strong regional economic structure where the maximum aid ceiling is 32 % nge for large enterprises [11]. (51) The Commission must then assess a series of adjustment factors that have to be applied to the figure of 32 % in order to calculate the maximum allowable aid intensity for the project in question, namely the competition factor (T), the capital labour factor (I) and the regional impact factor (M).
Competition factor (T) (52) The Commission notes that the project will create new capacities in the European market and will thus affect this market. (53) The authorisation of aid to companies operating in sectors which are in structural overcapacity poses particular risks for the distortion of competition.
Serious structural overcapacity is deemed to exist when the difference with respect to the average for manufacturing is more than five percentage points. (54) Pursuant to points 3.3 and 3.4 of the Multisectoral Framework, when sufficient data on capacity utilisation are available, the Commission has to limit the determination of the competition factor to the existence or otherwise of structural/serious overcapacity in the sector or subsector concerned.
The (sub)sector should be established at the lowest segmentation of the NACE classification. (55) The lowest NACE code corresponding to the manufacture of DRAMs is 32.10, which comprises all kinds of electronic components.
The Commission therefore considers that analysis of the capacity situation is not applicable in assessing the competition factor. (56) Pursuant to point 3.4 of the Multisectoral Framework, in the absence of sufficient data on capacity utilisation, the Commission will consider whether the investment takes place in a declining market.
A market is deemed to be declining if, over the last five years, the average annual growth rate of apparent consumption of the product in question is more than 10 % below the annual average of the EEA manufacturing industry as a whole, unless there is a strong upward trend in the relative growth rate of demand for the product.
As DRAMs are traded worldwide, the world market is regarded as the relevant geographic market. (58) The Commission would recall that, according to Portugal, Infineon has a 3,5 % share of the semiconductor market and a 12,8 % share of the DRAM market (data for 2002).
Portugal estimated that Infineon had a market share of 17,1 % in 2003.
Thus, the beneficiary’s share of the world market for DRAMs did not exceed 40 %, even after the investment took place. (59) Portugal submitted data on the growth rate of apparent consumption for DRAMs over the last five years, as required by the Multisectoral Framework.
However, since new data are available for 2001 and 2002, they must be used in the present case. (60) Portugal argued that, in order to analyse apparent consumption, the Commission should consider a five year period, e.g. 1998-2002, and not a six year period.
The Commission considers that, according to point 3.3 of the Multisectoral Framework, the reference period for the present case is 1997-2002. (61) The relevant apparent consumption data for DRAMs over the period 1997-2002 are given in the table below [13]. (in EUR million) | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | Average annual growth | 17594 | 12514 | 19431 | 31285 | 12453 | 16179 | – 1,66 % | (62) According to these figures, for the years 1997 to 2002, the average annual growth rate of apparent consumption in the market for DRAMs was – 1,66 %.
In the previous period, i.e.
However, if the period from 1998 to 2002 is considered (as requested by the Portuguese authorities), the rate is positive (6,63 %). (63) The market for DRAMs is highly cyclical and characterised by strong fluctuations.
One investigation that resulted in the imposition of a countervailing duty on DRAM imports from Hynix concluded among other things that these subsidised imports led to a dramatic decline in DRAM prices in the Community in the period from 1998 to 2001, and especially in 2001, when Hynix’s import prices fell by 76 % [14].
Once it had been concluded that the subsidised imports materially harmed the industry in the Community, a countervailing duty of 34,8 %, reflecting the level of subsidies granted to Hynix, was imposed on DRAM imports from that manufacturer. (65) The movements in the average selling prices of DRAMs on the world market during the reference period are given in the following table [15]. (in USD) | | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | | 6,08 | 4,19 | 6,37 | 7,85 | 2,75 | 3,65 | Movement | | – 31,1 % | 52,1 % | 23,3 % | – 65,0 % | 32,5 % | The table shows that DRAM prices on the world market fell by 65 % in 2001 and recovered only partially in 2002.
Accordingly, the Commission takes the view that the transaction values of apparent consumption in 2001 and, to a lesser extent, in 2002 were adversely affected by the abnormally low prices resulting from the subsidised sales by Hynix. (66) For the reasons given above, the Commission examined other information that was available in order to obtain a more reliable and full analysis of the market.
The movements on the world DRAM market during the reference period, as revealed by the statistics, are given in the following tables [15]. (values in millions of units) | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | Average annual growth | 3236 | 3668 | 3636 | 4020 | 4227 | 4247 | 5,59 % | (values in millions of megabytes) | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | Average annual growth | 5289 | 10814 | 19367 | 31919 | 52583 | 73277 | 69,17 % | The above values reveal a consistently positive trend on the DRAM market during the reference period.
It is important to point out that the market growth rate between 2000 and 2001 (5,1 % in terms of units and 64,7 % in terms of megabytes) is comparable to the average annual growth rate observed throughout the period.
As recognised by the Commission and the Council in the two regulations mentioned above (see footnote 11), this price decline was due essentially to subsidised imports from Korea. (67) When analysed together, the three indicators mentioned above (transaction value, volume in units and volume in megabytes) seem to indicate that, during the reference period, the DRAM market grew at a sustained rate, except in 2001, which was characterised by the exceptional market disruption resulting from an abnormal decline in prices. (68) The Commission also requested information on the prospects for the DRAM market.
According to the latest forecasts of the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (see table below), the average annual growth rate of the global market for semiconductors between 2003 and 2005 will be 15,4 %.
The average annual growth rate of the global market for memory products between 2003 and 2005 is expected to be 21,6 %. (in USD million) | | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | Semiconductors | 160711 | 191861 | 216051 | % growth | 14,2 % | 19,4 % | 12,6 % | Memory | 31712 | 40912 | 48522 | % growth | 17,3 % | 29,0 % | 18,6 % | (69) Information from an independent source (Gartner Dataquest) also confirms that the prospects for the DRAM market are very positive. (in USD million, millions of units and millions of megabytes respectively) | | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | Transaction value | 18095 | 26647 | 36000 | % growth | 16,9 % | 47,3 % | 35,1 % | Unit shipments | 4810 | 5584 | 5855 | % growth | 13,3 % | 16,1 % | 4,9 % | Megabytes | 112426 | 170036 | 262690 | % growth | 53,4 % | 51,2 % | 54,5 % | (70) A restrictive analysis of the information in terms of transaction values given above indicated that the DRAM market was in absolute decline during the relevant period.
Consequently, the Commission takes the view that, in the present case, market developments are better reflected by the data in terms of unit shipments and concludes that 5,59 % is a cautious and reasonable estimation of the average growth rate of the DRAM market during the reference period. (71) As mentioned above, in accordance with the Multisectoral Framework, a market is considered to be in decline if, during the reference period, the average annual growth rate of apparent consumption of the product in question is more than 10 % lower than the annual average for EEA manufacturing industry as a whole.
The Commission would remind the Portuguese authorities that, if the information on the basis of which the conclusions were reached proved to be incorrect as provided for in Article 9 of the Procedural Regulation [16] or if, as a result of the proceedings referred to above, it was subsequently concluded that the effect of the alleged infringements of the competition rules was not negligible, the Commission fully reserves the right to reassess the market situation on the basis of a new analysis and, if necessary, to repeal this decision.
This criterion also takes into account the possible distorting effect of the aid on the price of the final product. (74) According to Portugal, the project led to the creation of 264 direct jobs distributed as follows.
It thus considered that the net direct job creation directly linked to the project was 252. (76) The Commission considers that the 252 direct jobs created as a result of the investment can be taken into account as this is a reasonable figure for a capacity increase of 150 %. (77) Portugal moreover stated that all the existing jobs at Infineon Portugal (596 jobs) were safeguarded thanks to the investment.
According to Portugal, the Infineon group has located its back-end operations in Portugal and Malaysia.
Infineon immediately took on 100 of those workers.
Only the new higher-capacity chips are currently being produced. (78) The Commission concludes that there was, in fact, a significant probability that the Portuguese operations would have been shut down had the investment not taken place. (79) Accordingly, the Commission considers that the new investment has safeguarded 596 existing jobs and created 252 new jobs, giving a total of 848 jobs.
The capital labour factor for an eligible investment of EUR 141036103 that results in the creation and safeguarding of 848 jobs corresponds to a ratio of EUR 166316 per job.
The "I" factor for adjustment of the maximum intensity is, therefore, set at 1.
Regional impact factor (M) (80) The regional impact factor takes into account the beneficial effects of a new aided investment on the economy of the assisted region.
Job creation in this context refers to jobs created directly by the project together with jobs created by first-tier suppliers and customers in response to the aided investment. (81) According to Portugal, the project has led to the creation of 30 indirect jobs in the region.
Therefore, the Commission sets the regional impact factor (M) at 1.
Maximum allowable aid (82) In view of the foregoing, the maximum allowable aid intensity is calculated as follows: 32 % × 1 × 1 × 1 = 32 % net.
The proposed aid of EUR 41504299, equivalent to an aid intensity of 29,4 % net, that Portugal intends to grant to Infineon Portugal for its investment at Vila do Conde is thus below the maximum allowable aid intensity, calculated on the basis of the Multisectoral Framework.
Implementation of the aid of EUR 41504299 in net grant equivalent is, therefore, authorised on the basis of the facts currently available.
Article 2 This Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic.
Done at Brussels, 16 March 2004.
