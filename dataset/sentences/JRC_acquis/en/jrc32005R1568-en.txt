Furthermore, deep-water coral reefs have recently been included in a list of endangered habitats in the framework of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic ("OSPAR Convention").

(5) According to scientific evidence, recovery from damage to these habitats produced by fishing gear is either impossible or very difficult and slow.
