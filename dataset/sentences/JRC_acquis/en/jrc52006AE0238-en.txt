At its 424th plenary session, held on 14 and 15 February 2006 (meeting of 14 February) the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 88 votes to 13 with 11 abstentions. 1.
Quota arrangements, which, in some countries, have proven to be effective both in politics and in social organisations, should be explored thoroughly with regard to their effectiveness and success by the organisations concerned and the Commission. 1.8 The Committee would be pleased to see a target of 30 % for the under-represented sex in the nominations to the EESC made by Member States (proposed by the economic and social interest groups) for the 2006-2010 EESC mandate, with the view to raising this target to 40 % for the following mandate. 1.9 The EESC will revisit the findings of the present survey in 2006/2007 after the renewal of its four-yearly mandate.
Comments 2.1 Background 2.1.1 In January 2003, the European Parliament requested the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) to give an opinion on the representation of women in the decision-making bodies of the %quot%social partners%quot% [1].
Brussels, 14 February 2006.
The President of the European Economic and Social Committee Anne-Marie Sigmund [1] In subsequent contacts, the concept of %quot%social partners%quot% was clarified as to include not only employers' organisations and trade unions, but also other social and economic interest groups as represented in the EESC. [2] See %quot%Report on balanced decision-making in the EESC%quot% (J.
Woodward), VUB Bruxelles/Leiden University, September 2004, available (in English only) on the webpage of the EESC's Section for Employment, Social Affairs and Citizenship: http://www.esc.eu.int/sections/soc/docs/balanced_decisionmaking_eesc.pdf. [3] When two or more persons representing the same organisation completed the questionnaire, these responses have been treated as one. [4] After enlargement (in May 2004) this percentage has gone up slightly to 26 %. [5] Though on two occasions in 2002, UNICE provided Parliament with more data than were finally included in this document. [6] E.g., between the early 1990s and the early 2000s, the share of female participants in ETUC Congresses rose from 10/12 % to 30 %, in the Executive Board it is now 25 %, in the Steering Committee 32 %.
