That possibility is not available for the additional payments referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
To facilitate correct administration of the payment of those amounts Member States should be allowed to pay a maximum advance on the additional payments. (5) Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 lays down the rule applicable to conversion into national currency of the amounts of premiums and of the extensification payment.
Pursuant to that Article, that number is equivalent to the number of dairy cows needed to produce the individual milk reference quantity allocated to the producer on 31 March preceding the beginning of the 12-month period of application of the additional levy scheme beginning in the calendar year concerned.
In that case, special measures should be laid down, in accordance with Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, to simplify the administration of that scheme and its application by such producers.
However: - Article 1(1) and (2) shall apply from 1 January 2000.
