On 29 January 2002, the DSB adopted the panel and appellate body reports which established that the above Act also constituted a prohibited export subsidy under the WTO and that it did not amount to withdrawal of the FSC subsidy.
Consequently, on 7 May 2003, the Community was authorised by the DSB to impose countermeasures up to a level of USD 4043 million in the form of additional 100 % ad valorem duties on certain products originating in the United States of America. (3) It is considered that, initially, the imposition in stages of additional import duties of up to a 17 % ad valorem on imports of selected products originating in the United States of America is an appropriate countermeasure, in view of the failure of the United States of America to implement the DSB recommendations.
An ad valorem duty additional to the customs duty applicable under Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 shall be imposed on the products originating in the United States of America listed in the Annex to this Regulation, as follows: - 5 % from 1 March 2004 to 31 March 2004, - 6 % from 1 April 2004 to 30 April 2004, - 7 % from 1 May 2004 to 31 May 2004, - 8 % from 1 June 2004 to 30 June 2004, - 9 % from 1 July 2004 to 31 July 2004, - 10 % from 1 August 2004 to 31 August 2004, - 11 % from 1 September 2004 to 30 September 2004, - 12 % from 1 October 2004 to 31 October 2004, - 13 % from 1 November 2004 to 30 November 2004, - 14 % from 1 December 2004 to 31 December 2004, - 15 % from 1 January 2005 to 31 January 2005, - 16 % from 1 February 2005 to 28 February 2005, - 17 % from 1 March 2005. 2.
After 1 March 2005, the Commission shall present a proposal to the Council for the revision of the Regulation in the light of developments. 3.
Article 3 The Council shall decide on the repeal of this Regulation once the United States of America have fully implemented the recommendation of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.
Article 5 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
