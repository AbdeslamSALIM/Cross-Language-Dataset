It can therefore be presumed that in general, vertical agreements have such advantages where the supplier concerned has a market share of up to 30 % on the markets for the distribution of new motor vehicles or spare parts, or of up to 40 % where quantitative selective distribution is used for the sale of new motor vehicles.
As regards after sales services it can be presumed that, in general, vertical agreements by which the supplier sets criteria on how its authorised repairers have to provide repair or maintenance services for the motor vehicles of the relevant make and provides them with equipment and training for the provision of such services have such advantages where the network of authorised repairers of the supplier concerned has a market share of up to 30 %.
In order to allow all operators time to adapt vertical agreements which are compatible with that regulation and which are still in force when the exemption provided for therein expires, it is appropriate for such agreements to benefit from a transition period until 1 October 2003, during which time they should be exempted from the prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) under this Regulation. (37) In order to allow all operators within a quantitative selective distribution system for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles to adapt their business strategies to the non-application of the exemption to location clauses, it is appropriate to stipulate that the condition set out in Article 5(2)(b) shall enter into force on 1 October 2005. (38) The Commission should monitor the operation of this Regulation on a regular basis, with particular regard to its effects on competition in motor vehicle retailing and in after sales servicing in the common market or relevant parts of it.
Article 2 Scope 1.
However, it shall apply where competing undertakings enter into a non-reciprocal vertical agreement and: (a) the buyer has a total annual turnover not exceeding EUR 100 million, or (b) the supplier is a manufacturer and a distributor of goods, while the buyer is a distributor not manufacturing goods competing with the contract goods, or (c) the supplier is a provider of services at several levels of trade, while the buyer does not provide competing services at the level of trade where it purchases the contract services.
Article 3 General conditions 1.
Subject to paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, the exemption shall apply on condition that the supplier's market share on the relevant market on which it sells the new motor vehicles, spare parts for motor vehicles or repair and maintenance services does not exceed 30 %.
However, the market share threshold for the application of the exemption shall be 40 % for agreements establishing quantitative selective distribution systems for the sale of new motor vehicles.
In the case of vertical agreements containing exclusive supply obligations, the exemption shall apply on condition that the market share held by the buyer does not exceed 30 % of the relevant market on which it purchases the contract goods or services. 3.
Article 4 Hardcore restrictions (Hardcore restrictions concerning the sale of new motor vehicles, repair and maintenance services or spare parts) 1.
Article 5 Specific conditions 1.
Article 7 Non-application of the Regulation 1.
Pursuant to Article 1a of Regulation No 19/65/EEC, the Commission may by regulation declare that, where parallel networks of similar vertical restraints cover more than 50 % of a relevant market, this Regulation shall not apply to vertical agreements containing specific restraints relating to that market. 2.
Article 8 Market share calculation 1.
For the purposes of applying the market share thresholds of 30 % and 40 % provided for in this Regulation the following rules shall apply: (a) the market share shall be calculated on the basis of data relating to the preceding calendar year; (b) the market share shall include any goods or services supplied to integrated distributors for the purposes of sale; (c) if the market share is initially not more than 30 % or 40 % respectively but subsequently rises above that level without exceeding 35 % or 45 % respectively, the exemption shall continue to apply for a period of two consecutive calendar years following the year in which the market share threshold of 30 % or 40 % respectively was first exceeded; (d) if the market share is initially not more than 30 % or 40 % respectively but subsequently rises above 35 % or 45 % respectively, the exemption shall continue to apply for one calendar year following the year in which the level of 30 % or 40 % respectively was first exceeded; (e) the benefit of points (c) and (d) may not be combined so as to exceed a period of two calendar years.
Article 9 Turnover calculation 1.
The exemption shall remain applicable where, for any period of two consecutive financial years, the total annual turnover threshold is exceeded by no more than 10 %.
Article 10 Transitional period The prohibition laid down in Article 81(1) shall not apply during the period from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003 in respect of agreements already in force on 30 September 2002 which do not satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in this Regulation but which satisfy the conditions for exemption provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1475/95.
