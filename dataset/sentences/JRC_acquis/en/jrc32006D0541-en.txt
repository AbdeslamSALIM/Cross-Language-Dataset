General provisions The NGO shall launch an international open invitation to tender for supply contracts with a value of EUR 150000 or more.
In the case of an international open invitation to tender, the NGO shall publish a tender notice in all appropriate media, in particular on the NGOâ€™s web site, in the international press and the national press of the country in which the Action is being carried out, or in other specialist periodicals.
Supply contracts for a value of EUR 30000 or more but less than EUR 150000 shall be awarded by means of an open tender procedure published locally.
In the case of a local open tender procedure, the tender notice shall be published in all appropriate media but only in the country in which the Action is being carried out.
Supply contracts with a value of less than EUR 30000 must be awarded by means of a competitive negotiated procedure without publication, in which the NGO consults at least three suppliers of its choice and negotiates the terms of the contract with one or more of them.
Supply contracts with a value of less than EUR 5000 may be awarded by a negotiated procedure on the basis of a single tender.
Where the NGO uses a central buying office as service provider in conformity with Article 8.4 of Annex IV %quot%Procurement by grant Beneficiaries in the context of European Community external actions%quot%, it selects it in conformity with the procedures for service contracts set out in Article 4.1 and 4.2 thereof.
The guarantee shall represent minimum 1 % of the total amount of the bid, and the period of validity shall be at least one month.
The guarantee shall be released: - by a letter or a fax by the NGO where the tender has not been accepted or has been rejected, or where no contract has been awarded, - where the tenderer, designated as the supplier, has lodged the delivery guarantee.
The guarantee shall be forfeited if the supplier fails to provide the delivery guarantee within a reasonable deadline following the award of the contract and also if the tenderer withdraws his tender after it has been received.
That guarantee, expressed in the currency of the payment, shall represent 5 to 10 % of the total amount of the tender.
The delivery guarantee shall be released in full by a letter or a fax by the NGO when the supplier: - has carried out the supply in compliance with all his obligations, or - has been released from his obligations, or - has not carried out the supply for reasons of force majeure recognised by the NGO. 7.
When 50 % of the total quantity lay down in the tender notice has been delivered, the supplier may present a request for advance payment accompanied by an invoice for the sum claimed and a copy of the provisional certificate of conformity.
Where duly justified and accepted by the Commission, costs incurred in a force majeure situation may be considered as eligible direct costs and be recovered only within the limits foreseen for contingencies in the budget of the action.%quot% [1] OJ L 344, 27.12.2005, p. 1.
