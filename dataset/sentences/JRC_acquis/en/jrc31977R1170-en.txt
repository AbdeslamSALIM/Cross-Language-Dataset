Member States may grant aid to recognized producer groups for three years following the date of their recognition as laid down in Article 7 (3), to encourage their formation and to facilitate their operation.
The aid must not, however, exceed during the first year 60 %, during the second year 40 % and during the third year 20 % of the administrative costs of the producer group.
Where the report referred to in Article 11 shows that there is a risk of creating structural surpluses or a disturbance in the supply structure of the Community hop market: (a) the granting of aid may be limited to part of the area under hops registered for the year in question; (b) those areas under hops which are in their first and/or second year of production may be declared ineligible for aid.
They shall remain applicable until 31 December 1980 at the latest.
