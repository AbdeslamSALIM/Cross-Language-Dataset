Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on an EU Forest Action Plan {SEC(2006) 748} /* COM/2006/0302 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 15.6.2006 COM(2006) 302 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on an EU Forest Action Plan {SEC(2006) 748} COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT on an EU Forest Action Plan INTRODUCTION This Communication responds to the request of the Council[1] to the Commission to present an EU Forest Action Plan in 2006.
It also points out additional actions which can be carried out by the Member States according to their specific conditions and priorities, with support from existing Community instruments, although implementation may also require national instruments.
Key action 2 : Encourage research and technological development to enhance the competitiveness of the forest sector Research and technological development are crucial for the sustainable development of the EU forest sector.
As a first step, in 2007 the Commission will organise a workshop to discuss Community actions in this area.
Key action 3 : Exchange and assess experiences on the valuation and marketing of non-wood forest goods and services Forests fulfil numerous functions which are not reflected in the prices of marketed wood and non-wood goods.
Key action 4 : Promote the use of forest biomass for energy generation Using wood as an energy source can help to mitigate climate change by substituting fossil fuel, improving energy self-sufficiency, enhancing security of supply and providing job opportunities in rural areas.
The Standing Forestry Committee will support the implementation of the Biomass Action Plan[8], in particular concerning the development of markets for pellets and chips and information to forest owners about the opportunities of energy feedstock production.
The Member States will assess the availability of wood and wood residues and the feasibility of using them for energy production at national and regional levels, in order to consider further actions in support of the use of wood for energy generation.
Key action 5 : Foster the cooperation between forest owners and enhance education and training in forestry Due to changing ownership structures and the increasing share of non-farmers owning forests, a growing number of owners lack skills and capacities for sustainable forest management.
The EARDF, together with Community instruments for education and training, provide opportunities to support these activities.
In order to strengthen the competitiveness and economic viability of forestry, and in the framework of their priorities, the Member States may also: - encourage cooperation between forest owners, industry and third parties in the development of new products, processes, technologies and efficient markets; - encourage investments to enhance the economic value of forests; - support establishment and development of forest-owner associations.
Key action 6 : Facilitate EU compliance with the obligations on climate change mitigation of the UNFCCC[10] and its Kyoto Protocol and encourage adaptation to the effects of climate change Forests act as carbon sinks and can produce renewable and environmentally friendly raw materials and energy feedstock.
Key action 7 : Contribute towards achieving the revised Community biodiversity objectives for 2010 and beyond[14] As much of the EU biodiversity is impoverished and still declining, accelerated action at Community and Member State level is required to restore habitats and natural ecosystems, if the objective to halt biodiversity loss is to be met.
The Commission will propose to the Standing Forestry Committee to: - exchange experiences on implementation of Natura 2000 in forest areas; - consider forest biodiversity monitoring as a pilot exercise in the framework of the current work on EU biodiversity indicators[15]; - consider monitoring of the fragmentation of forests and of the effects of forest expansion on biodiversity; - evaluate existing information and scientific studies on the necessary area coverage of and modalities for protection of forests undisturbed by man; - follow the implementation of CBD[16] and other decisions regarding forest biodiversity.
Key action 8 : Work towards a European Forest Monitoring System The Forest Focus[17] monitoring scheme expires in 2006.
Key action 9 : Enhance the protection of EU forests Forest fires, biotic agents and atmospheric pollution have a sizeable influence on the ecological condition and productive capacity of forests in the EU.
In addition, with support from the EARDF and the Life+ instrument, the Member States may: - develop national afforestation guidelines and promote afforestation for environmental and protective objectives; - promote agroforestry systems; - promote Natura 2000-forest measures; - promote schemes for forest owners to engage in voluntary environmental commitments; - promote investments which enhance the ecological value of forests; - support forest fire prevention measures; - support restoration of forests damaged by natural disasters and fire; - support studies on the causes of forest fires, awareness raising campaigns, training and demonstration projects; - review and update broader protection strategies against biotic and abiotic agents, including studies on risk assessment in relation to harmful organisms and invasive species.
Key action 10 : Encourage environmental education and information Awareness raising is necessary to ensure that the benefits of sustainable forest management are adequately acknowledged by society.
Key action 11 : Maintain and enhance the protective functions of forests The increasing threat of natural disasters, extreme weather events as well as erosion and desertification problems in parts of Europe highlight the importance of the protective function of forests, particularly in mountain and Mediterranean areas.
Key action 12 : Explore the potential of urban and peri-urban forests For many Europeans urban forests are the main contact with nature’s benefits and values.
Key action 13 : Strengthen the role of the Standing Forestry Committee The Council Decision setting up the Standing Forestry Committee[24] provides the Committee with a broad mandate on aspects related to exchanges of information and consultation.
Key action 14 : Strengthen coordination between policy areas in forest-related matters In order to enhance efficient exchange of information on initiatives that may have impacts on the forest sector, each relevant Directorate-General will appoint a co-ordinator for forest-related policies.
Key action 15 : Apply the open method of coordination (OMC) to national forest programmes The Lisbon European Council defined the OMC as a method to help Member States to progressively develop their own policies.
Key action 16 : Strengthen the EU profile in international forest-related processes A high degree of coordination is necessary both within the Commission and in the Member States to ensure coherence in different forest-related international processes.
Relevant Council Working Parties, especially that on Forestry, have a key role to play in this regard.
Although the Commission will no longer have a specific financing instrument for forests after 2006, there will be opportunities for financial support from 2007 on from the Environment and Natural Resources Thematic Programme, as well as in country or regional programmes.
The FLEGT Action Plan[29] will be another priority objective for support from the Commission and Member States , in particular for capacity building in FLEGT partner countries.
Key action 18 : Improve information exchange and communication Availability and communication of up-to-date information are essential for enhancing public awareness and consideration of forestry in policy-making.
A report on implementation of the Action Plan will be presented to the Council and the European Parliament in 2012.
It will also be actively involved in the mid-term and final evaluations. [1] Council Conclusions on an EU Forest Action Plan, 2662nd meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council, 30–31 May 2005.
