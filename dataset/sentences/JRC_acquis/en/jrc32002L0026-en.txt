ANNEX I METHODS OF SAMPLING FOR OFFICIAL CONTROL OF THE LEVELS OF OCHRATOXIN A IN CERTAIN FOODSTUFFS 1.
General provisions 3.1.
Specific provisions 4.1.
Without prejudice to the specific provisions as laid down in points 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 of this Annex, the following formula can be used as a guide for the sampling of lots traded in individual packings (sacks, bags, retail packings, etc.): %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002075EN.004001.TIF%quot%%gt% - Weight: in kg - Sampling Frequency (SF): every nth sack or bag from which an incremental sample must be taken (decimal figures should be rounded to the nearest whole number). 4.2.
Weight of the aggregate sample The weight of the incremental sample should be about 100 grams, unless otherwise defined in this Annex.
In the case of lots of cereals under 50 tonnes and lots of dried vine fruit under 15 tonnes, see point 4.5.
Weight of the aggregate sample = 10 kg. - If it is not possible to carry out the method of sampling described above because of the commercial consequences resulting from damage to the lot (because of packaging forms, means of transport, etc.) an alternative method of sampling may be applied provided that it is as representative as possible and is fully described and documented. 4.5.
Sampling provisions for cereals and cereal products (lots %amp%lt; 50 tonnes) and for dried vine fruit (lots %amp%lt; 15 tonnes) For cereal lots under 50 tonnes and for dried vine fruit lots under 15 tonnes, the sampling plan has to be used with 10 to 100 incremental samples, depending on the lot weight, resulting in an aggregate sample of 1 to 10 kg.
General requirements Methods of analysis used for food control purposes must comply with the provisions of items 1 and 2 of the Annex to Directive 85/591/EEC concerning the introduction of Community methods of sampling and analysis for the monitoring of foodstuffs intended for human consumption. 4.3.
Specific requirements Where no specific methods for the determination of ochratoxin A levels in foodstuffs are prescribed at Community level, laboratories may select any method provided the selected method meets the following criteria: Performance characteristics for ochratoxin A %gt%TABLE%gt% - The detection limits of the methods used are not stated as the precision values are given at the concentrations of interest. - The precision values are calculated from the Horwitz equation: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% where: - RSDR is the relative standard deviation calculated from results generated under reproducibility conditions %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt%, - C is the concentration ratio (i.e. 1 = 100 g/100 g, 0,001 = 1,000 mg/kg).
