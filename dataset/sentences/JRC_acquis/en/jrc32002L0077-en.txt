The wording of certain provisions should, where possible, be clarified in order to facilitate their application, taking into account, where appropriate, the relevant Directives adopted under Article 95 of the Treaty, and the experience acquired through the implementation of Directive 90/388/EEC as amended. (7) This Directive makes reference to %quot%electronic communications services%quot% and %quot%electronic communications networks%quot% rather than the previously used terms %quot%telecommunications services%quot% and %quot%telecommunications networks%quot%.
Least market distortion means that contributions should be recovered in a way that as far as possible minimises the impact of the financial burden falling on end-users, for example by spreading contributions as widely as possible. (13) Where rights and obligations arising from international conventions setting up international satellite organisations are not compatible with the competition rules of the Treaty, Member States should take, in accordance with Article 307 of the EC Treaty, all appropriate steps to eliminate such incompatibilities.
This Directive should clarify this obligation because Article 3 of Directive 94/46/EC(11), merely required Member States to %quot%communicate to the Commission%quot% the information they possessed on such incompatibilities.
Article 2 Exclusive and special rights for electronic communications networks and electronic communications services 1.
Article 5 Directory services Member States shall ensure that all exclusive and/or special rights with regard to the establishment and provision of directory services on their territory, including both the publication of directories and directory enquiry services, are abolished.
Article 6 Universal service obligations 1.
Article 8 Cable television networks 1.
The Commission shall review the application of this Article not later than 31 December 2004.
Article 10 Repeal Directive 90/388/EC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex I, Part A, is repealed with effect from 25 July 2003, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States in respect of the time limits for transposition laid down in Annex I, Part B.
Article 11 This Directive shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 12 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
