REQUEST (1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, originating, inter alia, in the People’s Republic of China. (2) The request was lodged on 23 June 2005 by the Defence Committee of the Steel Butt-Welding Fittings Industry of the European Union on behalf of four Community producers.
PRODUCT (3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, normally declared under CN codes ex73079311, ex73079319, ex73079930 and ex73079990 originating in the People’s Republic of China (the product concerned).
Should circumvention practices via the Philippines covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation other than transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
TIME LIMITS (16) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which: - interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation, - producers in the Philippines may request exemption from registration of imports or measures, - interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission. (17) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
NON-COOPERATION (18) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. (19) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of facts available.
Article 2 The customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.
