Previous investigations and existing measures (1) Following an investigation (the previous investigation), the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 969/2000 [2], amended the measures originally imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 3068/92 [3] on imports of potassium chloride originating, inter alia, in Russia (the existing measures). (2) In March 2004, by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union [4], the Commission launched, on its own initiative, a partial interim review of the existing measures to examine whether they should be amended to take account of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States on 1 May 2004 (Enlargement). (3) The results of that partial interim review showed that it was in the interests of the Community to provide for the temporary adaptation of the existing measures so as to avoid a sudden and excessively negative impact on importers and users in the ten new Member States immediately following Enlargement. (4) To this end, in May 2004, by Regulation (EC) No 1002/2004 [5], the Commission accepted undertakings from two exporting producers in Russia, namely JSC Silvinit and JSC Uralkali for a period of one year.
In June 2005, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 858/2005 [6] new undertakings, which expire on 13 April 2006, were accepted from the two exporting producers in Russia.
Period of investigation (9) The investigation was limited to dumping and covered the period from 1 April 2003 until 30 March 2004 (the investigation period or IP). 4.
The product is generally classified into three basic categories, based on the K2O content, namely: - potassium content not exceeding 40 % K2O — falling within Combined Nomenclature (CN) code 31042010, - potassium content exceeding 40 % K2O but less than or equal to 62 % — falling within CN code 31042050, - potassium content over 62 % K2O — falling within CN code 31042090. (14) It should be recalled that in the previous investigation it was found that imports of certain special mixtures or blends with an unusually high content of potash which do not fall under any of the CN codes for potash indicated above, should also be considered as the product concerned.
Accordingly, such mixtures or blends falling within CN codes ex31052010, ex31052090, ex31056090, ex31059091 and ex31059099 were also included in the present investigation and constitute part of the product concerned. 2.
DUMPING WITH REGARD TO THE APPLICANTS 1.
In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered to be representative when each of the applicants’ domestic sales volumes of the like product constituted at least 5 % of their respective total export sales volumes to the Community during the investigation period.
Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable product type exported to the Community. (18) As a result of this analysis, it was found that one exporting producer, JSC Silvinit, had only sold one exported product type in representative quantities on the domestic market.
For the other exporting producer, JSC Uralkali, it was found that all exported product types had been sold in representative quantities on the domestic market. (19) An examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each product type could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the type in question. (20) In this regard, it was found for JSC Uralkali that its domestic sales prices for the best sold product type exported to the Community (the best sold export type) accounting for over 99 % of such exports, showed unusual trends during the investigation period.
It was established that, during the investigation period, 77 % of domestic sales of the best sold exported type had been made to one customer in Russia and that the sales price to this particular customer had, in the space of one month in the middle of the investigation period, more than doubled.
Price rises for the same product type sold to other domestic customers also rose at the same time, but only by a margin of around 40 %.
Examination of price rises for other potash types sold domestically showed similar price increases of around 40 % during the investigation period. (21) In view of this particular market situation with regard to pricing for a key product type used to calculate the dumping margin, pursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation it is considered that such sales do not permit a proper comparison.
Given the significance of such sales in the domestic sales volumes of the type in question, and the importance of this type in the overall export volume of potash exported by the company concerned to the Community, it is considered reasonable to disregard these specific sales to the customer in question.
The remaining domestic sales of this product type to other customers were found to be below the 5 % threshold considered necessary for them to be regarded as representative.
Secondly, Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation provides that normal value may be constructed in situations where "… because of a particular market situation such sales do not permit a proper comparison …".
This conclusion does not relate to the Russian market as a whole but rather to these sales of Uralkali. (24) As concerns JSC Silvinit, where the sales volume of one product type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the unit cost, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the adjusted unit cost, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that product type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. (25) For the other product type of JSC Silvinit, which was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic prices to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value, another method had to be applied.
However, this claim could not be accepted since in accordance with the chapeau of Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation the actual profit amounts realised by the company in the domestic market should be used for the construction of the normal value. (27) As concerns energy costs, such as electricity and gas used in the mining and production processes of the product concerned, the investigation established that these costs form a significant proportion of the total cost of manufacturing of potash producers, not only in Russia but in other producing countries as well.
The comparison showed that the cost per unit for electricity paid by the Canadian producer was not too dissimilar to that paid by the Russian producers. (30) As concerns gas supplies, it was established on the basis of data found in the published annual report for 2003 of the Russian gas provider OAO Gazprom (whose regional distributor was also the supplier to the exporting producers in question), that the domestic price of gas paid by the two Russian Producers was around one fifth of the export price from Russia.
Export price JSC Silvinit (Silvinit) (41) With regard to Silvinit, it was found that most of the company’s sales of potash to the Community in the investigation period were made via an unrelated Swiss trading company.
For the purposes of the present investigation and pursuant to Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, the prices, actually paid or payable to Silvinit by this trading company, were taken as the basis for calculating the export price. (42) However, it was found that two transactions were made via Silvinit’s related Russian trading company, International Potash Company (IPC), to a related company in Belgium called Ferchimex AS (Ferchimex), which processed the imported potash into a product not covered by the investigation.
JSC Uralkali (Uralkali) (43) As concerns Uralkali, it was found that all of the company’s sales of potash to the Community in the investigation period were made directly to a trader situated in Cyprus called Fertexim Ltd which acted as an exclusive distributor for Uralkali.
As a weighted average of all types exported to the Community, expressed as percentages of the total CIF Community frontier price, duty unpaid, the dumping margins established were as follows: Exporting producer | % Dumping margin | JSC Silvinit | 23,0 | JSC Uralkali | 12,3 | D.
In this regard, it was found that the change in the dumping margins resulted from a lowering of the normal values of the applicants. (49) In this regard, it should be noted that in the present investigation, normal value was established on the basis of the applicants’ costs and prices.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of potassium chloride falling within CN codes 31042010, 31042050, 31042090, and on special mixtures falling within CN codes ex31052010 (TARIC codes 3105201010 and 3105201020), ex31052090 (TARIC codes 3105209010 and 3105209020), ex31056090 (TARIC codes 3105609010 and 3105609020), ex31059091 (TARIC codes 3105909110 and 3105909120), ex31059099 (TARIC codes 3105909910 and 31059920), originating in Belarus or Russia."; (b) in paragraph 3, the heading for the table relating to "Russia" shall be replaced by the following: "Russia (all companies excluding JSC Silvinit and JSC Uralkali — TARIC additional code A999)"; (c) the following paragraph shall be inserted: "3a.
For the imports of the exporting producers mentioned below, the rate of the anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, for the products described in paragraph 1 shall be as follows: Company | Rate of duty | TARIC additional code | JSC Silvinit, Solikamsk, Russia | 23,0 % | A665 | JSC Uralkali, Berezniki, Russia | 12,3 % | A666" | 2.
