These maximum residue limits were subsequently extended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1322/2001(3) to allow the applicant further time for completion of the requested studies. (8) The requested data on the marker residue and the analytical method was evaluated by the CVMP and found to be not completely in accordance with the requirements laid down in Volume 8 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union.
The CVMP subsequently proposed to insert morantel in Annex II of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, with the motivation that residues of morantel depleted rapidly and therefore the establishment of maximum residue limits was not necessary for the protection of public health. (9) As residues of morantel in foodstuff from treated animals may supersede the acceptable daily intake 24 hours after administration, it is considered necessary, for reasons of consumer safety and to allow adequate withdrawal periods to be established for veterinary medicinal products containing morantel, to establish maximum residues limits, taking account of the maximum residue limits previously established. (10) Morantel is a pharmacologically active anthelmintic substance which has been in use in veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animal species for a considerable time for treatment against roundworms and tapeworms.
