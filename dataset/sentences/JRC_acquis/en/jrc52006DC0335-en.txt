The United States authorities postponed the entry into force of the new provisions but, ultimately, refused to waive the right to impose penalties on airlines failing to comply with the legislation on electronic access to PNR data after 5 March 2003.
In particular, the Parliament considered that the draft decision on adequacy exceeded the powers conferred on the Commission by Article 25 of the Directive.
On 14 May 2004 the Commission adopted the Decision on Adequacy 2004/535/CE pursuant to Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC (OJ 2004, L 235, p.11).
On 17 May 2004 the Council adopted Decision 2004/496/EC on the basis of Article 95 EC Treaty (OJ 2004, L 183, p.83), authorising the President of the council to sign the Agreement on behalf of the Community.
The Agreement was signed on 28 May 2004 and entered into force on the same day.
The Court stated that there is no competence for the Commission to take the Decision, since the transfer of PNR data to CBP constitutes processing operations concerning public security and activities of the State in areas of criminal law, which pursuant to Article 3 of Directive 95/46/EC fall outside its scope and, therefore, cannot be based on Article 95 of the EC Treaty.
Hence, according to the Court, the Agreement could not be based on Article 95 EC for the same reason.
Article 233 of the EC Treaty states that the institution or institutions whose act has been declared void shall be required to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice.
Since this is an action in compliance with a Court annulment under Article 233 and the EC Treaty furthermore does not provide for specific rules for the termination of international agreements, it would seem to be sufficient if the two institutions together address a letter or note verbale to the US authorities notifying them of the denunciation.
This should mention the date of 30 September 2006 as the effective date of the denunciation so as to coincide with the date referred to by the Court.
ANNEX DRAFT The Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the European Commission present their compliments to â€¦.
