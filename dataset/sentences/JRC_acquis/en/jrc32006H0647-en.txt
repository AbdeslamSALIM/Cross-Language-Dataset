Moreover, in order to ensure a broad protection, dermatologists recommend a critical wavelength of at least 370 nm. (16) In order to ensure reproducibility and comparability of the recommended minimum protection against UVB radiation, the International Sun Protection Factor Test Method (2006) as updated in 2006 by the European, Japanese, American and South African industry should be used.
In order to assess the minimum protection against UVA radiation, the persistent-pigment darkening method as applied by the Japanese industry and modified by the French health agency Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé — Afssaps as well as the critical wavelength test should be used.
Moreover, the increase in protection is only linear in the case of sunburn, that is to say, a product with sun protection factor 30 protects twice as well from sunburn as product with a sun protection factor of 15.
However, a product with sun protection factor 15 absorbs 93 % of UVB radiation, and a product with sun protection factor 30 absorbs 97 % of UVB radiation.
Finally, sun protection factors above 50 do not substantially increase the protection from UV radiation.
The following range of sun protection factors for each category and the respective labelling is recommended: Labelled category | Labelled sun protection factor | Measured sun protection factor (measured in accordance with the principles recommended in point 10 (a)) | Recommended minimum UVA protection factor (measured in accordance with principles recommended in point 10 (b)) | Recommended minimum critical wavelength (measured in accordance with principles recommended in point 10 (c)) | "Low protection" | "6" | 6-9,9 | 1/3 of labelled sun protection factor | 370 nm | "10" | 10-14,9 | "Medium protection" | "15" | 15-19,9 | "20" | 20-24,9 | "25" | 25-29,9 | "High protection" | "30" | 30-49,9 | "50" | 50-59,9 | "Very high protection" | "50 +" | 60 ≤ | 15.
The category of sunscreen products should be indicated on the label at least as prominently as the sun protection factor.
