Commission Regulation (EC) No 1350/2006 of 13 September 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain tungsten electrodes originating in the People's Republic of China Commission Regulation (EC) No 1350/2006 of 13 September 2006 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain tungsten electrodes originating in the People's Republic of China THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8, 9, 11(2) and 11(3) thereof, Whereas: A.
Investigation period (11) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 January to 31 December 2005 (investigation period or IP).
Normal value (a) Determination of normal value for the exporting producer in the PRC granted MET (26) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, the Commission first established, for the exporting producer concerned, whether its total domestic sales of TE were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community.
In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative when the total domestic sales volume of the exporting producer was at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community. (27) Given that the overall domestic sales of the exporting producer concerned were found to be representative, the Commission subsequently identified the types of TE sold domestically which were identical or directly comparable to the types sold for export to the Community. (28) For each of those types, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
This was done by establishing for each product type the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers on the domestic market during the investigation period. (41) Where the sales volume of a product type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type, and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price.
This price was calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales of that type made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. (42) Where the volume of profitable sales of a product type represented 80 % or less of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type. (43) Where the volume of profitable sales of any product type represented less than 10 % of the total sales volume of that type, it was considered that this particular type was sold in insufficient quantities for the domestic price to provide an appropriate basis for the establishment of the normal value. (44) For about 90 % of the product types, normal value was thus established based on sales prices in the ordinary course of trade on the domestic market of the analogue country. (45) Wherever domestic prices of a particular product type sold by the producer in the analogue country could not be used in order to establish normal value, another method had to be applied.
For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
On this basis, the level of cooperation was deemed to be high. (55) Therefore the dumping margin was set at the level determined for the cooperating company not granted MET/IT, i.e.: 204,9 %. (56) On this basis the country-wide level of dumping was provisionally established at 204,9 % of the cif Community frontier price, duty unpaid.
Based on this, the total Community production in the IP was in the range of 40-50 tonnes. 2.
Definition of the Community industry (59) The production of the Community producer that fully cooperated in the investigation represents more than 50 % of the tungsten electrodes produced in the Community.
Community consumption (60) Community consumption was established on the basis of the sales volume of the known producers in the Community plus imports.
The data showed that demand for the product concerned in the Community increased by 50 % over the period considered. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Community consumption (kg) | 107000 | 120000 | 116000 | 135000 | 161000 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 112 | 108 | 126 | 150 | 4.
Imports into the Community from the country concerned (a) Volume and market share of the imports concerned (61) The volume of Chinese imports was based on the data contained in the complaint and the sampling questionnaires for the IP, for the reasons stated above. (62) In terms of volume and market share, the evolution of imports has been the following: | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Import volumes from PRC (kg) | 23968 | 62760 | 67628 | 84915 | 122603 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 262 | 282 | 354 | 512 | Market share PRC | 22,4 % | 52,3 % | 58,3 % | 62,9 % | 76,2 % | (63) While consumption of tungsten electrodes increased by 50 % during the period considered, imports from the country concerned rose by over 400 % during the same period.
Over the period considered these prices fell by 12 %, despite a rise in 2005 due to the increase in price of the main raw material. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Import prices from the PRC EUR/kg | 37 | 37 | 28 | 24 | 33 | Index 2001 = 100 | 100 | 100 | 75 | 63 | 88 | (65) Concerning the selling price on the Community market of the product concerned during the IP, a comparison was made between the prices of the Community industry and those of the exporting producers in the PRC.
These prices were compared with the sales prices charged by the Chinese exporting producers, net of discounts, and adjusted where necessary to cif Community frontier prices with an appropriate adjustment for the customs clearance costs and post-importation costs. (66) The comparison showed that, during the IP, imports of the product concerned were sold in the Community at prices which undercut the Community industry's prices, when expressed as a percentage of the latter, by 40 %. 5.
Situation of the Community industry (67) In accordance with Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the impact of the dumped imports from the PRC on the Community industry included an analysis of all economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry from 2001 to the IP.
At the same time, Community consumption increased by 50 %, while the market share of the Community industry declined even more, by 70 %, over the same five years. (75) It was thus found that the Community industry could not participate in the growth of the market resulting from the increase in Community consumption. (76) Average sales prices to unrelated buyers in the Community market were on a declining trend until 2003.
Then they experienced an increase of almost 12 % between 2003 and 2004 with a further increase of 30 % between 2004 and 2005.
The price decrease until 2003 should be seen in the light of the Community industry's attempts to compete with the dumped imports.
Furthermore, the development of raw material prices which rose sharply, by over 100 %, between 2004 and 2005 added to the need for a further price increase in 2005.
The figures are shown as ranges for confidentiality reasons. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Profit margin | 0 % to – 10 % | 0 % to – 10 % | – 10 % to – 20 % | – 10 % to – 20 % | – 10 % to – 20 % | (78) Profitability deteriorated significantly over the period considered.
It reached its lowest levels in 2003 and then slightly improved, which is linked partly to the rationalisation efforts of the Community industry and to the price increases. (79) Cash flow has also deteriorated over the period considered, in line with the decrease in profitability.
The decrease in the absolute level of negative cash flow at the end of the period is only due to the decrease in the volume of production and sales. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Cash Flow ('000 EUR) | 100 to 200 | – 100 to 0 | – 200 to – 300 | – 200 to – 300 | – 100 to – 200 | (e) Investments, return on investments and ability to raise capital (80) At the beginning of the period considered, the Community industry recorded significant levels of investment, which was mainly the purchase of new machinery to optimise production, and which was justified by the overall satisfactory performance of the tungsten electrodes and other tungsten products until 2000/2001.
Conclusion on injury (88) It is recalled that between 2001 and the IP, the volume of dumped imports of the product concerned from the PRC increased by over 400 %, reaching 76,2 % market share by the end of the period considered.
Moreover, in the IP, the sales prices of the Community industry were substantially undercut by those of the dumped imports of the product concerned.
On a weighted average basis, price undercutting was 40 %. (89) At the same time, while the Community consumption increased by 50 %, the sales volume of the Community industry decreased by more than 50 %.
Effect of the imports from the PRC (95) The dramatic surge in the volume of the dumped imports from the PRC by over 400 % between 2001 and the IP and of their market share of the Community market from 22,4 % to 76,2 % coincided with the deterioration of the economic situation of the Community industry.
Production and capacity utilisation declined sharply while closing stocks rose by 31 %, this in the context of a growing Community market.
In addition, the prices of the dumped imports significantly undercut those of the Community industry, thus exerting a strong downward pressure upon the Community industry's prices at a time when the costs of raw materials significantly increased by over 100 %.
The investigation showed that the Community industry was not in a position to pass on any increase of costs to its customers due to the fierce price pressure exerted by the significant volumes of dumped products imported from the PRC.
This led to a sharp decrease in profitability, return on investment and cash flow. (96) It is therefore provisionally concluded that the pressure exerted by the dumped imports, which significantly increased their volume and market share from 2001 onwards, and which were made at dumped prices, played a determining role in the loss of market share of the Community industry and, as a consequence, its negative profitability development. 3.
These exports decreased by about 66 % between 2001 and the IP, and represented 41 % of the industry's total sales at the end of the IP.
In this context, it should be noted that due to a similar behaviour of the Chinese producers in the US market, one of the two existing US producers of tungsten electrodes had to stop its production. | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Sales volume in non-EC markets, 2001 = 100 | 100 | 87 | 85 | 49 | 34 | Average sales prices in non-EC markets, 2001 = 100 | 100 | 83 | 71 | 93 | 120 | (99) In terms of the indicators where a distinction between Community and export markets could not be made, such as production, capacity utilisation, investments and employment, it was found that their negative evolution clearly exceeded what could be attributed to the decrease in export performance.
Indeed, the average sales price to export markets increased by 20 % in the same period which suggests that the price pressure was less in those markets than in the Community market.
in 2005. (104) In this respect, it should first be noted that the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry coincided in time with the surge of Chinese imports, from 2001 to 2005, and did not only take place at the end of the period considered. (105) The increase in raw material prices, on the other hand, took place exclusively in 2005.
However, in that particular year, prices of the Community industry actually increased somewhat more (33 %) than the cost of production (30 %). | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | IP | Total unit cost per tonne, 2001 = 100 | 100 | 95 | 88 | 97 | 126 | Unit sales price, 2001 = 100 | 100 | 87 | 76 | 85 | 113 | (106) Those time patterns suggest that, although the increase in raw material prices contributed to the overall increase in costs which exceeded the increase in sales prices over the period considered, raw materials were not the decisive factor behind the deterioration of the financial situation of the Community industry.
Under these circumstances, it has to be concluded that the Community industry was exposed to heavy price pressure by these dumped imports and consequently had only a limited possibility to compensate for the increase in costs by increasing its sales prices. (108) Finally, it should be noted that the increase in raw material prices affected all operators in the market, including the Chinese exporting producers and can therefore not be considered as a particular factor causing injury to the Community industry. (109) Based on the above, it is concluded that the increase in prices of raw materials per se does not break the causal link between dumped imports from the PRC and the injury suffered by the Community industry. 4.
The resulting price depression and loss of economies of scale due to low capacity utilisation led to an unsustainable level of negative profitability causing significant financial losses to the Community industry. (111) The deterioration of most injury indicators of the Community industry coincided with a sharp increase in import volumes and market share from the PRC and a substantial price undercutting by these imports. (112) Although the investigation has shown that it cannot be excluded that the negative evolution of exports of the Community industry to non-EU countries may have contributed to the injury, the potential effect of that evolution is not such as to break the causal link between dumped imports from the PRC and the injury suffered by the Community industry. (113) Furthermore, although raw material prices experienced an unprecedented increase during the IP, this affected all operators in the market.
General considerations (115) Pursuant to Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it has been examined whether compelling reasons exist that could lead to the conclusion that it would not be in the Community interest to impose anti-dumping measures on imports from the country concerned.
As the production of tungsten electrodes declined by 60 % during the period considered, this had a negative impact not only on the costs of production for tungsten electrodes, but also for other round products produced by the Community industry. (120) This should be seen within the context of a growing world demand for the product concerned which, if measures were imposed, would allow the Community industry to increase its sales, improve its profitability and thereby ensure the economic viability of this industry. (121) It is therefore concluded that anti-dumping measures would be in the interests of the Community industry. 3.
These three importers represent about 30 % of the total imports of the product concerned into the Community during the IP.
For the importer which fully cooperated, the product concerned represents about 85 % of its turnover. (130) Should anti-dumping measures be imposed, it is not excluded that the level of imports originating in the country concerned may decrease, thus affecting the economic situation of the importers.
PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES 1.
The pre-tax profit margin used for this calculation was 8 % of turnover based on profit levels obtained prior to the existence of dumped imports.
The non-injurious price was obtained by adding the abovementioned profit margin of 8 % to the costs of production.
Provisional measures (140) In light of the foregoing, it is considered that a provisional anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the level of the dumping margin found, but should not, in accordance with Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation, be higher than the injury margin calculated above. (141) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
Imports not accompanied by such an invoice must be made subject to the residual anti-dumping duty applicable to all other companies. (146) It is recalled that should the exports by the companies benefiting from lower individual duty rates increase significantly in volume after the imposition of the anti-dumping measures, such an increase in volume could be considered as constituting in itself a change in the pattern of trade due to the imposition of measures within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation.
A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of certain tungsten electrodes (including tungsten bars and rods for electrodes), other than those obtained simply by sintering, whether or not cut to length, falling within CN codes ex81019500 and ex85159090 (TARIC codes 8101950010 and 8515909010) and originating in the People's Republic of China. 2.
The application of the individual duty rates specified for the companies mentioned in paragraph 2 shall be conditional upon presentation to the customs authorities of the Member States of a valid commercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in the Annex.
The release for free circulation in the Community of the product referred to in paragraph 1 shall be subject to the provision of a security, equivalent to the amount of the provisional duty. 5.
Article 2 Without prejudice to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, interested parties may request disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which this Regulation was adopted, make their views known in writing and apply to be heard orally by the Commission within one month of the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
