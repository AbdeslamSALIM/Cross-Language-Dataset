PREVIOUS PROCEDURE (1) In August 1999, by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999 [2], the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of steel ropes and cables (the product concerned) originating, inter alia, in India. (2) In November 2005, following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1858/2005 [3] decided that the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of the product concerned originating, inter alia, in India should be maintained. (3) By Decision 1999/572/EC [4], the Commission accepted a price undertaking from an Indian company, Usha Martin Industries and Usha Beltron Ltd.
The goods had also been resold to the first independent customer in the Community at prices below the MIPs. (15) Commission Decision 2006/38/EC [5], sets out in more detail the nature of the breaches found. (16) In view of these breaches, acceptance of the undertaking offered by Usha Martin Industries and Usha Beltron Ltd, now known as Usha Martin Ltd (TARIC additional code A024) has been withdrawn by Decision 2006/38/EC.
As the investigation in question was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and resulting injury by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999, it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping rate should be set at the level and in the form imposed by that Regulation, namely 23,8 % of the net, cif free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty.
