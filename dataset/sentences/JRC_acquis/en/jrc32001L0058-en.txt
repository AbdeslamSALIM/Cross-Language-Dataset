If in other cases it emerges that information on certain properties is of no significance or that it is technically impossible to provide, the reasons for this must be clearly stated under each heading.
metals in massive form, alloys, compressed gases etc.) listed in chapters 8 and 9 of Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC, for which there are labelling derogations. 1.
Emergency telephone In addition to the abovementioned information, supply the emergency telephone number of the company and/or relevant official advisory body (this may be the body responsible for receiving information relating to health, which is referred to in Article 17 of Directive 1999/45/EC). 2.
For a preparation not classified as dangerous according to Directive 1999/45/EC, the following substances shall be indicated, together with their concentration or concentration range, if they are present in an individual concentration of %amp%gt;= 1 % by weight for non-gaseous preparations and %amp%gt;= 0,2 % by volume for gaseous preparations: - substances presenting a health or environmental hazard within the meaning of Directive 67/548/EEC(2); - and substances for which there are Community workplace exposure limits. 2.4.
The classification (deriving either from Articles 4 and 6 or from Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC) of the above substances shall be given, including the symbol letters and R phrases which are assigned in accordance with their physicochemical, health and environmental hazards.
The R phrases do not need to be written out in full here: reference should be made to heading 16, where the full text of each relevant R phrase shall be listed. 2.5.
For substances listed by a generic name, according to Article 15 of Directive 1999/45/EC or the footnote to point 2.3 of this Annex, a precise chemical identifier is not necessary. 2.6.
If, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 of Directive 1999/45/EC or the footnote to point 2.3 of this Annex, the identity of certain substances is to be kept confidential, their chemical nature shall be described in order to ensure safe handling.
It may be necessary to mention other hazards, such as dustiness, suffocation, freezing or environmental effects such as hazards to soil-dwelling organisms, etc., which do not result in classification but which may contribute to the overall hazards of the material.
The information shown on the label should be given under heading 15. 4.
FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES Refer to requirements for fighting a fire caused by the substance or preparation, or arising in its vicinity by indicating: - suitable extinguishing media, - extinguishing media which must not be used for safety reasons, - special exposure hazards arising from the substance or preparation itself, combustion products, resulting gases, - special protective equipment for fire-fighters. 6.
EXPOSURE CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION 8.1.
Therefore provide suitable and adequate information on these measures to enable a proper risk assessment to be carried out under Article 4 of Directive 98/24/EC.
If necessary indicate any additional hand protection measures. 8.2.1.3.
If necessary, indicate any additional skin protection measures and specific hygiene measures. 8.2.2.
Odour If odour is perceptible, give a brief description of it. 9.2.
Note 1 The above properties should be determined in accordance with the specifications of Part A of Annex V to Directive 67/548/EEC or any other comparable method.
Note 2 For preparations, information should normally be given on the properties of the preparation itself.
Where available, give relevant test data (e.g.
Relevant data might include: - known or predicted distribution to environmental compartments, - surface tension, - absorption/desorption.
For other physicochemical properties see heading 9. 12.3.
