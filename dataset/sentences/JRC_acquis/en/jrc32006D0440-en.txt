The Council and Commission also request that the impact of the new measures for this purpose be kept under review. -------------------------------------------------- STATEMENT BY THE COUNCIL On the basis of the process and considerations laid down in the common approach on visa facilitation based on a case-by-case assessment of the countries concerned, and having regard to Rule II.3 of this Decision, the Council invites the Commission to bring forward recommendations for mandates for initiating negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission agreements, starting with the countries with a European perspective as referred to in the European Council Conclusions of June 2003 and June 2005. --------------------------------------------------
