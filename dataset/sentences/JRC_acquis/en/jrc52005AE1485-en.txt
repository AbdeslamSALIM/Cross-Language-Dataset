Bringing down unemployment, creating new jobs and promoting the economic growth required for that purpose on a sustainable basis is becoming the EU's biggest economic and social challenge. 1.2 Businesses have a vital role to play in meeting these challenges. 98 % of businesses in Europe are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Summary of the Commission document 2.1 The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), which is set to run from 2007 to 2013, is intended to help implement the refocused Lisbon strategy and the Community strategy for sustainable development. 2.2 The CIP marks the continuation of a range of existing Community support programmes in various policy areas and presents them as a package with a coherent legal basis.
The CIP is made up of three specific sub-programmes. 2.6 The purpose of the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is to create a framework for entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness.
The budgetary allocation for this programme is EUR 780 million. 2.9 The CIP will operate on the basis of annual work programmes.

The Committee is pleased that the EU is targeting education and training, not least through Community schemes such as Socrates (education in general), Tempus (university studies) and Leonardo da Vinci (vocational training).
When conducting this impact assessment, the Commission should work closely with the Competitiveness Council and the European Parliament. 3.7 The Committee shares the Commission's view that horizontal and coordinating EU measures can generate major added value.
The Committee is working on a separate opinion on the i2010 initiative. 4.6 The Intelligent Energy — Europe programme 4.6.1 The Committee welcomes the scope of the proposed programme.
The ongoing Sustainable energy for Europe campaign has an important contribution to make in this regard.
