In this Directive, the sequence number is 00. 1.2.
This Directive applies to all vehicles in categories M, N and O where a heating system is fitted. 2.
REQUIREMENTS FOR HEATING SYSTEMS 3.1.
The passenger compartment of every vehicle in categories M and N shall be fitted with a heating system. 3.2.
The test procedures for the verification of each of these requirements are set out in Annexes IV, V and VI. 3.2.1.
Note 2: A new Annex VIII %quot%Safety requirements for LPG combustion heaters%quot% will be added to this Directive in accordance with Article 5.
Note 3: Combustion heaters located outside the passenger compartment, using water as a transfer medium, are deemed to comply with Annexes IV and V.
ANNEX III REQUIREMENTS FOR WASTE HEATING SYSTEMS - AIR 1.
The requirements set out in paragraph 3.2 of Annex II are considered satisfied in respect of heating systems which include a heat exchanger, the primary circuit of which is passed over by exhaust gases or polluted air, provided that the following conditions are satisfied: 2.
the walls of the primary circuit of the heat exchanger must be leak tight at any pressure up to and including 2 bar; 3.
the wall of the heat exchanger where the exchange of heat takes place must be at least 2 mm thick if made of non-alloy steels; 4.1.
if the wall of the heat exchanger where the exchange of heat takes place is enamelled, the wall where such enamel has been applied must be at least 1 mm thick and this enamel must be durable, leak tight and not porous; 5.
