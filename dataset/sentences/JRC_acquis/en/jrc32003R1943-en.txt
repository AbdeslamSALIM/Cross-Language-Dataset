In the interests of clarity and rationality, that Regulation should be replaced by a new Regulation. (2) Regulation (EC) No 20/98 should consequently be repealed. (3) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 states that new producer groups may be allowed a transitional period of no more than five years in which to meet the conditions for recognition laid down in Article 11 of that Regulation.
However, to take account of the multiannual financing of investments, those qualifying for investment aid pursuant to this Regulation can be carried over to operational programmes as referred to in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96. (11) Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides a special scheme for Portugal.
Article 2 Definitions 1.
The production shall include the amount of the aid as provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 and Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 received by the producer groups for the same annual or semestrial period referred to in Article 3.
In the event of a natural disaster recognised by the competent national authorities, marketed production shall be deemed to be at least 70 % of the average theoretical value equal to the area belonging to the producer group granted preliminary recognition and sown to the product in question during the year of the natural disaster, multiplied by the average yield and average price obtained - by the producer group or its members for the product in question during the three years prior to the natural disaster, or - where the Member State so decides, in the same production region during the three years prior to the disaster.
Article 3 Financing of recognition plans 1.
The aid provided for in Article 14(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 shall be granted towards the costs of setting up and running the producer group, at a flat rate. 2.
The aid referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined for each producer group on the basis of its value of marketed production, and shall: (a) amount, for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth years, to 5 %, 5 %, 4 %, 3 % and 2 % respectively of the value of marketed production up to a maximum of EUR 1000000; (b) amount, for the first, second, third, fourth and fifth years, to 2,5 %, 2,5 %, 2,0 %, 1,5 % and 1,5 % respectively of the value of marketed production exceeding EUR 1000000; (c) be subject to a ceiling for each producer group of: - EUR 100000 for the first year, - EUR 100000 for the second year, - EUR 80000 for the third year, - EUR 60000 for the fourth year, - EUR 50000 for the fifth year; (d) be paid - in annual or semestrial instalments at the end of each annual or semestrial period for the implementation of the recognition plan, or - in instalments covering part of an annual period if recognition occurs according to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 before the end of an annual period.
Aid as provided for in Article 14(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 shall be granted, directly or through credit institutions, in the form of special loans to cover part of the cost of investments linked to implementation of the measures in recognition plans, as described in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1432/2003.
Article 5 Application for aid 1.
Producer groups shall each submit a single application for the aid referred to in Articles 3 and 4 within three months of the end of each annual period as referred to in Article 3(2)(d). 2.
Article 6 Eligibility Member States shall evaluate the eligibility of producer groups for the aid under this Regulation in order to establish that the aid is duly justified, regard being had to the conditions and the date on which any earlier public aid was granted to the producer organisations or groups from which the members of the producer group in question originate and to any movements of members between organisations and producer groups.
Article 8 Community contribution 1.
The Community contribution towards aid as referred to in Article 3 shall amount to: - 75 % of eligible public expenditure in Objective 1 and 2 regions as referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999(11), - 50 % of eligible public expenditure in other regions. 2.
The Community contribution towards aid as referred to in Article 4, expressed in terms of capital-grant equivalent, shall not exceed, as a percentage of eligible investment costs as referred to in Article 4: - 50 % in Objective 1 and 2 regions as referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, - 30 % in other regions.

Article 10 Consequences of recognition 1.
Investments qualifying for the aid or the costs referred to in Article 4 may be carried over to operational programmes provided they are in line with Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003.
Article 11 Specific clauses for Portugal Where the Portuguese authorities demonstrate that, in a given year, the aid payable to a producer group in Portugal in accordance with this Regulation is less than that stipulated in Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the aid provided for in Article 3(2) shall be increased so as to satisfy the provisions of the aforesaid Article 14.
Article 12 Checks Without prejudice to checks carried out in accordance with Title VI of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, Member States shall carry out checks on producer groups to verify compliance with the conditions for the grant of aid as referred to in Articles 3 and 4.
Article 13 Recovery of aid and sanction Recovery of aid and sanctions as provided for in Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003 shall apply where a check carried out pursuant to Article 12 of this Regulation shows that: (a) the value of marketed production is less than the amount used for calculating aid as referred to in Article 3; (b) aid covered by this Regulation has not been used in accordance with the regulations applicable or with the approved recognition plan.
