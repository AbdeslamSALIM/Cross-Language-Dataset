The applicant contends that the contested decision infringes Article 27 of the Staff Regulations in that, for no valid reason, it denies some of the candidates access to the vacant post.
Finally, he contends that the provision in the vacancy notice on which the abovementioned decision was based, namely paragraph III .1, is illegal, since it is in breach of the principle of non-discrimination and should therefore be declared inoperative, pursuant to Article 241 EC. --------------------------------------------------
