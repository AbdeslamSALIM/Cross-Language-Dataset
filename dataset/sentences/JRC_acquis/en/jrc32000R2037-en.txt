Further efficient measures need therefore to be taken in order to protect human health and the environment against adverse effects resulting from such emissions. (2) In view of its responsibilities for the environment and trade, the Community, pursuant to Decision 88/540/EEC(4), has become a Party to the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, as amended by the Parties to the Protocol at their second meeting in London and at their fourth meeting in Copenhagen. (3) Additional measures for the protection of the ozone layer were adopted by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol at their seventh meeting in Vienna in December 1995 and at their ninth meeting in Montreal in September 1997, in which the Community participated. (4) It is necessary for action to be taken at Community level to carry out the Community's obligations under the Vienna Convention and the latest amendments and adjustments to the Montreal Protocol, in particular to phase out the production and the placing on the market of methyl bromide within the Community and to provide for a system for the licensing not only of imports but also of exports of ozone-depleting substances. (5) In view of the earlier than anticipated availability of technologies for replacing ozone-depleting substances, it is appropriate in certain cases to provide for control measures which are stricter than those provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 of 15 December 1994 on substances that deplete the ozone layer(5) and stricter than those of the Montreal Protocol. (6) Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 must be modified substantially.
The production of those controlled substances is thus prohibited, subject to possible derogation for essential uses and to meet the basic domestic needs of Parties pursuant to Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol.
Measures for the control of the production of hydrochlorofluorocarbons should be taken by all Parties to the Montreal Protocol.
Controlled substances and products containing controlled substances from States not party to the Montreal Protocol should not be imported. (13) The licensing system for controlled substances should be extended to include the authorisation of exports of controlled substances, in order to monitor trade in ozone-depleting substances and to allow for exchange of information between Parties. (14) Provision should be made for the recovery of used controlled substances, and to prevent leakages of controlled substances. (15) The Montreal Protocol requires reporting on trade in ozone-depleting substances.
This Regulation shall also apply to the production, importation, placing on the market and use of substances in Annex II.
This definition shall not cover any controlled substance which is in a manufactured product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of that substance, or insignificant quantities of any controlled substance, originating from inadvertent or coincidental production during a manufacturing process, from unreacted feedstock, or from use as a processing agent which is present in chemical substances as trace impurities, or that is emitted during product manufacture or handling, - %quot%chlorofluorocarbons%quot% (CFCs) means the controlled substances listed in Group I of Annex I, including their isomers, - %quot%other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons%quot% means the controlled substances listed in Group II of Annex I, including their isomers, - %quot%halons%quot% means the controlled substances listed in Group III of Annex I, including their isomers, - %quot%carbon tetrachloride%quot% means the controlled substance specified in Group IV of Annex I, - %quot%1,1,1-trichloroethane%quot% means the controlled substance specified in Group V of Annex I, - %quot%methyl bromide%quot% means the controlled substance specified in Group VI of Annex I, - %quot%hydrobromofluorocarbons%quot% means the controlled substances listed in Group VII of Annex I, including their isomers, - %quot%hydrochlorofluorocarbons%quot% (HCFCs) means the controlled substances listed in Group VIII of Annex I, including their isomers, - %quot%new substances%quot% means substances listed in Annex II.
The Commission shall, in the light of those criteria and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), establish a list of undertakings in which the use of controlled substances as processing agents shall be permitted, laying down maximum emission levels for each of the undertakings concerned.
It may, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), amend Annex VI as well as the list of undertakings referred to above in the light of new information or technical developments, including the review provided for in Decision X/14 of the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, - %quot%producer%quot% means any natural or legal person manufacturing controlled substances within the Community, - %quot%production%quot% means the amount of controlled substances produced, less the amount destroyed by technologies approved by the Parties and less the amount entirely used as feedstock or as a processing agent in the manufacture of other chemicals.
