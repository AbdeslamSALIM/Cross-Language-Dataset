Under that Article, the Commission may decide, in certain specific cases to be determined, that proof of import as referred to in that Article may be furnished by a specific document or in any other way. (4) Since subjecting the payment of refunds to the requirements of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 entails a substantial change in the administrative procedures for both the national authorities and exporters, it has administrative implications and represents a significant financial burden.
Obtaining the proof referred to in Article 16 of that Regulation can pose considerable administrative difficulties in some countries.
That period expired on 31 December 2005. (6) However, in many of the countries of destination appropriate procedures and adequate means to provide for the necessary documents are still not in place.
In the case of exports of products falling within CN codes 0401 to 0405 carried out under Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 for which the exporter is unable to provide the proof referred to in Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, the product shall be deemed to have been imported into a third country on presentation of a copy of the transport document and one of the documents listed in Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. 2.
For the purposes of applying Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 Member States shall take into account the provisions laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply to export declarations accepted from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2006.
