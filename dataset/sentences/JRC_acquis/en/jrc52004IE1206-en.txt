At its 411th plenary session of 15 and 16 September 2004 (meeting of 15 September), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 144 votes to one, with two abstentions: 1.
With regard to point (a), research is needed in particular in the following fields: - economic and financial policy (4.1) - work and employment (4.2) - elderly people's everyday lives (4.3) - the social and spatial environment (4.4) - lifelong learning (4.5) - maintaining a healthy life and care requirements (4.6) - new technologies (4.7) - processing, collating and adding to existing knowledge (4.8).
This opens up new opportunities for economic and social development.
The holistic approach pursued under the telematics programme in the late 1990s has yet, however, to be universally taken up. 3.4 Under the sixth Framework Programme for Research (FP6), support for research into population ageing and its impact on individuals and society is only being pursued in a few subsidiary areas of the key actions Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health (Priority 1), Information society technologies (Priority 2), Citizens and governance in a knowledge-based society (Priority 7) and RTD supporting policies and anticipating scientific and technological needs (Priority 8), as well as ERA-NET. 3.4.1 Key policy findings are to be expected particularly from current Priority 8 projects on demographic perspectives and on health costs and expenditure against the backdrop of an ageing society.
The aim of making a European area of lifelong learning a reality has already been highlighted in a joint communication from DG Education and Culture and DG Employment and Social Affairs, and in a Council Resolution of 27 June 2002 [8].
Brussels, 15 September 2004.
