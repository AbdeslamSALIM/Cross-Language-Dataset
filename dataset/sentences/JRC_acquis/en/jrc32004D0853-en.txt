Thus the VAT is an additional complicating factor in an already complex mechanism of financial compensation resulting from the sharing of the management costs for the tunnel. (5) The purpose of the derogation requested by France and Italy is to seek authorisation to derogate from Article 3 of Directive 77/388/EEC in relation to the tunnel of Mont Blanc (Monte Bianco) and tunnel of Fr√©jus. (6) For both tunnels the two States wish to consider the entire length of the carriageway within the tunnel as the territory of the State in which any transit journey through the tunnel using the carriageway starts.
Article 2 Article 1 shall apply to the tunnels' tolls only.
Article 3 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic and the Italian Republic.
