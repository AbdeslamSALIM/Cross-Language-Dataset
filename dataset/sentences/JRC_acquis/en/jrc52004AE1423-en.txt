At its 412th plenary session of 27/ 28 October 2004 (meeting of 27 October) the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion 158 votes to four with three abstentions: 1.
As a result, reinsurance supervision regimes vary widely from one Member State to another. 1.2 On 21 April 2004, therefore, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Directive on reinsurance and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 92/49/EEC and Directives 98/78/EC and 2002/83/EC.
The Commission proposals 2.1 The purpose of the directive is to establish a harmonised supervisory framework for reinsurance undertakings and captives [1] in the European Union. 2.2 The proposal lays down the minimum conditions necessary to obtain official authorisation.
In 2002, the total reinsurance premium of the 40 largest reinsurers amounted to USD 138601200000, of which USD 58544000000 stemmed from EU reinsurers. 3.3 The reinsurance business is concerned mainly with the relationship between primary insurers and reinsurers.
The solvency calculation comprises two elements: 3â€° of the sum at risk and 4 % of the mathematical provisions.
Solvency provisions for non-life reinsurance activities (Articles 37 and 55) 5.1 The proposed directive applies the provisions for calculating the solvency margin of primary non-life insurance activities to the non-life reinsurance business as well.
The proposal also allows for the possibility of increasing the solvency requirements for non-life reinsurance by up to 50 % under the Lamfalussy procedure. 5.2 The Committee feels that, under the fast-track procedure, it is appropriate to transfer, unchanged, the solvency rules for primary non-life insurers to non-life reinsurers.
However, the Committee has considerable misgivings about extending the Lamfalussy procedure in the area of solvency requirements. 5.3 The proposed directive was conceived as a fast-track project, not as a framework directive within the Lamfalussy procedure.
Investment rules (Article 34) 7.1 The Committee accepts the qualitative prudential rules provided for in Article 34 (the "prudent person principle").
Brussels, 27 October 2004.
The President of the European Economic and Social Committee Anne-Marie Sigmund [1] A reinsurance captive is a reinsurer belonging to a company or a group of companies where that company or group of companies is not engaged in primary insurance or reinsurance.
A captive operates only to offer reinsurance protection to the company or group of companies in question. --------------------------------------------------
