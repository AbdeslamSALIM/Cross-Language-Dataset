INTRODUCTION This report on the activities of the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) is required under Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 (Annex I – “The IFI Regulation”)[1], which provided for the continuation of the funding of the IFI for the period 2005-2006.
This gave birth in 1986 to the International Fund for Ireland, an independent international organisation with its own governing body.
The IFI Regulation provides the current legal basis for the Community contributions for 2005 and 2006.
Article 5 of that Regulation provides that the Commission shall submit a report to the EC Budgetary Authority (European Parliament and Council of the European Union), assessing the need for support beyond 2006.
This report and its annexes build on the 2004 Report on the International Fund for Ireland[2], and fulfil the requirements for the assessment mentioned above.
Objectives and Priorities The IFI was established by an agreement between the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1986 (ANNEX II) and came into existence in December of that year.
Approximately 75 % of the IFI’s resources shall be distributed in Northern Ireland. 2.1.2.
Annexes III – V contain further details of the organisation of the IFI.
Since the last report on the IFI, it has committed a further € 103 million to 580 projects in total.
The IFI has committed over € 830 million to nearly 6 000 projects across the various programmes of support.
Since its inception, the IFI has received approximately € 743 million (current prices).
Over the lifetime of the IFI, the United States has been the largest contributor (59.9 %), while the EU contribution is about 39 % of the total committed resources, the remainder coming from Canada, Australia and New Zealand (Annex VII).
Activities Since the last report, the IFI has committed € 103 million to 580 projects across various programmes and schemes (Annex VIII) which can be grouped under three headings: the regeneration of deprived areas, community capacity building and economic development.
EU Involvement in the IFI The IFI differs from conventional EC Structural Funds' forms of assistance (such as the PEACE programme) in that it is an independent international organisation.
AUDITS OF IFI ACTIVITIES The services of the European Community (ECA and DG REGIO) have carried out audits and on-the-spot checks of the IFI, as reported in the 1999, 2001 and the 2002 reports to the EC Budget Authority.
Since 2003 over 85% of the Fund’s commitments have been to projects in these areas.
In addition, the IFI and the SEUPB have been engaged in reconciliation-mapping projects in an effort to establish the gaps in provision in the reconciliation sector in Northern Ireland and the six Border Counties.
Any Regulation would best cover the four years 2007 to 2010, in order to ensure certainty of funding for the IFI. 5.
Nevertheless as the origins of the IFI were in the US in the mid 1980s, there remains a sense in the community both North and South that the Fund is a US-supported organisation, despite the generous funding from the EU since 1989 and the continuing insistence of the Fund that all projects recognise and publicise the Community's contribution.
In addition, the Financial Perspectives[12] ensured the continuation of the PEACE programme in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland: In recognition of the special effort for the peace process in Northern Ireland, a total of € 200 million will be allocated for the PEACE Programme for the period 2007-2013.
In this context, the Commission believes that funding after 2006 should be still provided on the basis of the observations made in this report, which could be reflected either in the future Council Regulation on the EC contribution to the IFI, or through other appropriate means of co-operation between the Commission and the IFI.

[5] The PEACE II Programme is classified as an Objective 1 Operational Programme in the period between 2000 and 2006, for a total amount of € 609 million.
For the programming period 2007-2013, there will be a new PEACE programme with a contribution from the European Regional Development Fund of € 200 million.
This programme will be under the territorial co-operation objective of the new regulatory framework. [6] Defined as a mix of interface areas, areas affected by violence and areas of deprivation. [7] The PEACE II Programme explicitly targets those belonging to areas, sectors, groups or communities that have been ‘most affected by the conflict’, and which do not necessarily correspond to those most deprived in economic and social terms.
