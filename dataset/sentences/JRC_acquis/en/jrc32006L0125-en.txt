This is the case for pesticides or metabolites of pesticides with an ADI lower than 0,0005 mg/kg body weight. (13) This Directive establishes the principle of the prohibition of the use of these pesticides in the production of agricultural products intended for processed cereal-based foods and baby foods.
This Directive is a %quot%specific Directive%quot% within the meaning of Article 4(1) of Directive 89/398/EEC. 2.
Article 3 Member States shall ensure that the products referred to in Article 1(2) are marketed within the Community only if they conform to the rules laid down in this Directive.
Article 4 Processed cereal-based foods and baby foods shall be manufactured from ingredients whose suitability for particular nutritional use by infants and young children has been established by generally accepted scientific data.
Processed cereal-based foods shall comply with the compositional criteria specified in Annex I. 2.
Article 6 Only the nutritional substances listed in Annex IV may be added in the manufacture of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods.
The pesticides listed in Annex VII shall not be used in agricultural products intended for the production of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods.
However, for the purpose of control: (a) pesticides listed in Table 1 of Annex VII are considered not to have been used if their residues do not exceed a level of 0,003 mg/kg.
This level, which is considered to be the limit of quantification of the analytical methods, shall be kept under regular review in the light of technical progress; (b) pesticides listed in Table 2 of Annex VII are considered not to have been used if their residues do not exceed a level of 0,003 mg/kg.
The levels referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply to the products as proposed ready for consumption or as reconstituted according to the instructions of the manufacturers. 5.
For pesticides listed in Annex VI, where a decision concerning the non-inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is taken, Annex VI and Annex VII to this Directive shall be amended accordingly. 6.
The labelling of the products concerned shall bear in addition to the particulars provided for in Article 3 of Directive 2000/13/EC, the following mandatory particulars: (a) a statement as to the appropriate age from which the product may be used, regard being had to its composition, texture or other particular properties.
Products recommended for use from the age of four months may indicate that they are suitable from that age unless independent persons having qualifications in medicine, nutrition or pharmacy, or other professionals responsible for maternal and child care, advise otherwise; (b) information as to the presence or absence of gluten if the indicated age from which the product may be used is below six months; (c) the available energy value expressed in kJ and kcal, and the protein, carbohydrate and lipid content, expressed in numerical form, per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption; (d) the average quantity of each mineral substance and of each vitamin governed by a specific level as specified in Annex I and Annex II respectively, expressed in numerical form, per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption; (e) instructions for appropriate preparation, when necessary, and a statement as to the importance of following those instructions. 2.
The labelling may bear: (a) the average quantity of the nutrients set out in Annex IV when such declaration is not covered by the provisions of paragraph 1(d), expressed in numerical form, per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold and, where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption; (b) in addition to numerical information, information on vitamins and minerals shown in Annex V, expressed as a percentage of the reference values given therein, per 100 g or 100 ml of the product as sold, and where appropriate, per specified quantity of the product as proposed for consumption, provided that the quantities present are at least equal to 15 % of the reference values.
Article 9 Directive 96/5/EC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex VIII, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex VIII, Part B.
