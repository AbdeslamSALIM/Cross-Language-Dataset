Council opinion of 8 March 2005 on the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, 2004-2008 (2005/C 177/02) THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies [1], and in particular Article 9(3) thereof, Having regard to the recommendation of the Commission, After consulting the Economic and Financial Committee, HAS DELIVERED THIS OPINION: (1) On 8 March 2005 the Council examined the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, which covers the period 2004 to 2008.
It projects real GDP growth to pick up from 3,6 % in 2004 to 4,3 % on average over the rest of the programme period.
The programme's projections for inflation also appear realistic. (3) On 5 July 2004, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in Cyprus and recommended that this be corrected by 2005.
It foresees the general government deficit to sharply decline from 4,8 % of GDP in 2004 to 2,9 % in 2005 and to decline more gradually thereafter, to 0,9 % in 2008.
The update further indicates that several planned measures for 2005 onward are to be "studied" further, which leaves some uncertainty.
On the other hand, the estimated deficit outcome for 2004 has been better than expected.
The Commission services autumn 2004 forecast projected a deficit of 3,0 % of GDP for 2005, given a slightly lower GDP growth forecast for that year.
All in all, the planned deficit reduction for 2005 looks challenging but increasingly feasible.
The adjustment path has to be underpinned by measures of a permanent nature. (5) In view of this risk assessment, the budgetary stance in the programme seems sufficient to reduce the deficit to below 3 % of GDP by 2005 and seems to provide a sufficient safety margin against breaching this threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations from 2006 onward.
It is however not sufficient to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact's medium-term objective of a budgetary position of close to balance is achieved within the programme period. (6) The debt ratio is estimated to have reached 74,9 % of GDP in 2004, above the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value.
The programme projects the debt ratio to decline by almost 17 percentage points over the programme period.
