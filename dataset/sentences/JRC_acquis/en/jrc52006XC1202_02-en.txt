Annual expenditure planned under the scheme : Year 2006: Liability limit in EUR: 500000 The grant equivalent of the guarantee is calculated using the evaluation method laid down in the Commission Notice on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid in the form of guarantees (OJ C 71 of 11 March 2000, p. 14).
The amount of the guarantee is in principle 50 % of principal plus interest.
In cases where Burgenland has a particular interest in the implementation of the project, the amount of the guarantee can be up to a maximum of 75 %.
With agriculture employing 6 % of the working population in the area, it is an economic sector to be sustained and developed.
For investment aid over EUR 15000 the conditions outlined in scheme N 184/2003 notified by France will be respected.
Material investments less than EUR 15000 are key to installation and designed to improve working conditions on the holding.
In this way, if an investment aid application is made to the State for an amount higher than 15000 under the PIDIL programme, any application for an equivalent amount of aid under PACTE-agriculture will be rejected, and vice versa.
