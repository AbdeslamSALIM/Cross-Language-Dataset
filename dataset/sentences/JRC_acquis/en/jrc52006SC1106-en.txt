The environmental impact of the various options is unclear.
The different reform options would have no impact on trends in import prices , which closely follow trends in imports and protective tariffs.
Maintaining production would seem to be essential for agriculture in Martinique, relatively important in the Canary Islands and Guadeloupe and less important in Madeira.
Overall, in the three outermost regions in which bananas are grown, directly and indirectly the sector accounts for 30 000 full-time jobs.
