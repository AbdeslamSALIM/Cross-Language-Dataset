Article 76 of that Regulation provides, however, for derogations to those provisions in favour of least-developed GSP-beneficiary countries which submit an appropriate request to that effect to the Community. (3) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1537/1999(7), Laos obtained such a derogation for certain textiles, for the period from 15 July 1999 to 14 July 2000. (4) The request submitted by Laos satisfies the requirements of Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
By way of derogation from Articles 67 to 97 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, products listed in the Annex to this Regulation which are manufactured in Laos from woven fabric (woven items) or yarn (knitted items) imported into that country and originating in a country belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (except Myanmar), to the South Asian Assocation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) or to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement shall be regarded as originating in Laos in accordance with the arrangements set out below. 2.
For the purposes of paragraph 1, products shall be considered as originating in ASEAN or SAARC when they are obtained in these countries according to the rules of origin provided for in Articles 67 to 97 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, or as originating in the beneficiary countries of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement when they are obtained in those countries according to the rules of origin provided in Protocol No 1 to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement(9). 3.
Article 2 The derogation provided for in Article 1 shall apply to products transported directly from Laos and imported into the Community during the period from 15 July 2000 to 31 December 2001, up to the annual quantities listed in the Annex against each product.
Article 4 When drawings under Article 3 account for 80 % of the quantities shown in the Annex, the Commission, in consultation with the Lao authorities, shall consider whether it is necessary to extend application of the derogation beyond those quantities.
Article 6 In case of doubt, the Member States may demand a copy of the document certifying the origin of the materials used in Laos under this derogation.
Such a demand may be made at the time of entry into free circulation of the goods benefiting from this Regulation, or within the framework of the administrative cooperation for which provision is made in Article 94 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
Article 7 This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
