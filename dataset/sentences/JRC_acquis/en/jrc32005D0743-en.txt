(4) In July 1996 the Netherlands received an application from Biosys concerning Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus.
The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 22 November 2002 (boscalid), 7 February 2000 (indoxacarb), 5 March 2001 (spinosad) and 19 November 1999 (Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus).

Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC. (8) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue.
