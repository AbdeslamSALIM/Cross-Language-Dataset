The objectives of this proposal are, in essence: ♣ to lay down a common statement of principles whose use will lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness in all types of organised mobility for learning purposes; ♣ more specifically, to provide a reference point for all stakeholders within the integrated lifelong learning programme proposed by the Commission for the period 2007 to 2013.
In addition, the Commission in its 2001 Communication “A Mobility Strategy for the European Research Area”[4], supported by Council[5], identified concrete actions both at Community and at national level, to exploit mobility as a key instrument for career development and for bringing about the European Research Area, as well as a prerequisite to increase European capacities and performances in research.
Mobility arrangements should include: - before departure, language assessment and the opportunity to follow courses in the language of the host country and in the language of instruction, if different; - in the host country, linguistic support and advice. 6.
