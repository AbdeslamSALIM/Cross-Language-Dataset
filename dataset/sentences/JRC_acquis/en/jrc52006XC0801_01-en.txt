There remains a wide range of contracts that are not or only partially covered by them, such as - Contracts below the thresholds for application of the Public Procurement Directives [2]; - Contracts for services listed in Annex II B to Directive 2004/18/EC and in Annex XVII B to Directive 2004/17/EC that exceed the thresholds for application of these Directives.
These standards apply to the award of services concessions, to contracts below the thresholds [7] and to contracts for services listed in Annex II B to Directive 2004/18/EC and in Annex XVII B to Directive 2004/17/EC in respect of issues not dealt with by these Directives [8].
Infringement proceedings under Article 226 EC Treaty will be opened only in cases where this appears appropriate in view of the gravity of the infringement and its impact on the Internal Market. 2.
Advertising 2.1.1.
In particular, adequate transparency for contracts for services listed in Annex II B to Directive 2004/18/EC and in Annex XVII B to Directive 2004/17/EC that exceed the thresholds for application of these Directives will typically require publication in a medium with wide coverage.
Therefore, contracting entities may award such contracts without publishing a prior advertising, provided they meet the conditions laid down in the Directives for one of the derogations [17]. 2.2.
Contract award 2.2.1.
Judicial protection 2.3.1.
This means that in the present context they apply only to contracts for services listed in Annex II B to Directive 2004/18/EC and in Annex XVII B to Directive 2004/17/EC which exceed the thresholds for application of these Directives.
In accordance with the case-law on judicial protection, the available remedies must not be less efficient than those applying to similar claims based on domestic law (principle of equivalence) and must not be such as in practice to make it impossible or excessively difficult to obtain judicial protection (principle of effectiveness) [26]. [1] Directive 2004/18/EC, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 114 and Directive 2004/17/EC, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 1 ("the Public Procurement Directives"). [2] Threshold values are set in Article 7 of Directive 2004/18/EC and Article 16 of Directive 2004/17/EC. [3] A third group of contracts not or only partially covered by the Directives are concessions.
See Article 17 of Directive 2004/18/EC and Article 18 of Directive 2004/17/EC for service concessions and Articles 56 to 65 of Directive 2004/18/EC and Article 18 of Directive 2004/17/EC for works concessions.
Contracts for services listed in Annex II B to Directive 2004/18/EC and in Annex XVII B to Directive 2004/17/EC have to comply with the rules on technical specifications in Article 23 of Directive 2004/18/EC and in Article 34 of Directive 2004/17/EC if they exceed the threshold for application of these Directives.
