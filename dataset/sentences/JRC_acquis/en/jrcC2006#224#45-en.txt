Case C-307/06: Action brought on 14 July 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany Action brought on 14 July 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Federal Republic of Germany Parties Applicant: Commission of the European Communities (represented by V.
Kreuschitz and I.
Kaufmann-Bühler, acting as Agents) Defendant: Federal Republic of Germany Form of order sought - declare that, by granting Erziehungsgeld (child-raising allowance), on the basis of the national provisions of the Bundeserziehungsgeldgesetz, to workers resident in another Member State only if they are in an employment relationship involving non-minor employment, with that condition having to be satisfied by frontier workers only, the Federal Republic of Germany has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 39 EC and Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 [1]; - order the Federal Republic of Germany to pay the costs.
That requirement is incompatible with Article 39 EC and Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of the Council.
A person in minor employment can fall within the concept of worker within the meaning of Article 39 EC.
According to settled case-law of the Court of Justice, the concept of worker in Article 39 EC and Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 has a Community law meaning and must not be interpreted narrowly.
