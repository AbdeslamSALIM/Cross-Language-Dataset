The existing system no longer suffices and must be further improved in order to separate the good operators from the bad, to remedy the shortcomings in a proportionate but effective manner, and to exclude from the system those who do not comply with it. - Thus the Council, in its conclusions of 13 December 2002, stressed the Commission's role in the procedures for authorising and monitoring classification societies. - In turn, the European Parliament, in its Resolution on improving safety at sea [2003/2235(INI)], asked the Commission to carry out effective monitoring and an audit of classification societies, their subsidiaries and participating undertakings and to introduce penalties for failure to comply with their obligations.
Since its amendment on 12 December 2002, this Convention contains a section on security which has been transposed into the Community legal order by Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 (OJ L 129 of 29.4.2004, p. 6).
It is appropriate, therefore, to establish a close working relationship between the administrations and the organizations, which may require that the organization has a local representation on the territory of the Member State on behalf of which it performs its duties. ê 94/57/EC Recital 16 6.
