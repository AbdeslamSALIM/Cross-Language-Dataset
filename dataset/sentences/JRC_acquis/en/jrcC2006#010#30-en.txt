Case C-404/05: Action brought on 17 November 2005 by the Commission of the European Communities against the Federal Republic of Germany Action brought on 17 November 2005 by the Commission of the European Communities against the Federal Republic of Germany An action against the Federal Republic of Germany was brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 17 November 2005 by the Commission of the European Communities, represented by Enrico Traversa and Gerald Braun, acting as Agents, with an address for service in Luxembourg.
Under Article 49 freedom to provide services is to be understood as the right, without hindrance, from a base in one Member State, to provide individual services in another Member State without maintaining a permanent establishment there.
Article 49 therefore precludes the application of a national regulation or administrative practice which, without objective justification, restricts the opportunity for a services provider to actually make use of the freedom to provide services.
