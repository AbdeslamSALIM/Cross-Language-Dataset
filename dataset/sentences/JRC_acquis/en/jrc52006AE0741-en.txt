At its 427th plenary session, held on 17 and 18 May 2006 (meeting of 17 May), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 143 votes to 0 with 4 abstentions.
In its opinion of 28 April 2004, the EESC has already mentioned the vulnerability of VAT to tax evasion and recommended the development of an alternative system capable of ensuring more effective tax collection.

Amended proposal of 20 July 2005 for a Council Regulation 4.1 General remark One of the above-mentioned measures is reflected in the amended proposal of 20 July 2005 for a Council Regulation (COM 334/2005 final).
This amended proposal was preceded by the proposal of 23 December 2003 for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the place of supply of services (COM(2003) 822 final -2003/0329(CNS)).
The European Economic and Social Committee commented on this proposal for a Directive on 28 April 2004.
Only then could companies be expected to provide taxable services, possibly in all 25 Member States, in the absence of the reverse-charge option.
Brussels, 17 May 2006.
