As regards the correction of 100 % in respect of the premium for extensification, the applicant disputes the Commission's assessment of the factual circumstances and claims that it erred as to the facts and gave an inadequate statement of reasons for the contested decision.
The applicant considers, moreover, that the imposition of a correction at the rate of 100 % contravenes the guidelines in Commission document VI/5330/97/23.12.97, is unjustified and clearly disproportionate, and goes beyond the bounds of proper use of the Commission's discretion.
It also considers that it complied fully with the conditions in Article 15 of Regulation No 2419/2001 [6] as regards administrative and on-the-spot checks.
