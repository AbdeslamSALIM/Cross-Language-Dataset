By letter of 28 October 2002, she was informed that her name had been included on the list of suitable candidates.
Her contract, signed on 3 November 2004, classified her at Grade B*4, in accordance with the Commission's decision of 28 April 2004 on the engagement of temporary staff, under which temporary personnel are engaged at Grade A*8 or B*4.
She submits that the Commission, by its decision of 28 April 2004, amended the call for candidatures to Category B, where the minimum grade, at the time of that call's publication, was Grade B5 (renamed B*5 under the new Staff Regulations).
In addition, the applicant claims infringement of the principle of equal treatment to the extent that successful candidates in the same procedure who were recruited prior to 1 May 2004, and classified in accordance with the previous rules, were classified at higher grades and benefit from better conditions for career progress.
