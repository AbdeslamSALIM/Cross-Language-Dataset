The opinion proposes technical specifications for a baseline study on the prevalence of Salmonella in fattening pigs in the EU. (4) In order to set the Community target, comparable data on the prevalence of Salmonella in populations of slaughter pigs in the Member States needs to be available.
In addition, serological methods have been developed to assess the Salmonella status of a pig and may be used for monitoring Salmonella in pigs within the frame of national control programmes to be implemented in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003. (6) A number of Member States volunteered to carry out the additional analyses by taking carcase swabs or carrying out serology on meat juice. (7) The survey is to provide technical information necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation.
The results of the survey shall be used to set Community targets as provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 and to consider the best approach to evaluate in the future the achievement of the target. 3.
The survey shall cover a one-year period commencing on 1 October 2006. 4.
For the purposes of this Decision, "competent authority" shall be the authority or authorities of a Member State as designated under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.
Article 2 Technical specifications The survey in slaughter pigs shall be organised by the Member States and shall be performed from 1 October 2006 in slaughterhouses.
Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the provisions in Annex I.
Article 3 Collection of data, assessment and reporting 1.
The competent authority responsible for preparing the yearly national report pursuant to Article 9(1) of Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [4] shall collect and assess the results achieved pursuant to Article 2 of this Decision and shall report all necessary data and its assessment to the Commission. 2.
Article 4 Scope of the Community financial contribution 1.
The maximum financial contribution from the Community shall be EUR 20 per test for bacteriological detection of Salmonella spp., EUR 30 for serotyping of the relevant isolates and EUR 10 for serology on meat juice. 3.
Article 5 Conditions for granting a Community financial contribution 1.
An advance of 50 % of the total amount referred to in Annex II may be paid at the request of the Member State concerned. 3.
Failure to comply with the time limit in paragraph 1(c) shall entail a progressive reduction of the financial contribution to be paid, amounting to 25 % of the total amount by 15 November 2007, 50 % by 1 December 2007 and 100 % by 15 December 2007.
Article 6 Conversion rate for applications in national currencies The conversion rate for applications submitted in national currencies in month "n" shall be that for the 10th day of month "n+1" or the first day before that day for which a rate is quoted.
Article 7 Application This Decision shall apply from 1 October 2006.
Article 8 Addressees This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

Decision as last amended by Decision 2006/53/EC (OJ L 29, 2.2.2006, p. 37). [2] OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 1.
Regulation as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005 (OJ L 170, 1.7.2005, p. 12). [3] OJ L 349, 24.12.1998, p. 1. [4] OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 31. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX I Technical specifications in accordance with Article 2 1.
Table 1 Minimum sample size Number of pigs present in the population | Minimum sample size [1] | %gt% 20000000 | 2400 | 10 to 20000000 | 1067 | 2 to 10000000 | 600 | %lt% 2000000 | 384 | Member States shall take a 10 % extra number of samples, to be analyzed in case some samples would be excluded from the study for various reasons.
Thus, each Member State shall identify those plants that accounted for at least 80 % of all slaughtered fattening pigs.
For example, if one slaughterhouse accounted for 25 % of fattening pigs slaughtered in the selected slaughterhouses (those representing at least 80 % of all fattening pigs slaughtered in the Member State), then (2400 × 0,25) 600 pigs shall be sampled.
Table 2 Weighing of slaughterhouses for the purpose of allocating the number of fattening pigs to be sampled from each slaughterhouse; calculation of sampled animals per slaughterhouse Slaughterhouse ID | Number of fattening pigs processed previous year | Percent of total slaughter included in the study | Number of samples per slaughterhouse | Samples per month (/12) | AXD | 88000 | 17,6 | 0,176 × 2400 = 422,4 | 422,4:12 = 36 | SVH | 25000 | 5,0 | | | TPB | 75000 | 15,0 | | | MLG | 100000 | 20,0 | | | GHT | 212000 | 42,4 | | | Total | 500000 [2] | 100,0 | | | For each slaughterhouse each month, a number between 1 and 31 shall be selected at random.
Table 3 Randomisation table Slaughterhouse | Day of the month | Identity of carcase [3] | AXD | 19 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 12 | 124 | 12 | 2 | 8 | 59 | The following animals shall be excluded from the baseline study: - animals with a live weight of less than 50 kg or more than 170 kg, - animals that have undergone emergency slaughter, - any carcase that is totally condemned. 2.
If possible, at least 25 grams of lymph nodes without fat or connective tissues shall be collected, - a sponge swabbed at four sites in accordance with paragraph 2(3), per carcase, from a total of at least 384 pigs, randomly selected from the selected pigs.
The sponge sampling method shall be used in accordance with the most recent edition of standard ISO 17604.
A surface of about 100 cm2 per site shall be swabbed using one single abrasive sponge for all the following sites as indicated and numbered below in accordance with Annex A of standard ISO 17604: - hind limb, medial (9), - abdomen, lateral (belly, 3), - mid-dorsal region (mid-back, 4), - jowl (7).
The sample shall be kept at max. 7 °C during storage and transportation.
Transport Samples shall be sent within 36 hours by fast mail or courier and shall reach the laboratory no later than 72 hours after sampling.
Samples arriving later than within 72 hours after sampling shall be discarded unless analysis is initiated within 96 hours after sampling and the cold chain was not interrupted. 4.
At the laboratory, samples shall be kept refrigerated until bacteriological examination, which shall be carried out within 24 hours after receipt and so that analysis is initiated no later than 96 hours after the sample was collected.
Containers shall be incubated for a total of (18 ± 2) hours at (37 ± 1) °C.
Regarding swabs sample, at the laboratory, 100 ml of BPW shall be added for pre-enrichment.
The sample shall be incubated at 37 °C overnight and examined for Salmonella using the modified semi-solid Rappaport-Vassiladis medium (MRSV) method (draft Annex D of the ISO 6579:2002(E). 4.2.
This method is described in the current version of draft Annex D of ISO 6579:2002: "Detection of Salmonella spp.
in animal faeces and in samples of the primary production stage." In this method, MSRV shall be used as the single selective enrichment medium. 4.3.
Serotyping All strains isolated and confirmed as Salmonella spp.
Phage typing In case isolates of Salmonella serovar typhimurium and Salmonella serovar enteritidis are phage typed (optional), the methods described by WHO reference centre for phage typing of Salmonella of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), Colindale, United Kingdom, shall be used. 4.5.
Testing of anti-microbial susceptibility In case of testing for anti-microbial susceptibility (optional), a validated and controlled method for testing shall be used, such as those recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, since 1 January 2005: "Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute" — CLSI).

Reporting from Member States The competent authority responsible for the preparation of the yearly national report on the monitoring of Salmonella in animals pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2003/99/EC shall collect and evaluate the results and report to the Commission.
the fifth carcase to be processed on the 19th day of that month should be sampled for the survey. [4] Type of sample: L = lymph nodes, S = swab, MJ = meat juice.
