THE COURT'S OPINION 3.
The Court's opinion is addressed to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 [2]; it was drawn up following an examination of the Foundation's accounts, as required by Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 4.
The Foundation's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 [3] were drawn up by its Executive Director, pursuant to Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1365/75, and sent to the Court, which is required to give its opinion on their reliability and on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. 5.
Reliability of the accounts The Foundation's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 are, in all material respects, reliable.
Analysis of the appropriations carried over to the 2005 financial year shows that 37 % of the commitments carried over were entered into in December 2004.
No organisation manual and no annual verification programme have yet been established [4]. 9.
The revenue and expenditure account for the financial year 2003 shows a loss of 1,3 million euro.
This amount should have been recorded in an amending budget for the financial year 2004 [5].
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 5 October 2005.
Due to unforeseen circumstances, a significant surplus became available in some budget lines and was utilised in December to commence work on research activities relevant for 2004 and 2005.
Moreover in order to increase the synergy between Foundation activities, it was decided to use a single tender in 2005 for all services for observatories.
The updating of the financial procedures manual is scheduled for completion in September 2005 and will incorporate an annual programme for verification of inventory items. 9.
The Commission was contacted during 2004 with regard to establishing an amending budget and has indicated it will examine the issue in 2005. --------------------------------------------------
