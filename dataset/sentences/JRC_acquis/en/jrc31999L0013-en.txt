Any change that may have, in the opinion of the competent authority, significant negative effects on human health or the environment is also a substantial change, - for all other installations, shall mean a change of the nominal capacity leading to an increase of emissions of volatile organic compounds of more than 10 %.
Article 5 Requirements 1.
Installations where two or more activities are carried out, each of which exceeds the thresholds in Annex IIA shall: (a) as regards the substances specified in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8, meet the requirements of those paragraphs for each activity individually; (b) as regards all other substances, either: (i) meet the requirements of paragraph 2 for each activity individually; or (ii) have total emissions not exceeding those that would have resulted had point (i) been applied. 6.
For discharges of the VOCs referred to in paragraph 6, where the mass flow of the sum of the compounds causing the labelling referred to in that paragraph is greater than, or equal to, 10 g/h, an emission limit value of 2 mg/Nm³ shall be complied with.
The emission limit value refers to the mass sum of the individual compounds. 8.
For discharges of halogenated VOCs which are assigned the risk phrase R40, where the mass flow of the sum of the compounds causing the labelling R40 is greater than, or equal to, 100 g/h, an emission limit value of 20 mg/Nm³ shall be complied with.
The discharge of VOCs referred to in paragraphs 6 and 8 shall be controlled as emissions from an installation under contained conditions as far as technically and economically feasible to safeguard public health and the environment. 9.
Neither the reduction scheme nor the application of paragraph 11 nor Article 6 exempt installations discharging substances specified in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 from fulfilling the requirements of those paragraphs. 13.
Article 6 National plans 1.
Without prejudice to Directive 96/61/EC, Member States may define and implement national plans for reducing emissions from the activities and industrial installations covered by Article 1, excluding activities 4 and 11 of Annex IIA.
Article 8 Monitoring 1.
Member States shall ensure that channels to which abatement equipment is connected, and which at the final point of discharge emit more than an average of 10 kg/h of total organic carbon, are monitored continuously for compliance. 3.
Article 9 Compliance with emission limit values 1.
In the case of continuous measurements the emission limit values shall be considered to be complied with if: (a) none of the averages over 24 hours of normal operation exceeds the emission limit values, and (b) none of the hourly averages exceeds the emission limit values by more than a factor of 1,5. 4.
In the case of periodic measurements the emission limit values shall be considered to be complied with if, in one monitoring exercise: (a) the average of all the readings does not exceed the emission limit values, and (b) none of the hourly averages exceeds the emission limit value by more than a factor of 1,5. 5.
Article 10 Non-compliance Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that, if it is found that the requirements of this Directive have been breached: (a) the operator informs the competent authority and takes measures to ensure that compliance is restored within the shortest possible time; (b) in cases of non-compliance causing immediate danger to human health and as long as compliance is not restored under the conditions of paragraph (a), operation of the activity is suspended.
Article 11 Information systems and reporting 1.
The report shall be drawn up on the basis of a questionnaire or outline drafted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 6 of Directive 91/692/EEC (14).
Article 12 Public access to information 1.
Article 13 Committee The Commission shall be assisted by a committee of an advisory nature composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission.
Article 14 Sanctions Member States shall determine the sanctions applicable to breaches of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive and shall take all necessary measures for their implementation.
Article 16 Entry into force This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
Article 17 Addressees This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Adhesive coating - Any activity in which an adhesive is applied to a surface, with the exception of adhesive coating and laminating associated with printing activities.
Coating activity - Any activity in which a single or multiple application of a continuous film of a coating is applied to: - vehicles as listed below: - new cars, defined as vehicles of category M1 in Directive 70/156/EEC (1), and of category N1 in so far as they are coated at the same installation as M1 vehicles, - truck cabins, defined as the housing for the driver, and all integrated housing for the technical equipment, of vehicles of categories N2 and N3 in Directive 70/156/EEC, - vans and trucks, defined as vehicles of categories N1, N2 and N3 in Directive 70/156/EEC, but not including truck cabins, - buses, defined as vehicles of categories M2 and M3 in Directive 70/156/EEC, - trailers, defined in categories O1, O2, O3 and O4 in Directive 70/156/EEC, - metallic and plastic surfaces including surfaces of airplanes, ships, trains, etc., - wooden surfaces, - textile, fabric, film and paper surfaces, - leather.It does not include the coating of substrate with metals by electrophoretic and chemical spraying techniques.

ANNEX III SOLVENT MANAGEMENT PLAN 1.
Emissions can be calculated according to the following equation: E = F + O1 where F is the fugitive emission as defined in section (ii)(a).
