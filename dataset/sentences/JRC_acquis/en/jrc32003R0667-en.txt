However, in that period no price quotations were registered for cows in that Member State and it is therefore appropriate instead to take account of the price evolution for such animals in neighbouring markets. (3) Consequently, the purchase price for cows should be reduced by 20 %, and the purchase price for other animals over 30 months, by 8 %.
It shall apply to animals purchased from 28 April 2003.
