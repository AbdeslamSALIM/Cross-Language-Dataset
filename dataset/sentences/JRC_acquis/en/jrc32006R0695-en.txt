Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%695/2006 of 5 May 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%397/2004 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of cotton-type bedlinen originating in Pakistan Council Regulation (EC) No 695/2006 of 5 May 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 397/2004 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of cotton-type bedlinen originating in Pakistan THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Previous investigation (1) By Regulation (EC) No 397/2004 [2] (the definitive Regulation), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 13,1 % on imports of bedlinen of cotton fibres, pure or mixed with man-made fibres or flax (flax not being the dominant fibre), bleached, dyed or printed, originating in Pakistan. (2) This measure had been imposed on the basis of facts available since it had been impossible to verify on spot the highly implausible figures reported in the questionnaires of the six sampled companies, due to the following circumstances.
In total, 110 companies replied to the sampling questionnaire within the time limits and provided the requested information.
In total, 98 companies were considered as cooperating. (10) The sample was selected in accordance with Article 17(1) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the largest representative volume of exports from Pakistan into the Community that could reasonably be investigated within the time available. (11) The Commission informed the Pakistani authorities and the associations of producers/exporters of its intention to select a sample of eight companies representing 31 % of Pakistan's exports to the Community.
Normal value (24) Normal value was calculated according to Article 2 of the basic Regulation.
Therefore, it was first established for each sampled exporting producer, whether its total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales of the product concerned to the Community.
In accordance with Article 2(2), first sentence, of the basic Regulation, the domestic sales of the like product were found to be representative for one of the sampled companies since the domestic sales volume of this company exceeded 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community. (25) In addition to the above exporter with representative domestic sales exceeding 5 % of its exports sales volume to the Community, three other sampled exporters had some domestic sales of the product concerned, which, however, only represented 2,2, 0,5 and 0,2 % respectively of the sales volume of the product concerned exported to the Community.
Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the volume of that product type sold on the domestic market to independent customers during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total volume of the identical and directly comparable product type sold for export to the Community. (27) It was subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of the company could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade.
For those product types where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, it was considered that normal value had to be constructed in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. (28) The company had contested that its sales were in the ordinary course of trade, claiming that remnants sold on the domestic market were not comparable with the products sold for export.
It is therefore considered that the company's domestic sales are representative and being made in the ordinary course of trade. (29) Normal value was constructed by adding to the manufacturing costs of the exported types a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative expenses (SG %amp% A) and for profit, in accordance with Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. (30) In this respect, the company claimed that SG %amp% A and profit should be established on the basis of all transactions, as due to the large diversity of the product (the company has submitted information regarding more than 500 different product types) it cannot reliably be established whether a certain transaction is profitable or not.
It was therefore considered that SG %amp% A and profit used to construct normal value should be established on the basis of all transactions for all domestic sales of the product concerned. (31) The Community industry challenged the approach adopted in respect of this company, claiming that only profitable transactions should have been used to determine the percentage of profit realised by the company in the ordinary course of trade.
For all these exporters, therefore, normal value was constructed by adding to the cost of manufacturing of each type exported to the Community, corrected where appropriate as further explained in recital 36, a reasonable amount for SG %amp% A expenses and for profit.
Neither could they be established under Article 2(6)(b) as the exporters concerned did not have representative sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the same general category of products. (33) The SG %amp% A expenses and profit were accordingly determined in accordance with Article 2(6)(c) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the weighted average of the SG %amp% A expenses incurred and profit realised by the sole company with representative domestic sales and of the two companies with domestic sales representing 2,2 and 0,2 % respectively.
Depending on the information available and verifiable, this percentage was applied either to the value of each of the cost items or to the total costs as reported in the audited accounts for the purpose of establishing the manufacturing costs of the product concerned. (38) For one company, the adjustment referred to in recital 37 was made to take account of the fact that there was a very significant difference between the cost structure of bedlinen and that of the other major product sold by the company, i.e.
However, this claim was rejected, since the attribution of costs mentioned in recital 38 was not based on the cost allocation provided by the company, but on verified accounting information prepared by the company on a regular basis. (40) For one company, a further adjustment has been made.
In accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, their export prices were therefore established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable by these independent customers in the Community. (46) The eighth sampled exporting producer had a related importer in the Community.
The prices for these exports were constructed on the basis of the prices at which the imported products were first resold to an independent buyer, as set out in Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. (47) However, as requested by a number of companies, export sales of outdated stocks and sales delivered by air freight (on a cif or cf basis) were excluded from the dumping calculations, as these sales were not made in the ordinary course of trade.
These sales represented a negligible portion (less than 2 %) of all export sales reported. (48) This approach regarding sales delivered by air freight and outdated stocks has been challenged by the Community industry, claiming that whether or not a sale is in the ordinary course of trade cannot be established by the means of conveyance of the goods and that these sales should be taken into account if they are a relatively common occurrence in the sector in question.
This claim was rejected because, although most companies had sales delivered by air freight and sales of outdated stocks, those sales are not a relatively common occurrence in the sector as the volumes delivered by air freight and the volumes of outdated stocks are extremely limited as described in recital 47. 3.
Comparison (49) For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between normal values and export prices, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
Dumping margins (56) For the sampled exporting producers, individual dumping margins were established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average export price, in accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. (57) The dumping margins, expressed as a percentage of the net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, are: Yunus Textile Mills, Karachi | 8,5 % | Lucky Textile Mills, Karachi | 7,2 % | Nishat Mills Limited, Faisalabad | 6,1 % | Chenab Limited, Faisalabad | 5,7 % | Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Ltd, Karachi | 5,6 % | Al-Abid Silk Mills Ltd, Karachi | 3,9 % | Mohammad Farooq Textile Mills Ltd, Karachi | 3,5 % | Fairdeal Textiles (Pvt) Ltd, Karachi | 1,3 % | (58) In accordance with Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation, it is concluded that the dumping margin for Fairdeal Textiles (Pvt) Ltd is de minimis, as its margin of dumping is below 2 %. (59) For the cooperating companies not selected in the sample, the dumping margin was established on the basis of the weighted average dumping margin of the companies selected in the sample, pursuant to Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation.
This weighted average dumping margin, expressed as a percentage of the net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, was 5,8 %. (60) Several cooperating exporters not selected in the sample claimed that it was discriminatory not to receive the lowest duty instead of the weighted average duty of the sampled companies.
It is noted that in this case, eight exporters were selected in the sample in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the basic Regulation.
In light of the above, this claim was rejected. (61) In order to determine the residual dumping margin, the level of cooperation was first established.
A comparison between Eurostat data concerning imports originating in Pakistan and sampling replies showed that the level of cooperation was high (more than 80 %).
Therefore, and since there were no indications that the remaining companies were dumping at a lower level, it was considered appropriate to set the dumping margin for the remaining companies, which had not cooperated in the investigation, at the level of the highest dumping margin found for the companies included in the sample.
Given the fact that the present interim review is limited to the examination of the dumping aspects, the level of duties imposed should not be higher than the injury levels found in the original investigation. (67) As mentioned in recital 134 of the definitive Regulation, the original dumping margin was lower than the injury elimination level definitely determined and therefore the definitive anti-dumping duty was based on the lower dumping margin, namely 13,1 %.
Since the dumping margins found in the present interim review are still lower than the injury margin, the amended anti-dumping duties should be based on these lower dumping margins. (68) Therefore, the level of duties should be set at that of the dumping margins found, except for one company, for which a de minimis dumping margin has been found as outlined in recital 58: (a)For the exporters in the sample: Yunus Textile Mills, Karachi | 8,5 % | Lucky Textile Mills, Karachi | 7,2 % | Nishat Mills Limited, Faisalabad | 6,1 % | Chenab Limited, Faisalabad | 5,7 % | Gul Ahmed Textile Mills Ltd, Karachi | 5,6 % | Al-Abid Silk Mills Ltd, Karachi | 3,9 % | Mohammad Farooq Textile Mills Ltd, Karachi | 3,5 % | Fairdeal Textiles (Pvt) Ltd, Karachi | 0 % | (b)For the cooperating exporters not included in the sample | 5,8 % | (c)For all other companies | 8,5 % | (69) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the amendment of the existing measures and were given an opportunity to comment.
The rate of the definitive antidumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, of products manufactured by the following companies shall be: Manufacturer | Rate of duty % | TARIC additional code | Yunus Textile Mills H-23/1, Landhi Industrial Area, Karachi | 8,5 | A698 | Lucky Textile Mills L-8, Block 21, F.
