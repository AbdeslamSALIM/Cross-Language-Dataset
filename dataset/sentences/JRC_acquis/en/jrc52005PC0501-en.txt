The basic Regulation does not foresee a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | Summary of the proposed action On 17 August 2004, the Commission initiated an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures in force in respect of imports of steel ropes and cables originating in the People’s Republic of China, India, South Africa and Ukraine.
Thereafter, it was found that circumvention of the original measures concerning imports from Ukraine and the PRC took place via respectively Moldova and via Morocco following investigations pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation.
Consequently, the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports originating in the Ukraine was extended to imports of the same steel ropes and cables consigned from Moldova[6].
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: Sampled Community producers: - BTS Drahtseile GmbH (Germany), - Cables y Alambres especiales, SA (Spain), - CASAR Drahtseilwerk Saar GmbH (Germany), - Manuel Rodrigues de Oliveira Sa %amp% Filhos, SA (Portugal), - Trefileurope (France).
Producer in the exporting country: - Usha Martin Ltd. (India).
Related importers in the Community : - Usha Martin UK (United Kingdom), - Usha Martin Scandinavia (Denmark).
Producer in the analogue country: - Celik Halat (Turkey). - The investigation regarding the continuation and/or recurrence of dumping and injury covered the period from 1st July 2003 to 30 June 2004 (‘investigation period’ or ‘IP’).
In cases where the volume of profitable sales of a product type represented 80% or less of the total sales volume of that type, or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10% or more of the total sales volume of that type. 32.
As far as the profit margin is concerned and since there was no co-operation from unrelated importers, it was considered that, in the absence of any other more reliable information, the same profit margin as was used in the original investigation, i.e. 5%, should be used.
For non-cooperating exporting producers, an assessment of the level of dumping was made based on data relating to normal value and export prices, as provided by the applicant in the review request.
As Poland has been a member of the European Union since 1 May 2004, it can no longer be used as an analogue country for the purpose of anti-dumping investigations.
The investigation showed that Turkey has a competitive market for SWR with two domestic producers supplying around 83 % of the market and competition from imports from other third countries.
Therefore, it was considered that the export price level to other third countries can be seen as an indicator as to the likely price level for export sales to the Community should measures be repealed.
In the absence of other information, based on the normal value of the co-operating exporter, these imports would be dumped at significantly high levels.
In this regard, it should be noted that it is very unlikely that the domestic market in India, due to the presence of eight competing producers, would be able to absorb all of the spare capacity of this exporting producer.
It was also considered that the export price level to the USA and to other third countries can be seen as an indicator as to the likely price level for export sales to the Community should measures be repealed.
As in the case of India, this is at least partly due to the fact that, during the IP, a minimum price undertaking was in force which required the exporting producer concerned to respect a certain price level for exports into the Community.
An analysis of the figures available revealed that the average export prices to these countries were significantly below the average export prices to the Community.
It was further found that export prices to other third countries were generally of a significant lower level than those to the Community market and that therefore the Community remained an attractive market for the exporting producers of all countries concerned.
The volume of imports originating in Mexico remained very limited since 2001 through the IP.
The volume of imports from Russia declined from 3 630 tonnes in 2001, corresponding to a market share of 1,9%, to 2 101 tonnes in the IP, corresponding to a market share of 1,2%.
The volume of imports from Thailand declined from 1 039 tonnes in 2001, corresponding to a market share of 0,5%, to 277 tonnes in the IP, corresponding to a market share of 0,2%.
The volume of imports from Turkey declined from 4 354 tonnes in 2001, corresponding to a market share of 2,2%, to 1 457 tonnes in the IP, corresponding to a market share of 0,8%.
Unit sales prices of the Community industry remained flat between 2001 and the IP, profitability improved to an almost breakeven situation in the IP, while return on investment and cash-flow improved as well.
Also, the Community industry improved its profit situation between 2001 and the IP.
