In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objectives. (6) It is appropriate to establish different amounts of initial capital depending on the range of activities that investment firms are authorised to undertake. (7) Existing investment firms should be permitted, under certain conditions, to continue their business even if they do not comply with the minimum amount of initial capital fixed for new investment firms. (8) Member States should be able to establish rules stricter than those provided for in this Directive. (9) The smooth operation of the internal market requires not only legal rules but also close and regular cooperation and significantly enhanced convergence of regulatory and supervisory practices between the competent authorities of the Member States. (10) The Commission Communication of 11 May 1999 entitled %quot%Implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan%quot% listed a number of goals that need to be achieved in order to complete the internal market in financial services.
The Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 set the goal of implementing the action plan by 2005.
This goal should, in particular, be kept in mind when the reviews referred to in recital 21 are carried out. (23) The existence of internal systems for monitoring and controlling interest-rate risks on all business of institutions is a particularly important way of minimising such risks.
Consequently, such systems should be supervised by the competent authorities. (24) Since Directive 2006/48/EC does not establish common rules for the monitoring and control of large exposures in activities which are principally subject to market risks, it is therefore appropriate to provide for such rules. (25) Operational risk is a significant risk faced by institutions and requires coverage by own funds.
A common framework for the introduction of the supervision of investment firms on a consolidated basis should therefore be provided for. (29) Institutions should ensure that they have internal capital which, having regard to the risks to which they are or might be exposed, is adequate in quantity, quality and distribution.
In this context the role of the consolidating supervisor should be strengthened. (34) In order for the internal market to operate with increasing effectiveness and for citizens of the Union to be afforded adequate levels of transparency, it is necessary that competent authorities disclose publicly and in a way which allows for meaningful comparison the manner in which the requirements of this Directive are implemented. (35) In order to strengthen market discipline and stimulate institutions to improve their market strategy, risk control and internal management organisation, appropriate public disclosures by institutions should be provided for. (36) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [7]. (37) In its Resolution of 5 February 2002 on the implementation of financial services legislation [8], the Parliament requested that the Parliament and the Council should have an equal role in supervising the way in which the Commission exercises its executive role in order to reflect the legislative powers of Parliament under Article 251 of the Treaty.
On 11 December 2002, the Commission proposed amendments to Decision 1999/468/EC and then submitted an amended proposal on 22 April 2004.
Member States shall apply the requirements of this Directive to investment firms and credit institutions as defined in Article 3. 2.
Subject to Articles 18, 20, 22 to 32, 34 and 39 of this Directive, Articles 68 to 73 of Directive 2006/48/EC shall apply mutatis mutandis to investment firms.
Where a credit institution has as a parent undertaking a parent investment firm in a Member State, only that parent investment firm shall be subject to requirements on a consolidated basis in accordance with Articles 71 to 73 of Directive 2006/48/EC.
Where an investment firm has as a parent undertaking a parent credit institution in a Member State, only that parent credit institution shall be subject to requirements on a consolidated basis in accordance with Articles 71 to 73 of Directive 2006/48/EC.
Where a financial holding company has as a subsidiary both a credit institution and an investment firm, requirements on the basis of the consolidated financial situation of the financial holding company shall apply to the credit institution. 2.
When a group covered by paragraph 1 does not include a credit institution, Directive 2006/48/EC shall apply, subject to the following: (a) every reference to credit institutions shall be construed as a reference to investment firms; (b) in Articles 125 and 140(2) of Directive 2006/48/EC, each reference to other articles of that Directive shall be construed as a reference to Directive 2004/39/EC; (c) for the purposes of Article 39(3) of Directive 2006/48/EC, references to the European Banking Committee shall be construed as references to the Council and the Commission; and (d) by way of derogation from Article 140(1) of Directive 2006/48/EC, where a group does not include a credit institution, the first sentence of that Article shall be replaced by the following: %quot%Where an investment firm, a financial holding company or a mixed-activity holding company controls one or more subsidiaries which are insurance companies, the competent authorities and the authorities entrusted with the public task of supervising insurance undertakings shall cooperate closely%quot%.
For the purposes of point (e), financial instruments shall include both primary financial instruments or cash instruments and derivative financial instruments the value of which is derived from the price of an underlying financial instrument, a rate, an index or the price of another underlying item, and include as a minimum the instruments specified in Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC. 2.
For the purposes of applying Directive 2006/48/EC to groups covered by Article 2(1) which do not include a credit institution, the following definitions shall apply: (a) %quot%financial holding company%quot% means a financial institution the subsidiary undertakings of which are either exclusively or mainly investment firms or other financial institutions, at least one of which is an investment firm, and which is not a mixed financial holding company within the meaning of Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate [9]; (b) %quot%mixed-activity holding company%quot% means a parent undertaking, other than a financial holding company or an investment firm or a mixed financial holding company within the meaning of Directive 2002/87/EC, the subsidiaries of which include at least one investment firm; and (c) %quot%competent authorities%quot% means the national authorities which are empowered by law or regulation to supervise investment firms.
CHAPTER II Initial capital Article 4 For the purposes of this Directive, %quot%initial capital%quot% shall be comprised of the items referred to in Article 57(a) and (b) of Directive 2006/48/EC.
The competent authorities may allow an investment firm which executes investors' orders for financial instruments to hold such instruments for its own account if the following conditions are met: (a) such positions arise only as a result of the firm's failure to match investors' orders precisely; (b) the total market value of all such positions is subject to a ceiling of 15 % of the firm's initial capital; (c) the firm meets the requirements laid down in Articles 18, 20 and 28; and (d) such positions are incidental and provisional in nature and strictly limited to the time required to carry out the transaction in question.
Member States may reduce the amount referred to in paragraph 1 to EUR 50000 where a firm is not authorised to hold clients' money or securities, to deal for its own account, or to underwrite issues on a firm commitment basis.
Article 6 Local firms shall have initial capital of EUR 50000 insofar as they benefit from the freedom of establishment or to provide services specified in Articles 31 and 32 of Directive 2004/39/EC.
Article 7 Coverage for the firms referred to in Article 3(1)(b)(iii) shall take one of the following forms: (a) initial capital of EUR 50000; (b) professional indemnity insurance covering the whole territory of the Community or some other comparable guarantee against liability arising from professional negligence, representing at least EUR 1000000 applying to each claim and in aggregate EUR 1500000 per year for all claims; or (c) a combination of initial capital and professional indemnity insurance in a form resulting in a level of coverage equivalent to that referred to in points (a) or (b).
Article 9 All investment firms other than those referred to in Articles 5 to 8 shall have initial capital of EUR 730000.
In certain specific circumstances, and with the approval of the competent authorities, in the event of a merger of two or more investment firms and/or firms covered by Article 6, the own funds of the firm produced by the merger need not attain the level specified in Articles 5(1), 5(3), 6 and 9.
Nevertheless, during any period when the level specified in Articles 5(1), 5(3), 6 and 9 has not been attained, the own funds of the new firm may not fall below the merged firms' total own funds at the time of the merger. 4.
CHAPTER III Trading book Article 11 1.
Subject to paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article and Articles 14 to 17, the own funds of investment firms and credit institutions shall be determined in accordance with Directive 2006/48/EC.
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the competent authorities may permit those institutions which are obliged to meet the capital requirements calculated in accordance with Articles 21 and 28 to 32 and Annexes I and III to VI to use, for that purpose only, an alternative determination of own funds.
Such an alternative determination shall be the sum of the items set out in points (a) to (c) of this subparagraph, minus the item set out in point (d), with the deduction of that last item being left to the discretion of the competent authorities: (a) own funds as defined in Directive 2006/48/EC, excluding only points (l) to (p) of Article 57 of that Directive for those investment firms which are required to deduct item (d) of this paragraph from the total of items (a) to (c); (b) an institution's net trading-book profits net of any foreseeable charges or dividends, less net losses on its other business, provided that none of those amounts has already been included in item (a) of this paragraph as one of the items set out in points (b) or (k) of Article 57 of Directive 2006/48/EC; (c) subordinated loan capital and/or the items referred to in paragraph 5 of this Article, subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article and in Article 14; and (d) illiquid assets as specified in Article 15. 3.

The subordinated loan capital referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 may not exceed a maximum of 150 % of the original own funds left to meet the requirements calculated in accordance with Articles 21 and 28 to 32 and Annexes I to VI and may approach that maximum only in particular circumstances acceptable to the competent authorities. 5.
The competent authorities may permit investment firms to exceed the ceiling for subordinated loan capital set out in Article 13(4) if they judge it prudentially adequate and provided that the total of such subordinated loan capital and the items referred to in Article 13(5) does not exceed 200 % of the original own funds left to meet the requirements calculated in accordance with Articles 21 and 28 to 32 and Annexes I and III to VI, or 250 % of the same amount where investment firms deduct the item set out in Article 13(2)(d) when calculating own funds. 2.
The competent authorities may permit the ceiling for subordinated loan capital set out in Article 13(4) to be exceeded by a credit institution if they judge it prudentially adequate and provided that the total of such subordinated loan capital and points (d) to (h) of Article 57 of Directive 2006/48/EC does not exceed 250 % of the original own funds left to meet the requirements calculated in accordance with Articles 28 to 32 and Annexes I and III to VI to this Directive.

Article 16 Investment firms included in a group which has been granted the waiver provided for in Article 22 shall calculate their own funds in accordance with Articles 13 to 15, subject to the following: (a) the illiquid assets referred to in Article 13(2)(d) shall be deducted; (b) the exclusion referred to in point (a) of Article 13(2) shall not cover those components of points (l) to (p) of Article 57 of Directive 2006/48/EC which an investment firm holds in respect of undertakings included in the scope of consolidation as defined in Article 2(1) of this Directive; (c) the limits referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 66(1) of Directive 2006/48/EC shall be calculated with reference to the original own funds less the components of points (l) to (p) of Article 57 of that Directive as referred to in point (b) of this Article which are elements of the original own funds of those undertakings; and (d) the components of points (l) to (p) of Article 57 of Directive 2006/48/EC referred to in point (c) of this Article shall be deducted from the original own funds rather than from the total of all items as laid down in Article 66(2) of that Directive for the purposes in particular of Articles 13(4), 13(5) and 14 of this Directive.
Where an institution calculates risk-weighted exposure amounts for the purposes of Annex II to this Directive in accordance with Articles 84 to 89 of Directive 2006/48/EC, then for the purposes of the calculation provided for in point 4 of Part 1 of Annex VII to Directive 2006/48/EC, the following shall apply: (a) value adjustments made to take account of the credit quality of the counterparty may be included in the sum of value adjustments and provisions made for the exposures indicated in Annex II; and (b) subject to the approval of the competent authorities, if the credit risk of the counterparty is adequately taken into account in the valuation of a position included in the trading book, the expected loss amount for the counterparty risk exposure shall be zero.
For the purposes of this Article, Article 153 and 154 of Directive 2006/48/EC shall apply.

The Commission shall be assisted by the European Banking Committee established by Commission Decision 2004/10/EC [12] of 5 November 2003 (hereinafter referred to as %quot%the Committee%quot%). 2.
The period laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be three months. 3.
Article 44 Until 31 December 2012, for investment firms the relevant indicator for the trading and sales business line of which represents at least 50 % of the total of relevant indicators for all of their business lines calculated in accordance with Article 20 of this Directive and points 1 to 4 of Part 2 of Annex X to Directive 2006/48/EC, Member States may apply a percentage of 15 % to the business line %quot%trading and sales%quot%.
Competent authorities may permit investment firms to exceed the limits concerning large exposures set out in Article 111 of Directive 2006/48/EC.
This discretion is available until 31 December 2010 or the date of entry into force of any modifications consequent to the treatment of large exposures pursuant to Article 119 of Directive 2006/48/EC, whichever is the earlier.
For this discretion to be exercised, the following conditions shall be met: (a) the investment firm provides investment services or investment activities related to the financial instruments listed in points 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC; (b) the investment firm does not provide such investment services or undertake such investment activities for, or on behalf of, retail clients; c) breaches of the limits referred to in the introductory part of this paragraph arise in connection with exposures resulting from contracts that are financial instruments as listed in point (a) and relate to commodities or underlyings within the meaning of point 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC (MiFID) and are calculated in accordance with Annexes III and IV of Directive 2006/48/EC, or in connection with exposures resulting from contracts concerning the delivery of commodities or emission allowances; and (d) the investment firm has a documented strategy for managing and, in particular, for controlling and limiting risks arising from the concentration of exposures.
These arrangements shall enable the investment firm to react adequately and sufficiently promptly to any deterioration in that creditworthiness. 2.
Article 46 By way of derogation from Article 20(1), until 31 December 2011 competent authorities may choose, on a case-by-case basis, not to apply the capital requirements arising from point (d) of Article 75 of Directive 2006/48/EC in respect of investment firms to which Article 20(2) and (3) do not apply, whose total trading book positions never exceed EUR 50 million and whose average number of relevant employees during the financial year does not exceed 100.
Instead, the capital requirement in relation to those investment firms shall be at least the lower of: (a) the capital requirements arising from point (d) of Article 75 of Directive 2006/48/EC; and b) 12/88 of the higher of the following: (i) the sum of the capital requirements contained in points (a) to (c) of Article 75 of Directive 2006/48/EC; and (ii) the amount laid down in Article 21 of this Directive, notwithstanding Article 20(5).
Applying this derogation shall not result in a reduction in the overall level of capital requirements for an investment firm, in comparison to the requirements as at 31 December 2006, unless such a reduction is prudentially justified by a reduction in the size of the investment firm's business.
The provisions on capital requirements as laid down in this Directive and Directive 2006/48/EC shall not apply to investment firms whose main business consists exclusively of the provision of investment services or activities in relation to the financial instruments set out in points 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC and to whom Directive 93/22/EEC [13] did not apply on 31 December 2006.
As part of the review required by Article 65(3) of Directive 2004/39/EC, the Commission shall, on the basis of public consultations and in the light of discussions with the competent authorities, report to the Parliament and the Council on: (a) an appropriate regime for the prudential supervision of investment firms whose main business consists exclusively of the provision of investment services or activities in relation to the commodity derivatives or derivatives contracts set out in points 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC; and (b) the desirability of amending Directive 2004/39/EC to create a further category of investment firm whose main business consists exclusively of the provision of investment services or activities in relation to the financial instruments set out in points 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC relating to energy supplies (including electricity, coal, gas and oil). 3.
Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2006, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with Articles 2, 3, 11, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 44, 50 and the Annexes I, II, III, V, VII.
Article 152(8) to (14) of Directive 2006/48/EC shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purposes of this Directive subject to the following provisions which shall apply where the discretion referred to in Article 152(8) of Directive 2006/48/EC is exercised: (a) references in point 7 of Annex II to this Directive to Directive 2006/48/EC shall be read as references to Directive 2000/12/EC as that Directive stood prior to 1 January 2007; and (b) point 4 of Annex II to this Directive shall apply as it stood prior to 1 January 2007. 2.
Article 157(3) of Directive 2006/48/EC shall apply mutatis mutandis for the purposes of Articles 18 and 20 of this Directive.
Article 52 Directive 93/6/EEC, as amended by the Directives listed in Annex VIII, Part A, is repealed, without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex VIII, Part B.
Article 53 This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Directive as last amended by Directive 2002/87/EC. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX I CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION RISK GENERAL PROVISIONS Netting 1.
Particular instruments 4.
Similarly a sold FRA will be treated as a long position with a maturity date equal to the settlement date plus the contract period, and a short position with maturity equal to the settlement date.
Both the borrowing and the asset holding shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in point 14 in order to calculate the capital required against specific risk for interest‐rate futures and FRAs.
The borrowing shall be included in the first category set out in Table 1 in point 14 for purposes of specific risk, and the debt instrument under whichever column is appropriate for it in the same table.
The competent authorities may allow the capital requirement for an exchange‐traded future to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the future and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for a future that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V.
For the purposes of this point, %quot%long position%quot% means a position in which an institution has fixed the interest rate it will receive at some time in the future, and %quot%short position%quot% means a position in which it has fixed the interest rate it will pay at some time in the future. 5.
The competent authorities may allow the requirement against a written exchange‐traded option to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the option and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement against an option that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V.
The competent authorities may also allow the capital requirement for an OTC option cleared by a clearing house recognised by them to be equal to the margin required by the clearing house if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the option and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for an OTC option that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V.
The requirement against a written OTC option shall be set in relation to the instrument underlying it. 6.
Thus, an interest‐rate swap under which an institution receives floating‐rate interest and pays fixed‐rate interest shall be treated as equivalent to a long position in a floating‐rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed‐rate instrument with the same maturity as the swap itself.
Specific and general risks 12.
The first shall be its specific‐risk component — this is the risk of a price change in the instrument concerned due to factors related to its issuer or, in the case of a derivative, the issuer of the underlying instrument.
The second component shall cover its general risk — this is the risk of a price change in the instrument due (in the case of a traded debt instrument or debt derivative) to a change in the level of interest rates or (in the case of an equity or equity derivative) to a broad equity‐market movement unrelated to any specific attributes of individual securities.
Specific risk 14.
Other qualifying items as defined in point 15. | 0,25 % (residual term to final maturity 6 months or less) 1,00 % (residual term to final maturity greater than 6 and up to and including 24 months) 1,60 % (residual term to final maturity exceeding 24 months) | Debt securities issued or guaranteed by central governments, issued by central banks, international organisations, multilateral development banks or Member States' regional governments or local authorities or institutions which would qualify for credit quality step 4 or 5 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures under Articles 78 to 83 of Directive 2006/48/EC, and debt securities issued or guaranteed by institutions which would qualify for credit quality step 3 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures under point 26 of Part 1 of Annex VI to Directive 2006/48/EC, and debt securities issued or guaranteed by corporates which would qualify for credit quality step 3 or 4 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures under Articles 78 to 83 of Directive 2006/48/EC.
Exposures for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available. | 8,00 % | Debt securities issued or guaranteed by central governments, issued by central banks, international organisations, multilateral development banks or Member States' regional governments or local authorities or institutions which would qualify for credit quality step 6 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures under Articles 78 to 83 of Directive 2006/48/EC, and debt securities issued or guaranteed by corporates which would qualify for credit quality step 5 or 6 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures under Articles 78 to 83 of Directive 2006/48/EC. | 12,00 % | For institutions which apply the rules for the risk weighting of exposures under Articles 84 to 89 of Directive 2006/48/EC, to qualify for a credit quality step the obligor of the exposure shall have an internal rating with a PD equivalent to or lower than that associated with the appropriate credit quality step under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to corporates under Articles 78 to 83 of that Directive.
Instruments issued by a non-qualifying issuer shall receive a specific risk capital charge of 8 % or 12 % according to Table 1.
Competent authorities may require institutions to apply a higher specific risk charge to such instruments and/or to disallow offsetting for the purposes of defining the extent of general market risk between such instruments and any other debt instruments.
Unrated liquidity facilities shall be subject to a capital charge that is no less than that set out in Part 4 of Annex IX to Directive 2006/48/EC. 15. (a) long and short positions in assets qualifying for a credit quality step corresponding at least to investment grade in the mapping process described in Title V, Chapter 2, Section 3, Sub‐section 1 of Directive 2006/48/EC; (b) long and short positions in assets which, because of the solvency of the issuer, have a PD which is not higher than that of the assets referred to under (a), under the approach described in Title V, Chapter 2, Section 3, Sub‐section 2 of Directive 2006/48/EC; (c) (i) they are considered by the institutions concerned to be sufficiently liquid; (ii) their investment quality is, according to the institution's own discretion, at least equivalent to that of the assets referred to under point (a); and (iii) they are listed on at least one regulated market in a Member State or on a stock exchange in a third country provided that the exchange is recognised by the competent authorities of the relevant Member State; (d) long and short positions in assets issued by institutions subject to the capital adequacy requirements set out in Directive 2006/48/EC which are considered by the institutions concerned to be sufficiently liquid and whose investment quality is, according to the institution's own discretion, at least equivalent to that of the assets referred to under point (a); and (e) securities issued by institutions that are deemed to be of equivalent, or higher, credit quality than those associated with credit quality step 2 under the rules for the risk weighting of exposures to institutions set out in Articles 78 to 83 of Directive 2006/48/EC and that are subject to supervisory and regulatory arrangements comparable to those under this Directive.
The amount of the former which are matched by the latter in a given maturity band shall be the matched weighted position in that band, while the residual long or short position shall be the unmatched weighted position for the same band.
Table 2 Zone | Maturity band | Weighting (in %) | Assumed interest rate change (in %) | Coupon of 3 % or more | Coupon of less than 3 % | One | 0 ≤ 1 month | 0 ≤ 1 month | 0,00 | — | %gt% 1 ≤ 3 months | %gt% 1 ≤ 3 months | 0,20 | 1,00 | %gt% 3 ≤ 6 months | %gt% 3 ≤ 6 months | 0,40 | 1,00 | %gt% 6 ≤ 12 months | %gt% 6 ≤ 12 months | 0,70 | 1,00 | Two | %gt% 1 ≤ 2 years | %gt% 1,0 ≤ 1,9 years | 1,25 | 0,90 | %gt% 2 ≤ 3 years | %gt% 1,9 ≤ 2,8 years | 1,75 | 0,80 | %gt% 3 ≤ 4 years | %gt% 2,8 ≤ 3,6 years | 2,25 | 0,75 | Three | %gt% 4 ≤ 5 years | %gt% 3,6 ≤ 4,3 years | 2,75 | 0,75 | %gt% 5 ≤ 7 years | %gt% 4,3 ≤ 5,7 years | 3,25 | 0,70 | %gt% 7 ≤ 10 years | %gt% 5,7 ≤ 7,3 years | 3,75 | 0,65 | %gt% 10 ≤ 15 years | %gt% 7,3 ≤ 9,3 years | 4,50 | 0,60 | %gt% 15 ≤ 20 years | %gt% 9,3 ≤ 10,6 years | 5,25 | 0,60 | %gt% 20 years | %gt% 10,6 ≤ 12,0 years | 6,00 | 0,60 | | %gt% 12,0 ≤ 20,0 years | 8,00 | 0,60 | | %gt% 20 years | 12,50 | 0,60 | 21.
The institution may, if it wishes, reverse the order in point 21 so as to calculate the matched weighted position between zones two and three before calculating that position between zones one and two. 23.
The competent authorities may allow institutions in general or on an individual basis to use a system for calculating the capital requirement for the general risk on traded debt instruments which reflects duration, instead of the system set out in points 17 to 25, provided that the institution does so on a consistent basis. 27.
The institution shall then calculate the modified duration of each debt instrument on the basis of the following formula: modified duration = ((duration (D))/(1 + r)), where: D = Σt=1mt Ct/1+rt/Σt=1mCt/1+rt where: R = yield to maturity (see point 25), Ct = cash payment in time t, M = total maturity (see point 25). 29.
Table 3 Zone | Modified duration (in years) | Assumed interest (change in %) | One | %gt% 0 ≤ 1,0 | 1,0 | Two | %gt% 1,0 ≤ 3,6 | 0,85 | Three | %gt% 3,6 | 0,7 | 30.
The institution shall then calculate the duration‐weighted position for each instrument by multiplying its market price by its modified duration and by the assumed interest‐rate change for an instrument with that particular modified duration (see column 3 in Table 3). 31.
The institution shall calculate its duration-weighted long and its duration-weighted short positions within each zone.
The amount of the former which are matched by the latter within each zone shall be the matched duration‐weighted position for that zone.
Specific risk 34.
For the purpose of point (c), the competent authorities may authorise individual positions of up to 10 % provided that the total of such positions does not exceed 50 % of the portfolio.
General risk 36.
Its capital requirement against general risk shall be its overall net position multiplied by 8 %.
The competent authorities shall ensure that any institution which has netted off its positions in one or more of the equities constituting a stock-index future against one or more positions in the stock‐index future itself has adequate capital to cover the risk of loss caused by the future's values not moving fully in line with that of its constituent equities; they shall also do this when an institution holds opposite positions in stock‐index futures which are not identical in respect of either their maturity or their composition or both. 39.
By derogation from points 37 and 38, stock-index futures which are exchange traded and — in the opinion of the competent authorities — represent broadly diversified indices shall attract a capital requirement against general risk of 8 %, but no capital requirement against specific risk.
Such stock‐index futures shall be included in the calculation of the overall net position in point 33, but disregarded in the calculation of the overall gross position in the same point. 40.
UNDERWRITING 41.
Table 4 working day 0: | 100 % | working day 1: | 90 % | working days 2 to 3: | 75 % | working day 4: | 50 % | working day 5: | 25 % | after working day 5: | 0 %. | %quot%Working day zero%quot% shall be the working day on which the institution becomes unconditionally committed to accepting a known quantity of securities at an agreed price.
An 80 % offset will be applied when the value of two legs always move in the opposite direction and where there is an exact match in terms of the reference obligation, the maturity of both the reference obligation and the credit derivative, and the currency of the underlying exposure.
In all situations not falling under points 43 to 45, a specific risk capital charge will be assessed against both sides of the positions.
Without prejudice to other provisions in this section, positions in CIUs shall be subject to a capital requirement for position risk (specific and general) of 32 %.
Institutions may determine the capital requirement for positions in CIUs which meet the criteria set out in point 51, by the methods set out in points 53 to 56. 50.
SPECIFIC METHODS 53.
Where the institution is aware of the underlying investments of the CIU on a daily basis, the institution may look through to those underlying investments in order to calculate the capital requirements for position risk (general and specific) for those positions in accordance with the methods set out in this Annex or, if permission has been granted, in accordance with the methods set out in Annex V.
Institutions may rely on a third party to calculate and report capital requirements for position risk (general and specific) for positions in CIUs falling under points 53 and 55, in accordance with the methods set out in this Annex, provided that the correctness of the calculation and the report is adequately ensured. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX II CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMETNS FOR SETTLEMENT AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK SETTLEMENT/DELIVERY RISK 1.
Alternatively, institutions using the approach set out in Articles 84 to 89 of Directive 2006/48/EC may apply the risk weights, as set out in Articles 78 to 83 of that Directive provided that they apply them to all such exposures or may apply a 100 % risk weight to all such exposures.
Subject to the provisions of points 7 to 10, exposure values and risk‐weighted exposure amounts for such exposures shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of Chapter 2 of Title V of Directive 2006/48/EC with references to %quot%credit institutions%quot% in that Section interpreted as references to %quot%institutions%quot%, references to %quot%parent credit institutions%quot% interpreted as references to %quot%parent institutions%quot%, and with concomitant terms interpreted accordingly. 7.
For the purposes of point 6: Annex IV to Directive 2006/48/EC shall be considered to be amended to include point 8 of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2004/39/EC; Annex III to Directive 2006/48/EC shall be considered to be amended to include, after the footnotes of Table 1, the following text: - where the reference obligation is one that if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution it would be a qualifying item for the purposes of Annex I: 5 %; and - where the reference obligation is one that if it gave rise to a direct exposure of the institution it would not be a qualifying item for the purposes of Annex I: 10 %.
However, in the case of a credit default swap, an institution the exposure of which arising from the swap represents a long position in the underlying shall be permitted to use a figure of 0 % for potential future credit exposure, unless the credit default swap is subject to closeout upon the insolvency of the entity the exposure of which arising from the swap represents a short position in the underlying, even though the underlying has not defaulted.%quot%.
Where a credit derivative included in the trading book forms part of an internal hedge and the credit protection is recognised under Directive 2006/48/EC, there shall be deemed not to be counterparty risk arising from the position in the credit derivative. 12.
The capital requirement shall be 8 % of the total risk‐weighted exposure amounts. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX III CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FOREIGN-EXCHANGE RISK 1.
For the purposes of the calculation referred to in the first paragraph, in respect of CIUs the actual foreign exchange positions of the CIU shall be taken into account.
The assumed position of the CIU in foreign exchange shall be treated as a separate currency according to the treatment of investments in gold, subject to the modification that, if the direction of the CIU's investment is available, the total long position may be added to the total long open foreign exchange position and the total short position may be added to the total short open foreign exchange position.
The own‐funds requirement on the matched position in two closely correlated currencies shall be 4 % multiplied by the value of the matched position.
The capital requirement on unmatched positions in closely correlated currencies, and all positions in other currencies, shall be 8 %, multiplied by the higher of the sum of the net short or the net long positions in those currencies after the removal of matched positions in closely correlated currencies. 3.2.
Unmatched positions in those currencies shall be treated in the same way as other currencies.
By derogation from the first paragraph, the competent authorities may allow the capital requirement on the matched positions in currencies of Member States participating in the second stage of the economic and monetary union to be 1,6 %, multiplied by the value of such matched positions. 4.
Net positions in composite currencies may be broken down into the component currencies according to the quotas in force. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX IV CALCULATING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COMMODITIES RISK 1.
The interest‐rate and foreign‐exchange risks not covered by other provisions of this Annex shall be included in the calculation of general risk for traded debt instruments and in the calculation of foreign‐exchange risk. 5.
For the purpose of point 19, the excess of an institution's long (short) positions over its short (long) positions in the same commodity and identical commodity futures, options and warrants shall be its net position in each commodity.
The competent authorities shall allow positions in derivative instruments to be treated, as laid down in points 8, 9 and 10, as positions in the underlying commodity. 7.
Particular instruments 8.
The competent authorities may allow the capital requirement for an exchange‐traded future to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the future and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for a future that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V.
The competent authorities may also allow the capital requirement for an OTC commodity derivatives contract of the type referred to in this point cleared by a clearing house recognised by them to be equal to the margin required by the clearing house if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the derivatives contract and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for the contract in question that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V. 9.
Commodity swaps where one side of the transaction is a fixed price and the other the current market price shall be incorporated into the maturity ladder approach, as set out in points 13 to 18, as a series of positions equal to the notional amount of the contract, with one position corresponding with each payment on the swap and slotted into the maturity ladder set out in Table 1 to point 13.
Options on commodities or on commodity derivatives shall be treated as if they were positions equal in value to the amount of the underlying to which the option refers, multiplied by its delta for the purposes of this Annex.
The competent authorities may allow the requirement for a written exchange‐traded commodity option to be equal to the margin required by the exchange if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the option and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement against an option that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V.
The competent authorities may also allow the capital requirement for an OTC commodity option cleared by a clearing house recognised by them to be equal to the margin required by the clearing house if they are fully satisfied that it provides an accurate measure of the risk associated with the option and that it is at least equal to the capital requirement for an OTC option that would result from a calculation made using the method set out in the remainder of this Annex or applying the internal models method described in Annex V.
The requirement for a written OTC option shall be set in relation to the commodity underlying it. 11.

The competent authorities may, subject to the conditions laid down in this Annex, allow institutions to calculate their capital requirements for position risk, foreign‐exchange risk and/or commodities risk using their own internal risk‐management models instead of or in combination with the methods described in Annexes I, III and IV.
The institution shall also meet the following conditions: - where an institution is subject to event risk that is not reflected in its value‐at‐risk measure, because it is beyond the 10-day holding period and 99 percent confidence interval (low probability and high severity events), the institution shall ensure that the impact of such events is factored in to its internal capital assessment; and - the institution's internal model shall conservatively assess the risk arising from less liquid positions and positions with limited price transparency under realistic market scenarios.
The institution shall demonstrate that its approach meets soundness standards comparable to the approach set out in Articles 84 to 89 of Directive 2006/48/EC, under the assumption of a constant level of risk, and adjusted where appropriate to reflect the impact of liquidity, concentrations, hedging and optionality.
An institution that does not capture the incremental default risk through an internally developed approach shall calculate the surcharge through an approach consistent with the either the approach set out in Articles 78 to 83 of Directive 2006/48/EC or the approach set out in Articles 84 to 89 of that Directive.
For the purposes of point 9(b), the results of the institution's own calculation shall be scaled up by a multiplication factor of at least 3. 8.
Table 1 Number of overshootings | Plus-factor | Fewer than 5 | 0,00 | 5 | 0,40 | 6 | 0,50 | 7 | 0,65 | 8 | 0,75 | 9 | 0,85 | 10 or more | 1,00 | The competent authorities may, in individual cases and owing to an exceptional situation, waive the requirement to increase the multiplication factor by the %quot%plus‐factor%quot% in accordance with Table 1, if the institution has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authorities that such an increase is unjustified and that the model is basically sound.
Each institution must meet a capital requirement expressed as the higher of: (a) its previous day's value‐at‐risk measure according to the parameters specified in this Annex plus, where appropriate, the incremental default risk charge required under point 5; or (b) an average of the daily value‐at‐risk measures on each of the preceding 60 business days, multiplied by the factor mentioned in point 7, adjusted by the factor referred to in point 8 plus, where appropriate, the incremental default risk charge required under point 5. 10.
Interest rate risk The risk‐measurement system shall incorporate a set of risk factors corresponding to the interest rates in each currency in which the institution has interest rate sensitive on- or off‐balance sheet positions.
Foreign-exchange risk The risk‐measurement system shall incorporate risk factors corresponding to gold and to the individual foreign currencies in which the institution's positions are denominated.
The excess referred to in Article 31(b) shall be calculated by selecting those components of the total trading exposure to the client or group of clients in question which attract the highest specific‐risk requirements in Annex I and/or requirements in Annex II, the sum of which equals the amount of the excess referred to in Article 31(a). 2.
Table 1 Excess over the limits (on the basis of a percentage of own funds) | Factors | Up to 40 % | 200 % | From 40 % to 60 % | 300 % | From 60 % to 80 % | 400 % | From 80 % to 100 % | 500 % | From 100 % to 250 % | 600 % | Over 250 % | 900 % | -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX VII TRADING Part A Trading Intent 1.
Part B Systems and Controls 1.
Prudent Valuation Methods 3.
General standards 9.
When valuation adjustments/reserves give rise to material losses of the current financial year, these shall be deducted from an institution's original own funds according to point (k) of Article 57 of Directive 2006/48/EC 14.
Part C Internal Hedges 1.
Where such third party protection is purchased and is recognised as a hedge of a non-trading book exposure for the purposes of calculating capital requirements, neither the internal nor external credit derivative hedge shall be included in the trading book for the purposes of calculating capital requirements.
Part D Inclusion In The Trading Book 1.
Institutions shall have clearly defined policies and procedures for determining which position to include in the trading book for the purposes of calculating their capital requirements, consistent with the criteria set out in Article 11 and taking into account the institution's risk management capabilities and practices.
At a minimum these policies and procedures shall address: (a) the activities the institution considers to be trading and as constituting part of the trading book for capital requirement purposes; (b) the extent to which a position can be marked‐to‐market daily by reference to an active, liquid two-way market; (c) for positions that are marked‐to‐model, the extent to which the institution can: (i) identify all material risks of the position; (ii) hedge all material risks of the position with instruments for which an active, liquid two‐way market exists; and (iii) derive reliable estimates for the key assumptions and parameters used in the model; (d) the extent to which the institution can, and is required to, generate valuations for the position that can be validated externally in a consistent manner; (e) the extent to which legal restrictions or other operational requirements would impede the institution's ability to effect a liquidation or hedge of the position in the short term; (f) the extent to which the institution can, and is required to, actively risk manage the position within its trading operation; and (g) the extent to which the institution may transfer risk or positions between the non‐trading and trading books and the criteria for such transfers. 3.
Regardless of where they are booked, all repo‐style transactions are subject to a non‐trading book counterparty credit risk charge. -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX VIII
