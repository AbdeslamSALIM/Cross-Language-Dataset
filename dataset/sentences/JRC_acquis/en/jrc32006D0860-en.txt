ZUB 123 For information only, systems not used in Member States: 24.
ZUB 121 ALSN Automatic locomotive signalling of continues operation Автоматическая Локомотивная Сигнализация Непрерывного действия (original Russian name), Description: ALSN is a system of in-cab signalling and train auto-stop equipment.
The system is intended to operate with train movement speed up to 160 km/h.
ASFA is found on all lines being considered for Interoperability.
Main Characteristics: - Data transmission to trains: - 75 Hz Carrier frequency - AM modulated speed codes - 6 speed codes (40, 60,80,130,140) km/hr - 1 exit code - No train characteristics on board (Speed code from wayside) - Display to driver: - Speed corresponding to speed code - Gong in case of code change - Bell in case the system requests brake application - Supervision: - Speed (continuous) - Reaction: The emergency brake is called in the case of overspeed and the driver does not react to an acoustic warning.
Description: ATP-VR/RHK system in Finland is a fail safe standard ATP system, which is based either on technology of Ebicab 900 with JGA balises or on technology of ATSS with Mini-transponder balises.
The data transmission is between passive track side balises (2 per balise point) and on-board antenna underneath vehicle which also supplies the balise with energy when passing.
System calculates brake curves to every target point and indicates the most restrictive information to driver: - Maximum line speed or maximum train speed - %quot%Expect danger%quot% beyond 2-3 blocks - Supervision speed at signal with stop aspect - Speed restriction - Speed restriction in curves for traditional train and train with tilting body - Train specific restrictions - Speed restrictions in switches - Speed after switch - Authorised passing of signal at stop, 50 km/h supervised until next main signal - Speed after balise fault - Other functions: - Shunting - Roll away protection - Slip compensation - Reaction: - Supervision of speed limit: audible warning at 3 km/h over-speed (higher speeds: at 5 km/h over-speed), service brake 5 km/h after warning. - Supervision of target point: System calculates brake curves which functions are audible prompt to apply brake, continuous audible prompt to apply more brake and service brake by system.
System will brake sufficiently regardless of driver action. - Emergency brake applied by system if permitted speed exceeded by 15 km/h, by passing emergency brake curve or service brake is out of order.
Coded track circuits are installed on all high density Dublin Suburban routes and on Intercity routes to Cork, Limerick, Athlone and as far as border with UK towards Belfast.
Main Characteristics: (Dublin Suburban Electrified Area) - 83 1/3 Hz carrier frequency. - pulsed square wave codes 50, 75, 120, 180, 270 and 420 CPM.
On all lines under consideration for Interoperability Crocodile is found.
The data transmission is between passive track side balises (2 to 5 per signal) and an on-board antenna underneath the vehicle which also supplies the balise with energy when passing.
The data transmission is between passive track side balises (2 to 4 per signal) and an on-board antenna underneath the vehicle which also supplies the balise with energy when passing.
These lines are under consideration for interoperability.
The carrier frequency is coded by 100 % amplitude modulation m using electronic encoder.
Implemented as 99 % on conventional lines.
The data transmission is between passive track-side balises (2 to 9 per signal) and an on-board antenna underneath the vehicle which also supplies the balise with energy when passing.
This is done by a shift frequency modulation (FSK) with two carriers Fp at 20 KHz and 25 KHz (one for each track).
The data to transmit are of binary type, in groups of 80 bits (64 are useful).
The transmission of a bit set to %quot%1%quot% is made b the emission of the frequency Fp + 692 Hz, the transmission of one bit set to %quot%0%quot% is made by the emission of the frequency Fp — 750 Hz.
These lines are under consideration for interoperability.
The carrier frequency is coded by 100 % amplitude modulation.
LZB is also installed on lines in Austria and Spain.
The MEMOR II+ is complementary to the Crocodile system.
Main Characteristics: - Trackside DC powered bars (± 12 to +/- 20 V) - On board, no input of train characteristics by the driver, only one predefined speed curve stored on board. - Supervision: In case of caution signals or signals indicating speed restrictions, one positive trigger starts speed supervision, supervision of time and speed values for a certain distance compared to the stored speed curve.
The on-board equipment is able to manage in a co-ordinated way information coming from the different sources.
The system consists of track-side balises and encoders, and an on-board antenna which also supplies the balise with energy when passing.
Three types of balises are foreseen, all using the same frequencies for up- and downlink, but with different capacity: - Energising frequency: - 27,115 MHz - Data transmission to trains: - 4,5 MHz - 12/180 bit ASK Modulation - 1023 bit FSK Modulation - Train characteristics: Fixed train characteristics are loaded in maintenance facilities, while data depending on train composition are inserted by the driver.
The on-board equipment LZB 80 (Spain) can also process SELCAB information.
The vigilance system is also protecting against uncontrolled vehicle movement (sliding) with speed above 10 % of the vehicle maximal allowed speed.
The emergency brake can be released under special conditions.
After 16 s signal lamp is activated and driver confirmation is required with the same timing as in SHP function.
The older version TVM 300 is installed on the line Paris-Lyon (LGV SE) and Paris-Tours/Le Mans (LGV A) lines.

In general trains are only equipped with one form of radio but a few trains that travel in areas of both NRN and CSR is equipped with both forms of radio.
BR 1845 Issues G and H (lineside) BR 1661 Issue A (trainborne) Commonly called Cab Secure Radio Description: This Ground-Train radio follows the technical regulations described in Railtrack Specifications (BR Specification 1845 Issues G and H and in BR 1661 Issue A).
Radio systems following this basic subset allow for duplex voice communication (lineside), simplex voice communication (trainborne), broadcast mode and use of operating signals (tones), for selective calls and for data transmission.
Radio system use digital selective call (according MPT 1327 — 1200 bit/s FFSK) and 50 baud subaudio FSK for base station signalling.
System TRS is outfitted with the digital transmission in the coded form of a short telegram FFSK 1200 bps in both directions.
One of commands is assigned to the train remote stop that can be activated by a dispatcher or a signaller and causes vehicle emergency braking (if an adapter to ATP type LS 90 or driver vigilance equipment is present on-board).
System TRS is fully compatible at the control signals level in accordance with mandatory recommendation UIC 751-3.
The TRS is designed with use of track-side (distributive radio-sets (DRS), and up to 28 local radio-sets (LRS), connected to each other by a two-wires communication channel) and mobile (on-board radio-sets (BRS) and handheld radio-sets (HRS)) equipment.
Six frequencies in the band of 1000 — 1700 Hz are used for selective connection of 28 LRS's.
Selective calls, operating signals (tones) and data transmission have not been in use.
With the integrated train radio communication network are covered all the lines and railway station around the country.
Personnel responsible for safe and efficient railway operations have in use Motorola GP and P series portable radios.
Six frequencies in the band of 1000 — 1700 Hz are used for selective connection of LRS's.
Those are documented either in the technical specifications of the Control-Command Subsystem (referenced in chapter 5 of both Control-Command TSIs for the trans-European high-speed and conventional rail systems) or in the relevant national documentation of the Class B-systems or the STMs, respectively.
As stated in Chapter 7, the train-specific characteristics defined in this Annex shall be included in the Register of Rolling Stock by the railway undertaking.
Annex C deals with those aspects of the Control-Command Assemblies which are covered neither by Annex A nor by Annex B, and with the options permitted for Class A and Class B systems and interfaces (see Annex D,).
Such information concerns for example: - choices in the frame of technical compatibility requirements listed in Annex A, - choices in the frame of technical compatibility requirements listed in Annex B, - EMC-values (because of the use of equipment which is not covered by TSI requirements, for instance axle-counter-systems), - climatic conditions and physical conditions along the line.

It must provide the applicant(s) with an inspection report and, audit and/or test reports as appropriate 6.5.
The notified body chosen by the contracting entity and responsible for the EC verification, if not carrying out the surveillance of all the quality management system(s) concerned as under point 5, must co ordinate the surveillance activities of any other notified bodies responsible for that task, in order : - to be ensured that correct management of interfaces between the different quality management systems relating to subsystem integration has been performed. - to collect, in liaison with the contracting entity, the necessary elements for the assessment to guarantee the consistency and the overall supervision of the different quality management systems.
The contracting entity, if involved, and the main contractors must, for a period of 10 years after the last subsystem has been manufactured, keep at the disposal of the national authorities: - the documentation referenced in the second indent of the second subparagraph of point 5.1, - the updating referenced in the second subparagraph of point 5.5, - the decisions and reports from the notified body which are referenced in the points 5.4, 5.5 and 6.4 9.
Where the subsystem meets the requirements of the TSI, the notified body must then, based on the design examination and the approval and surveillance of the quality management system (s), draw up the certificate of conformity intended for the contracting entity, who shall in turn draw up the EC declaration of verification intended for the supervisory authority in the Member State within which the subsystem is located and/or operates.
The declaration must be written in the same language of the technical file and must contain at least the information included in Annex V of the Directive. 10.
The notified body chosen by the contracting entity shall be responsible for compiling the technical file that has to accompany the EC declaration of verification.
The technical file shall include at least the information indicated in Art 18 (3) of The Directive, and in particular as follows: - all necessary documents relating to the characteristics of the subsystem - the list of interoperability constituents incorporated into the subsystem, - copies of the EC declarations of conformity and, where appropriate, of the EC declarations of suitability for use, which the constituents must be provided in accordance with Article 13 of the Directive, accompanied, where appropriate, by the corresponding documents (certificates, quality management system approvals and surveillance documents) issued by the notified, - evidence of conformity to other regulations deriving from the treaty (including certificates) - all elements relating to the maintenance, the conditions and limits for use of the subsystem, - all elements relating to the instructions concerning servicing, constant or routine monitoring, adjustment and maintenance - certificate of conformity of the notified body as mentioned under point 9, accompanied by corresponding calculation notes and countersigned by itself, stating that the project complies with the Directive and the TSI, and mentioning, where appropriate, reservations recorded during performance of the activities and not withdrawn.
Each notified body must communicate to the other notified bodies the relevant information concerning the quality management system approvals and the EC design examination reports, which it has issued, withdrawn or refused.
