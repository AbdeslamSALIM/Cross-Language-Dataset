The conclusions[2] adopted by the Environment Council on 14 October 2004 call for rapid implementation of ETAP to give eco-efficient innovations a fair and competitive market perspective and to provide for the internalisation of external costs through an effective mix of instruments.
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ETAP IN 2004 The implementation of the key priorities in the Action Plan is well underway.
They should build on the work done by the Commission (Eurostat) in the field of environmental accounting and of eco-efficiency indicators.
The European Commission will report on the implementation of ETAP to the 2007 Spring European Council, including on the first results of the co-operation with Member States.
