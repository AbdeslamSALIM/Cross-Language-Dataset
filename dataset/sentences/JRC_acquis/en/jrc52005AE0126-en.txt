Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Council Regulation on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy (COM(2004) 489 final &amp;mdash; 2004/0164 (CNS)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Council Regulation on the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy (COM(2004) 489 final â€” 2004/0164 (CNS)) (2005/C 221/09) On 29 October 2004, the Council decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 37(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned proposal.
The Section for Agriculture, Rural Development and the Environment, which was responsible for preparing the Committee's work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 13 January 2005.
At its 414th plenary session of 9 and 10 February 2005 (meeting of 9 February 2005), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 133 votes with 6 abstentions: 1.
Introduction 1 January 2005 saw the launch of the far-reaching agricultural reform.
For EAFRD expenditure, the Commission proposes that the paying agency should also submit separate annual accounts for each programme, split into annual instalments. 2.2.4 Clearance of accounts, conformity clearance and the financial report The draft regulation envisages that the Commission will close the accounts of the paying agencies prior to 30 April.
The EESC feels that it is all the more essential that therefore the public should be able to readily understand and accept support for agriculture and rural development.
In the view of the EESC, two conditions must be met for this to happen: - payments must reach final beneficiaries with as few deductions as possible; and - abuse should be prevented through effective monitoring. 3.2 Innovative approaches for simpler operations The EESC acknowledges that the draft regulation contains a range of genuinely innovative approaches for better and simpler budgetary operations.
If recovery has not taken place within four years, or within six years where recovery action has been taken in the national courts, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery would be borne by the Member State concerned.
Given that procedures can last for over four or six years, the EESC proposes reconsidering timeframes and percentage rates for Member State involvement. 4.3.3 Limiting prefinancing payments to 7 % (Article 25) Article 25 sets the prefinancing amount, paid by the Commission after adoption of a rural development programme to the paying agency designated by the Member State, at 7 % of the EAFRD contribution.
In the view of the EESC, this is an acceptable limit, as similar restrictions already apply, and as it would not have any adverse consequences for the liquidity of paying agencies. 4.4 Expiry of payments (Article 16) Article 16 sets 15 October of the relevant budget year as a cut-off date for late payments by Member States.
The EESC therefore feels that 15 October is not an appropriate cut-off date. 4.5 Period for refusing financing (Article 31) Article 31 (conformity clearance) allows the Commission to refuse financing under certain circumstances (infringement of Community rules, failure to reach agreement with the relevant Member State).
Brussels, 9 February 2005.
