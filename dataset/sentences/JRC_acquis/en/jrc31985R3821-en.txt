Member States may exempt vehicles mentioned in Article 13 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85 from application of this Regulation.
Member States may, after authorization by the Commission, exempt from application of this Regulation vehicles used for the transport operations referred to in Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3820/85.
Article 6 Member States shall issue to the applicant an EEC approval mark, which shall conform to the model shown in Annex II, for each type of recording equipment or model record sheet which they approve pursuant to Article 5.
Article 10 No Member State may refuse to register any vehicle fitted with recording equipment, or prohibit the entry into service or use of such vehicle for any reason connected with the fact that the vehicle is fitted with such equipment, if the equipment bears the EEC approval mark referred to in Article 6 and the installation plaque referred to in Article 12.
Article 11 All decisions pursuant to this Regulation refusing or withdrawing approval of a type of recording equipment or model record sheet shall specify in detail the reasons on which they are based.
CHAPTER IV Use of equipment Article 13 The employer and drivers shall be responsible for seeing that the equipment functions correctly.
Measures taken by Member States pursuant to Article 19 may give the competent authorities power to prohibit the use of the vehicle in cases where breakown or faulty operation has not been put right as provided in the foregoing subparagraphs. 2.
Opinions shall be delivered by a qualified majority in accordance with Article 148 (2) of the Treaty.
Article 20 Regulation (EEC) No 1463/70 shall be repealed.

rev/km), or in impulses per kilometre (k = . . .
The characteristic coefficient is expressed either in revolutions per kilometre (w = . . .
rev/km) or in impulses per kilometre (w = . . .
The measurement of these distances must be made under normal test conditions (see Chapter VI, point 4 of this Annex) and is expressed in the form : 1 = . . .
Visual instruments showing: - distance travelled (distance recorder), - speed (speedometer), - time (clock). 1.2.
Recording instruments comprising: - a recorder of the distance travelled, - a speed recorder, - one or more time recorders satisfying the requirements laid down in Chapter III (c) 4. 1.3.
Measurement of distance travelled The distances travelled may be measured and recorded either: - so as to include both forward and reverse movement, or - so as to include only forward movement.
The distance recorder must be capable of reading up to at least 99 999,9 kilometres. 2.
The value of a speed graduation (space between two successive marks) must not exceed 10 % of the maximum speed shown on the scale. 2.2.
The length of each space on the scale representing a speed difference of 10 kilometres per hour must not be less than 10 millimetres. 2.4.
On an indicator with a needle, the distance between the needle and the instrument face must not exceed three millimetres. 3.
In equipment of the strip type, where the forward movement device of the sheets is controlled by the clock mechanism the speed of rectilinear forward movement must be at least 10 millimetres per hour. 1.4.
Each variation in speed of 10 kilometres per hour must be represented on the record by a variation of at least 1,5 millimetres on the corresponding coordinate. 4.
Recording equipment must be so constructed that it is possible, through the operation where necessary of a switch device, to record automatically and spearately four periods of time as indicated in Article 15 of the Regulation. 4.2.
It must be possible, from the characteristics of the traces, their relative positions and if necessary the signs laid down in Article 15 of the Regulation to distinguish clearly between the various periods of time.
The following markings must appear on the instrument face of the equipment: - close to the figure shown by the distance recorder, the unit of measurement of distance, indicated by the abbreviation 'km', - near the speed scale, the marking 'km/h', - the measurement range of the speedometer in the form 'Vmin . . .
The descriptive plaque must be built into the equipment and must show the following markings, which must be visible on the equipment when installed: - name and address of the manufacturer of the equipment, - manufacturer's number and year of construction, - approval mark for the equipment type, - the constant of the equipment in the form 'k = . . .
In use: (a) distance travelled: 4 % more or less than the real distance, where that distance is at least one kilometre; (b) speed: 6 km/h more or less than the real speed; (c) time: ± two minutes per day, or ± 10 minutes per seven days. 4.
In addition it must be possible to write on the sheets, without damaging them and without affecting the legibility of the recordings, the information referred to in Article 15 (5) of the Regulation.
The area for recording speed must be scaled off in divisions of 20 kilometres per hour or less.
The last marking on the scale must coincide with the upper limit of the range of measurement. 3.
The plaque must show at least the following details: - name, address or trade name of the approved fitter or workshop, - characteristic coefficient of the vehicle, in the form 'w = . . .
rev/km' or 'w = . . .
imp/km', - effective circumference of the wheel tyres in the form '1 = . . .
