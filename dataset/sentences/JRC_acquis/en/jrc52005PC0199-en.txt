In accordance with Article 18.4a) of the CPPNM, Euratom signed the CPPNM on 13. 6. 1980 and acceded to it on 6.10 1991[2].
In order to answer these concerns the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) set up in June 2001 an “Open-Ended Group of Legal and Technical Experts to Prepare a draft Amendment of the CPPNM” to discuss, whether there is a need to revise the CPPNM”.
The group concluded its work in March 2003 establishing a final report to which the draft amendment was enclosed.
Therefore, in the meantime, a group of 25 parties to the CPPNM under the lead of Austria, established in June 2004 a new proposal to amend the CPPNM.
This revised proposal was also circulated to all the Parties of the CPPNM by the IAEA secretariat, in order to initiate the procedure for the convening of the Amendment Conference in accordance with the Article 20 of the CPPNM.
The Commission received this revised proposal in September 2004.
Article 6 of the Convention concerning the protection of confidential information is complemented accordingly and updated considering the extension of the scope of the CPPNM.
Furthermore, the CPPNM is strengthened through the introduction of new measures of co-operation addressing the case of credible threat of sabotage of nuclear material or nuclear facility, or of sabotage thereof ( Article 5 ) and through the introduction of new offences relating to sabotage, contributing to and organising or directing the commission of an offence and smuggling ( Article 7 ). 3.
