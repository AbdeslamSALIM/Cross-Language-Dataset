Specification (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) Name : "Clémentine de Corse" Description - a reddish-orange colour with up to 1/5 of the surface area of the peel green, - medium-sized to small, with a maximum cross-section diameter of between 46 and 68 mm, - a minimum juice content of 42 %, - a tart taste, - an internal ripeness defined by the proportion (E/A) of sugar content of its juice (E), expressed in Brix concentration, to the acidity of the same juice (A) expressed in grams of citric acid per 100 g.
The proportion E/A should be between 8 and 17, where the acidity level is between 0.65 and 1.4, - at least 30 % of the fruit marketed with one or two leaves attached to the stalk.
Fruit certified under the PGI comprises only sizes 1 to 5.
The small size of the orchards, together with the mountainous terrain, is conducive to a better control over the evolution of parasites which could affect the fruit. - These are all reasons why the geographical area has been defined as where these soil and climatic conditions are to be found, together with a certain number of easily identifiable distinct criteria for indicating location, as follows: - Altitude: only areas between 2 and 300 metres are taken into consideration.
Above 300 metres the slope and climate are unfavourable. - Slope: it should be less than 25 %. - Distance from the sea: it should be less than 15 km, the limit for benefiting from the maritime climate.
