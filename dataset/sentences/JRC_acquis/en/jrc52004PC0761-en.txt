Under Article 3 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, no correction coefficient is applicable in Belgium and Luxembourg.
The correction coefficients applicable to remuneration, pensions and transfers of part of the remuneration that are set out in the Regulation have been calculated as follows: Correction coefficients for officials outside Belgium and Luxembourg Eurostat has calculated, in agreement with national statistical institutes, the economic parities which fix purchasing power parities on 1 July 2004 between the remuneration paid by the European Communities in the reference city, Brussels, and in the other places of employment.
Correction coefficients for pensioners outside Belgium and Luxembourg and correction coefficients for transfers Eurostat has calculated, in agreement with national statistical institutes, the economic parities which fix purchasing power parities on 1 July 2004 between the pension paid by the European Communities in the reference country, Belgium, and that paid in the other places of residence.
