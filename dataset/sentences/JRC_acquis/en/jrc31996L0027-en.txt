Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 90/629/EEC (OJ No L 341, 6. 12. 1990, p. 14).
Pursuant to Article 3 (4) of Directive 70/156/EEC applications for EC type-approval of a vehicle type with regard to the protection of occupants of motor vehicles in the event of a side-impact protection must be submitted by the manufacturer. 1.2.
A model for the information document is given in Appendix 1. 1.3.
A vehicle representative of the vehicle type to be approved must be submitted to the technical service responsible for conducting the type-approval tests. 1.4.
EC TYPE-APPROVAL 2.1.
EC type-approval is granted in accordance with Article 4 (3) and, if applicable, 4 (4) of Directive 70/156/EEC where the vehicle type satisfies the relevant requirements. 2.2.
The same Member State must not assign the same number to another type of vehicle. 2.4.
In the case of amendments to type-approvals granted pursuant to this Directive, the provisions of Article 5 of Directive 70/156/EEC are applicable. 3.2.
Any modification of the vehicle affecting the general form of the structure of the vehicle, or any variation in the reference mass greater than 8 % which in the judgment of the authority would have a marked influence on the results of the test necessitates a repetition of the test as described in Appendix 1 of Annex II. 3.3.
This would be the case if the reference mass differs by no more than 8 % from the original vehicle, or the number of front seats is unchanged.
An example of how to approach this problem is given in Appendix 5 of Annex II. 4.

The test authority, after consulting the manufacturer, may require the test to be carried out with the seat in a position other than the one indicated in Section 5.5.1 of Appendix 1 (1).
That position will be specified in the test report. 3.1.3.

HPC is the maximum value of the expression: (t2 - t1)[%gt%NUM%gt%1%gt%DEN%gt%(t2 - t1)t1%amp%int;t2 a.dt]2,5 where a is the resultant acceleration at the centre of gravity of the head (m/s²) divided by 9,81 recorded versus time and filtered at channel frequency class 1 000 Hz; t1 and t2 are any two times between the initial contact and the last instant of contact. 2.
Chest deflection: the peak chest deflection is the maximum value of deflection on any rib as determined by the thorax displacement transducers, filtered at channel frequency class 180 Hz. 2.2.
Viscous criterion: the peak viscous response is the maximum value of V*C on any rib which is calculated from the instantaneous product of the relative thorax compression related to the half thorax and the velocity of compression derived by differentiation of the compression, filtered at channel frequency class 180 Hz.
For the purposes of this calculation the standard width of the half thorax rib cage is 140 mm.
ABDOMINAL PROTECTION CRITERION The peak abdominal force is the maximum value of the sum of the three forces measured by transducers mounted 39 mm below the surface on the crash side, CFC 600 Hz. 4.

Appendix 1 - Addendum 2 PROCEDURE FOR CALCULATING THE VISCOUS CRITERION (V*C) FOR SIDE IMPACT DUMMY The viscous criterion (V*C) is calculated as the instantaneous product of the compression and the rate of deflection of the sternum.
The sternum deflection response is filtered once at channel frequency class 180.
The compression at time t is calculated from this filtered signal expressed as the proportion of the half width of the Eurosid 1 chest, measured at the metal ribs (0,14 m): C(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%D(t)%gt%DEN%gt%0,14 The sternum deflection velocity at time t is calculated from the filtered deflection as: V(t) = %gt%NUM%gt%8 × (D(t + 1) - D(t - 1)) - (D(t + 2) - D(t - 2))%gt%DEN%gt%12 ät where D(t) is the deflection at time t in metres and t is the time interval in seconds between the measurements of deflection.
The maximum value of t shall be 1,25 × 10-4 seconds.

The peak force of this sum must be between 5,9 and 7,9 kN. 5.12.
The thorax is positioned vertically while the arms and legs are positioned horizontally. 5.12.2.
The impactor is a pendulum of 23,5 + 0 to 0,2 kg and 152 ± 2 mm diameter. 5.12.3.
The impactor is equipped with an accelerometer sensitive in the direction of impact and located on the impactor axis. 5.12.4.
The impactor must freely swing on to the pelvis of the dummy with an impact velocity of 4,3 ± 0,1 m/s. 5.12.5.
The impact direction is perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis of the dummy and the axis of the impactor is aligned with the centre of the H point foam cylinder. 5.12.6.
The peak force of the impactor, obtained from the impactor acceleration filtered using CFC 180 and multiplied by the impactor mass, must be between 4,4 and 5,4 kN, and occur between 10,3 and 15,5 ms. 5.12.7.
The pubic symphisis force, filtered using CFC 600, must be between 1,04 and 1,64 kN and occur between 9,9 and 15,9 ms. 5.13.

Appendix 4 INSTALLATION OF THE SIDE IMPACT DUMMY 1.
The side impact dummy to be used for the following installation procedure is described in Appendix 3 of Annex II to this Directive. 2.
Adjust the leg joints so that they just support the leg when it is extended horizontally (1 to 2 g). 2.2.
Place the dummy in the outboard front seat of the impacted side as described in the side impact test procedure specification. 2.4.
The plane of symmetry of the dummy must coincide with the median vertical plane of the specified seating position. 2.5.
The pelvis of the dummy must be positioned such that a lateral line passing through the dummy H points is perpendicular to the longitudinal centre plane of the seat.
The line through the dummy H points must be horizontal with a maximum inclination of ± 2 °. 2.6.
Set the knees of the dummy such that their outside surfaces are 150 ± 10 mm from the plane of symmetry of the dummy.
If possible within these constraints place the thighs of the dummy in contact with the seat cushion. 2.9.
Set the knees of the dummy such that their outside surfaces are 150 ± 10 mm from the plane of symmetry of the dummy.
Appendix 5 PARTIAL TEST 1.
PROCEDURES AND INSTALLATIONS 2.1.
The head form impactor, defined in 3.1.1, must hit at 24,1 km/h, in the area impacted for the Eurosid head during the approval of the vehicle.
However, this test must not be carried out when, during the tests described in Appendix 1 to Annex II to this Directive: - there has been no head contact, or - the head contacted window glazing only, provided that the window glazing is not laminated glass. 2.1.1.2.
The body block impactor, defined in 3.2.1, must hit at 24,1 km/h in the lateral area impacted by the Eurosid shoulder, arm and thorax, during the type-approval of the vehicle.
This apparatus consists of a fully guided linear impactor, rigid, with a mass of 6,8 kg.
Its impact surface is hemispherical with a diameter of 165 mm. 3.1.2.
This apparatus consists of a fully guided linear impactor, rigid, with a mass of 30 kg.
Its dimensions and transversal section are shown in Figure 1. 3.2.2.
