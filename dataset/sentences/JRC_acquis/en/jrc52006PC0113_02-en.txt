The negotiations with the then candidate countries were discontinued in 2002, in view of impeding accession.
The extension of the mandate to the Balkan region in December 2004 was an important step forward and will help these parties to come closer to the EU in this sector of key economic importance. | 120 | General context The text of the multilateral agreement was accepted by Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the European Community, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, Romania and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo during the final round of negotiations on 20 December 2005.
This a major step forward where air transport will play a key role in putting impetus on the political and economic integration of Europe. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Air service agreements between the Member States and the ECAA Partners will be superseded by the Agreement. | 140 | Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union The ECAA was expressly designed as an open framework accessible for European countries which wish to fully integrate into the European aviation family and to fit into the Neighbourhood Policy of the Community. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | 211 | Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents Special Committee, Industry Consultative Forum.
Finally, the Annex to the agreement lists the Community aviation acts that will become applicable within the ECAA. | 310 | Legal basis EC Treaty Art. 80(2), 300(2), 300(4) | 329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community.
The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | 331 | The ECAA Agreement is a multilateral aviation agreement which will supersede to a large extent bilateral air service agreements between the Member States and the ECAA partners.
However, Member States will remain able to introduce safeguard measures where necessary. | 332 | The Agreement will be administered by a Joint Committee of the Parties.
One or two meeting per year is foreseen. | Choice of instruments | 341 | Proposed instruments: international agreement. | 342 | The Council is requested to adopt the Decisions on the signature and provisional application, and on the conclusion of the Agreement. | BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 409 | The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. | ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | 510 | Simplification | 511 | The proposal provides for simplification of legislation. | 512 | The several bilateral air service agreements between Member States and the ECAA Partners will be to a large extent substituted by one single Community agreement. | 570 | Detailed explanation of the proposal Proposals (1) for a Council decision on the signature and provisional application of the Multilateral Agreement between the Republic of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Republic of Croatia, the European Community, the Republic of Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Kingdom of Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, Romania and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo on the Establishment of a European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) and (2) for a Council decision on the conclusion of the ECAA Agreement. | 1.
