In recent years the Irish economy has continued to grow at just below 5 % p.a., the highest rate in the euro area, while employment is on the rise and inflation has converged rapidly towards the euro-area average.
As regards budgetary developments, the fiscal position has been broadly sound, with the general government balance recording surpluses in most years over the last decade and the debt ratio falling significantly (to under 30 % of GDP in 2005). (3) In its opinion of 17 February 2005, the Council endorsed the budgetary strategy presented in the previous update of the stability programme, covering the period 2004-2007.
As regards budgetary implementation in 2005, the previous update targeted a general government deficit of 0,8 % of GDP, while the current update estimates a 0,3 % surplus despite a downward revision of growth.
The main reason for the far better outcome in 2005 than initially targeted is to be found on the revenue side. (4) The programme broadly follows the model structure and data provision requirements for stability and convergence programmes specified in the new code of conduct [2]. (5) The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages that real GDP growth will remain in a narrow range of between 4,5 % and 5 % over the programme period.
Starting from a 0,25 % of GDP surplus in 2005, the budgetary strategy envisages a general government deficit of 0,6 % in 2006 and 0,8 % of GDP in the final two years of the programme.
In addition it provides a sufficient safety margin against breaching the 3 % of GDP deficit threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations in each year. (10) The debt ratio, which was still just below 100 % of GDP in the early 1990s, is estimated to have reached 28 % of GDP in 2005, well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value.
In particular, Ireland respects its MTO and the update provides an overview of the government's structural reform programme that should contribute towards enhancing the quality of public services, increasing the efficiency of public spending and addressing the infrastructural needs of the Irish economy. (13) The National Reform Programme of Ireland, submitted on 28 October 2005 in the context of the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs identifies, in particular, the following challenges with significant implications for public finances: (i) to continue to prioritise public investment in economic and social infrastructure and other growth-enhancing expenditures; and (ii) to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment and sustainable public finances, and to ensure moderate inflation levels.
