As stated in the Commission Communication of 14 December 2004, with which the Council concurred on 18 January 2005, in view of the unique circumstances created by the Council conclusions of 25 November 2003 and of the ruling of the European Court of Justice of 13 July 2004, the year 2005 should be considered to be the relevant deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit. (6) The general government deficit in Germany has been well above the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value since 2002.
Real GDP growth was projected at 0,8 % in 2005, 1,2 % in 2006 and 1,6 % in 2007, with the output gap not fully closing over the forecast period.
On 22 February 2006, the government adopted the draft federal budget for 2006 and, notably, also adopted the draft law to raise the central VAT rate from 16 % to 19 % as from 1 January 2007. (10) On 22 February 2006, the Federal Statistical Office released figures for GDP growth and the general government deficit in 2005, at 0,9 % and 3,3 % of GDP respectively.
The Commission servicesâ€™ interim forecast, published on 21 February 2006, projects real GDP to grow by 1,5 % in 2006, which is slightly above the low potential growth rate.
In line with the above macroeconomic forecast, the nominal deficit is expected to stay slightly above 3 % of GDP in 2006, but to drop clearly below the reference value in 2007.
Secondly, the limited effects in terms of reduction of the structural deficit expected in 2006 reflect, at least in part, the fact that some of the measures already implemented will produce results only with a lag.
Thirdly, a structural adjustment of at least 1 % of GDP in 2006 and 2007 planned by the government can be considered as consistent with the SGP provisions, including the required annual improvement to the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and temporary measures of at least 0,5 % of GDP as a benchmark.
The benchmark 0,5 % of GDP annual improvement in the structural balance should be respected in cumulative terms in 2006 and 2007. (13) According to the second subparagraph of Article 104(9) of the Treaty, the Council may request Germany to submit reports in accordance with a specific timetable in order to examine the adjustment efforts made in order to comply with this Decision.
Germany should submit a report to the Commission by 14 July 2006 at the latest, outlining the measures taken and planned to comply with this Decision.
In 2006 and 2007, Germany shall ensure a cumulative improvement in its cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and temporary measures of at least one percentage point.
Germany shall submit to the Commission, by 14 July 2006 at the latest, a report outlining the measures taken to comply with this Decision.
Germany shall submit further reports to the Commission, by 1 October 2006, 1 April 2007, 1 October 2007 and 1 April 2008, examining progress made in complying with this Decision.
Article 3 Germany shall take the necessary measures to ensure that budgetary consolidation towards its medium-term objective of a balanced budget in structural terms is sustained through a reduction in the structural deficit of at least 0,5 % of GDP per year after the excessive deficit has been corrected.
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.

Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2103/2005 (OJ L 337, 22.12.2005, p. 1). [5] This was broadly in line with the figure notified by the German authorities on 1 September 2005 (3,7 % of GDP), the main difference stemming from the securitisation undertaken by the pension office for former post office civil servants, which was not treated as deficit-reducing in the autumn forecast. --------------------------------------------------
