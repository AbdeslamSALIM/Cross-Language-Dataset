The reports which the external auditor of the Court of Auditors drew up in respect of the Court's accounts for the financial years 1987 to 1991 were sent only to the Chairman of the European Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee.
Pursuant to a decision taken by the Members of the Court of Auditors at the Court meeting of 8 July 1993, the external auditor's reports have since been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, starting with the report on the financial year 1992.
