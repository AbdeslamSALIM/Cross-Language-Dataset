Opinion of the European Central Bank of 17 March 2005 at the request of the Council of the European Union on a proposal for a Council decision concerning the signing of the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary (COM(2003) 783 final) (CON/2005/7) Opinion of the European Central Bank of 17 March 2005 at the request of the Council of the European Union on a proposal for a Council decision concerning the signing of the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary (COM(2003) 783 final) (CON/2005/7) (2005/C 81/08) Introduction 1.
On 31 January 2005 the European Central Bank (ECB) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Council decision concerning the signing of the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to certain rights in respect of securities held with an intermediary (hereinafter the "proposed decision") [1]. 2.
The proposed decision is a "proposed Community act" within the meaning of Article 105(4) of the Treaty for the following reasons: - an international agreement is binding on the Community and an integral part of Community law [2]; and - a Community institution's decision authorising, on behalf of the Community, the signature of an international agreement that is intended to have legal effects in the Community is itself a Community act [3].
The Convention directly concerns the fields of competence of the Eurosystem and the ECB, since it: (i) might have consequences for the smooth, efficient and sound operation of clearing and payment systems in the euro area (Article 105(2) of the Treaty and Article 3.1 and Article 22 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank); and (ii) might have consequences for the definition and implementation of monetary policy in the euro area (Article 105(2) of the Treaty and Article 3.1 of the Statute), in particular in view of the Eurosystem's obligation to conduct its credit operations on the basis of adequate collateral (Article 18.1 of the Statute).
The ECB also notes that the Convention, if signed and ratified by the Community, would, upon its entry into force, directly affect key provisions in Community legislation on which the ECB and the European Monetary Institute (EMI) have been consulted in the past [4].
General considerations 5.
The ECB takes note of the reasons given in the Hague Convention Report for this departure (see paragraphs Int-41 to 46, 4-4 and 4-24 to 4-25).
Third party rights 13.
For example, a jurisdiction in which an SSS or CSD is located might adopt such mandatory laws, amongst others to ensure that the legal and operational framework underlying the securities infrastructure, including the securities accounts, is sound and effective. 17.
Generally speaking and irrespective of direct interference by Article 11(1) or (2) of the Convention, the ECB notes that in many jurisdictions, a significant number of other laws dealing with various issues regarding securities and/or securities accounts, and which are often of a public law nature, refer for their application to the situs of these securities and securities accounts.
This interference might, for instance, also relate to the ECB's collection of statistical information (see Article 5 of the Statute), which seeks to minimise the reporting formalities within the existing legal framework and where a change of the current conflict-of-laws regime might affect the reporting of cross-border securities transactions and positions.
The possible existence of such a relationship between a conflict-of-laws rule and the surrounding framework of other relevant laws also pleads in favour of a prior broad impact assessment of the Convention's effects in the Community and of a harmonisation of the substantive securities law (see paragraph 20).
