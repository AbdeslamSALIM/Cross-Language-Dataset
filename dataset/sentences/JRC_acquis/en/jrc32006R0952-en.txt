Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [1], and in particular Article 40 thereof, Whereas: (1) The application of the quota system in the sugar sector requires a precise definition of an undertaking's production of sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup.
The possibility of allocating part of the production of one undertaking to another undertaking which has had sugar produced under contract should be limited to certain specific cases. (2) Under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, Member States grant approval, on request, to undertakings producing sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup or to undertakings that process these products into a product included in the list referred to in Article 13(2) of that Regulation.
The commitments that the undertakings must make in return for approval should be laid down, in particular the obligation to keep an up-to-date record of the quantities of raw materials entering the undertaking, being processed in it and leaving it in the form of an end product. (3) It is necessary to lay down Member States' obligations as regards checks on approved undertakings, and to define a sufficiently deterrent system of penalties. (4) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides for an information system on sugar prices.
Under Article 17 of that Regulation, approved undertakings are required to provide information on the quantities of white sugar sold and corresponding prices and conditions.
The frequency and content of the information on prices that sugar manufacturers and refiners must draw up for transmission to the Commission should be laid down.
Approved undertakings which use sugar for processing into one of the products listed in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 must also draw up, for transmission to the Commission, the price of the sugar purchased, at the same intervals and in the same format as those laid down for sugar producers. (5) To ensure publication of price levels in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 while guaranteeing the confidentiality of data, it should be laid down that the Commission must inform the Management Committee for Sugar twice a year of the average prices of white sugar sold on the Community market in the previous half-year, broken down into quota sugar and non-quota sugar. (6) A report on the operation of the system for recording and notifying market prices provided for in this Regulation is to be drawn up in order to propose improvements considered relevant and a computerised system for the transmission of price data.
Pending these improvements, on a transitional basis for 2006 and 2007, the prices drawn up by the undertakings must be sent directly to the Commission for the purposes of informing the Management Committee for Sugar. (7) Where Article 14 or 19 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 applies, manufacturers are to carry forward part of their production to the following marketing year, to be counted against the production of that year.
The most appropriate method of establishing the value of beet of a quality differing from the standard quality is to establish a scale of price increases and reductions expressed as a percentage of the minimum price. (10) Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides for the allocation of additional sugar quotas.
The deadline for payment of the one-off amount provided for in Article 9(3) of that Regulation should be laid down. (12) Point 5 of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 defines the production of quota sugar as the quantity of sugar production attributed to a specific marketing year under the quota of the undertaking concerned, and point 9 of Article 2 thereof defines quota beet as sugar beet processed into quota sugar.
CHAPTER II ESTABLISHING PRODUCTION Article 3 Sugar production 1.
For the purposes of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, %quot%sugar production%quot% means the total quantity, expressed as white sugar, of: (a) white sugar; (b) raw sugar; (c) invert sugar; (d) syrups belonging to one of the following categories, hereinafter called %quot%syrups%quot%: (i) sucrose or invert sugar syrups which are at least 70 % pure and are produced from sugar beet, (ii) sucrose or invert sugar syrups which are at least 75 % pure and are produced from sugar cane. 2.
Sugar production shall be expressed in terms of white sugar in the following way: (a) in the case of white sugar, disregarding differences in quality; (b) in the case of raw sugar, on the basis of yield determined in accordance with point III of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006; (c) in the case of invert sugar, by multiplying production of invert sugar by the coefficient 1; (d) in the case of syrups considered as intermediate products, on the basis of extractable sugar content determined in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article; (e) in the case of syrups which are not considered as intermediate products, on the basis of sugar content, expressed as sucrose in accordance with Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 [5]. 4.
The extractable sugar content shall be calculated by subtracting the difference between the dry matter content and the degree of polarisation of that syrup, multiplied by 1,70, from the degree of polarisation of the syrup in question.
Article 4 Isoglucose production 1.
For the purposes of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, %quot%isoglucose production%quot% means the total quantity of product obtained from glucose or its polymers with a content by weight in the dry state of at least 10 % fructose irrespective of its fructose content in excess of that limit.

Inulin syrup production shall be recorded by means of the combination of the following operations: (a) physical metering of the volume of the product as such immediately after leaving the first evaporator after each hydrolysis and before any operation to separate the glucose and fructose constituents or to produce mixtures; (b) determination of the dry matter content by refractometry and measurement of the fructose content by weight in the dry state, on the basis of daily representative sampling; (c) conversion of the fructose content to 80 % by weight in the dry state by multiplying the quantity determined in dry matter by the coefficient representing the ratio between the measured fructose content of that quantity of syrup and 80 %; (d) expression as sugar/isoglucose equivalent by applying the coefficient 1.9. 3.
All undertakings shall be required to notify without delay any of their facilities which may be used for the hydrolysis of the inulin, and the annual quantities and the use of the products referred to in paragraph 1 but less than 70 % pure.
The first report shall be sent not later than 31 January 2007.
