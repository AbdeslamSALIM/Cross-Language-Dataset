Common Position (EC) No 5/2006 of 23 January 2006 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to adopting a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) Common Position (EC) No 5/2006 adopted by the Council on 23 January 2006 with a view to adopting Directive 2006/…/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) (2006/C 126 E/02) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], After consulting the Committee of the Regions, Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], Whereas: (1) Community policy on the environment must aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Community.
Moreover, information, including spatial information, is needed for the formulation and implementation of this policy and other Community policies, which must integrate environmental protection requirements in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.
An infrastructure for spatial information in the Community should therefore be established. (4) The Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) should assist policy-making in relation to policies and activities that may have a direct or indirect impact on the environment. (5) INSPIRE should be based on the infrastructures for spatial information that are created by the Member States and that are made compatible with common implementing rules and are supplemented with measures at Community level.
This Directive should be without prejudice to Directive 2003/4/EC. (8) This Directive should be without prejudice to Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information [5], the objectives of which are complementary to those of this Directive. (9) The establishment of INSPIRE will represent significant added value for — and will also benefit from — other Community initiatives such as Council Regulation (EC) No 876/2002 of 21 May 2002 setting up the Galileo Joint Undertaking [6] and the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council "Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES): Establishing a GMES capacity by 2008 — (Action Plan (2004 to 2008))".
Such initiatives may be established by Community legislation, such as Commission Decision 2000/479/EC of 17 July 2000 on the implementation of a European pollutant emission register (EPER) according to Article 15 of Council Directive 96/61/EC concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) [7] and Regulation (EC) No 2152/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus) [8], in the framework of Community funded programmes (for example CORINE land cover, European Transport Policy Information System) or may emanate from initiatives taken at national or regional level.
Member States should therefore make available, as a minimum and free of charge, the services for discovering spatial data sets. (19) In order to assist the integration of the national infrastructures into INSPIRE, Member States should provide access to their infrastructures through a Community geo-portal operated by the Commission, as well as through any access points they themselves decide to operate. (20) In order to make information from various levels of public authority available, Member States should remove the practical obstacles faced in that regard by public authorities at national, regional and local level when performing their public tasks that may have a direct or indirect impact on the environment.
Such access can be hindered if it depends on individual ad hoc negotiations between public authorities every time access is required.
The purpose of this Directive is to lay down general rules aimed at the establishment of the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (hereinafter referred to as "INSPIRE"), for the purposes of Community environmental policies and policies or activities which may have an impact on the environment. 2.
Article 2 This Directive is without prejudice to Directives 2003/4/EC and 2003/98/EC.
This Directive shall cover spatial data sets which fulfil the following conditions: (a) they relate to an area where a Member State has and/or exercises jurisdictional rights; (b) they are in electronic format; (c) they are held by or on behalf of any of the following: (i) a public authority, having been produced or received by a public authority, or being managed or updated by that authority and falling within the scope of its public tasks; (ii) a third party to whom the network has been made available in accordance with Article 12; (d) they relate to one or more of the themes listed in Annex I, II or III. 2.
The technical description of the data themes referred to in Annexes I, II and III may be adapted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 22(2), in order to take into account the evolving needs for spatial data in support of Community policies that affect the environment.
CHAPTER II METADATA Article 5 1.

INTRODUCTION On 26 July 2004, the Commission submitted to the Council its proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the Community (INSPIRE).
On 7 June 2005, the European Parliament adopted its opinion at first reading.
On 20 September 2004, the Committee of the Regions decided not to deliver an opinion.
On 9 February 2005, the Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion.
On 23 January 2006., the Council adopted its common position in accordance with Article 251(2) of the Treaty.
The Council agrees with the substance of EP amendment 7 and related amendment 2.
Article 2 states that the Directive would apply without prejudice to Directive 2003/4/EC on public access to environmental information and 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information.
Article 3 introduces additional definitions of the terms "interoperability", "INSPIRE geo portal" and limits the scope of the definition of "public authority".
Metadata, interoperability of spatial data sets and services (Articles 5 to 10) The components of the metadata are clarified in Article 5 of the common position as well as the implementation rules.
Article 7 introduces additional conditions for the drafting of the implementing rules laying down technical arrangements for interoperability, particularly the cost-benefit consideration, integration of standards and activities at international level and reference to existing technical means.
Amendments 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23 were taken on board either fully or in part within reworded text.
Amendment 20 was not accepted since the reference to "indirect impact on the environment" was considered too vague (see Article 1).
Amendments 24, 25, 26 and 27 were accepted within reworded text.
Data-sharing (Article 17) Article 17 of the common position clarifies the scope of data-sharing obligations between the public authorities of one Member State, the public authorities of different Member States, the institutions and bodies of the Community and the bodies established by international agreements.
Amendment 29 was not accepted as redundantly extending the data-sharing requirements.
Amendment 30 is superseded by the new wording of Article 17.
The whole concept of the original Article 24 — common implementing rules for data-sharing — (amendment 32) is not acceptable to the Council.
Article 24 slightly defers the transposition date.
Amendment 47 was partly accepted in Annex III, paragraph 11.
Amendments 39, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46, 48 and 49 have been accepted.
Despite these changes, the Council's common position is in line with the majority of the European Parliament's amendments and establishes a good basis for further negotiations. --------------------------------------------------
