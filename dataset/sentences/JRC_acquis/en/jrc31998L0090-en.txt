The distance (A) from the ground to the upper surface of the lowest step, measured with the vehicle in running order on a horizontal and flat surface, shall not be more than 600 mm. 1.1.1.
However, for off-road vehicles, as defined in Annex IIA to Directive 70/156/EEC, that distance (A) may be increased up to 700 mm. 1.2.
The distance (B) between the upper surfaces of the steps shall be not more than 400 mm.
The vertical distance between two subsequent steps shall not vary by more than 50 mm. 1.2.1.
However, for off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1), this latter figure may be increased up to 100 mm. 1.3.
However, for off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1), the value (F) may be reduced to 200 mm. 1.4.
The lowest step may be designed as a rung, if this is necessary for reasons relating to construction or use, and in the case of off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1).
