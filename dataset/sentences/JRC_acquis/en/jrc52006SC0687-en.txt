Draft Decision NO X/2006 of the EC-Denmark/Faroe Islands Joint Committee amending Tables I and II of the Annex to Protocol 1 to the Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part - Draft common position of the Community /* SEC/2006/0687 final */ EN Brussels, 6.6.2006 SEC(2006) 687 final Draft DECISION NO X/2006 OF THE EC-DENMARK/FAROE ISLANDS JOINT COMMITTEE amending Tables I and II of the Annex to Protocol 1 to the Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands, of the other part - Draft common position of the Community - (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM The tariff treatment and arrangements applicable to certain fish and fishery products originating in the Faeroes released for free circulation in the Community are specified in Protocol 1 to the Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Government of the Faroe Islands [1], of the other part.
However, there is no tariff concession in Protocol 1 for imports of frozen haddock originating in the Faeroes.
Article 36 of the above-mentioned Agreement stipulates that at the request of the Faeroes, the Community will consider improving the access possibilities for specific products.
The Faeroes have requested that the quota for shrimp, prawns and Norway lobster be increased from 3 000 to 6 000 tonnes.
Nevertheless, in the case of the tariff quota for shrimps, prawns and Norway lobsters, the Commission considers that the increase in the quota should be introduced gradually in increments of 1 000 tonnes and made conditional to a sufficient degree of utilisation of the existing quota.
Article 31 of the Agreement established a Joint Committee with responsibility for the administration of the Agreement and its implementation.
In accordance with Article 34(1) of the Agreement, the Joint Committee may therefore adopt a decision modifying the annex of Protocol 1 to the Agreement.
Article 2 Table I of the Annex to Protocol 1 to the Agreement shall be amended by the inclusion of the following row: ‘0303 72 00 | Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) | 0’ | | Article 3 This Decision shall take effect on the first day of the second month following that of its adoption.
