Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals /* COM/2006/0745 final - COD 2006/0246 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 30.11.2006 COM(2006)745 final 2006/0246 (COD) Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL - Grounds for and objectives of the proposal Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals Community[1] ('the Regulation') implements the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade.
At the same time, it is proposed to include certain technical amendments to the operative provisions in the light of a Commission report in accordance with Article 21 of the Regulation on the experience of the procedures to date.
That report is being submitted in parallel to this proposal. - General context The Rotterdam Convention was adopted in September 1998.
It entered into force on 24 February 2004.
In January 2002, the Commission put forward a proposal, based on Article 133 of the Treaty, for a Council Regulation concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals to implement to the provisions of the Convention within the Community.
After the European Parliament had been consulted on an optional basis pursuant to Article 133, the Council unanimously decided to replace Article 133 by Article 175(1).
The Commission recently put forward a separate proposal to that end, which was adopted by the Council on 25 September 2006 (Decision 2006/730/EC[5]). - Existing provisions in the area of the proposal As noted above, the current Community rules relating to the export and import of dangerous chemicals are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 304/2003, as most recently amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 777/2006[6].
The key differences can be summarised as follows: - the rules apply to exports to all countries, whether or not they are Parties to the Convention; - a wider range of chemicals are subject to annual export notification.
Furthermore chemicals subject to the international PIC procedure ('PIC chemicals') and certain articles are also covered; - PIC chemicals and chemicals that are banned or severely restricted in the Community in a Convention use category cannot be exported without the explicit consent of importing countries; - Certain articles and chemicals (such those chemicals that are subject also to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants) are banned for export; - All dangerous chemicals exported to third countries have to be labelled and packaged in the same way as they must be within the Community. - Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union The proposal is fully in line with existing policies and objectives aimed at protecting human health and the environment globally such as those laid down in the 6th Environmental Action Programme.
It is therefore proposed to revise the definition and to make it clearer in those operative provisions that preparations are only subject to the requirements when they contain a chemical(s) listed in the relevant part(s) of Annex I of the Regulation to the extent that its presence is such that it could trigger labelling, irrespective of the presence of any other substances in the preparation.
The situation as regards chemicals listed in part 2 of Annex I (chemicals banned or severely restricted in the EC within a Convention use category and thus qualifying for PIC notification but that are not yet PIC chemicals) is particularly problematic.
Furthermore, it is proposed that if there is no response after 3 months, exports can proceed for a maximum 12 months pending receipt of explicit consent to subsequent exports.
Article 2 This outlines the scope of the Regulation.
A number of definitions in the existing Regulation have been amended as follows: - A revised definition for 'exporter' has been introduced to address the enforcement problems referred to above. - The definition of 'preparation' has been revised and the scope of the rules of Articles 7, 9, 13 and 14(1) in relation to preparations clarified. - The definitions of' Chemical subject to the PIC procedure', 'Party to the Convention' and 'Party' have been adapted to take account of the entry into force of the Convention. - The definitions of 'Convention', 'PIC procedure', the 'Conference of the Parties' 'Chemical Review Committee', 'the Secretariat' and 'Decision Guidance Document' are not strictly necessary and are introduced when mentioned for the first time in the operative provisions.
Article 4 The wording of this Article, relating to designated authorities, is in line with the Convention and is essentially unchanged.
Article 5 This Article relates to the Community’s participation in the Convention, including the Commission's role as the common designated authority for the Community.
Article 6 This Article defines the chemicals that are subject to export notification, qualify for PIC notification, and are subject to the international PIC procedure.
Article 7 Article 7 sets out the export notification procedure.
It applies to all exports of chemicals that are listed in Part 1 of Annex I to the proposed Regulation.
Article 8 This Article outlines the procedure for handling export notifications from third countries..
Article 10 This Article provides that where a chemical qualifies for PIC notification following final Community regulatory action, the Commission shall notify the Convention’s Secretariat, providing the information laid down in Annex II.
Article 12 Article 12 deals with obligations in relation to imports of chemicals.
Article 13 This Article sets out certain obligations in relation to exports other than export notification.
The first relates mainly to procedures for PIC chemicals (listed in Part 3 of Annex I to the Regulation) and ensuring that the import decisions of importing parties are respected.
These chemicals and articles are listed in Annex V.
Article 15 This Article deals with the question of information on transit movements for PIC chemicals.
Article 16 Article 16 lays down the rules applicable to information to accompany exported chemicals.
Article 17 Article 17 refers to the role of the Customs Services of the Member States under the proposed Regulation.
Article 18 This Article is a standard provision for penalties in the event of infringements.
Article 19 Article 19 reflects the provisions of the Convention relating to information exchange, but extends these arrangements to all countries.
Article 20 This Article concerns technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition.
Article 21 Article 21 deals with monitoring and reporting within the Community on the operation of the proposed Regulation.
Article 22 Article 22 sets out the procedures to be followed for updating all annexes.
It is proposed that inclusion of POPs chemicals in Annex V should be subject to the same procedure.
Article 23 This Article provides that technical guidance documents will be drawn up to help in implementation.
Article 24 This Article outlines the committee procedures to be followed, using the committee established by Article 29 of Council Directive 67/548/EEC.
Articles 25 and 26 These two Articles relate respectively to references to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 in other legislation; and entry into force of the proposed new Regulation.
A short transitional period of 3 months is foreseen before entry into force of the Article 17 provisions relating to the mandatory use of code numbers in export declarations.
Annexes Annex I to the Regulation lists the chemicals subject to the different procedures and is based on that contained in Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 as amended by Commission Regulations 1213/2003, 775/2004 and 777/2006.
Annex IV sets out the information to be provided pursuant to Article 9 about trade in chemicals listed in Annex I.
Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals[11] implemented the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, hereinafter “the Convention”, which entered into force on 24 February 2004, and replaced Council Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 of 23 July 1992 concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals[12]. 2.
Accordingly, dangerous chemicals, whether in the form of a substance by itself or in a preparation, which have been banned or severely restricted by the Community as plant protection products, as other forms of pesticides, or as industrial chemicals for use by professional users or by the public, should be subject to similar export notification rules to those applicable to such chemicals when they are banned or severely restricted within either or both of the use categories laid down in the Convention, namely as pesticides or chemicals for industrial use.
This export notification procedure should apply to Community exports to all third countries, whether or not they are Parties to the Convention or participate in its procedures.
Furthermore, in order to prevent undesired exports no chemicals banned or severely restricted within the Community that meet the Convention criteria or that are covered under the international PIC procedure should be exported unless the explicit consent of the importing country concerned has been sought and obtained, whether or not that country is a Party to the Convention.
Nevertheless, it seems appropriate that articles containing chemicals that could be released under conditions of use or disposal and that are banned or severely restricted in the Community within one or more of the use categories laid down in the Convention or are subject to the international PIC procedure should also be subject to the export notification rules.
In accordance with the Convention, information on transit movements of chemicals subject to the international PIC procedure should be provided to Parties to the Convention requesting such information. 15.
In particular, technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition should be provided directly by the Commission and the Member States, or indirectly via support for projects by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), especially assistance seeking to enable those countries to implement the Convention. 18.
The objectives of this Regulation are the following: (a) to implement the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, hereinafter “the Convention”; (b) to promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts in the international movement of hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm; (c) to contribute to their environmentally sound use.
In addition to the objectives referred to in paragraph 1, this Regulation shall ensure that the provisions of Council Directive 67/548/EEC[17], and of Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [18], regarding the classification, packaging and labelling of chemicals dangerous to man or to the environment when they are placed on the market in the Community also apply to all such chemicals when they are exported from the Member States to other parties or other countries, unless these provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those parties or other countries.
The participation of the Community in the Convention shall be a joint responsibility of the Commission and the Member States in particular for technical assistance, information exchange and matters relating to dispute settlement, participation in subsidiary bodies and voting. 36.
As far as the participation of the Community in the Convention is concerned, for the administrative functions of the Convention with reference to the PIC procedure and the export notification, the Commission shall act as a common designated authority on behalf of all the Designated National Authorities in close cooperation and consultation with the Designated National Authorities of the Member States.
The Commission shall in particular, be responsible for the following: (a) the transmission of Community export notifications to Parties and other countries pursuant to Article 7; (b) the submission to the Secretariat of the Convention, hereinafter “the Secretariat”, of notifications of relevant final regulatory actions pursuant to Article 10; (c) the transmission of information about other final regulatory actions not qualifying for PIC notification in accordance with Article 11; (d) the receiving of information from the Secretariat more generally.
The Commission shall also provide the Secretariat with Community import responses for chemicals subject to the PIC procedure pursuant to Article 12.
In addition, the Commission shall coordinate the Community input on all technical issues related to any of the following: (a) the Convention; (b) the preparation of the Conference of the Parties established by Article 18 of the Convention, hereinafter “the Conference of the Parties”; (c) the Chemical Review Committee established in accordance with Article 18(6) of the Convention, hereinafter “the Chemical Review Committee”; (d) other subsidiary bodies.
Article 6 Chemicals subject to export notification, qualifying for PIC notification, and subject to the PIC procedure 38.
The chemicals covered by the provisions of this Regulation relating to export notification, PIC notification and the PIC procedure respectively shall be as listed in Annex I. 39.
Chemicals in Annex I shall be assignable to one or more of three groups of chemicals, set out respectively as Parts 1, 2 and 3 of Annex I.
The chemicals listed in Part 2 of that Annex shall, in addition to being subject to the export notification procedure under Article 7, qualify for the PIC notification procedure laid down in Article 10, with detailed information being given on the identity of the substance and on the use category.
The chemicals listed in Part 3 of that Annex shall be subject to the PIC procedure with the use category being given and, where appropriate, additional information, in particular on any requirements for export notification. 40.
The lists referred to in paragraph 2 shall be made available to the public by electronic means.
In the case of substances listed in Part 1 of Annex I or preparations containing such substances in a concentration that could to trigger labelling obligations under Directive 1999/45/EC irrespective of the presence of any other substances, paragraphs 2 to 8 shall apply. 42.
When an exporter is due to export a chemical as referred to in paragraph 1 from the Community to a Party or other country for the first time following the date as from which it becomes subject to this Regulation, the exporter shall notify the Designated National Authority of the Member State in which he is established, no later than 30 days before the export of the chemical is due to take place.
Where the export of a chemical relates to an emergency situation in which any delay may endanger public health or the environment in the importing Party or other country, the requirements of paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 may be waived wholly or partly at the discretion of the Designated National Authority of the exporting Member State, in consultation with the Commission. 46.
The obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall cease when the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the chemical has become a chemical subject to the PIC procedure; (b) the importing country being a Party to the Convention has provided a response in accordance with Article 10(2) of the Convention to the Secretariat whether to consent or not to consent to import of the chemical; (c) the Commission has been informed about the response by the Secretariat and has forwarded that information to Member States.
The obligations set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 shall also cease when the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) the appropriate authority of the importing Party or other country has waived the requirement to be notified before the export of the chemical; (b) the Commission has received the information from the Secretariat or from the appropriate authority of the importing Party or other country and has forwarded it to Member States and made it available on the Internet. 47.
The Commission, the relevant Designated National Authorities of the Member States and the exporters shall provide importing Parties and other countries with available additional information on the exported chemicals, when requested. 48.
Should the Designated National Authorities of the Member States receive any export notifications either directly or indirectly from the Designated National Authorities of Parties or relevant authorities of other countries, they shall immediately forward those notifications to the Commission together with all available information.
Each Member State shall provide the Commission each year with aggregated information in accordance with Annex IV.

Where further chemicals qualify for PIC notification and are added to Part 2 of Annex I, the Commission shall notify the Secretariat.
The notification shall provide all relevant information as required in Annex II. 57.
In determining priorities for notifications, the Commission shall take into account whether the chemical is already listed in Part 3 of Annex I, the extent to which the information requirements laid down in Annex II can be met, and the severity of the risks presented by the chemical, in particular for developing countries.
The Commission shall notify the Secretariat in writing when a final regulatory action notified under paragraphs 1 or 2 is amended as soon as possible after adoption of the new final regulatory action, and no later than 60 days after the date on which the new final regulatory action is required to be applied.
The Commission shall forward immediately to the Member States information that it receives from the Secretariat regarding chemicals notified as banned or severely restricted by other Parties.
Within four weeks Member States may send comments on a possible PIC notification, including in particular relevant information about their national regulatory position in respect of the chemical, to the Commission and the Member State, which submitted a national regulatory action.
provide the information to the Secretariat, pursuant to Article 11.
Article 11 Information to be transmitted to the Secretariat about banned or severely restricted chemicals not qualifying for PIC notification When a chemical is listed only in Part 1 of Annex I or following receipt of information from a Member State for the purposes of Article 10(8) second indent the Commission shall provide the Secretariat with information about the relevant regulatory actions, so that this information can be disseminated to other Parties to the Convention as appropriate.
Where a chemical is subject to additional or amended restrictions under Community legislation, the Commission shall revise the import decision in accordance with the advisory procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and communicate the revised import decision to the Secretariat. 65.
An import decision under paragraph 1 shall relate to the category or categories specified for the chemical in the Decision Guidance Document. 67.
Each Member State shall communicate the responses forwarded by the Commission under paragraph 1 to those concerned within its jurisdiction. 73.
Exporters shall comply with decisions in each import response no later than six months after the Secretariat has first informed the Commission of such response under paragraph 1. 74.
Substances listed in the Parts 2 or 3 of Annex I or preparations containing such substances in a concentration that could trigger labelling obligations under Directive 1999/45/EC irrespective of the presence of any other substances shall not be exported unless either of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) explicit consent to the import into the third country concerned has been sought and received by the exporter through his Designated National Authority via the Commission and the Designated National Authority of the importing Party or an appropriate authority in an importing other country; (b) in the case of chemicals listed in Part 3 of Annex I, the latest circular issued by the Secretariat pursuant to paragraph 1 indicates that the importing Party has given consent to import.
In the case of chemicals listed in part 2 of Annex I that are for export to OECD countries, the Designated National Authority of the exporter may, in consultation with the Commission, decide that no explicit consent is required if the chemical, at the time of importation into the OECD country concerned, is licensed, registered or authorised or that it has recently been used in, or imported into, that OECD country and no regulatory action has been taken to prohibit its use.
Where explicit consent has been sought pursuant to point (a), if the Commission or the Designated National Authority of the exporter has not received a response to its request within 30 days, the Commission shall send a reminder.
The Designated National Authority of the exporter may, in consultation with the Commission, decide that the export may proceed if, after all reasonable efforts, no response to a request for explicit consent pursuant to paragraph 6(a) has been received within either of the following time-limits: (a) 60 days, where there is evidence from official sources in the importing Party or importing other country that the chemical, at the time of importation, is licensed, registered or authorised or that it has recently been used in, or imported into, the importing Party or importing other country and no regulatory action has been taken to prohibit its use; (b) 90 days, in all other cases. 77.
The validity of each explicit consent obtained pursuant to paragraph 6(a) or waiver granted pursuant to paragraph 7 shall be subject to periodic review by the Commission in consultation with the Member States concerned as follows: (a) for each explicit consent obtained pursuant to paragraph 6(a) a new explicit consent shall be required by the end of the third calendar year after the consent was given, unless the terms of that consent require otherwise; (b) unless a response to a request has been received in the meantime, each waiver granted pursuant to paragraph 7(a) shall be for a maximum period of two calendar years, upon expiry of which explicit consent shall be required; (c) unless a response to a request has been received in the meantime, each waiver granted pursuant to paragraph 7(b) shall be for a maximum period of 12 months, upon expiry of which explicit consent shall be required.
In the cases referred to in points (a) and (b), exports may however continue beyond the expiry of the relevant period pending a response to a new request for explicit consent.
The Commission shall register all requests for explicit consent, responses obtained and waivers granted in its database.
No chemical shall be exported later than six months before its expiry date, when such a date exists or can be inferred from the production date, unless the intrinsic properties of the chemical render this impracticable.
Articles containing substances listed in Parts 2 or 3 of Annex I in unreacted form or preparations containing such substances in a concentration that could trigger labelling obligations under Directive 1999/45/EC irrespective of the presence of any other substances, shall be subject to the export notification procedure laid down in Article 7. 82.
Parties to the Convention requiring information on transit movements of chemicals subject to the PIC procedure, together with the information requested by each Party to the Convention through the Secretariat, shall be as listed in Annex VI. 84.
