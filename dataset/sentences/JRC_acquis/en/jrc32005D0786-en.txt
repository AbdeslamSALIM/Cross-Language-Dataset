Germany submitted further information by letter dated 26 August 2004, registered on the same day.
It was set up in 1994 for the purpose of acquiring, as part of a privatisation, the phosphorus-based products division of Stickstoffwerke AG Wittenberg Piesteritz (Stickstoffwerke).
Stickstoffwerke was a manufacturer of chemical products brought under the Treuhandanstalt (THA), a public-law body responsible for the privatisation and restructuring of enterprises of the former German Democratic Republic. (11) The privatisation took place on 29 June 1994 following a tender organised by Goldmann Sachs.
The owners of CWP were Vopelius GmbH, URSEKO GmbH, Phosphor AG (Kazakhstan) and eight private investors.
The privatisation was conditional on a capital increase by Phosphor AG from DEM 30000 to DEM 1,6 million.
This capital increase did not take place and the shares of URSEKO GmbH and Phosphor AG were taken over by Vopelius GmbH and six employees of CWP.
Germany states that the privatisation contract was declared legally effective on 30 November 1994. (12) The following data on CWP’s operation have been submitted by Germany: Table 1 [5] (in DEM million) | | 1996/97 | 1997/98 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | Annual turnover | 18,8 | 26,3 | 6,2 | 33,0 | 31,2 | Operating result | – 4,8 | – 4,1 | – 7,2 | – 5,0 | – 4,1 | Employees | 80 | 99 | 100 | 100 | 97 | (13) According to Germany, CWP has had a registered capital of EUR 288880 (DEM 0,565 million) since December 1998.
Chemische Werke Piesteritz KG (24,8 %). (14) Vopelius Chemie AG and Vopelius GmbH, together with Galvano Chemie Leipzig GmbH and Vopelius-Bioprodukte GmbH [6], which are subsidiaries of Vopelius Chemie AG, form an integrated group (the group).
Mr Thilo von Vopelius is the chairman of the board of directors of Vopelius Chemie AG.
According to information submitted by Germany following the information injunction, the group (excluding CWP) employed 43 people in 2002, generated a turnover of EUR 17252657 (DEM 33,755 million) and held assets totalling EUR 6777174 (DEM 13,255 million).
It holds 24,8 % of CWP’s capital and is regarded by Germany as an institutional partner. (16) In February 2001 CWP sold its assets linked to the production of phosphates to […]* [8] (TI), a producer of phosphorus and phosphorus derivatives.
In the case of a positive Commission decision, the successor to the THA, the Bundesanstalt für vereiningungsbedingte Sonderaufgaben (BvS) and the Land of Saxony-Anhalt will waive the securities linked to the assets which will be taken over by TI so that the condition of the assets being free of liabilities would be fulfilled and the sales contract could become effective.
CWP also committed itself to guaranteeing 70 jobs until 1 October 1999 and to carrying out investments of EUR 5112919 (DEM 10 million) by 31 December 2002. (18) In turn, the THA made available several measures.
The loan was originally granted by Deutsche Bank before being transferred to Commerzbank in 1996 and then to Hypovereinsbank in 1998. (20) Measure 1a: Originally, the guarantee under Measure 1 was to run until December 1995.
However, following the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany reported that, as a result of various amendments to the privatisation contract, this guarantee was prolonged several times, on the last occasion until 30 November 2000.
Before expiry of the deadline, on 21 November 2000, BvS granted CWP a loan for the same amount in order to repay the credit covered by the guarantee.
The loan then replaced the existing credit and the guarantee was terminated.
Germany stated that this new loan was to run until 31 December 2005 and that the interest rate corresponded to the reference rate set by the Commission [9].
Financial measures notified by Germany in 1997 (23) The first amendments to the privatisation contract provided, among other things, for the prolongation of the guarantee under Measure 1 (Measure 1a) and the deferred payment of the purchase price. (24) A further agreement was reached at the end of 1996/beginning of 1997 between the company and the BvS in order to avoid the insolvency of CWP.
It provided for a series of measures by the public authorities which constituted the core of the 1997 notification.
Table 3 (in EUR million) | Measures by the THA/BvS | Amount | 4 | Waiver of purchase price | 3,18 | 5 | Waiver of interest on deferral of purchase price | 0,23 | 6 | Investment grant | 1,79 | 7 | 20 % guarantee covering private investment loan of DEM 6,3 million | 0,64 | 8 | 20 % guarantee covering private operating loan of DEM 8,5 million | 0,87 | 7a/8a | Transformation of guarantees into loans/grants | (1,51) | Measures by the Land of Saxony-Anhalt | 9 | 80 % guarantee covering private investment loan of DEM 6,3 million | 2,58 | 10 | 80 % guarantee covering private operating loan of DEM 8,5 million | 3,47 | Measures under approved aid schemes | 11 | Direct investment grants (joint Federal Government/Länder scheme) of 8 July 1998 | 1,94 | 12 | Investment allowances (1994-97) | 0,15 | Total | 14,85 | (25) Measure 4: Under this agreement, the BvS agreed in December 1996 to a further deferral until 31 December 1999 of the payment of the purchase price, which had already been deferred on several occasions under amendments to the privatisation contract.
Following the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany stated that, of the EUR 5133370 (DEM 10,04 million) granted in total to finance investment (Measures 2 and 6), only EUR 4867499 (DEM 9,52 million) had been used.
This loan was covered by a 20 % guarantee from the BvS for EUR 644228 (DEM 1.26 million).
The remaining 80 % was covered by a guarantee from the Land of Saxony-Anhalt (see Measure 9).
This loan was covered by a 20 % guarantee from the BvS for EUR 869196 (DEM 1,7 million).
The remaining 80 % was covered by a guarantee from the Land of Saxony-Anhalt (see Measure 10).
Hence, for the banks it merely replaces existing securities, but for CWP it constitutes a new loan replacing 20 % of the previous ones.
CWP is supposed to pay the amount of EUR 1513424 (DEM 2,96 million) by 31 December 2005, together with interest corresponding to the Commission’s reference rate.
However, in its response to the information injunction, Germany reported that since January 2003 CWP had not paid any interest and that the payments had been deferred.
Interest accumulated until December 2002 and amounting to EUR 301000 (DEM 588705) was paid in July 2003.
In the event of a positive Commission decision in this case, the Land of Saxony-Anhalt would consider a further prolongation of the guarantee. (32) Measure 10: The remaining amount of the investment loan of EUR 4345981 (DEM 8,5 million) under Measure 8 was also covered by an 80 % guarantee from the Land of Saxony-Anhalt amounting to EUR 3476785 (DEM 6,8 million).
The guarantee runs until April 2013. (33) Measure 11: Direct investment grants amounting to EUR 1937796 (DEM 3,79 million) were made on 8 July 1998.
The restructuring (35) According to the information provided by Germany in 1997, a first restructuring effort had been undertaken in the wake of privatisation with the THA measures (Measures 1 to 3).
As regards supplies, CWP counted on using elemental phosphorus as the raw material for the production of phosphoric acid, which, in turn, is the basis for the production of phosphates.
The original restructuring plan (37) In order to restore the company’s long-term viability, a sound restructuring plan was necessary.
The plan envisaged mainly investments in a new production process (the wet process). (38) Until 1996 CWP’s production was made up above all of common phosphates (low level of purity) used primarily in detergents.
These documents contradicted the 1997 notification. (40) The first document, dated 29 May 1996 and headed "A new concept for continuing the business of CWP as the company that acquired the phosphorus derivatives division of Stickstoffwerke AG Wittenberg" sums up CWP’s restructuring strategy.
Amendment of the plan (42) In its response to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany explained that the technical plan for the construction of the extraction installation had been amended and expanded.
The costs of the extraction installation rose from EUR 3,07 million (DEM 6 million) to EUR 7,772 million (DEM 15,1 million). (43) Furthermore, in 2000 CWP faced a problem with raffinate, a highly toxic by-product.
This danger was finally averted by an agreement with TI. (44) The agreement, which was reached in early 2001, provided for the sale of the phosphate production to TI, as described above.
CWP’s workforce is to be reduced by some 33 people. (45) Germany considers that the restructuring of CWP was successfully accomplished in respect of phosphate production, which is to be taken over by TI.
As regards the production of phosphoric acid, the restructuring will be successful once TI has paid the purchase price for CWP’s assets.
According to Germany, 90 % of the extraction installation has already been completed.
Costs of the restructuring (46) According to the document "Proposal for the long-term survival of CWP, including the investment and financing plan", dated 16 October 1996, CWP needed investments totalling EUR 5,62 million (DEM 11 million) and working capital amounting to EUR 2,56 million (DEM 5 million) during the period 1996 to 2000.
According to the 1997 notification, restructuring costs would total EUR 12,88 million (DEM 25,2 million).
The restructuring measures notified in 1997 are summarised in Table 4.
Table 4 (in EUR million) | Restructuring measures | Costs | Loss compensation (1995 to 1998) | 4,91 | Investments in safety | 2,15 | Restructuring investment | 5,52 | Clean-up of environmental damage dating from before 1 July 1990 | 0,31 | Total | 12,88 | (47) Following the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, those same costs were estimated at EUR 18,87 million (DEM 36,9 million).
It should be noted that Table 5 contains two new items, i.e. "grants" and "waiver of purchase price", which constitute financial resources rather than restructuring costs.
Table 5 (in EUR million) | Restructuring measures | Costs | Loss compensation (1995 to 1998) | 4,86 | Investments in safety | 2,05 | Restructuring investments | 7,98 | Cleaning-up of environmental damage dating from before 1 July 1990 | 0,31 | Grants | 0,20 | Waiver of purchase price | 3,43 | Total | 18,87 | (48) In its response to the information injunction, Germany divided the restructuring into two parts: restructuring of phosphate production and restructuring of the other areas (mainly phosphoric acid production).
The costs of restructuring the other business areas were estimated at EUR 27,14 million (DEM 53,08 million) in total and include investments of EUR 13,22 million (DEM 25,86 million).
Private contribution (50) According to the 1997 notification, the private contribution from CWP to the restructuring consisted in the financing of certain investments and a contribution from the shareholders. (51) CWP was to carry out investments totalling EUR 5,11 million (DEM 10 million) by 31 December 2002.
However, it is to be noted that this investment obligation had already been agreed at the time of the privatisation on 29 June 1994 and did not require these investments to be financed by private means. (52) In its response to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany stated that investments amounting to EUR 15,70 million (DEM 30,70 million) had been made during the period 1994 to 2000 and that, of those investments, EUR 7,21 million (DEM 14,11 million) had been privately financed.
In its response to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany explained that this amount related to the hire purchase (Mietkauf) of investment goods for which Vopelius provided a guarantee. (54) In its response to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany also considered that the company’s subscribed capital of EUR 288879 (DEM 0,565 million) must be regarded as a contribution from the shareholders to the financing of the investments. (55) In its response to the information injunction, Germany listed the measures which, in its view, constituted private financing (Table 6).
Table 6 (in EUR million) | Private financing | Amount | Limited partner’s capital contribution (BVT) | 4,84 | Shareholder loan (BVT) | 0,15 | Shareholder grant (BVT) | 0,11 | Share capital | 0,29 | Sales price — salt | 1,64 | Sales price — saltworks (not yet paid) | 1,66 | Supplier credit (Vopelius) | 2,75 | Total | 11,44 | (56) The increase in private financing, as notified by Germany, is due mainly to the capital contribution from BVT, which became a non-typical silent partner in CWP (atypische stille Beteiligung) in December 1998.
BVT also provided a loan in March 2001 and a grant in September 2001.
In addition, Germany included as investor contributions a supplier credit by Vopelius (which was made available between January 1997 and January 1998 and consisted in deferral of the payment for raw materials supplied by Vopelius) and the revenues that CWP would obtain from the sale of its phosphate division to TI. (57) It is unclear how the measures in Table 6 relate to the restructuring costs described in recitals 46 to 49.
It should be noted that the phosphoric acid produced with the wet process is equivalent in quality and properties to that produced with the thermal process.
However, the two processes actually use a different raw material: elemental phosphorus for the thermal process and MGA for the wet process.
Germany also states that TI has not been active on the specific phosphate market like CWP but on the market for phosphorus, phosphoric acids and other derivatives. (63) As regards the production of phosphoric acid, CWP states that its production of 40000 tonnes of thermal phosphoric acid is to be reduced to 20000 tonnes using the extraction process.
Its originally foreseen share of the phosphoric acid market (6 %) is to be reduced to 3 % in Western Europe.
REASONS FOR INITIATING THE FORMAL INVESTIGATION PROCEDURE (64) Following an action for annulment brought by Prayon-Rupel, the CFI in its judgment of 15 March 2001 annulled the Commission decision of 16 December 1997 [14] on the grounds of infringement of an essential procedural requirement.
It ruled that the Commission had been obliged to initiate the formal investigation procedure because of serious difficulties in assessing the compatibility of the aid with the common market. (65) The CFI put the serious difficulties down to the fact that the Commission had taken the decision without sufficient knowledge of the technical restructuring measures.
However, the CFI emphasised that the two draft restructuring plans of May and October 1996, submitted by Germany to the Commission, did not mention any abandonment of the thermal process.
Secondly, a preliminary assessment under the 1994 Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (Community guidelines) [15] raised serious doubts as to the compatibility of the aid with the common market.
REASONS FOR ISSUING THE INFORMATION INJUNCTION (67) The Commission initiated the investigation procedure mainly on the basis of the information submitted in 1997.
In addition, measures which had been regarded until then as ad hoc measures were regarded by Germany as existing aid following the initiation of the procedure (Measures 9 and 10).
Prayon-Rupel also considered that there was no supply problem, as the company could obtain phosphorus from China, the world’s largest producer, instead of from Kazakhstan. (70) Secondly, Prayon-Rupel doubted the viability of the restructuring plan.
According to Prayon-Rupel, a change in the production method not backed by sufficient investment would only lead to lower-quality products and hence to a further fall in profits. (71) Thirdly, Prayon-Rupel considered that CWP was expanding capacity.
According to Prayon-Rupel, this amounted to a doubling of capacity. (72) Fourthly, Prayon-Rupel considered that the aid was not limited to the minimum and that the commitment of the shareholders to invest EUR 5,11 million (DEM 10 million) following privatisation was not linked to the restructuring but was hypothetical and insufficient. (73) Lastly, Prayon-Rupel doubted that the plan would be implemented in full.
In its view, the acquisition by TI of CWP’s phosphate production already confirmed that the plan had not been implemented as planned.
Comments from Chemische Fabrik Budenheim A.
Oetker (74) In its letter of 20 August 2001, Chemische Fabrik Budenheim A.
CFB also noted that TI successfully produced phosphoric acid using the thermal process, refuting the claim that a change in the production process was necessary for CWP to restore its profitability.
Comments from BK Giulini (77) In its letter of 26 September 2001, BK Giulini considered that CWP did not have any restructuring plan and that the concept was inadequate and disproportionate.
The change in the production process was not necessary and, from a technical and economic point of view, was impracticable.
Another argument against the aid for CWP was overcapacity on the phosphoric acid market in Europe. (78) BK Giulini also states that the aid granted by Germany had demonstrably not contributed to restoring CWP’s viability.
The agreement between CWP and TI was evidence of the complete failure of the restructuring measures. (79) Lastly, BK Giulini considered that TI was the actual beneficiary of the aid.
Comments from CWP (80) By letters of 21 September 2001 and 6 February 2002, Germany gave the reaction of CWP to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure.
By letter of 8 October 2002, in which Germany transmitted CWP’s reaction to the comments from the above-mentioned interested parties, CWP addressed the doubts expressed by the Commission when initiating the formal investigation procedure and by all the other interested parties. (81) As regards the existence of a restructuring plan, CWP explained that the restructuring had two main objectives: extension of the product range in the area of phosphates and establishment of a broader raw material base by procuring cheaper alternatives to phosphorus.
It stated that these objectives had remained unchanged throughout the restructuring process although the plan had indeed been amended on several occasions. (82) As regards the doubts as to the viability of the restructuring measures, CWP considered that extension of the phosphate product range could be achieved by the construction of a new fluidised-bed dryer (Wirbelschichttrockner) for the production of water-free phosphates.
Regarding this extension, it stated that the extraction installation would allow it to produce the same products with the same quality and at lower costs than with the thermal process, without becoming dependent on supplies of elemental phosphorus by third parties. (83) Responding to CFB’s comment that TI successfully produced phosphoric acid using the thermal process, CWP pointed out that TI was not dependent on supplies of elemental phosphor as this is produced by the company itself.
Hence the situations of TI and CWP were quite different. (84) As regards the doubts as to the success of the restructuring plan, CWP considered that the measures undertaken represented a classical restructuring of a company.
In particular, the extraction installation was expected to reduce production costs by 7 % compared with the thermal process and to achieve a net capital yield of 23 %.
The first tests with the extraction installation had confirmed that the quality of the phosphoric acid produced was as good as that using the thermal process.
Moreover, CWP noted that other competitors, notably Prayon-Rupel, had announced the construction of an extraction installation six times larger than CWP’s.
CWP stated that this installation was now 90 % complete and that one institution was interested in obtaining a licence for the know-how. (85) Furthermore, CWP considered that there were no distortions of competition.
Moreover, CWP’s market share on the relevant markets, as described in recitals 62 and 63, was insignificant.
CWP also stated that it never sold below market prices. (86) CWP went on to state that BK Giulini was not a direct competitor.
The company, which produced special phosphates, had bought more than two thirds of CWP’s phosphate production in 2000 and was interested in taking over CWP’s production of phosphoric acid and phosphates.
In CWP’s view, the aid had not had any impact on BK Giulini. (87) As regards the private contribution to the restructuring, CWP stated that it was not able to finance the restructuring plan fully out of its own funds because of the high raw material costs.
According to CWP, by the end of 2002 privately financed investments amounted to EUR 5,11 million (DEM 10 million).
All the loans granted to the company, including those guaranteed by the BvS and the Land, were to be regarded as a private contribution to the restructuring since CWP paid interest and intended to repay them by selling the assets linked to phosphate production to TI. (88) As regards the identification of the aid beneficiary, CWP stated that it has not been incorporated into TI.
After the sale of the phosphate division to TI, there will be two independent companies operating on CWP’s site, with TI being active in the phosphate business and CWP in phosphoric acid production.
Contrary to the opinion of CFB, CWP had never supplied any thermal phosphoric acid to TI.
Moreover, CWP was the sole beneficiary of the aid.
COMMENTS FROM GERMANY (89) In its response to the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany submitted information on the amendments to the restructuring plan, as described in recitals 42 to 44.
It also provided information on all financial measures taken by the public authorities and made available to the company during privatisation and throughout the restructuring period, as described in recitals 17 to 34.
As regards the comments from third parties, Germany refers to CWP’s reaction, which was reported by letter of 8 October 2002. (90) In its response to the information injunction, Germany provided information on the compatibility of existing aid measures with the schemes under which they had purportedly been awarded.
The compatibility of these measures with the schemes under which they were allegedly granted should though be examined. (97) Measures 1, 2 and 3: As the company had some 70 employees at the time of privatisation, Germany regards any aid granted within this context as being covered by THA scheme N 768/94 [17].
The Commission acknowledges that the company had fewer than 250 employees at the time of privatisation.
These measures do not, therefore, need to be notified to the Commission and are to be regarded as constituting existing aid. (98) Measure 1a: As the granting of the guarantee is covered by the THA scheme, the possibility of converting this guarantee into a loan or grant had been envisaged from the outset because the company was already in difficulties.
Conversion of the guarantee into a loan and grant was already covered by the THA scheme and cannot therefore be classified as new aid. (99) Measures 9 and 10: After the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, Germany stated for the first time that these guarantees had been granted under a scheme approved by the Commission for the rescue and restructuring of firms in difficulty [19].
This explains why Measures 9 and 10 comply with the rescue and restructuring scheme but are not in accordance with the Community guidelines.
In its response to the information injunction, Germany stated that it would ensure that the rules on cumulation were complied with in respect of regional aid granted to CWP and that the maximum regional aid ceiling for SMEs was respected.
In its response to the information injunction, Germany stated that it would ensure that the rules on cumulation were complied with in respect of regional aid granted to CWP and that the maximum regional aid ceiling for SMEs was respected.
In addition, the aid measure was not taken into consideration when the formal investigation procedure was initiated. (102) Accordingly, the Commission considers that on the basis of the information provided, Measures 1 (including 1a), 2 and 3 as well as Measures 9, 10, 11 and 12 constitute existing aid which need not be reassessed by the Commission.
It should be recalled here that CWP was on the verge of insolvency in 1997 and that no private investor was willing at that time to provide CWP with the financial means it needed.
As CWP’s products are also traded and as its competitors are present in other Member States, the measures threaten to distort competition and affect trade between Member States. (104) The measures are financed through State resources and granted by the THA/BvS and the Land of Saxony-Anhalt.
However, this would be relevant only if Measures 7 and 8 constituted existing aid, which is not the case.
Since Measures 7 and 8 are to be regarded as ad hoc measures, Measures 7a and 8a are, as part of Measures 7 and 8, included in the assessment of compatibility. (107) The guarantees under Measure 7 (including Measure 7a) and under Measure 8 (including Measure 8a) enabled CWP to obtain loans on better financial terms than those normally available on the financial markets.
The aid element of the BvS loans under Measures 7 (including Measure 7a) and Measure 8 (including Measure 8a) thus consists in the difference between the interest rate that CWP would have been able to obtain for such a loan on the market and the interest rate at which the loans were provided by the BvS.
The Commission takes the view that CWP would have had to pay an interest rate at least equal to the reference interest rate plus 400 basis points.
Compatibility (109) Measures 4, 5, 6, 7 (including 7a) and 8 (including 8a) are to be assessed by the Commission as ad hoc aid.
As the primary objective of the aid is not regional development but the restoration of the long-term viability of an undertaking in difficulty, only restructuring aid could be authorized in the present case.
Restoration of viability (116) The sine qua non of all restructuring plans is that they must restore the long-term viability of the company within a reasonable time scale and on the basis of realistic assumptions as to its future operating conditions.
Among other things, it takes into account the circumstances giving rise to the difficulties. (117) It is to be noted that, in the case of CWP, a first restructuring had been undertaken following privatisation but it failed.
A second restructuring based on the two documents referred to in recitals 40 and 41 was undertaken in 1997.
In order to determine whether the 1996 strategy was viable, the measures for introducing the wet process need to be assessed. (118) As the expert report submitted by Prayon-Rupel demonstrates, the new production process cannot be introduced by way of minor adjustments to the existing installations.
Pre-treatment was introduced in December 1997, when the project was already operational, after tests in the laboratory had shown it to be necessary.
The DLM study on the feasibility of the installation dated November 1997 also mentions the necessary pre-treatment of wet phosphoric acid during the wet process.
However, the Commission cannot share this view: the contract between CWP and its supplier was dated July 1998, whereas the project was conceived in 1996.
This again should have been anticipated from the outset. (119) Moreover, the 1996 documents constituting the restructuring plan did not contain an adequate solution for the highly toxic raffinate.
It should have been clear already at the conception phase of the plan in 1996 that a solution had to be found for the toxic raffinate.
If the solution were to sell it, then an appropriate market study should have been conducted in order to establish whether this was feasible.
Germany, however, does not share this view and presented a study by DLM on the costs of the extraction installation.
This study does not then alter the view that the costs of the investment programme and, in particular, of the extraction installation were not carefully planned when the restructuring strategy was decided on.
The extraction installation was supposed to cost EUR 3,07 million (DEM 6 million) in 1996 but the cost had risen to EUR 7,72 million (DEM 15,1 million) by 2000/2001, when the work was interrupted owing to a lack of liquidity.
The overall investment, which had been put at for EUR 7,67 million in 1996, had risen to EUR 17,93 million by 2000/2001. (121) The inevitable consequence of the lack of any real planning for the restructuring measures and the investment costs was that the extraction installation was not completed by 1998 and CWP had not restored its long-term viability by 2000 as initially envisaged.
Finally, the Commission notes that CWP is not a major player on what is a difficult and highly concentrated market dominated by large firms such as Rhodia, Astaris, Prayon and TI.
In addition, the Commission considers that the 1996 strategy, for which the aid was granted, failed completely in 2000 and that there is no guarantee of CWP’s continued survival.
Moreover, the form in which the aid is granted must be such as to avoid providing the company with surplus cash which would be used for aggressive, market-distorting activities not linked to the restructuring process. (127) According to the figures submitted by Germany in 1997, the costs of the restructuring should amount to EUR 12,88 million (see Table 4).
In its response to the initiation of the investigation procedure, Germany indicated that the overall costs of the restructuring totalled EUR 18,87 million (see Table 5). (128) As regards the contribution of the beneficiary to the restructuring, the 1997 notification identified two items: financing of investments of EUR 5,11 million (DEM 10 million) and contribution from the shareholders of originally EUR 0,15 million (DEM 0,3 million).
As noted in the decision to initiate the formal investigation procedure, the investment obligation was a requirement of the privatisation in 1994, which had been agreed two years before the restructuring started, and not a contribution to the 1996 restructuring.
And so this obligation cannot be considered as a private investor contribution to the 1996 restructuring. (129) The State-guaranteed loans cannot be considered as a private investor contribution as claimed by CWP. (130) In its response to the information injunction, Germany lists a supplier credit from Vopelius as a private investor contribution.
It should be noted that this item does not constitute a credit as such but consists in deferral for several weeks of the payment by CWP for raw material supplies from Vopelius.
The amount of EUR 2,75 million indicated by Germany as a private investor contribution is an outstanding claim of Vopelius dated January 1998.
This short-term deferral of the payment of liabilities, which is not related to the financing of the restructuring costs, cannot be considered as a private contribution to the restructuring. (131) The other measures listed by Germany as private investor contribution in its response to the information injunction date from the period after 1998 and so are not related to the granting of the aid in late 1996/early 1997 or to the original restructuring plan. (132) Therefore, even if the Commission were to take into account the planned restructuring costs as originally notified by Germany (EUR 12,88 million) and to regard as private contributions the company’s subscribed capital of EUR 0,29 million and the shareholders’ contribution of EUR 0,15 million mentioned in the 1997 notification, the ratio of private contributions to the restructuring costs would amount to 3,4 %, which is manifestly insufficient, even when taking into account the previous practice regarding aid to companies in the Länder of eastern Germany. (133) Consequently, the condition of the aid being proportionate to the restructuring costs and benefits is not fulfilled.
In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 [24], where negative decisions are taken in cases of unlawful aid, the Commission has to decide that the Member State concerned must take all necessary measures unless this would be contrary to a general principle of Community law. (137) In the present case, all the aid measures, including those that were notified initially, have been granted and not authorised by a valid Commission decision.
The aid element of the guarantee is calculated as the difference between the reference interest rate plus 400 basis points and the interest rate at which the guaranteed loan was provided.
The aid element of the guarantee is calculated as the difference between the reference interest rate plus 400 basis points and the interest rate at which the guaranteed loan was provided.
The aid element of the loan is the difference between the reference interest rate plus 400 basis points and the interest rate at which the loan was provided by the BvS.
The loan under Measure 7 (including Measure 7a) and the loan under Measure 8 (including Measure 8a) shall be discontinued within two months following notification of this Decision. 2.
Interest shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 [27].
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.
