Those measures should therefore be adopted in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision. (11) The Commission should ensure complementarity and synergy with related Community initiatives and programmes, including, inter alia, by taking into account the work performed by other bodies. (12) This Decision lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure [8], for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure. (13) Since the objectives of this Decision, namely to promote safer use of the Internet and new online technologies and to fight against illegal content and content unwanted by the end-user, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States owing to the transnational character of the issues at stake and can, therefore, by reason of the European scale and effects of the actions, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
The programme shall be implemented in accordance with Annex III.
Participation in the programme may be opened to legal entities established in EFTA States which are contracting parties to the EEA Agreement, in accordance with the provisions of Protocol 31 to that Agreement. 3.
The decision to allow such participation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 4(2).

The Commission shall inform the Committee referred to in Article 4 of progress with the implementation of the programme.
