Rough rice in storage or sold for processing must not have a moisture content of more than 14 %.
In 1931 this Institute acquired a rice producer in the municipality of Villarboit (centre of the rice area in Baraggia) and used it as a research centre for the purpose of perfecting the specific features of production in the Baraggia area.
Rice was grown in the area defined in Baraggia in the early 17th century and was also recorded in notarised documents in 1606 in the Municipality of Salussola, which is part of the defined area.
