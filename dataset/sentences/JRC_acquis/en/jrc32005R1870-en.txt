Since 1 June 2001 the normal customs duty for imports of garlic falling within CN code 07032000 has consisted of an ad valorem customs duty of 9,6 % and a specific amount of EUR 1200 per tonne net.
However, a quota of 38370 tonnes free of specific duty was opened by an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Argentine Republic pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 for the modification of concessions with respect to garlic provided for in Schedule CXL annexed to the GATT, approved by Council Decision 2001/404/EC [2] (hereinafter the GATT quota).
The Agreement stipulates that the quota is to be divided up into 19147 tonnes for imports from Argentina (order numbers 09.4104 and 09.4099), 13200 tonnes for imports from China (order numbers 09.4105 and 09.4100) and 6023 tonnes for imports from other countries (order numbers 09.4106 and 09.4102). (2) Garlic may also be imported outside the GATT quota at the normal duty or on preferential terms under agreements concluded between the Community and certain third countries. (3) Garlic is an important product of the European Union’s fruit and vegetables sector, with an annual production of around 250000 tonnes in the EU.
The annual import from third countries is also significant, ranging from 60000 to 80000 tonnes.
The most appropriate objective level for the security is 5 % of the average additional duty applicable to imports of garlic falling within CN code 07032000. (18) To ensure that the GATT quota is managed properly, the measures to be taken by the Commission where the quantities of garlic of a specific origin or for a specific quarter covered by import licence applications exceed those fixed by Decision 2001/404/EC, added to the unused quantities from import licences previously issued, should be determined.
Such certificates of origin are to be issued by the competent national authorities in accordance with Articles 56 to 62 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. (22) All the necessary communications between Member States and the Commission pursuant to this Regulation should be specified, in particular for the purpose of administering tariff quotas, taking measures against fraud and monitoring the market. (23) Regulation (EC) No 565/2002, Commission Regulation (EC) No 228/2004 of 3 February 2004 laying down transitional measures applicable to Regulation (EC) No 565/2002 by reason of the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia [6] and Commission Regulation (EC) No 229/2004 of 10 February 2004 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 565/2002 as regards the dates for lodging the import licence applications for imports of garlic for the first quarter of the period 2004 to 2005 [7] .should be repealed.
In accordance with Decision 2001/404/EC, tariff quotas are hereby opened for imports into the Community of garlic falling within CN code 07032000 (hereinafter referred to as garlic), subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.
The ad valorem duty applicable to garlic imported under the quotas referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 9,6 %.
