Commission Regulation (EC) No 199/2006 of 3 February 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs as regards dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Regulation (EC) No 199/2006 of 3 February 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs as regards dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs (Text with EEA relevance) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food [1], and in particular Article 2(3) thereof, Whereas: (1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 [2] sets maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs. (2) %quot%Dioxins%quot% as referred to in this Regulation cover a group of 75 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) congeners and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners, of which 17 are of toxicological concern.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 different congeners which can be divided into two groups according to their toxicological properties: a small number exhibit toxicological properties similar to dioxins and are therefore often termed %quot%dioxin-like PCBs%quot%.
The SCF fixed a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.
The foodstuffs indicated in section 5 of Annex I must comply during that period with the maximum levels for dioxins and with the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.
Consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 to dispensing with the separate maximum level for dioxins. (9) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach throughout the Community.
By 31 March each year, Finland and Sweden shall communicate to the Commission the results of their monitoring of the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in fish from the Baltic region obtained in the preceding year and shall report on the measures taken to reduce human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs from fish from the Baltic region.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 4 November 2006.
