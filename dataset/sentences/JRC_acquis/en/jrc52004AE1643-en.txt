At its 413th plenary session, held on 15 and 16 December 2004 (meeting of 15 December), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 139 votes to one, with nine abstentions: 1.
UNHCR's 2003 report detailing the number of people and the populations of concern to it shows the full scale of the EU's commitments and obligations. 3.
However, the Committee would not view favourably a situation where reinforcement of capacities in the initial countries of reception or transit countries in the regions of origin led to EU Member States pulling back from their obligation to recognise legal refugee status or subsidiary protection status. 3.5 The Committee recommends that the harmonised procedures adopted by the Council on 29 April 2004 be implemented and revised, and that the present Communication avoids a drift towards the examination of applications in the regions of origin.
Brussels, 15 December 2004.
