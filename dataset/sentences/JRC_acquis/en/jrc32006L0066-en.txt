Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) Directive 2006/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators and repealing Directive 91/157/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof and Article 95(1) thereof in relation to Articles 4, 6 and 21 of this Directive, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of Regions [3], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [4], in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 22 June 2006, Whereas: (1) It is desirable to harmonise national measures concerning batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators.
However, it is also appropriate to take measures at Community level on the basis of Article 95(1) of the Treaty to harmonise requirements concerning the heavy metal content and labelling of batteries and accumulators and so to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market and avoid distortion of competition within the Community. (2) The Commission Communication of 30 July 1996 on the Review of the Community Strategy for Waste Management established guidelines for future Community waste policy.
Directive 91/157/EEC should therefore be revised and replaced in the interests of clarity. (5) In order to achieve its environmental aims, this Directive prohibits the placing on the market of certain batteries and accumulators containing mercury or cadmium.
This Directive should therefore set minimum collection and recycling targets for Member States.
It is appropriate to calculate the collection rate on the basis of average annual sales in preceding years, so as to have comparable targets for all Member States that are proportionate to the national level of battery and accumulator consumption. (15) Specific recycling requirements should be established for cadmium and lead batteries and accumulators in order to attain a high level of material recovery throughout the Community and to prevent disparities between Member States. (16) All interested parties should be able to participate in collection, treatment and recycling schemes.
In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. (27) This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation on safety, quality and health requirements and specific Community waste management legislation, in particular Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of-life vehicles [15] and Directive 2002/96/EC. (28) As regards producer responsibility, producers of batteries and accumulators and producers of other products incorporating a battery or accumulator are responsible for the waste management of batteries and accumulators that they place on the market.
Article 2 Scope 1.
Article 4 Prohibitions 1.
Without prejudice to Directive 2000/53/EC, Member States shall prohibit the placing on the market of: (a) all batteries or accumulators, whether or not incorporated into appliances, that contain more than 0,0005 % of mercury by weight; and (b) portable batteries or accumulators, including those incorporated into appliances, that contain more than 0,002 % of cadmium by weight. 2.
The prohibition set out in paragraph 1(a) shall not apply to button cells with a mercury content of no more than 2 % by weight. 3.
The Commission shall review the exemption referred to in paragraph 3(c) and submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council by 26 September 2010, together, if appropriate, with relevant proposals, with a view to the prohibition of cadmium in batteries and accumulators.
Article 5 Increased environmental performance Member States which have manufacturers established on their territory shall promote research and encourage improvements in the overall environmental performance of batteries and accumulators throughout their entire life cycle as well as the development and marketing of batteries and accumulators which contain smaller quantities of dangerous substances or which contain less polluting substances, in particular as substitutes for mercury, cadmium and lead.
Article 6 Placing on the market 1.
Article 7 Overarching objective Member States shall, having regard to the environmental impact of transport, take necessary measures to maximise the separate collection of waste batteries and accumulators and to minimise the disposal of batteries and accumulators as mixed municipal waste in order to achieve a high level of recycling for all waste batteries and accumulators.

In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2): (a) transitional arrangements may be laid down to address difficulties faced by a Member State in satisfying the requirements of paragraph 2 as a result of specific national circumstances; (b) a common methodology shall be established for the calculation of annual sales of portable batteries and accumulators to end-users by 26 September 2007.
Article 11 Removal of waste batteries and accumulators Member States shall ensure that manufacturers design appliances in such a way that waste batteries and accumulators can be readily removed.
Article 12 Treatment and recycling 1.
Member States shall ensure that, no later than 26 September 2009: (a) producers or third parties set up schemes using best available techniques, in terms of the protection of health and the environment, to provide for the treatment and recycling of waste batteries and accumulators; and (b) all identifiable batteries and accumulators collected in accordance with Article 8 of this Directive or with Directive 2002/96/EC undergo treatment and recycling through schemes that comply, as a minimum, with Community legislation, in particular as regards health, safety and waste management.
Treatment shall meet the minimum requirements set out in Annex III, Part A. 3.
Recycling processes shall, no later than 26 September 2010, meet the recycling efficiencies and associated provisions set out in Annex III, Part B. 5.
Annex III may be adapted or supplemented to take account of technical or scientific progress in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 24(2).
In particular: (a) detailed rules regarding the calculation of recycling efficiencies shall be added no later than 26 March 2010; and (b) the minimum recycling efficiencies shall be evaluated regularly and adapted to best available techniques and in the light of the developments referred to in paragraph 1, second subparagraph. 7.
