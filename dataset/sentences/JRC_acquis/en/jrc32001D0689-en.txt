ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA 1.
Dishwashers with less than 10 place settings but more than five place settings shall have an energy efficiency index lower than 0,64 as defined in Annex IV to Directive 97/17/EC, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.
Dishwashers with five or fewer place settings shall have an energy efficiency index lower than 0,76 as defined in Annex IV to Directive 97/17/EC, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with this requirement. 2.
Water consumption The water consumption of the dishwasher (expressed as W(measured)) shall be lower or equal to the threshold as defined by the equation below using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC: W(measured) %amp%lt;= (0,625 × S) + 9,25 where: W(measured)= the measured water consumption of the dishwasher in litres per cycle, expressed to the first decimal, S= the applicable number of standard place settings of the dishwasher.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall take into consideration the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 50242. 3.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with this requirement. 4.
Noise (a) Airborne noise from the appliance, counted as sound power, shall not exceed 53 dB (A) for free standing models and 50 dB (A) for built-in models.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall take into consideration the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 50242. 5.
The applicant and/or his supplier or suppliers, as appropriate, shall indicate to this competent body which flame retardants, if any, have been used in or on plastic parts heavier than 25 grams. 6.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements. 7.
Appliance design (a) The appliance shall allow the user to select a program for washing a standard load using detergents that work best at temperatures lower than 65 °C. (b) The appliance shall have clear markings identifying the appropriate settings for the programmes available (e.g.
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements. 8.
Cleaning performance The dishwasher shall have a cleaning performance index of more than 1,00 as defined in Annex IV to Directive 97/17/EC, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.
The dishwasher will thus qualify for either cleaning performance class A or B as defined in Annex IV to Directive 97/17/EC.
The cleaning performance class indicated on the energy label shall correspond to this mean value.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall take into consideration the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 50242. 9.
Drying performance The dishwasher shall have a drying performance index of more than 0,93 as defined in Annex IV to Directive 97/17/EC, using the same test method EN 50242 and programme cycle as chosen for Directive 97/17/EC.
The dishwasher will thus qualify for either drying performance class A or B as defined in Annex IV to Directive 97/17/EC.
In case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall take into consideration the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 50242. 10.
The user shall be informed that the conduit between the warm water source and the dishwasher should be short and well insulated; (d) advice to adjust the salt dosing to the local water hardness, if applicable; (e) advice to use a full load whenever possible; (f) advice to avoid rinsing items before placing them in the dishwasher; (g) advice on the best use of the rinse and hold option, if available; (h) advice on the availability of detergents that work best at temperatures lower than 65 °C and have the potential to save energy; (i) advice on varying the detergent dose according to the type and amount of the load and its degree of soil (for example: a half load requires less detergent).
The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements, and shall provide a copy of the instruction manual to the competent body assessing the application. 11.
Information appearing on the eco-label Box 2 of the eco-label shall include the following text: - very low energy consumption, - low water consumption, - designed to facilitate recycling. (1) OJ L 118, 7.5.1997, p. 1. (2) OJ 196 16.8.1967, p.1.
