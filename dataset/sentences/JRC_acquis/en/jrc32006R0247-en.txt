Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 36, 37 and 299(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [1], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [3], Whereas: (1) The particular geographical situation of the outermost regions imposes additional transport costs in supplying products which are essential for human consumption, for processing or as agricultural inputs.
It is therefore appropriate to introduce specific supply arrangements to guarantee supply to the outermost regions and compensate for the additional costs arising from their remoteness, insularity and distant location. (2) To that end, notwithstanding Article 23 of the Treaty, imports of certain agricultural products from third countries should be exempt from the applicable import duties.
Moreover, Portugal will have the means under this Regulation to support local sugar beet production.
Given that the quantities that may be re-dispatched will be proportional and limited to the extent strictly necessary for ensuring the viability of local sugar production and processing, the temporary dispatching of sugar from the Azores will not adversely affect the internal market of the Community. (6) In the case of C sugar to supply the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, the arrangements for exemption from import duties provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2177/92 of 30 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the specific supply arrangements for the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands with regard to sugar [4] should continue to apply for the period laid down in Article 10(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [5]. (7) To date the Canary Islands have been supplied under the specific supply arrangements with milk-based preparations falling within CN codes 19019099 and CN codes 21069092 intended for industrial processing.
In line with the high dependence of the Azores on milk production, combined with other handicaps connected with their distant location and the absence of profitable alternative lines of production, the derogation from certain provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector [7], introduced by Article 23 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Azores and Madeira (Poseima) [8] and renewed by Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2004 [9] should be confirmed with respect to the application of the supplementary levy in the milk and milk products sector in the Azores. (19) Support for the production of cow's milk in Madeira has not succeeded in maintaining the balance between domestic and external supply, chiefly because of the serious structural difficulties affecting the sector and its poor capacity to adapt to new economic environments.
Consequently, authorisation to produce reconstituted UHT milk from milk powder of Community origin should continue, with a view to covering local consumption more fully. (20) The need to maintain local production by means of incentives justifies not applying Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 in the French overseas departments and Madeira.
For Madeira this exemption should be subject to a limit of 4000 tonnes, corresponding to the current production of 2000 tonnes and allowing for a reasonable possibility of increased production, estimated at present at a maximum of 2000 tonnes. (21) Traditional livestock farming activities should be supported.
The possibility opened under Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers [10] to enable Portugal to transfer rights to the suckler cow premium from the mainland to the Azores should be renewed and that instrument should be adjusted in line with the new support arrangements for the outermost regions. (22) Tobacco growing is of historical importance in the Canary Islands.
In addition, to maintain the manufacture of tobacco products, imports into the Canary Islands of raw and semi-manufactured tobacco should continue to be exempt from customs duty, up to an annual limit of 20000 tonnes of stripped raw tobacco equivalent. (23) Implementation of this Regulation must not jeopardise the level of special support from which the outermost regions have benefited up to now.
For that reason, so that they can carry out the appropriate measures, the Member States should have at their disposal sums equivalent to the support already granted by the Community under Council Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the French overseas departments (Poseidom) [11], Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 and Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands (Poseican) [12] and sums granted to farmers established in those regions under Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [13], Council Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 of 19 December 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat [14], Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [15] and sums granted for the supply of rice to the French overseas department of Réunion under Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice [16].
