(13) By fax dated 5 July 2004, the French authorities submitted to the Commission new calculations concerning the special business tax scheme.
DESCRIPTION (14) Only the special business tax scheme applicable to FT, as referred to in the opening decision, is the subject of this Decision. (15) Inasmuch as the measure under scrutiny has already been described in detail in the opening decision [7], a description will be included in this Decision only as far as is necessary. (16) Until 1990 inclusive, FT's business activities were conducted by a Directorate in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
However, contrary to this principle — which is enshrined, moreover, in Law No 90-568 itself [9] — the legislator introduced taxation rules derogating from the ordinary rules for FT (Articles 18-21 of Law No 90-568) in the form of two schemes: a "transitional" scheme applicable from 1 January 1991 to 1 January 1994, followed by a "definitive" scheme applicable indefinitely with effect from 1 January 1994: - 1991 to 1993: Article 19 of Law No 90-568 laid down the principle that, for a period lasting from 1 January 1991 until 1 January 1994, FT would be subject only to the duties and taxes actually borne by the State.
These contributions were fixed annually by the Finance Acts up to a certain amount [10]. - 1994 to 2003: Pursuant to Law No 90-568 (Article 18) and Article 1654 CGI, FT was subject to the ordinary tax system as from 1 January 1994, except for local direct taxation (property tax, business tax), with respect to which Law No 90-568 laid down special conditions concerning the rate, the basis and the taxation arrangements.
According to an initial estimate by the French authorities, the advantage derived by FT from the special business tax scheme that was applicable to it amounted to approximately EUR 198 million a year [11].
This special open-ended business tax scheme was abolished by the 2003 Finance Act [12].
The French authorities base this conclusion on the following three points: - between 1991 and 1993 inclusive, FT was subject to a levy for the benefit of the general budget which, according to the French authorities, was equivalent to payment of business tax and included (inter alia) the amount of the business tax itself; - the French authorities stress that Law No 90-568 established "once and for all" a single tax scheme applicable to FT from 1991 to 2003.
Lastly, at the meetings with the Commission on 16 and 23 June 2004, the French authorities questioned the validity of the calculations which they themselves had previously submitted to the Commission concerning the difference between the business tax paid by FT and that which it would have had to pay had it been subject to the rules of ordinary law.
Only the main findings of that analysis are reproduced in this Decision [13]: - FT received special treatment in relation to business tax (introduced by Articles 18-21 of Law No 90-568); - this special treatment conferred on it an advantage (according to the estimates of the French authorities themselves); - the special provisions on business tax applicable to FT were introduced by Parliament by means of a law promulgated by the President of the French Republic, which leaves no doubt as to the imputability of this measure to the State; - in so far as FT paid fewer taxes than companies subject to the rules of ordinary law, there is a use of public resources; - since FT operates in a very competitive sector, that of telecommunications, the advantages from which FT benefits distort or threaten to distort competition; - since FT operates in markets which were gradually opened to competition from the end of the 1980s, any advantage granted to FT by the State is likely to affect trade between Member States. 1.
The years 1991 to 1993 (22) To analyse the business tax scheme for the period 1991 to 1993, it is necessary to examine the first argument advanced by the French authorities, according to which the levy for the benefit of the general budget paid by FT from 1991 to 1993 was in the nature of a tax and can be considered equivalent to payment of business tax according to specific procedures.
Nor was the amount of the levy defined according to the parameters which determine the amount of the business tax. (24) Moreover, in the opening decision, the Commission pointed out that the amount of the lump sum paid by FT to the State by way of contribution to the general budget was equivalent to the profit which the PTT paid to the State in 1989 and 1990.
It considered, therefore, that the payment of this sum was akin more to a levy on FT's operating results than to individual taxation by way of business tax. (25) Before 1990, when FT's business activities were still being conducted by a Directorate in the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the budget of that Directorate was in surplus.
Law No 90-568 provided, in the same chapter entitled "Taxation" and in the same article, that FT did not have to pay any taxes (other than those paid by the State) and that it had to pay a levy for the benefit of the general budget, these two provisions being applicable during the same period (from 1 January 1991 to 1 January 1994). (29) Additionally, the levy possesses features which are typically those of a tax, namely a pecuniary payment collected definitively, without any counterpart and through authority by the State or another public entity.
Lastly, it procures resources for the State. (30) It would seem, therefore, that the objective of Article 19 of the Law was to establish a three-year transitional period during which FT would continue to pay to the State the same amounts as in the past by way of participation in the operating results and at the same time would be exempted from payment of all taxes (other than those paid by the State).
In other words, the special levy which FT paid to the State between 1991 and 1993 inclusive performed a dual function: it was tantamount in part to the payment of various taxes and — for the remainder — to participation by the State as owner of the company in the latter's results. (32) In the light of the above (and in particular of the partly tax-like nature of the levy and of the link between the levy and the specific tax scheme applicable to the company), even in the absence of explicit textual indications to the effect that the levy has to be considered a specific method of payment of business tax, the Commission concludes that during the years 1991 to 1993 inclusive the levy in question was tantamount in part to the payment of taxes, including the payment of business tax, and – for the remainder — to participation by the State as owner of the company in the latter's operating results. (33) In this connection it should be added that, according to the information submitted by the French authorities for the years 1991 to 1993 inclusive, the levy in question was larger than the taxes FT would have had to pay had it been subject to the ordinary business tax and corporation tax arrangements.
However, the Commission would point out that, during the years 1991 to 1993 inclusive, FT was subject only to the duties and taxes actually borne by the State (in particular it did not pay any property tax).
At the meetings with the Commission on 16 and 23 June 2004, the French authorities confirmed that the levy was indeed higher than the sum of all the other taxes.
Consequently, the Commission considers that FT did not benefit from any advantage during the period between 1991 and 1993 inclusive in so far as it was subject to a special levy of a mixed nature, being tantamount in part to the payment of various taxes and - for the remainder – to a levy on the operating results, which special levy was higher than the sum of the duties and taxes from which FT was exempted. 2.
The years 1994 to 2003 (34) In order to analyse the business tax scheme for the period 1994 to 2003, it is necessary to examine the second and third arguments advanced by the French authorities. (35) The French authorities stress that Law No 90-568 established "once and for all" a single tax scheme applicable to FT from 1991 to 2002 inclusive.
More precisely, the French authorities maintain that the undertaxation of FT for the "definitive" period ( 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2003) is offset by an overtaxation (due to the payment of the levy) during the "transitional" period ( 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1993).
This is claimed to be because the amount paid by FT to the State by way of the levy for the years 1991, 1992 and 1993 was so much higher than under the ordinary rules of taxation that it exceeded any advantage derived by FT from the specific arrangements for fixing the business tax during the "definitive" period. (36) This argument cannot be accepted.
Law No 90-568 established two clearly distinct taxation schemes: - a "transitional" scheme lasting from 1991 to 1994, during which time FT was exempted from all taxes other than those paid by the State and had to pay to the State a lump sum by way of a "levy for the benefit of the general budget"; - as from 1994, a scheme intended to be definitive (the Law did not lay down any end date for this scheme and in 2003 a new law was needed to abolish it); under this scheme, FT was subject under ordinary-law conditions to all taxes except property taxes and business tax, for which special conditions were laid down. (37) According to case law, aid given to a company cannot be offset by a specific charge imposed on the same company on another score.
The Court of Justice has thus held that a reduction in social security contributions pertaining to family allowances which benefits certain companies cannot be "made good" through an additional charge imposed on those same companies under the heading of unemployment insurance [17]. (38) In the light of this case law, the Commission cannot agree that the "undertaxation" of FT under the heading of business tax from 1994 onwards could be offset by the special levy paid by the company between 1991 and 1994, a levy which was not specifically connected with business tax.
As the Commission has already observed, Law No 90-568 does not provide that the special levy was due instead of business tax.
Moreover, the amount of this levy was defined, not according to the parameters which determine the amount of business tax, but by reference to the profit which the PTT paid to the State in 1989 and 1990.
This ought normally to have led the Commission to rule out any set-off and to consider that the non-payment of business tax during the "transitional" period also constituted a specific advantage conferred on the company. (39) It is by way of exception that the Commission has accepted that the levy paid by the company between 1991 and 1993 inclusive was also tantamount to payment of business tax.
Any offsetting between the amounts paid by FT by way of levies on operating surpluses and the undertaxation of FT under the heading of business tax would involve a confusing of levies of different types (tax credits with pecuniary gains), which is not admissible. (40) Lastly, the Commission notes that Law No 90-568 did not provide for any offsetting of the undertaxation of FT from 1994 onwards by an overtaxation for the years 1991 to 1994.
If the French authorities now propose to offset different types of levy (the special levy of a mixed type – being in the nature both of a tax and of a dividend – and the undertaxation of FT on the score of business tax) applicable to two separate periods, this is not at all due to the application of the normal taxation rules of French law, but involves an a posteriori rationalisation aimed at avoiding the recovery of the aid from which FT benefited. (41) In conclusion, the Commission cannot accept the French authorities' second argument according to which an overall calculation should be made of the advantage conferred by the scheme on FT throughout the period 1991 to 2002. (42) This means that the difference between the business tax actually paid by FT and that which should have been due under the ordinary law from 1 January 1994 to 1 January 2003 constitutes State aid inasmuch as it represents an advantage for FT granted through resources which would otherwise have been incorporated in the budget of the State. (43) Nor can the Commission accept the argument according to which business tax enters into the calculation of the taxable result and that the correction of any undertaxation under the heading of business tax should be accompanied by a downward correction of the amount of corporation tax since the arrangements for taxing the company under the headings of business tax and corporation tax are inseparable. (44) This argument has been rejected by the Court of First Instance, which has stated clearly that "… the Commission is not obliged, in its decisions ordering the recovery of State aid, to determine the incidence of tax on the amount of aid to be recovered, since that calculation falls within the scope of national law; it is merely required to indicate the gross sum to be recovered.
The exceptional business tax scheme was introduced by a law of 1990 (i.e.
They note that the scheme was introduced by Law No 90-568 of 2 July 1990 and consider that it was on 2 July 1990 (i.e.
Any aid with regard to which the limitation period has expired, shall be deemed to be existing aid". (48) It should be pointed out that the 10-year limitation period provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 "does not in any way express a general principle whereby new aid is transformed into existing aid but merely precludes recovery of aid established more then 10 years before the Commission first intervened" [21].
What matters, therefore, under the terms of the Regulation, is the date on which the individual aid was granted to the recipient under an aid scheme and not the date on which the scheme itself was introduced.
Law No 90-568 introduced an aid scheme for FT [22].
According to Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, "Any action taken by the Commission … with regard to the unlawful aid shall interrupt the limitation period".
The Court of First Instance has already held that a simple request for information can interrupt the limitation period provided for in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 [23].
In the present case, the first information request sent by the Commission to the French authorities concerning the special business tax scheme applicable to FT was dated 28 June 2001.
The Commission would stress that, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 122 and 123 of the opening decision, it considers that the aid is not compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 87(2) or (3)(a), (c) (with reference to the economic development of certain areas), (d) and (e).
CONCLUSION (53) In the light of the above, the Commission finds that: - The business tax scheme applicable during the period 1991 to 1993 does not constitute State aid. - The difference between the business tax actually paid by FT and that which would have been payable under the ordinary law from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2002 constitutes State aid.
They stressed that the back-calculation of this figure over previous years confirmed and strengthened their position as it would show the overtaxation of FT in relation to the ordinary-law position. (56) Lastly, at the meetings with the Commission on 16 and 23 June 2004, the French authorities maintained that the calculations previously submitted to the Commission were imprecise and that it was impossible to estimate for certain the amount of aid from which FT had benefited during the period 1994 to 2003.

The exact amount of aid to be recovered will be determined by the Commission, in collaboration with the French authorities, within the framework of the recovery procedure, at the latest by 1 November 2004. (60) In conclusion, the Commission considers that the specific business tax scheme applicable to FT between 1994 and 2003 procured it an advantage amounting to State aid in that it was undertaxed compared with the ordinary-law situation.
France shall take all necessary measures to recover from France Télécom the aid referred to in Article 1. 2.
The interest shall be calculated in conformity with the provisions laid down in Chapter V of Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 of 21 April 2004 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [26].
Article 3 France shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures that it proposes to take and that it has already taken to comply with it.
Article 4 This Decision is addressed to the French Republic.
