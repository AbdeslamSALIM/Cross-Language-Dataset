The basic Regulation does not foresee a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | Summary of the proposed action On 22 March 2005, the Commission initiated an investigation with regard to imports of DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea.
The Community industry in the original investigation consisted of two producers which accounted for the major proportion of the total Community production of DRAMs, Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany, and Micron Europe Ltd, Crowthorne, United Kingdom. 2.
Opening of an investigation (4) On 22 March 2005, by a notice (‘the notice’) published in the Official Journal of the European Union[3], the Commission announced the opening of an investigation with a view to determining to what extent special provisions may need to be adopted in accordance with Article 24(3) of the basic Regulation in order to ensure that the countervailing duty is correctly levied on imports of DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea. 4.
The product concerned also includes DRAMs presented in (non-customized) memory modules or (non-customized) memory boards, or in some other kind of aggregate form, provided the main purpose of which is to provide memory. (8) The product concerned is currently classifiable within CN codes 8542 21 11, 8542 21 13, 8542 21 15, 8542 21 17, ex 8542 21 01, ex 8542 21 05, ex 8548 90 10, ex 8473 30 10 and ex 8473 50 10.
Secondly, Binding Origin Information issued in 2003 concerned multi-combinational forms of DRAMs falling within CN code ex 8548 90 10 (TARIC code 8548 90 10*10), which were manufactured partly in the US and partly in the Republic of Korea.
The analysis covered the period running from May 2003 to May 2005 and was based on Comext statistics at TARIC code level. (23) With regard to the first category of the product concerned, it was established on the basis of information submitted by the Community industry that the operation of diffusion is currently taking place exclusively in the following countries outside the Community (in decreasing order of manufacturing capacity): the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, the US, Japan, Singapore and the People’s Republic of China.
ensuring the levy of the countervailing duty in case of lack of information or lack of co-operation by the declarant. (29) The special provision referred to under point a) of recital (28) should consist in a clearer description of the product concerned, singling out all different forms of DRAMs and mentioning explicitly mounted DRAMs. (30) The special provisions referred to under points b) and c) of recital (28) should take the form of a reference number to be indicated by the declarant in box 44 of the Single Administrative Document (‘SAD’) at the moment of the customs declaration for release into free circulation of the imported DRAM.
Moreover, any additional document would put an undue burden on the declarant in case of imports of DRAMs in the manufacture of which no company subject to the countervailing duty has intervened. (32) The product/origin descriptions falling under numbers 2 to 7 should, on the contrary, be accompanied by a statement issued by the last manufacturer of the DRAM and submitted by the declarant together with the SAD at the moment of the customs declaration for release into free circulation, in conformity with the text provided in the Annex.
With a view to simplifying the customs procedure and the application of the appropriate duty rates corresponding to that value, the following six levels of duty rates should be established, each corresponding to the following numbers of product/origin descriptions: - No 2: a duty rate of 0% should apply; - No 3: a duty rate of 3,4% should apply; - No 4: a duty rate of 6,9% should apply; - No 5: a duty rate of 10,4% should apply; - No 6: a duty rate of 13,9% should apply; - No 7: a duty rate of 17,4% should apply. (34) Each level of duty rate established in recital (33) corresponds to the lowest percentage (foreseen for the relevant range of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs) applied to the countervailing duty (for example, 10% of 34,8% for multi-combinational forms of DRAMs falling under No 3, i.e. 3,4%), to ensure a balanced application of the provision and to avoid any disproportionate burden to the economic operators importing and selling the product concerned in the Community. (35) Finally, with regard to the special provision referred to under point d) of recital (28), it is considered that the lack of both the indication of a reference number in box 44 of the SAD, as foreseen in recital (30), and of a statement, in the cases mentioned in recital (32), should trigger the application of the countervailing duty rate of 34,8% since it should be assumed – unless the contrary is proved – that the multi-combinational form of DRAM is originating in the Republic of Korea and has been manufactured by companies subject to the countervailing duty. (36) In addition, in the cases mentioned in recital (32), should some of the DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs not be clearly marked and their manufacturers not be clearly identifiable from the required statement, it should be assumed - unless the contrary is proved – that such DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs are originating in the Republic of Korea and have been manufactured by companies subject to the countervailing duty.
DRAMs defined in the preceding paragraph take the following forms: - DRAM wafers falling within CN code ex 8542 21 01 (TARIC code 8542 21 01 10), - DRAM chips (dies) falling within CN code ex 8542 21 05 (TARIC code 8542 21 05 10), - mounted DRAMs falling within CN codes 8542 21 11, 8542 21 13, 8542 21 15 and 8542 21 17, - multi-combinational forms of DRAMs (memory modules, memory boards or other aggregate forms) falling within CN codes ex 8473 30 10 (TARIC code 8473 30 10 10), ex 8473 50 10 (TARIC code 8473 50 10 10) and ex 8548 90 10 (TARIC code 8548 90 10 10), - chips and/or mounted DRAMs incorporated in multi-combinational forms of DRAMs provided the multi-combinational form of DRAM is originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, falling within CN codes ex 8473 30 10 (TARIC code 8473 30 10 10), ex 8473 50 10 (TARIC code 8473 50 10 10) and ex 8548 90 10 (TARIC code 8548 90 10 10).’ 2.
The rate of the definitive countervailing duty applicable to the net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, shall be as follows: Korean Producers | Rate of Duty (%) | TARIC additional code | Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (‘Samsung’) 24th Fl., Samsung Main Bldg 250, 2-Ga, Taepyeong-Ro Jung-Gu, Seoul | 0% | A437 | Hynix Semiconductor Inc. 891, Daechidong Kangnamgu, Seoul | 34,8% | A693 | All other companies | 34,8% | A999’ | 3.
Upon presentation to the Member State’s customs authorities of the customs declaration for release into free circulation of multi-combinational forms of DRAMs, the declarant shall indicate in box 44 of the Single Administrative Document (‘SAD’) the reference number corresponding to the below product/origin descriptions indicated in the following table.
The rate of the definitive countervailing duty applicable to the net-free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, shall be as follows: No | Product/origin description | Reference number | Rate of Duty (%) | 1 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea or originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by Samsung | D010 | 0% | 2 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing less than 10% of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D011 | 0% | 3 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 10% or more but less than 20% of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D012 | 3,4% | 4 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 20% or more but less than 30% of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D013 | 6,9% | 5 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 30% or more but less than 40% of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D014 | 10,4% | 6 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 40% or more but less than 50% of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D015 | 13,9% | 7 | Multi-combinational forms of DRAMs originating in countries other than the Republic of Korea, incorporating DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea and manufactured by all companies other than Samsung and representing 50% or more of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational form of DRAM | D016 | 17,4%’ | 5.
In such cases, the countervailing duty rate applicable to multi-combinational forms of DRAMs shall be calculated on the basis of the percentage represented by the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the DRAM chips and/or mounted DRAMs originating in the Republic of Korea out of the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the multi-combinational forms of DRAM, as established in the table contained in paragraph 3, numbers 2 to 7.
