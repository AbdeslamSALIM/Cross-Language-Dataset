It strengthens the links between research and innovation, with research policy focusing more on developing new knowledge and its applications and the framework conditions for research, and innovation policy focusing on transforming knowledge into economic value and commercial success.
Chapter 1 Research and innovation at the heart of EU policies Research and innovation need a predictable and favourable regulatory environment to attract private investment and to help transfer new ideas to the market.
Many regulatory and administrative practices affecting research and innovation are the responsibility of Member States.
Nevertheless, the Community can both lead by example in its own areas of competence and support Member States in theirs – not by intervening more but via better and more focused regulation and policies.
The Europe INNOVA initiative is a family of sectoral innovation projects bringing together analysis and practical experience.
Member States are invited to transpose and apply Community legislation in a way that will promote research and innovation. 1.2.
However, as explained in the State Aid Action Plan[9], market failure may hamper the delivery of optimal levels of research and innovation.
The Commission will also encourage eco-innovation and improvements in productivity through eco-efficiency in line with the Environmental Technology Action Plan, in particular when revising the Community guidelines for State aid on environment. 1.3.
Community co-financing may be provided for joint projects under the PRO INNO initiative, and for policy coordination under the RTD OMC-Net initiative.
The Commission will also foster public recognition of researchers and encourages Member States to do likewise. 1.5.
Using public procurement to foster research and innovation Business investment in research and innovation is strongly influenced by the market, in particular the level of performance demanded by customers.
To put research and innovation at the heart of EU policies: | The Commission will: | Member States are invited to: | Reference: | 1.1 | Step up dialogue with stakeholders to identify regulatory barriers to research and innovation | Transpose Community legislation in a way that will promote research and innovation | IG 7 and 14 | 1.2 | Adopt a more research and innovation-friendly State aid regime | Fully exploit the possibilities of the new framework for support to research and innovation | IG 7 and 13 | 1.3 | Support actions on improving the IPR system and its effective use | Adopt the Community patent, and meanwhile improve the current system | IG 8 CLP action I.1 | 1.4 | Support, monitor and further develop actions under the research human resources strategy | Implement the Recommendations and Directive (when adopted) on research human resources and other means | IG 7 CLP action III.10 | 1.5 | Promote the use of public procurement to stimulate research and innovation | Consider reviewing procurement practices through mutual learning and use the possibilities offered by the new legislation | IG 3 and 8 | 1.6 | Provide guidance to promote an optimal use of R%amp%D tax incentives | Implement on a voluntary basis the forthcoming guidance taking into account national contexts | IG 7 CLP action III.9 | CHAPTER 2 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AT THE HEART OF EU FUNDING Public support programmes are essential to “the excellence and attractiveness of the science base” as well as for the innovation performance of companies.
Member States should also do more, taking into account their specific situations and learning from others’ experience. 2.1.
Mobilising public and private resources for key technologies The Council and the European Parliament are invited to adopt the Commission’s proposals for FP7 and CIP , which would provide the financial means and instruments to address the challenges of the new Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs.
SMEs’ participation in FP7 will be further enhanced by taking due account of their needs in defining the content of the thematic areas and by further simplifying and rationalising administrative/financial procedures.
In addition, the Commission will continue to promote the participation of SMEs in EU research programmes.
Further Community funding to fill the gaps between research and implementation is provided, for instance, by the Trans-European network budget lines that support industrial projects in the fields of radio navigation systems (GALILEO), railways, air traffic control and other intelligent transport systems applications. 2.2.
Mobilising national programmes and other sources of funding for European research and innovation Community funding to promote innovation and research activities represents only a small fraction of the overall European public effort[19].
To put research and innovation at the heart of EU funding: | The Commission will: | Member States are invited to: | Reference: | 2.1 | Stimulate the use of Structural Funds for driving research and innovation | Adopt the Commission’s proposals on the Cohesion and Structural Funds and take full advantage of the wide range of new opportunities offered by these Funds and by the Rural Development Fund, regarding research and innovation | CLP action II.1 to 3 and III.1 and 2 | 2.2 | Promote better access to finance for innovative SMEs | Make full use of the equity and guarantee schemes and engage their financial communities to facilitate access to finance | IG 8 and 15 | 2.3 | Support the development of new technologies and foster their market uptake | Adopt the Commission’s proposals on the 7th Research Framework Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, together with the European Parliament | CLP II.4 and 5 | 2.4 | Mobilise national and regional research and innovation programmes and other sources of funding | Take maximum advantage of Community support schemes to foster transnational cooperation | IG 8 CLP II.4 | CHAPTER 3 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AT THE HEART OF BUSINESS When placed at the heart of business, research and innovation become motors of wealth generation and growth.
Public policy cannot create clusters, but public funding can strengthen them.
Business and policy stand to benefit from better information on trends in private research investment and innovation, particularly in individual sectors.
More emphasis is needed on sectoral needs in formulating research and innovation policies, together with improved business support services to foster technology take-up and entrepreneurial innovation, in particular to help SMEs overcome their specific problems and participate in European networks. 3.1.
Training and research centres, financial institutions, innovation and intellectual property consultants, local and regional development agencies and other support organisations are all key players in maximising firms’ creative business potential.
EU innovation policy therefore facilitates transnational technology transfer (TTT) between firms and encourages them to bring innovations to market, in particular through the network of Innovation Relay Centres[22], which fill a market gap by providing a regional gateway to European cooperation and combining grass-roots knowledge with Europe-wide expertise and contacts.
Many enterprises, especially SMEs, encounter difficulties in planning, implementing and marketing innovative products and in innovating in their production processes.
Commitment to innovation and research is also a manifestation of corporate social responsibility[25] (CSR).
To put research and innovation at the heart of business: | The Commission will: | The Member States are invited to: | Reference: | 3.1. | Define EU guidelines to improve research collaboration and knowledge transfer between public research and industry | Implement the guidelines taking into account the national contexts | CLP III.10 | 3.2. | Promote innovation poles and knowledge-driven and industrial clusters | Make full use of Structural Funds for the development of innovation poles and participate in EU cluster initiatives | IG 8 and 10 CLP III.1 | 3.3. | Provide specific business support services to enterprises, in particular SMEs, stimulating research and innovation | Make full use of Structural Funds and IRC support for improving innovation support services, in particular for SMEs | IG 8 and 15 CLP III.1 | 3.4. | Promote good innovation management practices | Promote the use of new innovation management tools and consider innovation prizes | IG 8 and 15 | 3.5. | Define and implement a strategy promoting innovative services | Consider ways of promoting innovative services | IG 8 | 3.6. | Expand monitoring and analysis of private research investment and sectoral innovation performance | Take account of the results of the EU level monitoring and analysis | ILS[29] chapter 6 | CHAPTER 4 IMPROVED RESEARCH AND INNOVATION POLICIES The EU currently displays a patchwork of national and regional research and innovation systems adapted to the varying local situations.
In addition, a pilot scheme has been launched to support bottom-up coordination initiatives by several countries and regions in the field of research policy (RTD OMC-NET).
To improve research and innovation governance in Europe: | The Commission will: | Member States are invited to: | Reference: | 4.1 | Monitor and support national research and innovation policy developments through the new Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs | Where appropriate, report on national research and innovation policy developments in NRP within the new Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs | CLP ch. 2 ILS ch. 3 and 6 | 4.2 | Further develop policy analysis instruments for research and innovation | Make full use of statistical and policy analysis provided by the Commission | ILS ch. 6 | 4.3 | Support policy learning platforms and facilitate transnational policy cooperation | Make full use of transnational policy learning and cooperation | ILS ch. 4 and 6 | CONCLUSION The actions outlined in this Communication will ensure maximum effectiveness in research and innovation policies and is in line with the renewed Lisbon strategy’s emphasis on focus, partnership and streamlining .
Moreover, the approach will be updated in the light of implementation of the Partnership for Growth and Jobs. 1 “Working together for growth and jobs.
