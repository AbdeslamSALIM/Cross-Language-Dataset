Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Green Paper: Mortgage Credit in the EU (COM(2005) 327 final) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the "Green Paper: Mortgage Credit in the EU" (COM(2005) 327 final) (2006/C 65/21) On 19 July 2005 the European Commission decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the Green Paper: Mortgage Credit in the EU The Section for the Single Market, Production and Consumption, which was responsible for preparing the Committee's work on the subject, adopted its opinion on 11 November 2005.

In other words, the Commission envisages an integration such as to enable any citizen of the Union to acquire a property in his own country or another, using the services of a financial intermediary in his own country, the country where the property is situated or a third country. 3.2 Consumer protection (point II of the GP) 3.2.1 On information the Commission raises four questions.
