However, in the two acceding countries Bulgaria and Romania, administrative weakness remained the main challenge facing the implementation of ISPA in 2005.
For Romania , the level of assurance on the systems in place has quite radically advanced compared to 2004.
For Bulgaria , as significant efforts were made in 2005 to close the gaps identified in the management and control systems, the EDIS process was eventually put back on track.
European Court of Auditors findings In its Annual report concerning the financial year 2004 , the Court's overall opinion on the pre-accession instruments was that supervisory and control systems were basically sound and worked in practice, although risks continue to exist at the level of the implementing organisations.
This opinion was confirmed in the framework of a limited review of ISPA activities in 2005, as a result of which the Court recommended that the Commission monitors closely the systems in question. 5.5.
