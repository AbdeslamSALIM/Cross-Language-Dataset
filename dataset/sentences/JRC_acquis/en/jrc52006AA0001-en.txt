Whereas, pursuant to Article 164 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community shall carry out the following activities, complementing the activities carried out in the Member States: (a) implementation of research, technological development and demonstration programmes, by promoting cooperation with and between undertakings, research centres and universities; (b) promotion of cooperation in the field of Community research, technological development and demonstration with third countries and international organisations; (c) dissemination and optimisation of the results of activities in Community research, technological development and demonstration; (d) stimulation of the training and mobility of researchers in the Community; Whereas, pursuant to Article 167 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, for the implementation of the multiannual framework programme the Council shall determine the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities and lay down the rules governing the dissemination of research results; Whereas Article 274 of the Treaty establishing the European Community makes the Commission responsible for the implementation of the budget, having regard to the principles of sound financial management; Whereas, in the area of the specific programmes referred to in Article 164(a) and Article 166(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the budget can be implemented within a framework of direct and indirect centralised management by the Commission, in accordance with Articles 53(2) of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Articles 36 and 37 of its Implementing Rules; Whereas, in its Opinion No 2/2004 [7], the Court outlined the principles of an integrated internal control framework, on the basis of which internal controls should be designed to provide reasonable assurance that revenue and expenditure are raised and spent in accordance with the legal provisions in force and managed in accordance with the principles of sound financial management; Whereas the Court concluded in its Special Report No 1/2004 [8] that the rules for setting the Community's financial participation in the RTD framework programmes should be reviewed from first principles, with the aim of eliminating unnecessary complexity in the forthcoming Seventh Framework Programme so as not to compromise effective and adequate control over expenditure, HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING OPINION: INTRODUCTION Main features of the Commission proposal for %quot%Rules for Participation%quot% 1.
Besides this, the Commission proposal focuses on achieving greater simplification with regard to the systems for financial management and control, in particular through: - the use of lump sums, flat rates and scales of unit cost to simplify the reimbursement of eligible costs (see Article 30), - the establishment of a single cost system together with an increase in upper funding limits (see Article 33), - the setting up of a %quot%Guarantee fund%quot% to cover the financial risk of carrying out indirect RTD actions (see Article 38). 4.
The Court's Opinion 5.
It also takes into account previous resolutions of the European Parliament and the Council, notably in the discharge procedure concerning the financial year 2003 [12] and the 2006 general budget [13].
According to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty, the Commission is responsible for keeping under constant review all systems of aid existing in the Member States, since, as a matter of principle, State aid is prohibited (see whereas (3)).
With regard to the ceilings laid down in paragraph 5.12 of the %quot%Community Framework for State Aid for Research and Development%quot%, this specifies: %quot%Where Community financing and State aid are combined, total official support may not exceed 75 % in the case of industrial research and 50 % in the case of pre-competitive development activities%quot% (see also paragraphs 72 and 73). 16.
Chapter I: Introductory provisions (Article 1 to Article 3) Clarification of definition of %quot%indirect action%quot% required 20.
Chapter II: Participations (Article 4 to Article 38) Section 1: Minimum conditions (Article 4 to Article 12) Minimum conditions for participation to be clarified 22.
The Court recommends that these conditions should be more clearly described (see Article 5 and Article 7). 24.
Section 2: Procedures (Article 13 to Article 28) Lack of clarity in rules applicable to Community funding by means other than grants awarded on the basis of calls for proposals 27.
In the Commission's proposal, Annex III of the %quot%Decision%quot% provides for exceptions to the use of grants in accordance with Article 160 of the Financial Regulation (Article 229(3) of the Implementing Rules).
These exceptions cover all Community funding made by means other than grants, including grants awarded on the basis of calls for proposals, namely: - public procurement for goods or services established by contract and selected on the basis of calls for tender, - study, research or training scholarships and prizes following contests [33], - subscriptions to organisations, - honoraria for independent experts. 28.
These exceptions, which by default are subject to the rules set out in the Financial Regulation, should be clearly enumerated in the %quot%Decision%quot%, Annex III a) 3. %quot%Coordination and support actions%quot% (see Footnote 31) and in Article 14 of the %quot%Rules for Participation%quot% (see also paragraph 21).
Furthermore, the Court recommends that the Commission identifies which provisions of the Financial Regulation are applicable for each of the exceptions referred to in Article 14 and also clarifies the extent to which other provisions of this Regulation do not apply.
Moreover, in contrast to the Commission proposal, the Court recommends that such rules should cover the negotiation phase, which takes place after selection of proposals on the basis of a comparative assessment by independent experts and prior to the award of a grant [36] (see Article 16 and Article 17(4a)).
By doing this, the Commission would establish a common framework contributing to a consistent and coherent approach to risk assessment by sub-delegated Authorising Officers, in accordance with Article 118 of the Financial Regulation (Article 182 of the Implementing Rules).
The Court considers, however, that grants should be awarded on the basis of Commission decisions since, according to the Financial Regulation [40], the use of the Commission decision procedure is a pre-condition for agreeing on negotiated flat rates for indirect costs, established according to the usual cost accounting practices of the participant, over and above the 7 % established by the Financial Regulation (see paragraphs 69 and 70).
Therefore, in the Court's view, a reference to %quot%monitoring activities%quot% must be added in Article 17 to be consistent with the proposal in Article 27. 40.
In this context, the Court welcomes the intention of the Commission to provide for electronic submission and a unique registration facility [37], as stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, and recommends that this provision should be included in the %quot%Rules for Participation%quot% (see Article 16 and Article 17a).
Model grant agreements should take account of specificities in funding arrangements 43.
This has also created a %quot%de facto%quot% veto right for each participant in an indirect action, which in practice often results in the loss of the flexibility required for sucessful research. 46.
The Court therefore suggests a simplified governance structure for consortia carrying out indirect actions, in line with previous proposals [44].
As a consequence, the consortium agreement would have to be concluded after the negotiation of a selected proposal, but prior to the signature of the grant agreement or the award of a grant by Commission decision (see Article 23 and Article 24(2)). 50.
Changes in the composition of a consortium to be made in a fair, transparent and competitive manner 54.
The Court recommends clarifying the Commission's legal obligation to monitor indirect actions and programme implementation, also regarding previous RTD framework programmes (see also Article 7 of the Decision) [47].
Therefore the Court considers that the %quot%Rules for Participation%quot% should state that the results of the Commission's programme monitoring activities, including those regarding previous RTD framework programmes, are to be presented to a programme committee composed of representatives of Member States, in accordance with Article 202 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (see whereas (17) and Article 27).
Section 3: Community financial contribution (Article 29 to Article 38) Court welcomes proposals to simplify financing systems 58.
Therefore, in Article 31 of the %quot%Rules for Participation%quot%, the applicability of the %quot%no profit%quot% principle to each participant in an indirect action should be clarified.
In contrast to the Commission proposal, the Court considers that participants should be able to charge flat rates established in accordance with their usual cost accounting practices (see paragraph 38).
In practice, this would imply that participants may charge rates for indirect costs which are significantly above the 20 % of direct costs under previous RTD framework programmes [53].
In the Court's view, all costs should be reported for each period, thereby guaranteeing that the Commission has a means of verifying the effective co-financing of the indirect action (see Article 34). 75.
The external auditor must comply with the requirements established in line with the 8th Council Directive 84/253/EEC of 10 April 1984 [57].
In the Court's view, there should be no specific rules applying to %quot%Networks of Excellence%quot% and, therefore, Article 35 should be deleted (see also paragraph 59).
These arise primarily because of the pre-financing granted by the Community (in general 80 % of annual instalments), - second, the guarantee fund being an %quot%insurance%quot%-type mechanism, financially stable participants would be covering the risk resulting from potentially defaulting participants, mostly SME's.
Chapter III: Dissemination and use, and access rights (Article 39 to Article 52) Establishing access rights to foreground for affiliated entities 82.
Promoting the use of jointly-owned foreground 83.
In all other cases, arrangements concerning the transfer of ownership should be dealt with by the participants (see Article 42 and Article 43).
In the Court's view, access rights should be granted to affiliated entities on a reciprocal base as described above (see paragraph 82).
