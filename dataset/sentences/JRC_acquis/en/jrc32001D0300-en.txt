The most recent outbreaks of FMD were reported in 2000 in Greece due to introduction from a neighbouring country and in 2001 in the United Kingdom. (5) However in countries adjacent to the Member States outbreaks and in some cases severe epidemics have been recorded during the last years which are liable to threaten the health status of Community susceptible livestock mainly due to movement of persons and goods, excluding imports of livestock and livestock products which are prohibited, and means of transports between Member States and neighbouring countries. (6) In the light of the emergence of new virus topotypes and regional deterioration of control measures, the Community, in close cooperation with the EUFMD and by using the Trust Fund 911100/MTF/INT/003/EEC, supported emergency vaccination campaigns in Turkey in 1998 and in Transcaucasia in 1999 and 2000. (7) Since its establishment, Trust Fund 911100/MTF/INT/003/EEC has been operated on a case-by-case basis in agreement between the Commission and EUFMD by Exchange of Letters of agreement to measures proposed by the EUFMD. (8) On 25 February 2000 a meeting of a group of experts at FAO headquarters reviewed the procedures for operating Trust Fund 911100/MTF/INT/003/EEC with regard to expenses incurred due to implementation of agreed FMD control programmes in member countries of the EUFMD or neighbouring countries. (9) Following evaluation, the group of experts from the Commission and the FAO found the FAO rules and procedures for the operation of such funds equivalent to those applicable in Community institutions. (10) The group of experts recommended revision of the rules and procedures for the operation of the Trust Fund 911100/MTF/INT/003/EEC in order to lay down a formalised agreement on the operation of that Trust Fund.
Expenditure incurred by the Trust Fund during the years 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 shall be replenished by annual Community contributions payable in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively.
The Trust Fund referred to in Article 1 shall be operated in agreement between the Commission and the EUFMD in accordance with the implementing agreement referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. 3.
