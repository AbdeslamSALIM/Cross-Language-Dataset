Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 should be amended accordingly. (8) The health import requirements for food of animal origin will not be completely harmonised for certain types of products and the import conditions applicable to such products during the transitional period should be made clear. (9) The provision of food chain information is a new requirement on food business operators.
In particular, a smooth flow of information from the farm to the slaughterhouse should be facilitated by a transitional arrangement relaxing the requirement to supply the information 24 hours in advance of the animals' arrival at the slaughterhouse. (10) Section III of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 requires the official veterinarian or approved veterinarian to sign the certificate accompanying the farmed non domestic ungulates from the farm to the slaughterhouse.
That provision should be maintained during the transitional period. (11) The certificate required by Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 in Chapter X Part B of Annex I is more detailed than the certificate previously prescribed.
During the transitional period, it is appropriate to allow the competent authority time for planning and organising additional training and qualification of slaughterhouse staff assisting with official controls, and to limit consequently the requirement to ensuring that slaughterhouse staff is trained for the specific tasks they are allowed to carry out. (18) Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 requires laboratories carrying out analysis of samples taken during official controls to be accredited.
