By letter dated 10 June 2004, Nepal has submitted a request for the renewal of this derogation. (4) The request submitted by Nepal has been considered by the Commission and has been found to be duly substantiated. (5) When the validity of Regulation No 1615/2000 was extended, it was considered that its expiry should coincide with the ending of the current GSP scheme, which was due to end on that date.
However, no decisions have yet been taken and no new rules will be in place before 31 December 2004. (7) A prolongation of the derogation should not pre-judge or prejudice the outcome of discussions on possible new rules of origin for GSP.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
It shall apply from 1 January 2005.
Done at Brussels, 20 December 2004.
