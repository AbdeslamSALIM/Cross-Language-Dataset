PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 22 November 2000, six German industrial producers which are members of the Federation of Industrial Grain Distilleries submitted a complaint to the Commission about the amendment of Germany's Spirits Monopoly Law of 2 May 1976 by the Budget Consolidation Law (%quot%HsanG%quot%) of 22 December 1999 [2]. (2) The complainants wanted it to be established that by amending the Spirits Monopoly Law [3] the German legislator had introduced a scheme which infringes Article 87 of the EC Treaty: it treats industrial and agricultural grain distilleries - which up to then had been equally entitled to aid - unfairly, since only the agricultural producers would still be eligible for aid.
They claim that the new scheme gives the agricultural grain brandy distilleries an indisputable advantage in the form of aid that is incompatible with the Community competition rules. (3) The Commission first asked Germany for further information about the criticised amendments on 3 January 2001.
Germany replied by letter dated 14 February to the effect that the aid measures in question had already been notified to the Commission in 1976 and that the new Law merely served to improve the existing mechanism.
By letter dated 19 December Germany confirmed its explanations of 14 February and gave a renewed assurance that the aid in question complied with Community law. (5) By letter dated 22 February 2002 the Commission requested Germany, under Article 17(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [4], to comment and submit appropriate proposals on how the legislation on aid for grain distilleries could be made consistent with Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.
By letters dated 19 and 23 July Germany informed the Commission that it was rejecting the proposal and was therefore not prepared to carry out the appropriate measures within the time limits set. (7) Under Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 the Commission therefore decided on 16 October 2002 to initiate a formal investigation procedure in respect of the aid measures concerned.
The decision was published on 11 September in the Official Journal of the European Union [5], all interested parties being invited to submit comments on the measures in question. (8) Germany commented on the initiation of the procedure on 12 November. (9) The Commission received a total of 54 submissions from third parties, including a petition with some 2000 signatures.
These were forwarded to Germany on 7 February 2003, with a request for comments.
On 26 February Germany asked the Commission to extend the time limit for its reply, which was granted on 27 February.
Germany replied to this by letter dated 5 April.
The German spirits monopoly and its development (13) The German spirits monopoly was introduced by the Law of 8 April 1922 [6] and amended as a consequence of decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (inter alia Case 45/75 Rewe-Zentrale [7] by the Law of 2 May 1976 [8].
The new Law of 2 May 1976 on the Spirits Monopoly abolished the price support policy resulting from the territorial protective measures, which infringed Article 31 EC (ex Article 37), and replaced them with a price compensation mechanism. (14) On 9 April 1976 Germany notified to the Commission the reformed Spirits Monopoly Law [9] under Article 93(3) (now Article 88(3)) of the EC Treaty read in conjunction with Article 4 of Council Regulation No 26 of 4 April 1962 applying certain rules of competition to production of and trade in agricultural products [10].
The 1976 Law granted DKV the exclusive right to purchase the bulk of domestic grain brandy production at statutorily guaranteed prices which cover the costs [14] of the producers, whether industrial or agricultural, and to market the grain brandy at market prices, if necessary after conversion and/or rectification.
Up to the year 2000, over 80 % of the grain brandy produced in Germany was marketed by DKV, and the other 20 % by the distilleries themselves [15]. (19) In return for performing the statutory duty transferred to it in Article 82 of the Spirits Monopoly Law, DKV receives a consideration, which in the absence of a market price is determined in accordance with the Basic principles of pricing public contracts on a total production cost basis (LSP). (20) The German grain brandy producers entitled to aid are obliged to deliver to DKV quantities corresponding to their distillation rights, which are determined annually by the government agencies.
Thus the selling price of alcohol declined from an average of DEM 333/hl in 1976 to DEM 115/hl in 1999/2000. (28) For 1999/2000, the statutory purchase price which DKV had to pay the grain distilleries was DEM 263 per hl alcohol (compared with DEM 296/hl paid by the BfB to producers of other spirit).
Compensatory amounts in the event of early withdrawal from the monopoly (31) The system provided for in Article 58a of the Spirits Monopoly Law will make it easier for the grain distilleries to leave the monopoly.
As already explained above (see paragraph 22), distilleries which are prepared to leave the monopoly early receive, in return for leaving of their own free will and instead of the operating aid for offsetting production costs, degressive compensatory amounts up to September 2006, which in each case are paid out in the first four months of an operating year.
Market in figures (34) At the end of the 1999/2000 operating year (before the Law was introduced) there were 68 industrial and 409 agricultural distilleries, which produced a total of 253000 hectolitres of grain brandy.
The number of agricultural distilleries had fallen to 340, with a total production of 142000 hectolitres. (35) The 57 industrial distilleries that had left the monopoly early had received compensatory amounts totalling EUR 5,9 million at the end of the 2001/2002 operating year, the six agricultural ones EUR 0,6 million.
The 47 distilleries that market their output themselves (total of 5400 hl grain brandy) received EUR 315000 in aid for this purpose.
Lastly, in the 2001/2002 operating year, DKV received a grant of EUR 6,6 million.
Agricultural producers (38) All 35 agricultural distilleries reject the Commission's position.
Germany has therefore proposed a transitional time limit of 30 September 2006.
It has given the Commission concrete reasons why the original time limit of 1 January 2004 laid down by the Commission in the appropriate measures should be extended to at least the 2005/2006 operating year.
LEGAL ASSESSMENT A.
Applicability of the competition rules Grain brandy not covered by Annex I to the EC Treaty (46) It was explained above that the processing of grain brandy was organised separately from the other alcohol products of agricultural origin covered by the monopoly (see paragraphs 16 to 24).
The language versions which, like the English and the Dutch, do not specifically exclude spirits must be interpreted and applied in the light of the other language versions and can only be understood in such a way that spirits are among the alcoholic beverages which are also excluded from the scope of Annex I. (62) As part of the operation and development of the common market in agricultural products, the Council on 8 April 2003 adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 670/2003 laying down specific measures concerning the market in ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin [23].
The measures in question should be regarded as existing aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty (65) The Commission has shown that grain brandy is an industrial product to which Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty apply. (66) Under Article 87(1), %quot%save as otherwise provided in this Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market%quot%.
The fact that the Court of Justice held in Hansen and Sektkellerei C.A.
Kupferberg that Articles 95 and 37 of the EEC Treaty must be interpreted as not precluding the de facto reduction made in the selling price of spirit sold by the federal monopoly administration in a given period %quot%provided that the rate of taxation actually applied to imported products during that period did not exceed the rate of taxation actually levied on corresponding domestic products%quot% does not anticipate the assessment of the state aid by the Commission. (77) There is no doubt therefore that the measures in question are likely to affect trade between Member States. (78) Consequently, the measures in question constitute state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.
The Commission also notes that Germany notified the measures arising out of the 1976 Law in April of that year on the basis of the provisions applying to agricultural products and that the notification prompted no further comments at the time. (80) Pursuant to Article 88(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, the Commission recommended by decision of 19 June 2002 that Germany take appropriate measures, after it had reached the conclusion that grain brandy should be regarded as an industrial product and that the measures concerned constitute aid which is no longer compatible with the common market; however, Germany objected to this. (81) The state aid resulting from the Spirits Monopoly Law, including the aid measures for grain brandy under the Law of 2 May 1976 had been duly notified by Germany without the Commission expressing reservations at the time about its compatibility with the Community competition rules.
Consequently, the aid is existing state aid within the meaning of Article 1(b)(iii) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (82) Thus, in its decision of 19 June 2002 on appropriate measures, the Commission did not classify the measures resulting from the Law of 22 December 1999 as new aid. (83) The HsanG of 22 December 1999 is actually intended to reduce the number of recipients and the level of the subsidies granted.
It changes nothing at the heart of the system introduced by the Law of 2 May 1976, under which the producers' costs are covered irrespective of the market price of grain brandy.
The same applies to the compensatory amounts, which are granted in return for leaving the monopoly early and replace the subsidies for a certain period. (84) The HsanG 1999, therefore, did not need to be notified to the Commission before its entry into force. (85) This view accords with the decision of the Court of Justice in Case C-44/93 Namur-Les assurances du crédit SA [25].
Where the Commission considers that an existing aid scheme is not, or is no longer, compatible with the common market, it shall inform the Member State concerned of its preliminary view and give the Member State concerned the opportunity to submit its comments within a period of one month. …%quot%. (90) By letter dated 22 February 2002 the Commission duly informed Germany that it had reached the conclusion, after examining its replies and the facts submitted by the complainants, that the Community competition rules apply to the aid measures in question and that the special provisions on agricultural products cannot be invoked, since grain brandy is an industrial product, which as such does not fall within Annex I to the EC Treaty. (91) After the Commission had established that Germany's measures in support of the grain distilleries constitute existing aid whose compatibility with the provisions of the EC Treaty is doubtful, it requested Germany under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 to state its views on this within one month of receiving the letter of 22 February 2002.
The recommendation may propose, in particular: (a) substantive amendment of the aid scheme, or (b) introduction of procedural requirements, or (c) abolition of the aid scheme.%quot% (94) Pursuant to Article 88(1) of the EC Treaty read in conjunction with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, the Commission recommended in the decision of 19 June 2002 that Germany take appropriate measures to reform the relevant provisions of German grain brandy legislation (Law of 2 May 1976 and Law of 22 December 1999) as follows: (a) agricultural and industrial distilleries may no longer receive any operating aid in the form of subsidies for maintaining statutorily guaranteed prices; (b) they may no longer claim other aid of whatever kind as compensation for any early departure from the system; (c) the legislative amendments must ensue as soon as possible after the start of the 2002/2003 operating year and enter into force at the latest on 1 January 2004; (d) Germany must inform the Commission of the measures taken in a report to be submitted at the latest at the end of the first quarter of 2003.
Kupferberg, see paragraph 42). (96) Germany invokes this case law in its replies to the Commission and infers from it that the provisions of the Spirits Monopoly Law of 2 May 1976 have already been examined and confirmed by the Court.
Germany estimates that a distillery with an annual production of 1000 hl grain alcohol must invest at least EUR 400000 a year in marketing that quantity of alcohol. (111) Clearly, the necessary restructurings are not feasible unless an additional period is granted in which the existing financial aid, whether in the form of a refund of production costs or of compensatory amounts, is maintained.
Thereafter Germany must abolish the scheme and all its consequences. (114) The Commission therefore determines as follows: (a) agricultural and industrial distilleries may no longer receive any operating aid in the form of subsidies for maintaining statutorily guaranteed prices; (b) they may no longer claim other aid of whatever kind as compensation for any early departure from the system; (c) the legislative amendments must ensue as soon as possible after the start of the 2005/2006 operating year and enter into force at the latest by 30 September 2006; (d) Germany must inform the Commission of the measures taken in a report to be submitted at the latest at the end of the second quarter of 2005.
Article 2 Germany shall take all necessary measures to abolish the aid scheme referred to in Article 1 as from 30 September 2006.
