On 18 January 2005, the Council decided that Greece had not taken effective action in response to these recommendations.
On 17 February 2005, the Council decided in accordance to Article 104(9) to give notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction below the 3 % of GDP threshold by 2006 at the latest.
The reference scenario targets a sizeable reduction of the nominal general government budget deficit by 3.6 percentage point over the programme period, from the outturn of 6,1 % of GDP in 2004 to 2,4 % in 2007.
Moreover, the new statistical revisions for 2004 and earlier years may imply potential carryover effects requiring additional measures for the future.
The cyclically-adjusted deficit calculated by the Commission services according to the commonly agreed methodology applied to the data of the reference scenario, although projected in the programme to improve by 0,5 per cent of GDP per year, would remain above 3 % of GDP throughout the programme period.
