Commission Regulation (EC) No 2799/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the grant of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed and the sale of such skimmed-milk powder COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2799/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the grant of aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder intended for animal feed and the sale of such skimmed-milk powder THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Articles 10 and 15 thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 replaces Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1587/96(3), and, among others, Council Regulation (EEC) No 986/68 of 15 July 1968 laying down general rules for granting aid for skimmed milk and skimmed-milk powder for use as feed(4), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1802/95(5).
The checks provided for in this Regulation should take that derogation into account and Regulation (EC) No 1043/97 should be repealed; (5) aid should be granted only if the compound feedingstuffs meet certain minimum standards as regards composition customarily observed in the industry and if they have reached the final stage of industrial manufacture.
However, since no reference methods have been laid down for determining the quantity of skimmed-milk powder in compound feedingstuffs, the presence of rennet whey powder in skimmed-milk powder or the quality of starch in skimmed-milk powder, the appropriate methods should be laid down in this Regulation; (9) a standing invitation to tender should be organised for the sale of skimmed-milk powder from public stocks, in order to ensure equality of access for all potential purchasers, to arrive at a selling price reflecting market conditions and to verify the actual end use of skimmed-milk powder intended for use in the manufacture of compound feedingstuffs.
It should therefore be possible to fix differentiated minimum prices; (10) this Regulation should set the time limit for entry into storage for the purposes of sale.
The aid measure provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1105/68 should therefore be abolished and the said Regulation repealed; (12) the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: CHAPTER I GENERAL PROVISIONS Article 1 This Regulation lays down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards: (a) the grant of aid for skimmed milk, skimmed-milk powder, buttermilk and buttermilk powder intended for use as animal feed under Article 11 of that Regulation; (b) the sale of skimmed-milk powder intended for use as animal feed under Article 7(4) of that Regulation.
Where it is established that the manufactured product contains a quantity of skimmed-milk powder exceeding the maximum quantity of 80 kilograms referred to in paragraph 1 (a)(i) but not exceeding 81 kilograms, the aid may nevertheless be granted on the basis of a skimmed-milk powder content of 80 kilograms.
Where the manufactured product does not contain the minimum quantity of 50 kilograms of skimmed-milk powder referred to in paragraph 1 (a)(i), aid minus 15 % shall be granted for the skimmed-milk powder actually incorporated provided that the skimmed-milk powder content is equal to at least 45 kilograms per 100 kilograms of finished product.
CHAPTER II AID FOR SKIMMED-MILK POWDER Section 1 Amount of aid and implementing conditions Article 7 1.

Take solutions of the test samples Inject 100 μl of accurately measure supernatant or filtrate (8.3.3) into the HPLC apparatus operating at a flow rate of 1,0 ml of eluent solution (5.2) per minute.
Immediately after the injection a linear gradient is started, which results in a 5 % higher percentage of B after 27 minutes.

Repeatability The difference between the results of two determinations carried out simultaneously or in rapid succession by the same analyst using the same apparatus on identical test material shall not exceed 0,2 % m/m. 9.3.2.
Linearity From 0 to 16 % of rennet whey a linear relationship should be obtained with a coefficient of correlation %amp%gt; 0,99. 9.4.
Interpretation 9.4.1.
Whey is considered to be present if the result obtained in 9.2 is higher than 1 % m/m and the retention time of the GMP peak differs less than 0,2 minutes from that of the standard sample (5).
The 1 % limit is fixed in agreement with the provisions of points 9.2 and 9.4.1 of Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 625/78. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_1999340EN.002401.EPS%quot%%gt% (1) Rennet-type whey powder of standard composition and also the adulterated skimmed-milk powder are available from NIZO, Kernhemseweg 2, PO Box 20 - NL-6710 BA Ede.

Test tubes, 25 mm x 200 mm 5.
Procedure Weight 1 g of the sample and transfer it into the test tube (4.3).

ANNEX VI DETERMINATION OF MOISTURE IN ACID BUTTERMILK POWDER 1.
Scope To determine the moisture content of acid buttermilk powder intended for animal feedingstuffs. 2.
The loss of mass is determined by weighing. 3.
Analytical balance 3.2.
Reckon drying time from the moment when the oven temperature returns to 83 °C.
Open the oven, place the lid on the container immediately, remove the container from the oven, leave to cool for 30 to 45 minutes in the desiccator (3.4) and weigh to the nearest 1 mg.
Dry for an additional 30 minutes in the vacuum oven (3.3) at 83 °C and reweigh.
The difference between the two weighings must not exceed 0,1 % of moisture. 5.
Reproducibility limit The difference between the results of two determinations carried out by operators in different laboratories, using different apparatus on identical test material shall not exceed 0,6 g water/100 g acid buttermilk powder. 6.3.
