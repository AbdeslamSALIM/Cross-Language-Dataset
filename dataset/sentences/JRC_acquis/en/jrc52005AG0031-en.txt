The Community approved the Århus Convention on 17 February 2005.
For the 10-year period starting from 22 July 2002, the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme establishes the objectives of Community environmental policy and the actions planned to attain these objectives.
It is therefore appropriate to introduce rules that oblige Community institutions and bodies to ensure such quality. (15) Where Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 provides for exceptions, these should apply, mutatis mutandis, to requests for access to environmental information under this Regulation.
Article 2 Definitions 1.
Administrative acts and administrative omissions shall not include measures taken or omissions by a Community institution or body in its capacity as an administrative review body, such as under: (a) Articles 81, 82, 86 and 87 of the Treaty (competition rules); (b) Articles 226 and 228 of the Treaty (infringement proceedings); (c) Article 195 of the Treaty (Ombudsman proceedings); (d) Article 280 of the Treaty (OLAF proceedings).
TITLE II ACCESS TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION Article 3 Application of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 shall apply to any request by an applicant for access to environmental information held by Community institutions and bodies without discrimination as to citizenship, nationality or domicile and, in the case of a legal person, without discrimination as to where it has its registered seat or an effective centre of its activities.
Article 4 Collection and dissemination of environmental information 1.
In appropriate cases, Community institutions and bodies may satisfy the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2 by creating links to Internet sites where the information can be found. 4.
Article 5 Quality of the environmental information 1.
Article 6 Application of exceptions concerning requests for access to environmental information 1.
In addition to the exceptions set out in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, Community institutions and bodies may refuse access to environmental information where disclosure of the information would adversely affect the protection of the environment to which the information relates, such as the breeding sites of rare species. 3.
Article 7 Requests for access to environmental information which is not held by a Community institution or body Where a Community institution or body receives a request for access to environmental information and where this information is not held by that Community institution or body, it shall, as promptly as possible, inform the applicant of the Community institution or body or the public authority within the meaning of Directive 2003/4/EC to which it believes it is possible to apply for the information requested or transfer the request to the relevant Community institution or body or the public authority and inform the applicant accordingly.
Article 8 Cooperation In the event of an imminent threat to human health or the environment, whether caused by human activities or due to natural causes, Community institutions and bodies shall, upon request of public authorities within the meaning of Directive 2003/4/EC, collaborate with and assist those public authorities in order to enable the latter to disseminate immediately and without delay to the public that might be affected all environmental information which could enable it to take measures to prevent or mitigate harm arising from the threat, to the extent that this information is held by or on behalf of Community institutions and bodies and/or those public authorities.
The first subparagraph shall apply without prejudice to any specific obligation laid down by Community legislation, in particular by Decision No 2119/98/EC and by Decision No 1786/2002/EC.
TITLE III PUBLIC PARTICIPATION CONCERNING PLANS AND PROGRAMMES RELATING TO THE ENVIRONMENT Article 9 1.
TITLE IV INTERNAL REVIEW AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE Article 10 Request for internal review of administrative acts 1.
Any non-governmental organisation which meets the criteria set out in Article 11 is entitled to make a request for internal review to the Community institution or body that has adopted an administrative act under environmental law or, in case of an alleged administrative omission, should have adopted such an act.
The Community institution or body referred to in paragraph 1 shall consider any such request, unless it is clearly unsubstantiated.
Article 11 Criteria for entitlement at Community level 1.
Article 12 Proceedings before the Court of Justice 1.
The non-governmental organisation which made the request for internal review pursuant to Article 10 may institute proceedings before the Court of Justice in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty. 2.
Where the Community institution or body fails to act in accordance with Article 10(2) or (3) the non-governmental organisation may institute proceedings before the Court of Justice in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.
TITLE V FINAL PROVISIONS Article 13 Application measures Where necessary, Community institutions and bodies shall adapt their rules of procedure to the provisions of this Regulation.
Decision as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). [8] OJ L 271, 9.10.2002, p. 1.
Decision as amended by Decision No 786/2004/EC (OJ L 138, 30.4.2004, p. 7). [9] … [10] … -------------------------------------------------- STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS I.
The European Parliament adopted its first-reading opinion at its session from 29 March to 1 April 2004.
The Economic and Social Committee adopted its opinion on 29 April 2004 [1].
The Council adopted its common position on 18 July 2005.
Specific In particular, the Council agreed that: - amendments 39, 40 and 41 were not acceptable because sustainable development is outside the scope of the Convention and not in line with Article 174 of the EC Treaty with regard to the objectives of environmental policy, - amendment 1 was covered by the formulation of recital 7, - amendment 56 could have created an overlapping exemption regime: Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 provides a sufficient framework to ensure compliance with the Convention; - amendments 3 and 7 and 10 went beyond the requirements of the Århus Convention and were therefore unnecessary for ensuring compliance, - amendment 5 was not linked to any specific provisions in the Regulation; the concern that procedures should be streamlined is met in particular by Articles 10 to 12 in the common position, - amendments 8 and 44 were no longer relevant since the notion of 'qualified entity' was deleted from the text, - amendment 9 was not acceptable because the definition of 'environmental information' which appears in the common position was taken over from Directive 2003/4/EC on access to information in the field of the environment, - amendment 16 went beyond the provisions on information dissemination which are contained in Directive 2003/4/EC and would have entailed unnecessary administrative burdens, - amendments 17 and 19 repeated provisions already clear in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, - amendments 21, 22 and 23 seemed too prescriptive: it should be left to institutions and bodies to determine how they want to take account of public participation results, on the basis of general principles laid out in the regulation, - amendment 25 could not be accepted because it might have slowed down procedures considerably, - amendments 30, 42, 47, 48, 49, 50, 52 and 53 were unacceptable as the Århus Convention leaves it to Parties to determine the modalities for granting access to justice.
Besides the fact that it limits the concept of 'qualified entity' to NGOs meeting a number of conditions, the Common position carefully sticks to the provisions contained in Articles 230(4) and 232(3) of the EC Treaty, which are sufficient to ensure compliance, - amendment 51 was unnecessary because the modalities of access to the Ombudsman, as set out in Article 195 of the EC Treaty, are sufficient to ensure compliance with the Convention and should therefore not be interfered with, - some elements of amendments 33, 35 and 58 were taken on board.
Inserting a reference to sustainable development, however, was deemed inappropriate in the present context, with regard to the definition of environmental law, as explained above in relation to amendments 39, 40 and 41.
Furthermore, the common position ensures that criteria for entitlement to make a request (now Article 11) avoid legal ambiguities, - amendment 36 had lost its relevance since the corresponding article was deleted (Article 13 in the initial proposal), and given the redrafting of former Article 12 (now Article 11), - amendments 37 and 38 should be rejected because not all Community institutions and bodies will automatically have to adapt their rules of procedure.
It looks forward to constructive discussions with the European Parliament with a view to the early adoption of the Regulation. [1] OJ C 117, 30.4.2004, p. 52. --------------------------------------------------
