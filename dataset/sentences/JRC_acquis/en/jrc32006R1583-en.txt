Council Regulation (EC) NoÂ 1583/2006 of 23 October 2006 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ethanolamines originating in the United States of America Council Regulation (EC) No 1583/2006 of 23 October 2006 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ethanolamines originating in the United States of America THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] (hereinafter referred to as the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 9 and 11(2) thereof, Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission, after consulting the Advisory Committee, Whereas: A.
Two of the three companies benefiting from an individual anti-dumping duty were Dow Chemical Company and Union Carbide Corporation. (3) After disinvestment of Dow Chemical Company's ethanolamine business into the company INEOS LLC, the individual anti-dumping duty of EUR 69,40 per tonne applicable to Dow Chemical Company was attributed to INEOS LLC [4].
However, since the Dow Chemical Company acquired on 6 February 2001 all shares of Union Carbide Corporation, a company benefiting from an individual anti-dumping duty of EUR 59,25 per tonne, the Dow Chemical Company is still active in the ethanolamine business.
The Union Carbide Corporation still exists but has become part of the Dow Chemical Company group and does no longer have any independent production activities. 2.
Request for an expiry review (4) Following the publication in November 2004 of a notice of impending expiry of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of ethanolamines originating in the USA [5], the Commission received on 25 April 2005 a request for a review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. (5) The request was lodged by CEFIC on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 75 %, of the total Community production of ethanolamine. (6) The request was based on the grounds that expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the Community industry.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (8) The Commission's services sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned and to those who requested a questionnaire within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (9) The Commission also gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. (10) Replies to the questionnaire were received from two exporting producers in the USA and their nine related importers in the Community, one related importer in Switzerland, three Community producers (the applicant Community producers), and one industrial user in the Community.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: (a) Applicant Community producers BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany Innovene Europe Ltd, Staines, United Kingdom SASOL GmbH, Marl, Germany (b) Exporting producers in the USA The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan and Houston, Texas, USA (c) Related importers in the Community Dow Chemical Iberica SL, Tarragona, Spain INEOS Oxide Ltd, Antwerp, Belgium (d) Related importer in Switzerland Dow Europe GmbH, Horgen, Switzerland (e) Industrial users in the Community Degussa Goldschmidt Espana SA, Granollers, Spain 4.
Investigation period (12) The investigation regarding the continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 (the RIP).
Finally, the product can also be used by the manufacturers themselves or by their related manufacturers in the production of ethylene amines. 2.
Like product (15) As in the previous investigations, it was shown that the product concerned produced in the USA and sold to the Community is identical in terms of physical and technical characteristics to the product produced and sold in the Community by the Community producers and that there is no difference in use between those products.
LIKELIHOOD OF A CONTINUATION OR RECURRENCE OF DUMPING (16) In accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether dumping was currently taking place and, if so, whether or not the expiry of the measures would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping. 1.
Preliminary remarks (17) Of the four US exporting producers named in the complaint, two did cooperate in the investigation. (18) The two cooperating exporting producers represented 100 % of imports to the Community during the RIP, which amounted to 41000 tonnes.
Imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the USA represented 16,7 % of Community consumption during the RIP down from 29 % during the previous investigation period (1998). 2.
Dumping of imports during the RIP Normal value (19) With regard to the two cooperating US exporting producers, normal value was established for each type of the product concerned, based on the price paid or payable on the domestic market in the USA by unrelated customers pursuant to Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation, since these sales were found to have been made in sufficient quantities and in the ordinary course of trade.
Export price (20) As in the original and in the previous review investigation, this investigation showed again that the two cooperating US exporting producers exported the product concerned to the Community via companies which are related.
As a consequence, and in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, export prices were constructed on the basis of the prices at which the imported product was first resold to independent customers in the Community.
Comparison (21) The normal value was compared with the average export price for each type of the product concerned, on an ex-works basis and at the same level of trade.
Dumping margin (22) In accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established per product type on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export prices at the same level of trade.
If the export prices were reduced commensurate to the level of the duties, the dumping margins observed during the RIP would be 13,4 % for INEOS and 28,3 % for Dow Chemical.
Further room for exports to the Community market because of unused US production capacity (25) It is estimated that the unused production capacity in the US during the RIP is about 90000 tonnes.
Compared to an estimated installed total capacity in the USA of 650000 tonnes, total estimated fulfilled demand and captive use of 560000 tonnes implies a capacity utilisation rate of 86 %, which is rather low given the favourable market conditions during the RIP.
The relatively low capacity utilisation rate was a consequence of operational problems in certain production facilities.
The spare capacity of 90000 tonnes should be compared to the volume of exports from the US to the Community during the RIP (41088 tonnes) and total Community consumption (246670 tonnes).
Evolution of the prices in the Community market and in the exporting country market (27) The ethanolamine market has been characterised by strong growth in the demand for DEA in the years 2000-2001, triggered by the use of DEA in the production of glyphosate herbicides, which are used in a process to allow genetically modified crops to resist such herbicides.
As a consequence, the worldwide price level of ethanolamines is high because of high demand. (28) The investigation showed that US domestic prices are on average higher than average sales prices on the Community market.
This implies that sales prices on the Community are set for a longer period and are more stable. (29) Sales to traders and distributors by the two cooperating exporting producers represent only 13 % of the volumes sold on the US domestic market and 32 % of sales on the Community market, but the US domestic prices were on average 35 % higher than the Community prices for this level of trade.
Therefore, in a context of increasing prices, US domestic prices will have a tendency to be relatively higher than Community prices.
On the other hand, this level of trade represents the smaller part of sales on both the US domestic and Community markets. (30) For industrial users, which constitute the majority of customers, the termination of the measures would probably not influence the price level at which ethanolamine is sold in the Community market, since it was observed that the burden of the measures was carried by the US exporting producers.
Lower volumes shipped typically entail higher sales prices. (32) In summary, for both cooperating exporting producers, the US market in principle remains the most important sales market.
A reduction of export volumes may possibly be expected from the US producer INEOS after the takeover of Innovene, with its production facilities in the Community, once the company would have de-bottlenecked the acquired production facilities and have expanded by installing new capacity in the Community, which is not expected to become operational before 2008.
All figures in the following recitals are based on information sourced from the companies BASF, Dow and INEOS and the chemical industry's leading reference publications by PCI and Tecnon. (36) Taking into account the projections of both US and Community producers on future demand and production capacity, growth on the Community market is foreseen to be lower than in the rest of the world.
The projected Community average growth rate on an annual basis stands at around 3 % in the medium term, compared to 7 % in Asia and 4,2 % projected worldwide. (37) In 2004, demand on the European market exceeded Community installed production capacity by approximately 40000 tonnes.
The inverse situation existed in the USA, where the existing capacity was some 90000 tonnes higher than the effective use and sale of the product, which nevertheless did not negatively affect the high price levels, because of operational production problems limiting supply to the customers.
Confronting the projected growth rates with the announced capacity expansions, some excess capacity over demand on the Community market can be expected as from 2008, in particular because of the likely implementation of INEOS' investment plans in the Community, which would increase the installed capacity in the Community by one quarter to a third.
Such capacity expansion is expected not to become operational before early 2008.
This is illustrated by the fact that Dow Chemical has formed a joint venture with Petronas, called Optimal, and has installed 75000 tonnes capacity in Malaysia, dedicated to serve the Asian ethanolamine market. (39) More in general, by 2010, worldwide production capacity is likely to have increased from around 1300000 tonnes to 1785000 tonnes.
World demand at a projected growth rate of 4,2 % would by 2010 have increased to between 1550000 tonnes and 1700000 tonnes.
Conclusion on the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping (40) It is recalled that dumping during the RIP was found to exist for both cooperating exporting producers, however at a lower level than in the previous review investigation. (41) Compared to the previous review investigation, market share of US imports decreased from 29 % to 16,7 %.
Moreover, in order to maintain the profitability of production capacities installed, there currently exists an incentive for all producers to increase their sales to the Community market, should measures be repealed. (42) To conclude, there is a likelihood of continuation of dumping and a risk of an increase of the volume of imports possibly exerting a downward pressure on prices in the Community, at least in the short term, if measures were repealed.
DEFINITION OF THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY (43) The three applicant Community producers fully cooperated in the investigation.
Hence, he had to be considered as non-cooperating. (44) It should be noted that since Regulation (EC) No 1603/2000 publishing the measures that are currently in force, Union Carbide Ltd (UK), which was taken over by the Dow Chemical Company, no longer produces ethanolamine in the Community.
Finally, INEOS Oxide Ltd, the UK-based parent company of INEOS Americas LLC, acquired Innovene on 16 December 2005.
Both companies, INEOS Americas LLC and Innovene, continued to fully cooperate in the proceeding. (45) On this basis the three Community producers are BASF AG, Innovene and Sasol and they constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation. (46) The investigation showed that, as in the previous review investigation, part of the production of ethanolamine in the Community is intended for internal, or captive, use.
Community consumption | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Total tonnes | 283992 | 331194 | 358830 | 366645 | Index | 100 | 117 | 126 | 129 | Captive tonnes | 97768 | 107539 | 118584 | 119975 | Index | 100 | 110 | 121 | 123 | Free market tonnes | 186224 | 223655 | 240246 | 246670 | Index | 100 | 120 | 129 | 132 | (47) The determination of total Community consumption was based on the combination of production minus the exports of all producers in the Community and the imports from third countries into the Community market.
The most important demand drivers since 2002 have been DEA for glyphosate production, TEA for esterquats and MEA for wood treatment. (48) Free market consumption increased by 32 % (or by 60000 tonnes) over the period considered with an increase of 20 % (or 37000 tonnes) between 2002 and 2003. (49) Concerning the captive market, consumption increased by 23 % or by 22000 tonnes due to increased use of ethanolamines in production processes of other chemicals. 2.
US Imports | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Tonnes | 46075 | 40576 | 40512 | 41088 | Index | 100 | 88 | 88 | 89 | Market share | 24,7 % | 18,1 % | 16,9 % | 16,7 % | Import price EUR/tonne | 979,63 | 915,15 | 975,09 | 995,55 | Index | 100 | 93 | 100 | 102 | (50) The volume of imports into the Community from the USA decreased by 12 % between 2002 and 2003 and has remained at that level since.
The drop of imports and market share between 2002 and 2003 coincided with a 7 % overall decline of the average import price.
Between 2002 and 2003, the US exporting producers did not participate in the expansion of the free market consumption in the Community.
Also after 2003, the US exporting producers did not increase their market share, although import prices increased again.
Over the period considered, the average import price increased modestly by 2 %.
This was the reason that the previous review investigation led to the revision of the form of the anti-dumping measures and that specific fixed duty rates per tonne were imposed. (52) In the current review investigation, both the US exporting producers and their related importers in the Community were found to have realised profits during the RIP and the related importers' margins were found to have conformed to market conditions.
The sales price levels compared to normal value and/or cost of production allowed for adequate profits for all companies involved in markets characterised by high sales prices. (53) The comparison of cif import prices at Community frontier charged to independent customers including anti-dumping duties with the Community industry's ex-work prices, for the same product types and on the same level of trade, led to the establishment of undercutting of the Community industry's sales prices by between 7,3 % and 17,5 %. 3.
Imports from other third countries | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Tonnes | 17596 | 18688 | 12276 | 8773 | Index | 100 | 106 | 70 | 50 | Market share | 9,4 % | 8,4 % | 3,4 % | 2,4 % | Import price EUR/tonne | 1034,23 | 970,75 | 982,67 | 955,24 | Index | 100 | 94 | 95 | 92 | (54) Imports from other third countries halved over the period considered.
Economic situation of the Community industry Output, production capacity and capacity utilisation | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Production in tonnes | 206481 | 242350 | 279307 | 290625 | Index | 100 | 117 | 135 | 141 | Capacity in tonnes | 263320 | 273820 | 302070 | 311820 | Index | 100 | 104 | 115 | 118 | Capacity utilisation | 78,4 % | 88,5 % | 92,5 % | 93,2 % | (55) Over the period considered, production has increased by 41 %.
At the same time capacity was extended by 18 %, leading to an improvement of capacity utilisation from 78,4 % to 93,2 %. (56) The production capacity increase between 2002 and 2003 is marginal and reflects some efficiency improvements.
Inventories Inventories | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Tonnes | 9543 | 10883 | 10228 | 7596 | Index | 100 | 114 | 107 | 80 | (57) The level of inventories is compared at the end of each year 2002 to 2004 and varies to a certain degree depending upon orders.
Sales volume, market share and sales price | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Sales volume | 130214 | 144103 | 167054 | 175953 | Index | 100 | 111 | 128 | 135 | Market share in total consumption (including captive use) | 45,9 % | 43,5 % | 46,6 % | 48,0 % | Market share in free market consumption | 69,9 % | 64,4 % | 69,5 % | 71,3 % | Sales price EUR/tonne (free market sales) | 801,77 | 758,49 | 835,68 | 936,08 | Index | 100 | 95 | 104 | 117 | (58) The Community industry's sales volume to unrelated customers increased by 35 % over the period considered.
Both the market share of total Community consumption and of free market consumption indicate that after a loss of market share between 2002 and 2003, market share has stabilised and stood at 48 % in relation to total consumption respectively 71,3 % in the free market during the RIP.
The average price level of sales to unrelated customers followed a similar pattern and after a decrease of 5 % between 2002 and 2003, the price level in the free market during the RIP was 17 % higher than in 2002. (59) Compared to the price level during the RIP of the previous review investigation, which coincided with the calendar year 1998, sales prices in 2004 and during the current RIP were on average respectively 22,7 % and 37,5 % higher than in 1998.
Factors affecting Community prices (60) Consumption has been continually increasing over the last decade, from 152000 tonnes in 1995 to 367000 tonnes during the RIP, which represents an annual increase of 9,7 %.
This evolution has supported high price levels in the Community, at the same time pushing the Community industry towards an important improvement of capacity utilisation rates from 78,4 % to 93,2 %, leading to a 14,5 % annual increase of production.
In absolute terms production increased by 84000 tonnes compared to an increase of consumption of 83000 tonnes, and capacity expanded by only 48500 tonnes. | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Average cost of production EUR/tonne | 779,53 | 749,85 | 746,84 | 790,60 | Index | 100 | 96 | 96 | 101 | (61) High and increasing demand compared to a lower pace of capacity expansion and overall reduction of imports have sustained the price level of ethanolamine in the Community.
The increase of cost of production by 5,9 % between 2004 and the RIP was the consequence of an increasing naphta price, which is an oil based energy driver used in the production of ethylene oxide, the main raw material in the production of ethanolamine in the Community.
Employment, productivity and wages | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Employment | 102 | 103 | 101 | 102 | Index | 100 | 101 | 99 | 99 | Productivity tonnes per employee | 2016 | 2354 | 2755 | 2861 | Index | 100 | 117 | 137 | 142 | Wages in EUR 1000 | 6860 | 7526 | 8018 | 7598 | Index | 100 | 110 | 117 | 111 | Average wage per employee (EUR) | 66976 | 73105 | 79097 | 74797 | Index | 100 | 109 | 118 | 112 | (62) Employment at the level of the Community industry for the like product remained stable during the period considered.
Profitability Sales to unrelated parties in the Community | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Sales value in EUR 1000 | 104402 | 109301 | 139603 | 164705 | Index | 100 | 105 | 134 | 158 | Cost of production in EUR 1000 | 101506 | 108056 | 124763 | 139100 | Index | 100 | 106 | 123 | 137 | Profitability | 2,8 % | 1,1 % | 10,6 % | 15,5 % | (64) The profitability over the period considered on free market sales of the product concerned to unrelated parties in the Community increased from 2,8 % in 2002 to 15,5 % during the RIP, after a decline to 1,1 % in 2003.
This improvement of profitability since 2003 is to be seen in the context of stable imports from the USA, and an increasing demand, with a consequence of both increased sales volumes and an increased sales price level, which during 2004 and the RIP were more pronounced than the increase of the cost of production.
Investments, return on investment and ability to raise capital | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Investments in EUR 1000 | 1170 | 9975 | 687478 | 388476 | Index | 100 | 852 | 58750 | 33198 | Return on investment | 2,2 % | 0,9 % | 10,2 % | 17,6 % | (65) The price levels obtained in the Community determine whether companies are inclined to build additional capacity.
Cash flow | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Cash flow in EUR 1000 | 4842 | 3301 | 16863 | 27596 | Index | 100 | 68 | 348 | 570 | Cash flow on turnover | 4,6 % | 3,0 % | 12,1 % | 16,6 % | (67) The evolution of the cash flow is a further illustration of the link between price levels, profitability and the return on investment.
After low cash flow levels in 2002 and 2003, the Community industry returned to double-digit figures for the cash flow in relation to turnover since 2004 and its level for most companies is sufficiently high in order to direct funding towards new investments in the ethanolamines business.
Growth (68) The Community industry benefited from the growth of the market over the period considered, which is illustrated by the increase of its market share of total consumption from 45,9 % to 48 % and of its market share of free consumption from 69,9 % to 71,3 %.
Export activity of the Community industry | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | RIP | Export volume tonnes | 15631 | 15278 | 16709 | 17428 | Index | 100 | 98 | 107 | 111 | (71) The Community industry's export volumes to third countries increased by 11 % over the period considered which corresponds to 4 % on average on an annual basis, which is largely in line with the expansion of world consumption.
Conclusion on the situation on the Community market (72) The volume of ethanolamine consumed on the Community market expanded by 29 % while imports from the USA declined by 11 % over the period considered.
At the same time, the Community industry could increase its sales volume and thereby stabilise and even slightly increase its market share. (73) The economic situation of the Community industry improved with respect to most of the economic indicators: production (+ 41 %), production capacity (+ 18 %) and capacity utilisation, sales volume (+ 35 % or + 45000 tonnes) and value (+ 58 %), productivity, market share (+ 2 percentage points), cash flow and profitability, investments and return on investment.
The Community industry moreover benefited from the growth of the Community market and kept pace with world demand evolution as its export activity increased by 11 % in volume. (74) To conclude, in view of the positive development of the indicators pertaining to the Community industry, it is considered to be in a good situation.
Removal of the measures could, if the export prices were reduced commensurately, lead to dumping margins between 13,4 % and 28,3 % for the cooperating exporting producers, whereas the behaviour of the non-cooperating producers, that represented 42 % of the imports in the original investigation, remains unknown.
The latter, however, being subject to the highest anti-dumping measures, would have the highest incentive to return to the Community market, if measures were terminated. (76) At the same time it is estimated that a spare capacity of 90000 tonnes exists currently in the US market, once the operational problems and the effect of the hurricane will have been remedied. (77) It was therefore concluded that there is a likelihood of continuation of dumping and a risk of an increase of the volume of imports exerting a downward pressure on prices in the Community, at least in the short term, if measures were repealed. (78) It is normally the case that an increase of dumped imports would exercise a downward pressure on the sales price level and would negatively affect the Community industry's profitability as well as its financial recovery that was observed during the period considered.
Expected shift of US production from MEG to ethanolamine (79) It is expected that US producers will to a certain extent redirect the use of the main raw material ethylene oxide (EO) from the production of monoethyleneglycol (MEG) to the production of ethanolamine. (80) The raw material EO is used in the production of other chemical products or derivatives, mostly ethylene glycols and in particular monoethyleneglycol (MEG).
However, since the end of 2003, MEG prices in the Community significantly increased and they became higher than ethylene prices and at certain periods of time even higher than ethanolamine prices.
As a consequence, EO has been increasingly redirected towards MEG production, thereby creating a relative scarcity for EO in the market, at the same time contributing to keep ethanolamine prices at a relatively high level. (82) However, Middle East countries are currently investing in naphta-based ethylene glycol capacity.
Hurricane damage in Louisiana was primarily responsible for occasional US domestic market shortages. (86) This evolution continued into the first five months of 2006 but at a remarkably lower pace: prices on the Community market rose between 2,8 % and 4 % and on the US domestic market by 9,9 %, illustrating a gradual curing of the local operational and damage problems. (87) Compared to the RIP, oil prices increased considerably during the second half of 2005 and were on average some 30 % higher, affecting further the cost of naphta, the increase of which began in the second half of the RIP (first semester of 2005).
Conclusion on the likelihood of recurrence of injury (90) In case measures were repealed, there is a short term likelihood of a significant increase of dumped US imports to the Community with downward pressure on prices as a consequence. (91) In the medium term, this could be aggravated by the increase of ethanolamine production in the US in reaction to reduced MEG sales opportunities, necessitating the US producers to find additional sales markets and thereby redirecting larger volumes to the Community market. (92) The apparent end of the increase of sales prices in the beginning of 2006 and the adverse evolution of the cost of production due to the oil price evolution also seem to negatively affect the Community industry's profitability. (93) All these factors point to a likelihood of recurrence of injury.
Preliminary remark (94) In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether maintaining the anti-dumping measures currently in force would be against the interest of the Community as a whole.
Furthermore, the present investigation is an expiry review, thus analysing a situation in which anti-dumping measures are in place. (96) On this basis it was examined whether, despite the conclusion on the likelihood of a continuation of dumping and likelihood of recurrence of injury, compelling reasons exist which would lead to the conclusion, in this particular case, that it is not in the Community interest to maintain measures. 2.
Interest of the Community industry (97) It is recalled that dumping during the RIP was still present and that there exists a likelihood of continuation of dumping of the product concerned originating in the USA and of recurrence of injury to the Community industry. (98) The Community industry has proven to be a viable and competitive industry, confirmed by the positive development of most economic indicators, in particular profitability, cash flow and return on investment.
Of course, discontinuation of the measures could be in the interest of the related importers in case the sales price level to clients would not be affected and in case the US exporting producers would not claim part or all of the resulting extra profit margin while setting the prices at which related importers can purchase ethanolamine. 4.
One industrial user, representing around 14 % of total US imports during the RIP, replied to the questionnaire, two others made their views known and forwarded information on the cost structure of production of the finished goods.
These industrial users argue that the increase of the TEA price is putting their businesses in danger and that there exists a shortage of supply on the Community market.
Moreover, the continuation of production in the Community is allegedly in jeopardy if profitability of the esterquat business is not improved. (103) It was found that during the RIP TEA represented around 23 % of the total cost of production of esterquats, up from 22 % in 2003 but overall comparable to the situation that existed in 2002, the first year of the period considered.
This cost reduction, under the hypothesis that the abolition of measures would be fully translated into a lower purchase price, would reduce the cost of TEA by approximately 7 %.
The effect in the full cost of production of the finished goods would be a reduction of around 1 %, improving the profitability by the same margin. (104) It was found that profitability in the esterquat business has indeed deteriorated over the period considered from around 18 % to 8 %.
However, the decline of the sales price of esterquats by 6 % over the period considered seems to have been the major contributing factor, causing the relative importance of production costs in the sales price to rise by almost 10 %.
The sector seems to undergo the effect of a move east, in particular to Russia, where lower cost solutions can be found in general, but more specifically for the purchase of the other main raw material %quot%thalo fatty acid%quot%.
Conclusion on Community interest (107) The investigation has shown that the existing anti-dumping measures have contributed to the recovery of the Community industry.
All imports originating in the USA are made via related traders, who, while measures were in place, were found to have obtained market conform profit margins during the RIP. (109) Furthermore, in the past, the existing measures appear not to have had any significant negative effect on the economic situation of the users.
The investigation on the likelihood of recurrence of injury however showed that a number of factors such as the spare capacity existing in the USA, the reduced sales opportunities for MEG, the situation of the ethanolamine both worldwide and at Community level, point to a likelihood of recurrence of injury in the medium term. (114) It follows from the above that, as provided for by Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of ethanolamines originating in the United States of America, imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1603/2000, as last amended by a notice regarding the anti-dumping fixed duty rate applicable to INEOS [7], should be maintained.
It is further considered that measures should be maintained for an additional period of two years only. (115) On the one hand, a likelihood of recurrence of injurious dumping has been established based on the facts that (i) dumping by US exporting producers has continued notwithstanding the measures in force, and (ii) there is an expectation of increased imports into the Community because of existing excess production capacity of 90000 tonnes in the USA that will become operational again by the end of 2006 and considering that there is no corresponding domestic demand to absorb this capacity in the USA.
Additionally, the main non-cooperating US producer currently subject to the highest anti-dumping duty and therefore also having the highest incentive to return to the Community market in case the measures lapse, has the necessary distribution network at its disposal because it sells other chemical products in the Community market. (116) On the other hand, US excess capacity is expected to disappear gradually towards 2010 at the latest and the planned capacity expansions by one of the cooperating US exporting producers in the Community are scheduled to come online by the end of 2008, thus in two years time.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of ethanolamines falling within CN codes ex29221100 (monoethanolamine) (TARIC code 2922110010), ex29221200 (diethanolamine) (TARIC code 2922120010) and 29221310 (triethanolamine), originating in the United States of America. 2.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free at Community frontier price, before duty, of the products described above and manufactured by the companies below shall be as follows: Country | Company | Specific fixed duty | United States of America | The Dow Chemical Corporation 2030 Dow Center Midland, Michigan 48674 USA (TARIC additional code A115) | EUR 59,25 per tonne | INEOS Americas LLC 7770 Rangeline Road Theodore, Alabama 36582 USA (TARIC additional code A145) | EUR 69,40 per tonne | Huntsman Chemical Corporation 3040 Post Oak Boulevard PO Box 27707 Houston, Texas 77056 (TARIC additional code A116) | EUR 111,25 per tonne | All other companies (TARIC additional code A999) | EUR 111,25 per tonne | 3.
In cases where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation and, therefore, the price actually paid or payable is apportioned for the determination of the customs value pursuant to Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 [8], the amount of the anti-dumping duty, calculated on the basis of the amounts set above, shall be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and shall be in force for a period of two years.
