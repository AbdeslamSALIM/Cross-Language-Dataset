Council Regulation (EC) No 382/2001 covers two overarching themes: a) the development of projects aimed at reinforcing bilateral cooperation with all the partner countries across a broad range of areas, and, b) the promotion of commercial relations with an exclusive focus on Japan and Korea.
Newly industrialised Asian countries and territories The TPIC also includes newly industrialised Asian countries and territories with whom the EU is engaged in long-term relations: Brunei, Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore and Chinese Taipei.
EU relations with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are governed by the 1989 Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
Furthermore, an Economic Dialogue meeting was launched in 2003 with the aim of facilitating dialogue and better understanding on areas of shared interest.
In this context, existing programmes or initiatives whose lifecycle goes beyond 2006 should be continued (e.g.
ANNEXES ANNEX 1 - ESTABLISHED COOPERATION FRAMEWORK The key legal and policy tools for fostering cooperation with TPIC countries are as follows: 1.
NEWLY INDUSTRIALISED ASIAN COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES The cooperation with Brunei, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Macao (since 1999) and Singapore have been excluded from the Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/92 of 25 February 1992 on financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America (the “ALA” regulation), as a result of the status of these countries and territories as non-developing countries.
In a 1997 communication entitled “The EU and Hong Kong: Beyond 1997” the Commission undertook to have a vigorous and effective engagement with the Hong Kong SAR and to explore ways to put trade investment and cooperation relations on a more permanent footing.
In the case of Macao our relations are based on a Trade and Co-operation Agreement concluded on 14 December 1992, which came into effect on 1 January 1993 and on the Commission communication of November 1999 entitled “The European Union and Macao: Beyond the Year 2000”.
GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL COUNTRIES EU relations with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, are governed by a Cooperation Agreement signed in 1989 between the European Community and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
