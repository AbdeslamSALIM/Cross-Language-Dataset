Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines /* COM/2005/0253 final - COD 2005/0111 */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 14.6.2005 COM(2005) 253 final 2005/0111 (COD) Proposal for a DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal This proposal concerns extending the transposition deadline for Member States and the compliance date for regulated firms of Directive 2004/39/EC on Market in Financial Instruments (MiFID).
However, a significant part of that transposition period will be taken up by the preparation of the necessary implementing measures for 17 provisions of the directive, which cannot be effective without such measures.
Transposition - entry into force For reasons of coherence the transposition deadline for this proposal has been aligned to the proposed extended transposition deadline (i.e. 30 October 2006) for Directive 2004/39/EC (Article 2).
However, national legislation, implementing the previous regime established by Directive 93/22/EC may remain into force until the full application of the MiFID into national law (i.e. 30 April 2007).
By 30 April 2007 at the latest, the Commission shall, on the basis of public consultation and in the light of discussions with competent authorities, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the possible extension of the scope of the provisions of this Directive concerning pre and post-trade transparency obligations to transactions in classes of financial instruments other than shares. 2.
By 30 April 2008 at the latest, the Commission shall present a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of Article 27. 3.
By 30 October 2007 at the latest, the Commission shall, on the basis of public consultations and in the light of discussions with competent authorities, report to the European Parliament and to the Council on: (a) the continued appropriateness of the exemption provided for in Article 2(1)(k) for undertakings whose main business is dealing on own account in commodity derivatives; (b) the content and form of proportionate requirements for the authorisation and supervision of such undertakings as investment firms within the meaning of this Directive; (c) the appropriateness of rules concerning the appointment of tied agents in performing investment services and/or activities, in particular with respect to the supervision on them; (d) the continued appropriateness of the exemption provided for in Article 2(1)(i). 4.
They shall apply these provisions from 1 May 2007.” (4) In Article 71, paragraphs 1 to 4 are replaced by the following: “1.
Investment firms already authorised in their home Member State to provide investment services before 30 April 2007 shall be deemed to be so authorised for the purposes of this Directive, if the laws of that Member State provide that to take up such activities they must comply with conditions comparable to those provided for in Articles 9 to 14. 2.
A regulated market or a market operator already authorised in its home Member State before 30 April 2007 shall be deemed to be so authorised for the purposes of this Directive, if the laws of that Member State provide that the regulated market or market operator, as the case may be, must comply with conditions comparable to those provided for in Title III. 3.
Tied agents already entered in a public register before 30 April 2007 shall be deemed to be so registered for the purposes of this Directive, if the laws of those Member States provide that tied agents must comply with conditions comparable to those provided for in Article 23. 4.
Information communicated before 30 April 2007 for the purposes of Articles 17, 18 or 30 of Directive 93/22/EEC shall be deemed to have been communicated for the purposes of Articles 31 and 32 of this Directive.” Article 2 Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 October 2006 at the latest.
Article 3 This Directive shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
