A more detailed report (working document of the Commission services SEC(2005) 747 ) providing economic and financial information regarding the beneficiary countries is released in parallel. 2.
It has continued to incorporate a set of principles reaffirmed by the Council in its conclusions of 8 October 2002, which underline the exceptional character of this assistance, its complementarity to financing from the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and its macroeconomic conditionality.
During the period 2000-2003, the Balkans countries (former Yugosla v Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro and Albania) have benefited from nine assistance decisions of the Council.
This situation makes the Balkans countries the main beneficiaries of MFA for 2000-2004 with a total of new decisions amounting to a maximum of EUR 733 million. 2.2.1.
Disbursement of EUR 7 million in grants for Tajikistan and of EUR 15 million in loans for Serbia and Montenegro have been initiated in 2004 but, due to technical reasons, the financial transfer has been postponed to 2005. 2.3.
As observed already in 2000 and 2001, MFA is aimed not only at promoting macroeconomic stabilisation but also at supporting the recipient governments' programmes of structural reform.
Consistently, MFA has been effectively combined with assistance from the PHARE/ISPA, TACIS or CARDS programmes with a view to strengthening the institutional capacity that was essential to the success of the structural reform process.
In 2003, grants reached 2.2% of GDP in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 2.6% in Albania, 2.4% in Serbia and Montenegro.
Growth in several other countries of the region ( Belarus, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Georgia ) approached or exceeded 10%.
The implementation of the measures foreseen in the EU-Moldova Action Plan recently adopted in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy will be the test of Moldovaâ€™s readiness to pursue decisively and effectively a genuine market reform agenda.
