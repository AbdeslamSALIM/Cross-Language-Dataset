Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a European Regional Development Fund (COM(2004) 495 final &amp;mdash; 2004/0167 (COD)) Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee on the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a European Regional Development Fund (COM(2004) 495 final — 2004/0167 (COD)) (2005/C 255/18) On 21 December 2004 the Council of the European Union decided to consult the European Economic and Social Committee, under Article 262 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, on the abovementioned communication.
At its 416th plenary session on 6 and 7 April 2005 (meeting of 6 April), the European Economic and Social Committee adopted the following opinion by 123 votes to 1 with 4 abstentions: 1.
Opinion of the Committee 5.1 Introduction, Scope of the regulations and Eligible Expenditure (Articles 1, 2, 3, 7 and 13) 5.1.1 The Committee welcomes the clear link made in Article 2 between the purpose of the fund and the objectives of the Community and particularly the Lisbon agenda.
The regulation should reflect these factors and whilst recognising the primary role of the ESF in these areas, support for network to promote best practice in innovation as widely defined should be supported. 5.3.2 The Committee welcomes the commitment to sustainable development, energy efficiency and the promotion of renewable energy sources as desirable goals in themselves.
These latter points are also very relevant in major urban centres. 5.4 Activities to promote European Territorial Cooperation (Article 6) 5.4.1 The Committee has welcomed the Commission's proposals for support for cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation building on the experience of Interreg [12].
The regulation limits this derogation to activities under the "Regional Competitiveness and Employment" objective and also to 10 % of the "priority concerned [17]".
The 10 % level therefore should apply to the programme as a whole to enable sufficient flexibility. 5.6 Rural areas and areas dependent on fisheries (Article 9) 5.6.1 The Committee specifically commented on the need to ensure that these activities were not limited to agricultural projects and welcomes the focus on infrastructure, telecommunications, new economic activities, links between urban and rural areas and promoting tourism.
The Committee welcomes this and refers to the more detailed work also undertaken by the Committee on the EAFRD. 5.7 Areas with natural handicaps and outermost areas (Articles 10 and 11) 5.7.1 The Committee has argued for the continuation of solidarity with these regions with particular difficulties and broadly welcomes these proposals.
Article 10 contains the phrase "without prejudice to Article 3 and 4", implying that these regions are also eligible for support under those priorities, it would be useful to explicitly set out in the Regulation that this indeed is the case.
Similarly Article 11 indicates that this provision permits the funding of additional costs to activities set out in Article 4, which the Committee welcomes.
It would again be helpful to clarify that these regions could also be eligible for support under the other objectives. 5.8 Specific provisions on territorial cooperation objective (Article 12 and Articles 14-22) 5.8.1 The Committee welcomed the proposal for a new legal instrument to facilitate cooperation.
The relationship between ERDF (Article 18) and the new European Grouping of Cross-border Cooperation (EGCC) needs to be clarified, particularly for conferring by Member States the responsibilities of the managing authority on EGCC. 5.8.2 These matters have been considered in more detail and the Committee has drawn up specific conclusions on establishing a European grouping of Cross-Border cooperation [20]. 5.9 Final provisions (Articles 22 — 26) 5.9.1 These confirm the transitional provisions under the current regulations (EC) No. 1783/99 and formally record the proposed beginning and review dates of the regulations.
Brussels, 6 April 2005.
