BACKGROUND 1.1.
At its meeting in Nice in 2000, the European Council acknowledged the need for greater awareness and exchange of experiences, with a view to promoting equality between women and men, in particular through the establishment of a European Gender Institute, and asked the Commission to carry out a feasibility study.
This study, which was completed in 2002, assessed the need for the creation of such an institute as well as its aims and administrative structure. 1.2.
The European Council of June 2004, taking account of the earlier discussions and reflecting the Lisbon objectives as regards gender equality, expressed its support for the establishment of a European Gender Institute and invited the Commission to put forward a proposal. 1.5.
On 8 March 2005, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality[1].
The proposal is in line with both the communication of December 2002 and the draft interinstitutional agreement of February 2005 on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies.[2] 1.6.
An Advisory Forum composed of 25 representatives of competent bodies from all the Member States, as well as three representatives of the social partners and NGOs at European level, is also envisaged as a support mechanism for the Director and as a vehicle for the exchange of information and knowledge. 1.8.
The European Economic and Social Committee delivered its opinion on 27 September 2005.
The European Parliament adopted its position at first reading on 14 March 2006, making 50 amendments, on the basis of the Gröner - Sartori report, drawn up on behalf of the "Women’s Rights and Gender Equality" parliamentary committee. 2.
EXAMINATION OF THE AMENDMENTS The amendments fall mainly into the following categories: those which make the text clearer : the Commission can accept them as they stand (nos. 2, 3, 6, 59/74, 13, 15, 18, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38, 39, 45 and 53) or subject to slight reworking (amendments 7, 8, 10 and 40); - those which reinforce/clarify the tasks of the Institute and its working methods: a vote was taken on a large number of amendments in the FEMM Committee, with a view to reinforcing the Institute’s tasks; a softer line was taken on these amendments in plenary.
The clear position of the European Parliament on the technical nature of the Institute enables the Commission to accept these amendments as they stand ( nos. 60/76 , 61rev/77, 17, 62/78, 64/80, 65/81, 42, 48, 67/83 and 68/84), in part or after reworking (nos. 4, 5, 20, 24, 25, 26 and 63/79).
The Commission accepts , as they stand, amendments 41 (tenure of the Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson of the Management Board) and 55 (clarification of the time limit for setting up the Institute).
The Commission accepts this position of the EP (amendment 66/82), on the condition that, in a very limited number of cases where the Commission assumes responsibility (adoption of the work programme and the budget), the voting weight of the Commission’s representative is equal to that of the nine Council representatives, so as to preserve the balance between the two institutions; - those which, although constructive, are not proper to the Regulation , but are relevant to the Institute’s rules of procedure (no. 31), fall within the competence of the Management Board (nos. 32 and 52) or are covered by other amendments (no. 23), and are not accepted ; - those which form part of legal technique : the Commission accepts amendment 9, which gives greater legal clarity, but does not accept amendment 1, which seeks to include in the specific legal bases of the proposal an article which is not a specific basis (Article 3(2)). 2.1.
Amendment 3 This amendment comprises two small additions to Recital 10 (linked to the Institute’s tasks), making the text clearer, and replacement of the word "collection" by "documentation" of information and data, so as to make it clear that the Institute will place greater emphasis on analysing the information and data obtained, thus lending undoubted added value.
Amendment 6 This amendment adds to Recital 11 an explicit reference to the Institute’s cooperation with national and Community statistical bodies.
Amendment 9 This amendment to Recital 13 refers to Article 3(2) of the Treaty.
It is acceptable, since it adds precision. 2.1.5.
Amendment 15 This amendment to Article 3(1)(b) seeks to reinforce cooperation with Eurostat and national statistical bodies.
Amendment 61rev/77 This amendment to Article 3(1)(c) entails three additions: - disseminate and promote the use of methodological tools; - methodological tools should support not only Community policies but also the resulting national policies; - they should also support gender mainstreaming in all Community institutions and bodies.
Amendment 17 This amendment concerning Article 3(1)(d a) (new) makes explicit provision in the Regulation for the creation of a Network for the Institute, involving all the stakeholders, in order to optimise the use of resources, foster the exchange of information, etc.
It is acceptable; the Commission proposal covers the necessary budget for creating a telematic network, because all the agencies have this.
The Council is also in favour of creating a telematic network. 2.1.11.
Amendment 18 This amendment to Article 3(1)(e) (publication of the Institute’s annual report on its activities) is intended to move this task to a separate paragraph.
Acceptable, as the tasks are presented in a clearer manner; same move in the Council’s text. 2.1.12.
It is acceptable, being also in line with the Council’s text. 2.1.13.
Amendment 64/80 This amendment concerning Article 3(1)(g b) (new) provides that the Institute’s tasks should include cooperation and development of dialogue with the relevant organisations, which is already stipulated in Article 8, thereby drawing more attention to this role of the Institute.
Amendment 65/81 This amendment concerning Article 3(1)(h d) (new) envisages that the Institute will provide the Community institutions with information on gender equality in the accession and candidate countries.
Amendment 28 This amendment concerning Article 3(1)(h e) (new) provides for the dissemination of examples of good practice.
Acceptable, as it clarifies the tasks, but it should be incorporated in Article 3 (1)(a), in line with the Council’s text. 2.1.16.
Amendment 29 This amendment concerning Article 3(1a) (new) provides for the moving to a separate paragraph of the task of publishing the annual report on the Institute’s activities.
Acceptable, as the moving of this task within the text improves the presentation (see amendment 18); it is in line with the Council’s text. 2.1.17.
Acceptable, more concise presentation, in line with the Council’s text. 2.1.18.
Amendment 36 This amendment to Article 8(1) (Cooperation with national/European/international organisations) explicitly includes cooperation with experts and universities.
Amendment 38 This amendment to Article 10(2) stipulates that the members of the Management Board should, additionally, possess transdisciplinary expertise.
It is acceptable, as it makes the text clearer. 2.1.20.
Acceptable, being in line with the Council’s text. 2.1.22.
Amendment 42 This amendment to Article 10(5)(b) envisages the publication of the Institute’s annual report on its website.
Acceptable, as it enhances transparency. 2.1.23.
Amendment 45 This amendment to Article 10(11) makes it clear that the purpose of having the directors of other agencies attend meetings of the Management Board is to coordinate the respective working programmes as regards gender mainstreaming.
Amendment 48 This amendment to Article 11(4) provides that the Director may be called upon at any time by the Council and the EP to attend a hearing on any matter linked to the Institute’s activities.
Amendment 68/84 This amendment to Article 12(4) indicates that the Forum should additionally support the Director in preparing the Institute’s annual and medium-term programmes of activities.
Amendment 53 This amendment to Article 20 (Evaluation) stipulates that the evaluation of the Institute should include the financial implications not just of the extension of tasks but also of any modification of them.
Acceptable, as it gives greater clarity and is in line with the Council’s text. 2.1.28.
Amendment 55 This amendment to Article 23 (Start of the Institute’s activities) points out that the Institute must be operational as soon as possible within the stipulated twelve-month period.
Acceptable, as it strengthens the text. 2.2.
Amendment 5 This amendment introduces a new Recital 10b on the importance for the Institute of highlighting achievements by women in all walks of life so as to provide a positive example for other women to follow.
This will be acceptable after it has been reworked to include the importance of highlighting role models for men as well: “highlighting achievements by women in all walks of life so as to provide a positive example for other women to follow” should therefore be replaced with “ highlighting positive gender roles in European society in all walks of life for other men and women to follow…".
See also amendment 63/79. 2.2.3.
Amendment 7 This amendment to Recital 12 concerning the Institute’s working methods replaces "avoid duplication" with “ ensure the best possible use of resources ".
See also amendment 30, which is not acceptable. 2.2.4.
Amendment 8 This amendment adds a new Recital 12a to reflect the content of Article 8(1) (and of Article 3(1)(g b), following amendment 64/80, which has been accepted) concerning the Institute’s cooperation with the various key bodies.
Amendment 10 This amendment to Recital 19 (subsidiarity) removes the reference to the main objectives because it is considered to be rather limiting.
Amendment 20 This amendment to Article 3(1)(g) further clarifies the description of tasks and is acceptable apart from the words “and promote”, since the Institute will have a budget for organising its own seminars/conferences but not for providing funding for conferences held by other bodies. 2.2.7.
It will be acceptable after it has been reworked in two ways: (a) to include the role of men, which is very important, in order to promote real equality between men and women; “achievements by women” should therefore be replaced with “ positive gender roles in European society " (see also amendment 5), and (b) to remove “propose policies”, as the Institute should simply “present its findings and initiatives…", in view of its role in providing technical support to policy makers. 2.2.8.
Amendment 24 This amendment concerning Article 3(1)(h a) (new) indicates that the Institute’s tasks include providing expertise on gender mainstreaming for public and private organisations.
Amendment 25 This amendment concerning Article 3(1)(h b) (new) indicates that the Institute’s tasks include the submission of recommendations and guidelines to the Community institutions so that they may incorporate effectively gender mainstreaming into legislation.
Amendment 26 This amendment to Article 3(1) adds a new point (h c) on the dialogue which the Institute should develop at international level with bodies and organisations responsible for gender equality.
The text should therefore be replaced with the following wording based on that used for the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work: " collect and make available information on gender equality issues from and to third countries and international organisations" . 2.2.11.
The composition of the Management Board proposed by the European Parliament makes it possible, through a system of rotation, for representatives of all the Member States to sit on the Management Board over three terms of office (9 x 3 = 27), thus ensuring the necessary geographical balance.
Amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission 2.3.1.
Amendment 1 This amendment seeks to include Article 3(2) of the Treaty, which introduces the principle of incorporating the gender dimension into all Community policies, in the legal bases of the proposal.
Article 3(2) and its objective are, moreover, referred to in Recital 2. 2.3.2.
Amendment 23 This amendment to Article 3(1)(h) makes explicit reference to the social partners’ contribution to the Institute’s documentation centre.
See also amendment 7 (accepted with an addition). 2.3.4.
Amendment 31 This amendment concerning Article 4(5)(1a) (new) makes provision for the Institute’s annual report to include all information on the Institute’s contractual relations, the tasks entrusted and the bodies involved.
This falls under the Institute’s rules of procedure. 2.3.5.
Amendment 32 This amendment concerning Article 4a (new) defines in detail the procedure for creating a virtual network for the Institute (as provided for in amendment 17, accepted as it stands).
Amendment 46 This amendment to Article 11(1) (appointment of the Director) makes two adjustments: (a) inclusion of the detailed procedure which the Commission will use to draw up the list of candidates (open competition, after publication of a call for expressions of interest in the OJ/EU and in other publications), which is not necessary, given that the proposed procedure is the one which is applied across the board for all the agencies; (b) all candidates on the short list proposed by the Commission, not just the candidate selected by the Management Board, to make a statement before the EP.
Amendment 47 This amendment to Article 11(2) (extending the Director’s term of office) indicates that the Commission does not make a proposal and is not solely responsible for evaluating the Director, and that this responsibility be shared by the European Parliament and the Management Board.
The provision proposed by the Commission is horizontal in nature and should be retained for the sake of consistency. 2.3.8.
Amendment 52 This amendment to Article 19(1) (Participation of third countries) gives examples of areas in which the Institute may cooperate with third counties.
Amendment 54 This amendment to Article 21 (Review clause) indicates that if the Commission, following an evaluation, deems that the Institute's existence is no longer justified, it may propose that it be repealed.
CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, the Commission accepts in full amendments 2, 3, 6, 9, 59/74, 13, 60/76, 15, 61/77, 17, 18, 62/78, 64/80, 65/81, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 45, 48, 67/83, 68/84, 53 and 55.
