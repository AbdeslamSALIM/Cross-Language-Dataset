The distillers have gradually reached their storage capacity limits as a result and have been unable to accept all the wines to be delivered by the producers for distillation under Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 378/2002(5). (4) The delivery period in Portugal must therefore be extended so that the planned operation can be completed and operators are not penalised for deliveries made after 30 June.
Allowing deliveries to continue is advisable in order to prevent deliveries from extending beyond the wine year. (5) This amendment must therefore apply retroactively from 1 July 2002.
It shall apply from 1 July 2002.
