Article 5 The competent authorities of each Member State shall, within one month, send to the competent authorities of the Member State a copy of the component type-approval certificates, an example of which is given in Annex VII, completed for each type of roll-over protection structure which they approve or refuse to approve.
Article 8 N° Member State may refuse to grant EEC type-approval or national type-approval in respect of a tractor on grounds relating to roll-over protection structures or their tractor attachment if these bear the EEC component type-approval mark and if the requirements laid down in Annex VIII have been satisfied.
Article 9 N° Member State may refuse or prohibit the sale, registration, entry into service or use of any tractor on grounds relating to the roll-over protection structure and its tractor attachment if these bear the EEC component type-approval mark and if the requirements laid down in Annex VIII have been met.
Article 10 This Directive shall not affect the right of Member States to specify - in due compliance with the Treaty - the requirements they deem necessary to ensure that workers are protected when using the tractors in question, provided this does not mean that the protection structures are modified in a way unspecified in this Directive.
Article 12 Any amendments necessary in order to adapt the requirements of the Annexes to this Directive so as to take account of technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 74/150/EEC.
Article 15 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

ANNEX III TEST PROCEDURE A.
The position of the centre of gravity of the block shall be one-sixth of the width of the top of the protection structure inwards from a vertical plane parallel to the median plane of the tractor touching the outside extremity of the top of the protection structure.If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the impact to be applied thereon will have to be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure.1.1.2.The tractor shall be lashed to the ground by means of four wire ropes, one at each end of both axles, arranged as indicated in Figure 5 of Annex IV.
The position of the centre of gravity of the block shall be one-sixth of the width of the top of the protection structure inwards from a vertical plane parallel to the median plane of the tractor touching the outside extremity of the top of the protection structure.If the structure is curved or protruding at this point, wedges enabling the impact to be applied thereon will have to be added, without thereby reinforcing the structure.1.2.2.The tractor shall be lashed to the ground by means of four wire ropes, one at each end of both axles, arranged as indicated in Figure 6 of Annex IV.
Unless it is certain that another part of this edge would hit the ground first, the point of impact shall be in the plane at right angles to the median plane and passing 200 mm in front of the seat reference point, the seat being set at the mid position of the longitudinal seat adjustment.1.3.2.The tractor wheels on the side which is to receive the impact shall be lashed to the ground by means of wire ropes passing over the corresponding ends of the front and rear axles.
It may be necessary to use two beams or wedges if the outer sides of the front and rear tyres are not in the same vertical plane.The prop shall then be placed as indicated in Figure 7 of Annex IV against the rim of the wheel opposite to the impact, pushed firmly against the rim and then fixed at its base.The length of the rop shall be chosen such that it makes an angle of 30 p 3g with the ground when in position against the rim.
This plane must be able to move horizontally with the seat and the steering wheel during the impact but to remain perpendicular to the floor of the tractor or of the protection structure if this is resiliently mounted.2.2.The zone is bounded by the following planes, the tractor being on a horizontal surface and, where the steering wheel is adjustable, its position adjusted for normal seated driving.2.2.1.A horizontal plane - A1B1B2A2 - 900 mm above the seat reference point. 2.2.2.An inclined plane - H1H2G2G1 - perpendicular to the vertical reference plane and including a point 900 mm directly above the seat reference point and the rearmost point of the seat backrest.2.2.3.A cylindrical surface - A1A2H2H1 - which is perpendicular to the reference plane, has a radius of 120 mm and is tangential to the planes defined above in Items 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.2.2.4.A cylindrical surface - B1C1C2B2 - perpendicular to the reference plane, having a radius of 900 mm and extending forward by 400 mm the plane defined in Item 2.2.1 above, to which it is tangential, following a horizontal line 150 mm forward of the seat reference point.2.2.5.A inclined plane - C1D1D2C2 - perpendicular to the reference plane, extending the surface defined in Item 2.2.4 above and passing through a point 40 mm from the outer edge of the steering wheel.2.2.6.A vertical plan - D1K1E1E2K2D2 - perpendicular to the reference plane and passing 40 mm in front of the other edge of the steering wheel.2.2.7.A horizontal plane - E1F1P1N1N2P2F2E2 - passing through the seat reference point.2.2.8.A curvilinear surface - G1L1M1N1N1M2L2G2 - perpendicular to the reference plaen and in contact with the back of the seat backrest.2.2.9.Two vertical planes - K1I1F1E1 and K2I2F2E2 - parallel to the reference plane, 250 mm either side of this plane, and bounded towards the top 300 mm above the horizontal plane passing through the seat reference point.2.2.10.Two inclined and parallel planes - A1B1C1D1K1I1L1G1H1 and A2B2C2D2K2I2L2G2H2 - starting from the upper edge of the planes defined in Item 2.2.9 above and joining the horizontal plane defined in Item 2.2.1 above at least 100 mm from the reference plane on the side where the impact is applied.2.2.11.Two vertical planes - Q1P1N1M1 and Q2P2N2M2 - parallel to the reference plane, 200 mm either side of this plane, and bounded towards the top 300 mm above the horizontal plane passing through the seat reference point.2.2.12.Two portions - I1Q1P1F1 and I2Q2P2F2 - of a vertical plane, perpendicular to the reference plane and passing 350 mm in front of the seat reference point.2.2.13.Two portions - I1Q1M1L1 - and I2Q2M2L2 - of the horizontal plane passing 300 mm above the seat reference point.2.3.Seat location and seat reference point2.3.1Seat reference point2.3.1.1.The refernce point shall be established using the apparatus illustrated in Figures 3 and 3b of Annex IV.
This horizontal plane cuts the lower surface of the seat pan board 150 mm in front of the abovementioned tangent.2.3.1.3.The apparatus shall be positioned on the seat.
It shall then be loaded with a force of 550 N at a point 50 mm in front of joint (A), and the two parts of the backrest board shall be lightly pressed tangentially against the backrest.2.3.1.4.If it is not possible to determine definite tangents to each area of the backrest (above and below the lumbar region) the following must be done:2.3.1.4.1.Where no definite tangent to the lower area is possible the lower part of the backrest board is pressed against the backrest vertically.2.3.1.4.2.Where no definite tangent to the upper area is possible the joint (B) is fixed at a height of 230 mm above the lower surface of the seat pan board, the backrest board being perpendicular to the latter.
