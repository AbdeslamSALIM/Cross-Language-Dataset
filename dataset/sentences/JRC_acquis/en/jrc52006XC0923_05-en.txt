The notified amount of foods irradiated in the EU during 2003 is 17164 tonnes. 4.2.
The situation in 2003 is similar to 2002.
Few products on the market were found to be irradiated and not labelled (3,5 %).
As regards dietary supplements, some Member States (DE, DK, IRL, NL et UK) decided to check this sector in particular, because of the high percentage of products found irradiated and not labelled in 2002 (29,5 %).
In 2003, 524 samples have been controlled, 82 have been found irradiated (16 %).
In total, about 5000 food samples have been checked of which about 2,1 % (excluding the irradiated dietary supplements in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands) were irradiated but not labelled.
Deadline for the submission of results of checks for the report 2004 The deadline for the submission of results of checks to the Commission performed in 2004, according to Article 7 (3) of Directive 1999/2/EC, is 30 April 2005.
