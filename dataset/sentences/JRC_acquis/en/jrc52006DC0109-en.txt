CONCLUSIONS 9 COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Evaluation of the use of User Inspectorates under the Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC) S UMMARY The current Communication is a follow-up to the invitation contained in Directive 97/23/EC on Pressure Equipment to present a report evaluating the functioning of User Inspectorates.
This consultation was announced through various channels and was available on internet from the beginning of October 2004 until the end of January 2005.
Many respondents, mainly users and User Inspectorates, therefore suggested that all Member States should be obliged to transpose Article 14 on User Inspectorates and accept conformity assessment of all User Inspectorates, regardless of whether they have themselves designated User Inspectorates.
The Commission concludes that it would be beneficial to implement the Directive’s provisions on User Inspectorates in all Member States.
However, it should be noted that in practice conformity assessments of non-serial products with combinations of modules like B1 + F, B + F and B + C1 done by a (single) User Inspectorate are quite similar to conformity assessment with module G.
Moreover, modules B and B1 are mainly relevant for serially manufactured products.
Since customer specific serial equipment is stated to become increasingly important for big users, is has been proposed that User Inspectorates could assess manufacturers’ quality systems according to the relevant modules (D, D1, E, E1, H and H1) of the Pressure Equipment Directive.
by making the transposition of Pressure Equipment Directive Article 14 mandatory.
