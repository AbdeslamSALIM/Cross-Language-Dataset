I have the honour to refer to the negotiations held on 14 and 15 October 1999 between our respective Delegations with a view to renewing the Agreement between the European Community and Ukraine on trade in textile products including its annexes and agreed minutes (%quot%the Agreement%quot%) initialled on 5 May 1993, as last amended and extended by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters initialled on 9 November 1995. 2.
Such agreement will aim at the elimination, upon its entry into force, of quantitative restrictions for product categories whose utilisation rates were below 2 % in 1999 (categories 1, 2, 2A, 3, 9, 12, 20, 23, 37, 67 and 115). 3.
Annex I which sets out the products referred to in Article 1 of the Agreement shall be replaced by Annex I to EC Regulation 3030/93 (Appendix 1 to this letter gives further details). 3.2.
Annex II which sets out the quantitative restrictions for exports from Ukraine to the European Community shall be replaced by Appendix 2 to this letter.
For the year 1999 there will be an increase of 60 % for quantitative limits for textile categories 6, 7, 15 and 16, and an increase of 50 % for categories 5, 26/27, 29 and 50.
For the year 2000, the increase will be, subject to the conditions and procedures of paragraph 5 of this letter, 30 % for all textile categories over the effective 1999 levels, with the exception of categories 5, 6, 7, 15, 16, 26/27, 29 and 50, which will be increased by 50 % over the effective 1999 levels. 3.3.
The Annex to Protocol C which sets out the quantitative restrictions for exports from the Republic of Ukraine to the European Community after OPT operations in the Republic of Ukraine shall be replaced by Appendix 3 to this letter. 3.4.
The Parties agreed that imports into Ukraine of the textiles products originating in the Community and listed in Appendix 4 shall not exceed the rates of import duties described in that Appendix (products covered by chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System). 5.
Ukraine undertakes to provide such confirmation by 31 March 2000.
The Parties also agreed that the volume of quantitative limits of year 2000 would be the same as those of 1999 until the moment when Ukraine applies the import tariff levels specified in Annex III. 6.
In the case of non-application of these rates the Community will have the right to reintroduce for the year 2000 the levels for quantitative restrictions applicable for 1999 as specified in the Exchange of Letters initialled on 9 November 1995. 7.
In the meantime, it shall be applied provisionally no later than 1 December 1999 on the conditions to be specified in an Exchange of Notes (see Appendix 5).
Where there is an %quot%ex%quot% symbol in front of a CN code, the products covered in each category are determined by the scope of the CN code and by that of the corresponding description. (1) In 1999 this Annex was published in Official Journal L 134 of 28.5.1999.
