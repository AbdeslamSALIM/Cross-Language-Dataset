The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation (“the Parties”) on mutual recognition in relation to conformity assessment[1] entered into force on 1 June 2002. 2.
In order to reduce administrative burden, Article 10 will be revised so that the Committee set up under the Agreement no longer needs to make formal Decisions to recognise, modify the scope of, or withdraw recognition of conformity assessment bodies in cases where the recognition, withdrawal or change in the scope of activity of the conformity assessment body has not been contested by the other Party.
A new paragraph will be added to Article 11 to clarify the situation regarding the validity of certificates issued by conformity assessment bodies whose recognition has been withdrawn. 7.
The wording of Articles 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 has been changed to reflect the revisions to Articles 10 and 11. 8.
Article 2 refers to specified editions of the relevant ISO/IEC guides.
In order to avoid the need to modify the Agreement each time a new edition of the ISO/IEC guide is produced, the specific reference has been deleted from Article 2 and replaced by a general reference to definitions laid down by ISO and IEC.
The reference to the definitions laid down in European standards 45020 (1993 edition) is no longer valid and has therefore been deleted from Article 2. 11.
