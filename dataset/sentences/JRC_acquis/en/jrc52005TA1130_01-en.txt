Annual Report on the Implementation of the Budget, together with the institutions' replies COURT OF AUDITORS +++++ TIFF +++++ In accordance with the provisions of Article 248 (1) and (4) of the EC Treaty, Articles 143 and 181(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and Articles 116 and 135(2) of the Financial Regulation of 27 March 2003 applicable to the 9th European Development Fund, the Court of Auditors of the European Communities, at its meeting of 28 September 2005, adopted its ANNUAL REPORTS concerning the financial year 2004 The reports, together with the institutions' replies to the Court's observations, were transmitted to the authorities responsible for giving discharge and to the other institutions.
Annual Report on the Implementation of the Budget (2005/C 301/01) TABLE OF CONTENTS General introduction Chapter 1 — The Statement of Assurance and supporting information Chapter 2 — Budgetary Management Chapter 3 — Revenue Chapter 4 — The common agricultural policy Chapter 5 — Structural measures Chapter 6 — Internal policies, including research Chapter 7 — External actions Chapter 8 — Pre-accession strategy Chapter 9 — Administrative expenditure Chapter 10 — Financial instruments and banking activities Annex I [1] — Financial information on the budget Annex II [1] — Reports and Opinions adopted by the Court of Auditors since 2000 [1] The annexes related to the Annual Report on the Implementation of the Budget can be found at the end of this publication. -------------------------------------------------- GENERAL INTRODUCTION 0.1.
The document follows the structure established for recent Annual Reports: the Statement of Assurance is presented in Chapter 1; key observations on budgetary management are given in Chapter 2; Chapters 3 to 9 cover revenue and activities financed from different parts of the budget, reflecting the headings of the financial perspective; while Chapter 10 covers financial instruments and banking activities.
In relation to the Annual Report on the implementation of the general budget, the chapters covering revenue and the major areas of expenditure have the following main elements: - detailed analyses and results of the audit work carried out in the context of the Statement of Assurance in the form of specific assessments, - results of follow-up reviews of progress made on implementing recommendations of the Court and the Budgetary Authorities arising from previous audits, - summaries of the Special Reports published by the Court since the last annual report. 0.3.
In addition, the Annexes to Chapters 4 to 9 set out the elements used for monitoring and evaluating the financial management of the EU budget. 0.4. 2004 was marked by the accession of 10 new Member States on 1 May 2004, the biggest enlargement in the EU's history.
This has resulted in a change in the way that financial information is presented, with details now being given in the budget by ABB policy area. 0.5.
The Court's work shows that further efforts are needed in order that the Commission may provide accurate accounting information for the 2005 year end. 0.6.
Since the reform process was initiated in 2000, the Court has noted an improvement in the way in which the Commission organises itself and manages the EU budget.
In April 2004 the Court issued its Opinion No 2/2004 [1] on the "single audit" model which included a proposal for a Community internal control framework.
Furthermore, clearly defined standards and objectives of internal control systems would provide an objective basis against which the Court could assess their design and operation when auditing them, thereby increasing the effectiveness of its work.

[2] COM(2005) 252 final, 15.6.2005. -------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER 1 The Statement of Assurance and supporting information TABLE OF CONTENTS Statement of Assurance Reliability of the accounts Legality and regularity of the underlying transactions Information in support of the Statement of Assurance Introduction Reliability of the accounts Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget (revenue and expenditure) Consolidated financial statements Action plan for the modernisation of the accounting system Legality and regularity of underlying transactions The Court’s DAS approach DAS audit results 2004 Commission’s internal control system Audit scope The Commission’s management representations Progress made in reinforcing the internal control system Towards a Community internal control framework THE COURT OF AUDITORS’ STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE I.
In the Court's opinion, the "Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget and consolidated financial statements" of the European Communities were drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002 and with the accounting principles, rules and methods set out in the Annexes to the consolidated financial statements [2].
However, adaptations and validations necessary to ensure the full implementation of the new accounting framework have been delayed.
Legality and regularity of the underlying transactions V.
Moreover, for common agricultural policy (CAP) expenditure the Court’s audit shows that, where properly applied, the integrated administration and control system (IACS) is an effective system to limit the risk of irregular expenditure.
The Court concluded that CAP expenditure, viewed as a whole, was still materially affected by errors. (b) In the case of structural measures, the Court again found weaknesses in the management and control systems which show the need, in varying degrees, for improvement in order to fully comply with the regulatory requirements for effective day-to-day management checks and/or independent sample checks of operations for the 2000 to 2006 programming period.
For both programming periods (1994 to 1999 and 2000 to 2006), numerous errors of legality and regularity were detected in the expenditure included in the declarations leading to payments by the Commission. (c) In the case of internal policies, despite the progress made in certain areas, the Court’s audit findings related to the supervisory and control systems and the underlying transactions do not provide sufficient assurance as regards the legality and regularity of payments.
It is likely that the risk of errors will persist unless the legal framework is changed so as to simplify cost reimbursement systems and clarify the procedures and instructions governing the different programmes. (d) In the case of external actions, the improvements of the Commission’s supervisory and control systems have not yet had an impact at implementing organisation level, where a relatively high number of errors at the level of payments in terms of frequency and financial impact were detected which were linked to the lack of a comprehensive approach to the supervision, control and audit of these organisations.
The Treaty also authorises the Court to supplement this statement with specific assessments of each major area of Community activity. | | 1.2.The aim of the work on the reliability of the accounts of the European Communities is to obtain sufficient evidence to conclude on the extent to which revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities have been properly registered and that the annual accounts faithfully reflect the financial position at the end of the year (see paragraphs 1.6 to 1.45). | | 1.3.The aim of the work on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions is to gather sufficient evidence, of a direct or indirect nature, to give an opinion on whether they are in accordance with the applicable regulations or contractual provisions, and have been correctly calculated (see paragraphs 1.46 to 1.86). | | 1.4.Once again, the Court paid particular attention to the efforts made by the Commission to strengthen its internal control system and to the follow-up given to the action plans annexed to the annual activity reports and their Synthesis for the financial year 2003 (see paragraphs 1.54 to 1.86). | | 1.5.In addition, the Court provides indicators to monitor progress in improving internal controls both overall, and for each income and expenditure area (see Annexes to this Chapter and to Chapters 3 to 9). | | Reliability of the accounts 1.6.The Court’s observations concern the final consolidated annual accounts for the financial year 2004, as drawn up by the Commission in compliance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 25 June 2002. | | 1.7.Pending the complete implementation of the action plan on the modernisation of the accounting system as of the financial year 2005 (see paragraphs 1.21 to 1.45) and in the absence of a suitable accounting system, the preparation of the year-end financial statements was still, to a large extent, based on records outside the accounts.
The 2004 closure of accounts was made using the same rules and systems as the previous year, as provided for by both the Financial Regulation and the Commission Communication on the modernisation of the accounting system project in December 2002 (see COM(2002) 755 final of 17 December 2002). | 1.8.Furthermore, in 2004 the accounting system still followed, to a large extent, cash-based accounting principles and did not make it possible to distinguish between capital and non-capital expenditure, between final payments and pre-financing, or even to determine the amount of debts and receivables.
This affected the calculation of the economic outturn (see paragraphs 1.17 to 1.18 and also paragraphs 1.28 to 1.45). | 1.8.The differentiation between capital and non-capital expenditure is one of the improvements arising from the introduction of the new accounting system.
However, the efforts made by the Commission as part of the modernisation of the accounting system have already resulted in improvements in the quality of information provided. | | 1.10.Table 1.1 contains a follow-up of the reservation concerning the reliability of the accounts which was expressed in the Statement of Assurance for the 2003 financial year, as well as other points raised by the Court in that Annual Report which, according to the Commission, ought to be settled in the context of the modernisation of the Community accounting framework. | 1.10.As in last year’s replies, and as stated by the Court in its remark, the reservation of the Court in 2003 concerning revenues and advances is addressed by the introduction of the new accounting system in 2005.
The new system will also address the other points raised in table 1.1. | 1.11.Despite the progress noted, in particular as regards the presentation of the annual accounts and the reduction in the number and scale of the reservations, the Court’s audit identified problems, most of them already pointed out in previous reports (see paragraphs 1.12 to 1.20). | 1.11.As the Court has noted, progress has been made in the presentation of the annual accounts.
As part of the move to accrual-based accounting all open ECIP files are currently being revised | Considerable efforts have been made to record the financial intermediaries.
Some of the questions have been dealt with in the accounting rules. | Other weaknesses concerning the presentation of the accounts persist as regards certain items of agricultural expenditure and other advances not executed but shown as such, the presentation of approximate amounts having the characteristics of provisions, being shown like debts, and the accounting for pension rights, which neutralises the effect on the economic outturn. | Various points were dealt with within the framework of the transition to accrual accounting in 2005 and the Commission will only introduce changes for the 2005 accounts to avoid successive changes. | The application of the accounting rules adopted by the Accounting Officer on 28 December 2004 is supposed to settle most of the points raised.
According to the Commission, the current presentation of pensions in the balance sheet will, however, be maintained until an IPSAS standard has been issued on the subject. | There is still no indication in the year-end accounts that some transactions are likely to be corrected at a later date by the Commission's departments or by the Member States (see paragraph 1.12), nor any indication of the possible scale of such corrections.
Furthermore, there are other uncertainties which may temporarily affect the accounts (see paragraph 1.13). | The annual accounts necessarily present financial information as known at the time of their closure.
The accounts can only recognise the amounts to be recovered when the Commission adopts its decisions under clearance of accounts or similar procedures.
The Commission is preparing rules for the accounting treatment of such recoveries, and for improving the explanatory notes to the annual accounts, as part of the modernisation of the accounting system. | The situation remains unchanged for the 2004 accounts and is expected to be dealt with in the framework of the modernisation of the accounting system. | | Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget (revenue and expenditure) Provisional components of the implementation of the budget 1.12.
Despite the Court’s observation in its 2002 [7] and 2003 [8] Annual Reports, there continues to be no sufficient and precise indication in the explanatory notes to the year-end accounts that some transactions are likely to be corrected at a later date by the Commission’s departments or by the Member States (clearance of the EAGGF-Guarantee paying agencies’ accounts, adjustment of the provisional amounts in the case of the closure procedure for projects and programmes relating to Internal policies, External actions and Structural Funds).
An additional comment is included in the 2004 final accounts indicating that most of the payments made by the Commission during the year are provisional and subject to varying conditions.
Following the modernisation of the accounting system, the Commission has new accounting rules in place for accounting methods of recoveries of amounts paid out, and this also covers the explanatory notes to the annual accounts.
The effects of the new rules should be seen in the 2005 annual accounts.
Concerning agricultural spending, the annual accounts necessarily present financial information as known at the time of their closure.
The accounts can only recognise the definitive amounts to be recovered when the Commission adopts its final decisions under clearance of accounts or similar procedures.
The Commission will analyse the possibility of improving information on the financial impact of corrections made concerning prior years. | 1.13.
Furthermore, there are other uncertainties which may temporarily affect the accounts, for example, 20 paying agencies, managing 11000 million euro of agriculture funds, received a qualified or negative opinion on their accounts from the certifying bodies (see paragraph 4.19), and the Commission’s postponement of its financial clearance decision for the financial year 2004 of paying agency accounts representing 9 % of the expenditure declared for the financial year 2004, pending further information or the completion of certain audit work (see paragraph 4.20). 1.13.
As stated in point 4.19, qualifications and negative opinions are restricted in the great majority of cases to particular issues and measures, concerning specific aspects of the activities of the 20 paying agencies concerned.
The Commission has already initiated a procedure to recover any material undue payments. | Expenditure booked against non-corresponding budget headings 1.14.
On the basis of the budgetary principle of transparency it would be appropriate to clarify the situation in the financial statements [10]. 1.14.
As underlined by the Court, the management of these projects according to Cohesion Fund rules was provided for by the Accession Treaty. | 1.15.
According to this system (known as modulation), accounting entries have been made against a budget heading which will ultimately not be the one to which the concerned expenditure will be charged (165,2 million euro in 2004), and expenditure which has not yet been implemented (263 million euro at 31 December 2004) has been presented in the accounts as already having been effected (see paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14 of the 2002 and 1.10(a) of the 2003 Annual Report). 1.15.
With regard to the entry into the accounts of 165,2 million euro in 2004, the accounting methods applied to the amounts withheld under Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 and Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1655/2004 are established in accordance with Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1017/2001 (amending Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 296/96).
With regard to the expenditure not yet implemented by the Member States (263 million euro in 2004), Member States can withhold part of the direct aid for farmers, on the basis of modulation and eco-conditionality, to be used during a specific period for measures accompanying rural development (under Articles 3 to 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 and Articles 153(4) and 155 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003).
Reservations concerning the completeness and accuracy of the amounts due to the Commission in respect of the EAGGF-Guarantee debtors ledger (665,5 million euro net at 31 December 2004) have been expressed by several certifying bodies (see paragraph 1.25 of the 2002 and 1.10(d) of the 2003 Annual Report). 1.16.
Certifying bodies for 86 of the 91 paying agencies were able to provide assurance that debtors’ ledgers were stated fairly.
The recording of sundry debtors (4139,8 million euro at 31 December 2004) continues to pose problems [12].
In the absence of adequate internal control procedures for miscellaneous revenue in the authorising officers’ departments, the Court cannot obtain assurance that the record of amounts receivable is complete and accurate. 1.17.
As replied in previous years, the Commission accepts this remark of the Court, but states that the introduction of the new accounting system in 2005 addresses the problems raised. | 1.18.
Furthermore, in the absence of a suitable accounting system, the Court is unable to give assurance as to the accuracy and completeness of the amounts entered as held by financial intermediaries [13] totalling 1313,6 million euro [14] at 31 December 2004 (see paragraph 1.27 of the 2002 and 1.10(f) of the 2003 Annual Report). 1.18.
The new system introduced in 2005 and based on accrual-accounting rules, will allow the Commission to better control the amounts of pre-financing (such as for financial intermediaries). | 1.19.
In addition, the basis on which the Commission recorded a value reduction of 29,6 million euro on advances for ECIP [13] (European Community Investment Partners) (51,5 million euro at 31 December 2004) was doubtful, because the constituent parts to which it applies were not yet fully identified, as the review of the open files has not been finalised (see paragraph 1.18 of the 2002 and 1.10(b) of the 2003 Annual Report) 1.19.
The review of the open files continued in 2005.
The value of 51,5 million euro registered in the balance sheet at year-end 2004 corresponds to 41,2 million euro relating to pre-financing amounts (facility 2), and 10,3 million euro on accounts opened by the various financial institution partners of the ECIP programme.
The value reduction of 29,6 million euro applies only to the amount of the pre-financing.
As has been responded previously by the Commission, this accounting treatment for pensions is in accordance with the accounting rules adopted by the Accounting Officer of the Commission following discussion with the Accounting Standards Committee.
This action plan, which was intended to be fully operational as of 1 January 2005 [18], consists of two strands, one concerning the adoption of the new accounting framework [19], and the other, the development of the information systems required for its implementation [20].
A project oversight board and an advisory committee for accounting standards were set up in order to provide support to the Commission’s Accounting Officer, who is responsible for the implementation of the project. | | Audit scope and approach 1.22.
The new accounting system is operational and the preparation of the 2005 annual accounts (including opening balance sheet) continues to progress since the finalisation of the Court’s audit in May 2005. | 1.23.
In the first phase, which covers the transition process during 2004, the Court concentrated on the: - verification that the new accounting rules and accounting guidelines are compatible with the Financial Regulation and international standards (see paragraphs 1.24 to 1.27); - identification of the data not previously available, which needed to be put into the system (pre-financing and related guarantees, invoices/payment requests, legal entities), by carrying out a system evaluation and corroborative tests [21] (see paragraphs 1.28 to 1.37); - high level assessment by the Accounting Officer and his services of the state of readiness of the local financial management systems of certain Directorates-General and services providing data for the Commission’s accounts (local systems) for the introduction of accrual-based accounting (ABAC) (see paragraphs 1.38 to 1.42). | | New accounting framework 1.24.
With a view on its future work on the opening balance for the 2005 financial year, which by the end of the audit work (May 2005) was not yet completed, the Court limited its first analysis to four accounting rules considered as key for the transition, namely those dealing with financial statements, expenses and payables, pre-financing and provisions, contingent assets and liabilities.
It was found that these four rules comply in all material aspects with the Financial Regulation as well as with the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), as far as they are covered by them [26].
However, due to the complexity of the different areas covered, compliance is, to a certain extent, achieved by remaining rather general in both the basic rules and the more-detailed accounting manual, thereby leaving the interpretation of specific elements to the discretion of the different Directorates-General (see paragraph 1.32).
Furthermore, there is a need for clarification concerning guarantees and pre-financing (see paragraph 1.33). 1.26.
The Commission estimates the amount of the pre-financing to be entered into the accounts at approximately 64000 million euro.
The process of establishing opening balances is expected to be completed in good time.
The presentation of pre-financing in the financial statements will reflect the economic reality. | Guarantees 1.33.
Therefore it would be necessary to provide complementary information in the explanatory notes relating to contingent assets and liabilities. 1.33.
This amount will only be reduced if the Authorising Officer has accepted a reduction in the guarantee provided.
Both the value of the guarantee held and the current net amount guaranteed will be presented in the notes to the financial statements, using information coming from the accounting system. | Invoices/payment requests 1.34.
As for pre-financing (see paragraph 1.31), the amounts entered into the system for invoices/payment requests were still provisional by the end of the audit work for this Annual Report in May 2005. 1.34.
See reply to paragraph 1.31. | 1.35.
The Court’s audit revealed some risks related to the local systems.
Accordingly, these problems should not reoccur. | Validation of local systems 1.38.
The Accounting Officer has to verify and validate that local systems are capable of providing the central system with data which complies with the new accounting rules [28].
Once this procedure is finalised, the central system is no longer allowed to accept data provided by non-validated local systems. | | 1.39.
This validation is carried out in two phases.
Although initially foreseen for end-December 2004, 40 individual and a final Synthesis report were only available during February 2005. 1.39.
Draft reports on the validation of local systems for these 13 Directorates-General will be issued before the end of 2005. | 1.41.
The current validation procedure does not include a mechanism to inform the Accounting Officer about modifications to the local systems which would trigger a new validation according to Article 61 of the Financial Regulation. 1.41.
The Directorate-General for Budget will develop a procedure for the notification of changes to the local systems before the end of 2005, based on the experience gained throughout this validation exercise. | 1.42.
In the second validation phase (scheduled still to start in 2005), in-depth checks will be carried out to ensure a sufficient level of data quality and to corroborate the results of the first phase.
The requirements of Article 61 of the Financial Regulation will only be fulfilled when, still based on the results of these checks, the Accounting Officer concludes on the final validation of the local systems. 1.42.
This Progress Report has been sent firstly to the Accounting Officer and will be made available, in due course, to the Court of Auditors. | Assessment of progress made 1.43.
Against this background the Commission has achieved significant progress towards introducing accrual-based accounting. | | 1.44.
However, as already observed by the Court in previous Annual Reports [33], the timetable established for the necessary adaptations and validations is very ambitious.
The Commission is confident that the opening balances will be established in good time. | 1.45.
The Commission has, as it has done throughout this modernisation project, every intention in taking the actions necessary to ensure the completion of the work. | Legality and regularity of underlying transactions The Court’s DAS approach 1.46.
These specific assessments, which aim to give the discharge authority the possibility to monitor the quality of the management of the funds in each of the major fields of Community intervention [35], are based on four sources of evidence: (a) an examination of the way in which the supervisory and control systems set up both in the Community institutions and in the Member States and third countries work; (b) a testing of samples of transactions for each major area by carrying out checks down to final beneficiary level; (c) an analysis of the annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General and of the procedures applied in drawing them up; (d) where possible, an examination of the work of other auditors who are independent of Community management procedures. | | 1.47.
The objective of the audit of supervisory and control systems is to assess the extent to which they manage the risks concerning legality and regularity of underlying transactions.
In accordance with international audit standards, the Court also takes account of the "management representations" contained in the annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General, as well as in their Synthesis which is adopted by the Commission.
Finally, the work of other auditors [36] is reviewed in order to evaluate the potential relevance for the specific assessments. 1.47.
In areas where, according to the Court’s audit, supervisory and control systems are implemented that allow risk to be managed adequately, the Court’s substantive testing tends to identify only insignificant findings as regards legality and regularity of underlying transactions and the Court’s assessment of the declarations of Directors-General and authorising officers by delegation [37] confirmed that no or only minor reservations had to be presented (see paragraphs 3.52 to 3.55, 8.31 and 8.32, 8.36 and 8.37, 9.13 and 9.26 to 9.28). | | 1.49.
In areas where, according to the Court’s evaluation, supervisory and control systems exist but their effectiveness in managing the associated risk has to be improved, the Court’s substantive testing tends to identify material findings as regards legality and regularity of underlying transactions (see paragraphs 4.55 to 4.62, 5.47 to 5.50, 6.46, 7.39 and 7.40).
As stated in its replies to the paragraphs referred to by the Court, the Commission considers that the Directors-General had reasonable assurance that the supervisory and control systems in place are sufficient to manage the risk of error and irregularity in the underlying transactions.
The Commission works constantly to improve these systems, most recently through its analysis of gaps between its present systems and those recommended by the ECA in its Opinion No 2/2004, and in its regulatory proposals for the 2007 to 2013 financial perspectives. | Table 1.2 — Follow-up by the Court to the reservations expressed in 2003 and 2004 by the Directors-General by financial perspective Key Sector | Main reservations of Directors-General | 2003 | 2004 | | Impact of these main reservations on the Director-General's assurance in the Court's view | Evolution | Other weaknesses revealed by the Court's audit | 2003 | 2004 | | Content of declarations | Evolution | Relevance for the Court's audit conclusions | Evolution | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | Own Resources | Monitoring the application of preferential schemes | × | | | B | A | + | / | | | | A | A | = | A | A | + | Import of Basmati rice | × | | "Hilton" beef | × | × | Common Agricultural Policy | International Olive Oil Council | × | | | B | B | + | Insufficient account taken of the supervisory and control systems for 2003 transactions | × | | | C | B | + | C | C | + | IACS in Greece | × | × | Limited scope of the Commission's monitoring action and backlog of incomplete checks as regards regulation 4045/89 (see par. 4.58) | | × | Structural measures | EAGGF-Guidance: management and control systems in the Member States (2000/2006) | × | × | | C | B | + | Risks connected with the closure of the 1994-1999 programming period and/or significant weaknesses in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2064/97 (see par. 5.45) | × | × | | C | B | + | C | C | + | ESF: several management and control systems in the Member States (2000/2006) | × | × | | | | IFOP: management and control systems in the Member States (2000/2006) | × | × (Italy) | | | | ERDF: management and control systems (2000/2006) | × (Greece and Spain) | × (Greece) | | | | URBAN and INTERREG management and control systems (2000/2006) | × | | | | | Cohesion Funds: management and control systems (2000/2006) | × (Greece, Spain and Portugal) | × (Greece) | | | | Internal policies, including research | Preliminary testing within the framework of indirect centralised management (Article 35 MERF) | × | | | B | B | = | Risks related to the systematic exceeding of the payment period in the area of research | × | | | B | B | + | B | B | + | On-the-spot audits | × | × | Preliminary testing within the framework of indirect centralised management (Article 35 MERF) (see par. 6.39) | | × | Error frequency (eligibility) in the cost declarations for research contracts | × | × | Error frequency for public health area (see par. 6.39) | | × | Weaknesses in the European Fund for Refugee's management system in the United Kingdom and in Luxembourg | | × | | | | External actions | Partnership with a non-governmental organisation | × | | | B | A | + | Supervisory and control systems for the legality and regularity of underlying transactions at the level of implementing organisations need to be further improved to be fully operational (see par. 7.40) | × | × | | C | B | + | C | C | + | Non respect of contract procurement procedures by a Humanitarian Organisation | | × | | | | Pre-accession strategy | ISPA: management and control systems | × | × (Romania) | | C | B | + | Risk that some candidate countries cannot fulfil their obligations regarding co-financing | × | | | C | B | + | C | B | + | PHARE: Risks inherent in the decentralised systems, omissions in the audit of systems and transactions | × | × (Romania and Bulgaria) | | | | Administrative expenditure | Implementation of internal control standards in the EU's delegations | × | × | | A | A | = | / | | | | B | A | + | B | A | + | | | The Commission considers that no additional reserves should have been presented, as stated in the column "Other weaknesses revealed by the Court’s audit" of table 1.2.
Each case concerns issues which were known to the responsible service and, for which appropriate action had been taken to protect the EC budget, or which presented no significant financial risk (see replies to paragraphs 4.58, 5.45, 6.39 and 7.40).
The Commission would welcome guidance as to the further information sought by the Court in order to improve its assessment of the relevance of the declarations for the three budgetary areas agriculture, structural measures and external actions for 2004. | 1.50.
The Court has recognised in its annual reports, especially since the presentation of the White Paper on the Commission’s reform in April 2000 [42], that progress has been made in improving the design, implementation and functioning of supervisory and control systems, namely at Commission level (see paragraphs 1.71 to 1.83).
Moreover, at this point, the Commission is demonstrating its commitment by endeavouring to reinforce implementation of an integrated internal control system in line with the principles set out by the Court in Opinion No 2/2004 on the single audit. | Need to develop indicators for assessing progress 1.51.
This is of particular relevance if one takes into account all relevant developments in the audit environment (namely the enlargement, reforms of the policies, changes in the administrative structures). | | 1.52.
With a view to implementing the road map to an integrated control framework (COM(2005) 252/4 of 15 June 2005), an evaluation report on the differences between the internal control framework in the Commission departments and the control principles set out in the Court’s Opinion No 2/2004 relating to Community internal controls has been drawn up.
The Commission acknowledges that this process, which had already started in 2003, could be more formalised in its departments.
The effectiveness of internal controls relies largely on qualitative assessments using tools which cannot always be reduced to simple indicators. | 1.53.
The Court assessed the Commission’s internal control system in the different management areas (see Article 53 of the Financial Regulation), in view of the guarantees it provides as regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.
On the other, the Court examined the progress made as regards the implementation of the key elements of the Commission’s internal control (internal control standards and action plans annexed to 2003 annual activity reports and their Synthesis) and assessed the effectiveness of the procedures introduced and tools developed. | | The Commission’s management representations 2004 Synthesis report 1.55.
In its 2004 Synthesis of the annual activity reports [47], the Commission continued its efforts to improve the transparency concerning its obligation to render account of its management, and decided on the appropriate actions to respond to cross-cutting (horizontal) aspects [48]. | | 1.56.
The assessment of the Commission’s internal control system presented in the Synthesis is generally consistent with the analysis of the Court.
However, in certain cases the Court’s audit findings indicate that further measures are needed to reach the "globally satisfactory" situation presented in the 2004 Synthesis (modernisation of the accounting system, see paragraphs 1.21 to 1.45; indicators assessing progress, see paragraphs 1.51 to 1.53; annual activity reports and declarations of Director-General, see paragraphs 1.59 to 1.70; action plans, see paragraphs 1.72 to 1.74). 1.56.
In the 2004 Synthesis, the Commission noted that the authorising officers by delegation were able to provide the reasonable assurance required.
In the ongoing improvement process, the Commission had set itself a series of objectives relating to essential cross-cutting questions in connection with the quality of management.
The Court notes that the Commission’s strategy implies a qualitative change because further improvements are sought, not by launching a new reform but by fully developing the performance potential of the existing systems, concentrating on the following areas: (a) promoting accountability, by assurances from the Directors-General and accrual based accounts signed by the Accounting Officer; (b) enhancing effective performance management, by effective supervisory and control systems and solid daily management in which risk management is embedded; (c) reinforcing responsibility and monitoring capacity through an integrated internal control framework (see paragraphs 1.84 to 1.86). | | Annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General for the financial year 2004 Improved guidelines 1.59.
The Court noted an improvement in the quality of the guidelines, as compared to 2003, particularly for the following aspects having a link with legality and regularity: (a) inclusion of the monitoring of actions established within the framework of risk management and internal control assessment; (b) explanations, for policies in shared management, on the links between the systems for which the Commission is responsible and those for which Member States are in charge; (c) identification, for all management models except centralised management, if the weaknesses being the subject of a reservation are attributable to the Commission and/or to a third party; (d) conclusions on the combined impact of reservations on declarations. 1.60.
The Commission feels that the provisions in the circular relating to part 3 of the annual reports (management and internal control systems) also make a significant improvement by refocusing the analysis of the departments on the risks inherent in their management environment and the effectiveness of the internal control system instead of on the evaluation of its consistency with the minimum requirements of the internal control standards.
Despite the progress noted, there remains scope for improvement, in particular the presentation of indicators having a direct link to legality and regularity (see paragraphs 1.51 to 1.53). 1.61.
See also replies to paragraphs 1.52 and 1.53. | 1.62.
As regards the materiality of system weaknesses and their impact on the Directors-General's reasonable assurance, the 2004 circular refers to the basic principles already adopted in January 2003 [50].
However, no common materiality thresholds were yet established by budgetary area taking into consideration the nature of the operations concerned and the tolerable risk for the area in question [52].
As stated in the report on the evaluation of the differences between the control system in Commission departments and the control principles set out in Opinion No 2/2004 of the Court of Auditors, it is normal that the rates of error found fluctuate depending on the characteristics of the programmes and also over time.
For the 2005 annual activity reports, the Commission is going to explore the possibility of adopting a common method for determining the threshold of materiality of weaknesses (see 2004 Synthesis), including those of a systemic nature, with a view to making a more consistent evaluation of their impact on the reasonable assurance for the "families" of shared management, research and internal policies. | Declarations of Directors-General 1.64.
For example, certain Directorates-General did not clarify appropriately the selected criteria and/or quantify the financial impact in a satisfactory way [54]. 1.65.
The Commission notes that the Court itself recognises, in point 1.63, the progress made overall in the formulation of reservations to the declaration of assurance by the Directors-General, a difficult matter and a practice still rather new to the Commission.
These reports give complementary explanations. | 1.66.
All the Directors-General stated that they had obtained reasonable assurance that the resources allocated to them had been used for the specified purposes, and that the internal controls which they had introduced had ensured that the underlying transactions were legal and regular.
They all concluded that they could give their assurance. | 1.67.
The main reservations are shown in table 1.2.
Of the 32 reservations expressed in 2004, the majority (26) concern weaknesses already brought to light in 2003.
This confirms that most of the weaknesses identified can be eliminated only in the medium term (see paragraph 1.67 of the Court’s Annual Report concerning the financial year 2003).
The reduction in the number of reservations from 49 in 2003 to 32 [55] in 2004 is primarily due to the fact that the Directors-General improved the presentation of declarations by concentrating on weaknesses which represent important risks for the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. 1.67.
With regard to the impact and scope of the reservations (see table 1.2 and paragraph 1.49), the Commission notes the Court’s observations and will continue to provide more detailed information so that the Court can take them into account to greater advantage in order to support its declaration of assurance. | 1.68.
Due to the improved situation (see paragraphs 1.60 and 1.63), the combined impact of the reservations on the assurance given in the declarations was, in general, more clearly defined than in the 2003 financial year.
However, the extent of the reservations expressed by some Directorates-General is not always compatible or sufficiently justified in view of the assurance provided (see table 1.2 and paragraphs 4.27 to 4.32, 4.62 and 5.42). 1.68.
The Commission notes that all authorising officers by delegation were able to provide reasonable assurance. | 1.69.
The Court’s work shows that the supervisory and control systems in several areas of the financial perspectives, have still not reached a satisfactory level and that further efforts are required in order to strengthen them.
Therefore, some weaknesses singled out by the Court during its audits should have been included in the declarations of the Directors-General (see table 1.2 and paragraphs 4.58, 5.46, 6.39 and 7.37). 1.69.
See replies to paragraphs 1.49, 4.58, 5.45, 6.39 and 7.37.
The Directors-General’s assurance in a given year is not based solely on the audit work carried out in the course of the year concerned, but on the assurance built up over previous years’ audit work under the Directorates-General’s audit strategy, as well as the assurance provided from the audit work of Member States. | 1.70.
However, the Court considers that they can still only serve as a limited source for its assurance because of difficulties of a coherent application of some methodological principles. 1.70.
As stated in the Synthesis, the Commission is also continuing to reinforce consistency in the way its departments apply the guidelines it issues.
The road map for an integrated internal control system (COM(2005) 252/4 of 15 June 2005) and the related commitment by all the financial actors concerned will also contribute to providing the Court of Auditors with a sounder basis for its assessment. | Progress made in reinforcing the internal control system Overview on the state of internal control 1.71.
The Directorate-General for the Budget presented, for the second year, a report providing an overview of the state of internal control in the Commission’s Directorates-General and services in 2004 [56].
This report takes stock of the significant progress in implementing internal control since the establishment of the White Paper in March 2000.
Areas identified are reinforcing the monitoring of the effectiveness of internal control of Directorates-General, enhancing supervision procedures on financial management, strengthening of risk management, review and simplification of low value contracts and grants and the creation of an integrated internal control framework.
The Court considers that this overview on the internal control system of the Commission gives a balanced presentation of the progress achieved and areas in need for improvement. | | Action plans General situation as regards implementation 1.72.
The Court examined the progress of implementation of the measures foreseen in the consolidated action plan annexed to the 2003 Synthesis report, that have a direct link to legality and regularity [57], as well as the horizontal actions indicated in table 1.3 of its 2003 Annual Report which are not covered by the Synthesis [58]. | | 1.73.
The monitoring of the implementation of the horizontal action plans (as well as of the specific action plans and of the audit recommendations) has been satisfactorily integrated into the working environment of the Commission, in particular through the activity-based management of the Directorates-General (annual management plans and annual activity reports). | | 1.74.
Monitoring of measures which had not been completed was integrated into the series of objectives of a multi-annual nature set in the 2004 Synthesis affecting essential cross-cutting issues for the quality of management work. | Reinforcement of internal audit function 1.75.
Work on this action has been largely executed over a two year period.
The audit results presented in the different reports [61] (strengths and achievements, as well as areas in need for improvement) are balanced and confirm, on the whole, the Court’s audit findings. | | 1.76.
With a view to reinforcing the relations between the IAS and the Internal Audit Capabilities (IACs) set up in all Directorates-General, in February 2004 [62] the Commission obliged the IACs to systematically send their final reports to the IAS and requested that the latter reports twice a year on their key findings.
The Court considers that these steps should help to reinforce the internal audit function within the Commission. | | Table 1.3 — The Court's analysis of the main non-closed horizontal actions as at 31 December 2004 Domain | Action | Character of the measure | Source of the action plan | Diagnosis/Measures still to be undertaken | EXTERNAL ACTIONS | "Internal controls in delegations" | Internal controls | Synthesis 2002 (5.4.1) | Action finished/Implementation under way – improvements possible Additional efforts necessary in the next years to strengthen the compliance and effectiveness of internal control systems in delegations (see paragraph 7.41(c)). | "Evaluation of the devolution exercise" | Cross-cutting political issues | Synthesis 2001 (2) | Action in progress Follow-up required in the next years (see paragraphs 7.48 to 7.51). | SHARED MANAGEMENT (STRUCTURAL ACTIONS) | "Shared management" | Financial management | Synthesis 2002 (5.3.3A) | Action finished/Implementation under way – improvements possible Follow-up required in 2005 in order to better clarify the responsibilities of Members States and the Commission in the different management areas (see paragraph 5.7). | "Audit in shared management" | Audit | Synthesis 2002 (5.3.3B) | Action finished/Implementation under way – improvements possible Strengthening of the methodology and development of the concept of single audit foreseen for 2005 and 2006 (see paragraph 5.54). | INTERNAL POLICIES (RESEARCH) | "Co-financing" | Financial management | Synthesis 2002 (5.3.4) | Action finished/implementation under way – improvements possible The concept of forfaitisation for some categories of expenses to be introduced in the Financial Regulation (see paragraph 6.47). | HORIZONTAL ASPECTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL | "Annual activity reports methodology" | Annual activity reports methodology | Synthesis 2002 (4.4) | Action finished/Implementation under way – improvements possible Additional efforts necessary for the following issues: materiality (see paragraph 1.63), impact of reservations on the reasonable assurance (see paragraph 1.68) and indicators (see paragraph 1.61). | "Management risk assessment" | Activity based management/Strategic planning and programming | Synthesis 2002 (3.3.2) | Action in progress Additional efforts necessary in the next years (see paragraphs 1.78 and 1.79). | HORIZONTAL ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING AND IT SYSTEMS | "Interoperability" | Implementation of the reform | Synthesis 2001 (7) | Action finished/Implementation under way – improvements possible Additional efforts necessary (by newly created Directorate-General for Informatics) in the next years. | "Recovery" | Financial management | Synthesis 2002 (5.3.2A) | Action in progress Presentation of specific performance indicators regarding recovery not yet mandatory (see paragraph 1.61). | "Accounting framework" | Financial management | Synthesis 2002 (5.3.7) | Action in progress Additional efforts necessary (see paragraphs 1.21 to 1.45). | "Development of a database of legal entities and of contracts" | Chapter II "A culture based on service" and chapter V "Audit, financial management and control" | White paper (11 and 74) | Action in progress Additional efforts necessary (see paragraphs 1.21 to 1.45). | | 1.77.
The Commission is already taking action in this regard: a clarified information and reporting structure and a common reporting framework, established in Spring 2005, in particular covering the rating of audit observations and recommendations, are important steps in enhancing the effectiveness of the internal audit function for the Commission overall.
This has not only the objective of guaranteeing the availability of quality internal audit services for the Directorates-General but also to establish an objective basis for other auditors to rely on audit work done at other levels. | Risk assessment 1.78.
To that end, the Central Financial Service (CFS) of the Directorate-General for the Budget, initiated, in 2004, a pilot project in seven Directorates-General in order to test the preliminary version of the risk management framework and corresponding implementation manual, while preparing in parallel the activity planning process and setting their main objectives for 2005. | | 1.79.
Despite the generally positive result, further efforts are necessary to develop methodological elements and tools for risk analysis and management, which could form a solid structural framework to be applied effectively in all Commission services.
The Commission agrees that further efforts are necessary and that the Court observations fairly reflect the Commission’s action plan. | Internal control standards 1.80.
The Court analysed the application of internal control standards [64] by 14 of the Commission’s Directorates-General [65].
The aim was not only to assess the degree of implementation but also to evaluate their effective functioning as regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions (see paragraphs 1.58 and 1.71). | | 1.81.
The guidelines presented by the CFS on the definition of the internal control standards (baseline requirements) for the 2004 financial year did not introduce significant changes as compared to 2003 [66]. | | 1.82.
In their self-assessments, which are annexed to the "Overview on the state of internal control in the Commission DGs and services in 2004" (see paragraph 1.71), the Directorates-General declare for the 2004 financial year that they comply with 93 % of the baseline requirements defined by the CFS.
Given that the baseline requirements remained essentially unchanged, the Court notes a slight increase in the compliance with the internal control standards, as compared to 2003 (91 %) The analysis of the Court on the implementation of internal control standards is presented in table 1.4. | | Table 1.4 — The Court's analysis of the implementation of internal control standards (with a direct link to the legality and regularity of underlying transactions for the main Directorates-General) (situation at 31 December 2004) Assessment: A: Implementation of baseline requirements B: Partial implementation of baseline requirements Directorate-General or department | Execution of payment appropriations in 2004 (million euro) | Standard 11 "Risk analysis and management" | Standard 12 "Adequate management information" | Standard 14 "Reporting improprieties" | Standard 17 "Supervision" | Standard 18 "Recording exceptions" | Standard 20 "Recording and correction of internal control weaknesses" | Standard 21 "Audit reports" | Standard 22 "Internal audit capability" | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | Personnel and Administration | 178 | A | A | A | A | A | B | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Agriculture and Rural Development | 47345 | A | A | A | A | A | A | B | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | EuropeAid | 3683 | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Budget | 1420 | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Economic and Financial Affairs | 301 | B | B | B | B | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Humanitarian Aid | 497 | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Enlargement | 1948 | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | B | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities | 9208 | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Eurostat | 30 | B | B | B | A | A | A | B | B | B | B | B | B | A | A | A | B | Fisheries and Maritime Affairs | 784 | A | B | A | B | A | A | B | B | A | A | A | B | A | A | B | B | Information Society and Media | 1148 | B | A | B | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | B | A | A | A | A | A | Regional Policy | 21816 | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Research | 2448 | A | A | B | B | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | Health and Consumer Protection | 365 | B | A | B | A | A | A | A | A | B | B | A | A | A | A | A | B | | 1.83.
The innovative element introduced by the guidelines on the annual review of the internal control system for the financial year 2004 consists of the assessment, by the Directorates-General, of the effectiveness of the application of the internal control standards.
The Court’s review of the annual activity reports showed, however, that the evaluation is very general and does not make it possible to systematically identify the areas in need of improvement (see paragraph 1.58).
A lot of work has already been done in this area, in particular, with regard to the two key standards of supervision and risk management.
However, this is a continuing process and the Commission acknowledges that much remains to be achieved in connection with one of the important innovations of the circular on the 2004 AARs as stated in reply to paragraph 1.60. | Towards a Community internal control framework 1.84.
The Court proposed, in its Opinion No 2/2004, the implementation of a Community internal control framework that should integrate and strengthen the elements already existing, while at the same time adding new aspects in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness of controls (common principles to be applied at all levels of administration in the institutions and Member States, internal controls should provide reasonable (not absolute) assurance on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, costs of the controls should be in proportion to the benefits they bring in both monetary and political terms, systems should be based around a logical chain structure where controls are undertaken, recorded and reported to a common standard, allowing reliance to be placed on them by all participants). | | 1.85.
The Commission adopted as a strategic objective to ensure that the Court obtains reasonable assurance concerning the legality and regularity of underlying transactions [69].
Furthermore, the Commission adopted a "roadmap to an integrated internal control framework" [70] with a view to initiating a process leading to a common understanding by the end of 2005, to be formalised in an interinstitutional agreement between the Parliament, the Council and itself, on how the current internal control framework can be improved in order to provide the Court with the reasonable assurance it seeks. | | 1.86.
There are necessarily numerous conditions governing the eligibility of operations and expenditure, but the Commission provides guidance and has simplified the rules as far as possible. | [1] The "Consolidated reports on implementation of the budget and Consolidated financial statements" make up Volume I of the annual accounts of the European Communities, financial year 2004.

Most expenditure on structural operations and on internal and external policies takes the form of programmes managed over a number of years (e.g. 2000-2006 for the current Structural Fund programming period).
In these cases, legal obligations are not generally reflected as budgetary commitments in the year they are agreed, but as approximately equal yearly tranches over the life of the programmes. | | OBSERVATIONS More information in Commission report, but insufficient analysis 2.4.Detailed information on budgetary implementation for 2004 can be obtained from the Commission document entitled "Report on budgetary and financial management - Financial year 2004".
In its 2003 annual report, the Court recommended that more detailed information be given on the cumulative state of implementation of Community programmes.
In addition, the Commission provides a number of more specialised, detailed annual reports on several policy areas, notably the annual report on budgetary implementation of the Structural Funds. | A larger budget for a bigger Union 2.6.The 2004 budget was originally drawn up for an EU of 15 Member States.
Total appropriations for commitments fell by 0,3 % and total appropriations for payments increased by 2,3 % compared with the 2003 final budget.
Enlargement necessitated an amending budget from 1 May onwards.
The updated budget represented increases of 11,5 % and 7,8 % for commitments and payments respectively, compared with the 2003 final budget.
The increase in commitments is proportionally larger because they can cover expenditure for more than one year (see paragraph 2.3). | | 2.7.Commitment and payment appropriations were below their increased financial perspective ceilings by 4,3 billion euro and 11,8 billion euro respectively.
For commitments, the margin occurs mainly in agriculture (2,5 billion euro) and pre-accession strategy (1,7 billion euro) with the other headings being near or slightly over the limits. | | 2.8.Amending budgets voted during the year resulted in an overall 1,6 billion euro reduction in appropriations for commitments (due to less than foreseen expenditure on agriculture), and a 2,0 billion euro increase in appropriations for payments, mostly related to extra appropriations for structural operations (see paragraph 2.14). | | Payment spending rate increased to 95 % 2.9.Table 2.1 gives an overview of the budgetary outturn for the 2004 financial year for both payments and commitments.
In 2004 the proportion of final appropriations for commitments used (the implementation rate) was 98 %, marginally lower than 2003 (99 %).
In its 2002 and 2003 Annual Reports [18] the Court identified poor forecasting of structural operations expenditure by Member States as a significant reason for the Commission not being able to take timely action on management of the underspending and the resulting surplus.
Unlike in previous years, the Commission’s 2004 report on budgetary and financial management provides no information or analysis of Member States’ estimates. 2.12.
The Commission would like to emphasise that the annual payment budget is not directly based on the Member States’ forecasts, but on the Commission’s own assessment of the likely need for payment appropriations.
The Member States’ forecasts are potentially a useful input for this assessment, which is why the Commission is continuing to press for improvement. | 2.13.
A total amount of 2,8 billion euro is being carried over to 2005, comprising 1,5 billion euro in respect of the operational budget (1,2 billion euro in 2003), and 1,3 billion euro in respect of earmarked third party revenues (1,0 billion euro in 2003). | | Current expenditure programmes have reached the expected spending rate 2.14.
A large proportion of the budget — structural operations, some internal policies and external actions — consists of multiannual expenditure programmes running within defined cycles over a number of years (e.g. 2000-2006 in the case of the Structural Funds).
The Commission and the Member States encountered significant delays in setting up and starting operation of these programmes, particularly in respect of the Structural Funds.
The current level of spending involves only a limited reduction in the level of outstanding commitments.
The information provided in the Commission’s report on financial and budgetary management on the state of implementation of the Structural Funds (see paragraph 2.4) shows that the three policy objectives for the 2000-2006 period were implemented by around 40 % by the end of 2004. 2.15.
The Commission has experienced significant problems and delays in closing these programmes and in making final payments (see paragraphs 5.29 to 5.31).
At the end of 2004, 3,3 billion euro of budgetary commitments remain outstanding for the closure of these old programmes in 2005 and potentially beyond. 2.16.
Member States were obliged to submit payment claims for these programmes at the latest by 31 March 2003.
The 2,2 years referred to by the Court can be regarded as a normal ratio and close to the n + 2 principle. | 2.18.
Graph 2.1 shows the value of outstanding budgetary commitments on differentiated expenditure since 1994.
The increase is due to both the change in the system for annual commitments for the Structural Funds, introduced for the 2000-2006 programming period, and the cumulative effect of underspending between 1999 and 2003 which resulted in 40 billion euro of payment appropriations being cancelled [22]. | | Table 2.3 — Change in balance of outstanding budgetary commitments 2004 Source: 2004 annual accounts and report on budgetary and financial management.

In 2002 the Commission undertook an in-depth analysis of the progress of the budgetary execution of the Structural Funds taking into account, and adjusting for, the low rates of spending in 2000 to 2002, and forecasting the level of outstanding budgetary commitments at the end of each year up to 2010 [24]. | | 2.20.
The higher than forecast level of outstanding commitments for 1994 to 1999 is due to the delay in the closure of these programmes, which was difficult to predict at the time (see reply to point 2.16).
The difficulties in making these estimates were, to a large extent, due to the fundamental change of the payments system for the new 2000 to 2006 programmes, compared to the previous programmes. | Outstanding budgetary commitments do not represent total legal commitments 2.21.
The legal commitments made, but not yet transformed into budgetary commitments, are disclosed as off balance sheet items in the annual accounts [26]. | | 2.22.
At the end of 2004, outstanding budgetary commitments for the Structural Funds 2000-2006 programming period were 60 billion euro, representing 2,2 years’ expenditure at the 2004 spending rate.
As such, total outstanding legal commitments for the Structural Funds 2000-2006 programming period at the end of 2004 were 136 billion euro, which represents nearly five years’ payments at the 2004 spending rate.
However, in order to liquidate all the outstanding legal commitments from the 2000-2006 programming period by the end of the payment period (2010), the Commission will need to maintain a high spending rate and/or to undertake significant decommitments under the n + 2 rule (see paragraphs 2.24 to 2.26). 2.22.
It is normal that part of the balance for programmes for the current period will be paid in the years 2007 to 2010.
Due to the application of the n + 2 rule for the Structural Funds the Commission does not expect to face any significant accumulation of outstanding commitments at the end of the current period.
The closure of 2000 to 2006 programmes should not mean that the start-up of programmes in the next period will be delayed.
In 2004, the amount involved was higher at 219 million euro, representing just 0,3 % of the balance of outstanding budgetary commitments for the Structural Funds at the end of the year. 2.24.
The Commission maintains its view that the n + 2 rule will stabilise the level of outstanding commitments.
The payments on account made at the beginning of the programming period, representing 7 % of the total 2000 to 2006 envelope of each programme, provide a relatively long-term protection against n + 2 decommitments as advance payments reduce the level of reimbursements needed to avoid automatic decommitments.
This protection weakens over time though, which may lead to growing n + 2 de-commitments in the years ahead.
At the same time, the n + 2 rule provides an incentive for faster implementation and more regular submission of payment claims.
Of the commitments cancelled following this rule, 76 % related to ESF expenditure in the Netherlands.
In practice new commitments from the performance reserve [29] were in some cases allocated to the programmes from which commitments were cancelled, thereby negating the effect of the procedure [30].
The background to the situation described by the Court, regarding the additional commitment from the performance reserve to a programme from which funding had been decommitted under n + 2 is, that given the fact that appropriations cannot be shifted between objectives (amounts fixed at the Berlin European Council in 1999 and in the Structural Funds Regulation), competition for the Performance Reserve is limited to programmes of one Member State within one Objective.
As there is one Objective 3 SPD in the Netherlands, the Commission had no choice but to commit the reserve to this programme, but of course putting it into the better performing priorities.
Although the Commission considers the year n + 2 rule to be an important budgetary management tool, no analysis on its operation or effect is given in its report on budgetary and financial management. 2.26.
One purpose of the n + 2 rule is to spur execution, and so the effects of the rule can be partly gauged from the information on execution given in the budgetary and financial management report.
More detailed information as related to the Structural Funds is included in the aforementioned annual report on the Structural Funds, published in May 2005. | Inappropriate budgeting over life of spending programmes 2.27.
Payments are intended to be made during a period stretching beyond the nominal life of the programme (up to 2010 in the case of the 2000-2006 period).
Where two cycles overlap, the years of lower demand at the start of the second cycle are intended, by the Commission, to be compensated for by payments from the end of the first cycle, resulting in a smooth and consistent demand for payment appropriations. | | 2.29.
This difference in treatment results in growing levels of outstanding budgetary commitments (see paragraph 2.18) and the resulting time lag between commitments and payments. 2.29.
A growing stock of outstanding commitments is a normal feature of multi-annual programming such as that in the structural funds.
Information should also be provided on Member State spending estimates and the operation of the year n + 2 rule for the Structural Funds. 2.30.
The Commission also refers to its response in point 2.4. | 2.31.
The year n + 2 rule, which is intended to manage the situation for the Structural Funds, has resulted in very little decommitment since it was established. 2.32.
The level of decommittments is not in itself a proper indicator of the effectiveness of the n + 2 rule.
This rule also has an effect on promoting execution (see also reply to point 2.24). | 2.33.
Outstanding budgetary commitments for the Structural Funds are in excess of the Commission’s revised forecasts of 2002.
For the Structural Funds the budget for commitments is based on equal annual instalments, and that for payments is based on smooth and consistent supply-led assumptions for spending, but implemented following irregular demand-led claims from Member States.
As already recognised by the Commission, its ability to actively manage the implementation of the budget for multiannual spending programmes is limited [34]. 2.34.
The Commission also refers to its response in point 2.23. | [18] See paragraph 2.26 of the Court’s 2002 Annual Report, and paragraphs 2.31 and 2.47 of the Court’s 2003 Annual Report.

As shown in Table 3.1, Graph 3.1 and Graph 3.2 own resources are by far the main source of financing for budgetary expenditure (92 %).
There are three categories of own resources: traditional own resources (customs duties, agricultural duties, and sugar levies) (13 %), own resources calculated on the basis of value added tax collected by Member States (15 %), and own resources derived from the Member States’ gross national income (72 %). | | Source: Budgets and amending budgets for 2004; Annual Accounts of the European Communities, 2004.

Traditional own resources are established and recovered by Member States under national legal and regulatory provisions which must meet the requirements of the Community rules [2].
An overall report on the functioning of the inspections is drawn up every three years and presented to the budgetary authority [6]. | | 3.5.
The Commission will continue to focus on Member States’ management of the B accounts in its own inspections of traditional own resources. | Supervisory and control systems in Member States 3.6.
Community legislation does not generally prescribe either particular methods or the level of customs control, this being at the discretion of the Member States. | | Customs surveillance at the external land frontier of the EU 3.7.
The Court examined customs supervision and clearance at selected land frontier posts in eight Member States [8].
The audit concentrated on an evaluation of the customs surveillance and control procedures that are intended to ensure that all goods are subject to a customs treatment [9].
The Court carried out an examination of the electronic customs clearance systems in 12 Member States [12] and of the supervision and coordination done by the Commission.
The Commission has provided for such procedures in its legislation (Article 353 of Regulation (EC) No 837/2005) on the Community computerised transit system, NCTS.
As part of its regular follow-up of points raised by the ECA, the Commission will pursue the introduction of suitable controls with Member States. | 3.12.
In order to ensure efficiency and a similar level of control at all customs points, the Commission has proposed a number of tools [14], which include a common methodology and common criteria for risk management.
Risk analysis has a part to play, not only in the uniform collection of customs duties (and their prompt transfer to the Commission), but also in other tasks.
The Court has previously reported on the use of risk analysis techniques [15].
However, despite the Commission’s support and recommendations, differences still remain between the Member States in the degree to which they make systematic use of risk analysis and risk profiles in targeting controls, even though computerisation of customs processes has made this possible. 3.13.
In another two Member States risk profiles were used only on part of imports, leaving goods imported under certain simplified procedures without any profile-based targeting of control measures. 3.14.
The analysis of risk has a part to play in all types of customs controls, including the selection of importers for authorisation, to use simplified procedures, and the frequency and content of audit-based checks.
In one Member State fiscal risk profiles at borders have been reduced and substituted for by audit-based fiscal controls made at the economic operators’ premises.
Each Member State provides a quarterly statement of its B accounts to the Commission.
The net balance included in the Communities"balance sheet under" Amounts owed by Member States’ is 739,4 million euro (2003: 729,3 million euro). | | +++++ TIFF +++++ 3.20.
At 31 December 2004 the gross balance for the B accounts standing in the Commission’s books was 1905,0 million euro, 19,4 % less than the equivalent figure at 31 December 2003 (2364,3 million euro) [17].
The estimates of the unrecoverable proportion provided by the Member States vary from 10 % (12,8 million euro, in the case of the United Kingdom) to 96 % (118 million euro, in the case of Spain) [20]. 3.22.
The Commission explained to Member States the underlying principle they should use in preparing their estimates during the ACOR meeting on 9 December 2004.
In 2003 Germany removed entries totalling 40,1 million euro from its B account, without providing a full explanation of this reduction. 3.23.
In the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector the producers have financial responsibility for the losses incurred from disposing of the surplus production under quota [22].
The Member States retain 25 % of the levies as collection costs [23]. | | 3.25.
The Court followed up previous work on sugar levies and examined the calculation finalised in September 2004 (for the marketing year running from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003).
The Court found that the system for calculating sugar levies was operating in a generally satisfactory way despite ambiguities in the prescribed calculation method [24], which need to be resolved.
Specific aspects of the VAT/GNI own resources are the subject of separate audits. | | 3.28.
The Court’s separate audits concerning the VAT and GNI own resources covered Commission controls on Member States’ inventories for the European System of Accounts (ESA 95) [28], the calculation of the weighted average VAT rate (WAR) in the Member States’ VAT statements [29] and supervisory and control systems in relation to the compilation of National Accounts at Statistical Offices in Member States. | | Evaluation of supervisory and control systems Commission supervisory and control systems 3.29.
The Court examined the work of the units carrying out these inspections. | | VAT own resource 3.30.
In respect of the VAT own resources, the Commission’s on-the-spot inspections carried out during the financial year 2004 led to 28 new reservations [30]) in respect of specific elements of Member States’ VAT statements [31].
However, given the limited resources available, the Commission faces difficulties to maintain the same quality and frequency of inspection visits to Member States as before enlargement [32].
Furthermore, as far as the follow-up of the audit observations related to reservations is concerned little progress was made (only six reservations were lifted during the year) and thus 107 remained at the end of 2004.
These reservations often cover several financial years and four of them date back to VAT statements submitted more than 10 years ago.
This has already proved effective in the case of two Member States which met the Commission’s wishes while the infringement procedure was still at the preparatory stage.
Member States that apply differing VAT rates are required to calculate a weighted average rate (WAR) to be used in the calculation of the VAT own resource by the Commission.
The Court examined the Commission’s inspections of this aspect of the system, audited the calculation of the WAR in five Member States [33] and checked its compliance with Community legislative requirements [34]. | | 3.32.
In the case of Austria, significant progress has been made that will make it possible to lift the reservation, which was placed both by Austria and by the Commission, once the Commission has received the agreed amendments. | 3.33.
On the other hand, the Commission placed no reservation in cases of systematic shortcomings [36] in the WAR calculation. 3.33.
For these products the expenditure is known but there is no specific information available on the allocation to different VAT rates or to exemption.
However the Commission has started to set up a unit that will undertake verification of public and National Accounts produced by Member States. | | 3.36.
Since 2003, Community legislation provides for the transmission of an annual report on the quality of GNI data by Member States to the Commission.
Pursuant to Article 2(3) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1287/2003 the content and format of this report should follow the guidelines laid down by the Commission [38]. | | 3.37.
A review of the quality reports submitted in 2004 shows that: (a) some Member States have not followed the guidelines on content and format; (b) significant differences exist in the amount and detail of the information given; (c) no information is given on the results of investigations on the quality of GNI and its components, although such information is requested by the guidelines. 3.37.
Quality reports were submitted in 2004 for the first time and produced a significant improvement in the information supplied with the questionnaire compared with previous years.
The GNI Committee, at its July 2005 meeting, approved Eurostat proposals for extended guidelines that are intended to ensure a more harmonised result this year. | Commission controls on ESA 95 inventories 3.38.
An important part of Commission supervisory and control systems in respect of the GNI own resource concerned the ESA 95 inventories.
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of checks for ensuring that Member States comply with ESA 95 requirements, the Court assessed the way in which the Commission has carried out these checks on GNI inventories for ESA 95 for the 15 pre-enlargement Member States [39]. | | 3.40.
Through the development of the GNI Inventory Assessment Questionnaire (GIAQ) [40], the Commission has improved the control approach in setting up a systematic and structured tool for carrying out its checks.
This view is supported by the fact that many Members States publish their inventories or extracts thereof. | 3.42.
The Commission decided it would not be useful or cost-effective to lay down detailed information on all GIAQ items that did not lead to a question for the GNI visit, as the Commission would not have been able to complete the analysis of the Inventories within a reasonable time. | Illegal activities 3.43.
The Commission has requested that Member States should start with an estimation of certain categories of illegal activities [41]. | | 3.44.
From the Commission checks on the inventories for ESA 95 it appears that only a few Member States have included such estimates in GNI, moreover for different types of illegal activities.
Thus GNI estimates are not fully comparable which affects the GNI own resources calculation and do not fully comply with ESA 95 requirements. 3.44.
Member States have until 2006 to comply with ESA95 in this respect, before possible reservations are placed. | Intermediate consumption 3.45.
In two of the eight Member States [42] audited (Belgium and Ireland), there is no threshold in the business accounting rules and no adjustment is made for compliance with ESA 95.
The Court has examined in seven Member States [44] to what extent supervisory and control systems were set up and implemented at Statistical Offices in respect of the compilation of National Accounts. | | 3.48.
The Court notes that significant differences exist between Member States in the existence and implementation of the following elements of supervisory and control systems in respect of the National Accounts compilation process: (a) the performance of a formal and structured risk analysis in respect of the process of National Accounts compilation [45]; (b) the existence of agreements or equivalent arrangements between National Accounts departments and units providing basic statistical data, which set out the conditions for the delivery and the quality of data [46]; (c) the systematic production of "quality reports" accompanying statistical surveys [47]; (d) the documenting of supervisory controls performed by management on National Accounts compilation [45]; (e) the performance of internal audits on the process of statistical data collection and compilation [45]. 3.49.
The Commission will discuss with the Member States in the GNI Committee the extent to which the national supervisory and control systems should become part of the GNI verification process. | Annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General 3.50.
As in 2003, the annual activity report for DG Budget includes the number of VAT inspection visits in Member States but says nothing else about the verification of the VAT own resources data.
It mentions neither control activities related to the GNI own resource, the existence of 107 reservations in respect of Member States’ VAT statements or changes in the number of reservations during the year. 3.50.
Eurostat agrees to provide more information on verifying GNI and VAT in its Annual Activity Report. | Conclusions and recommendations 3.52.
As the Court remarks in paragraph 3.21 of the report, the regulation governing the B accounts was amended at the end of 2004.
However, the Court’s audit work on the GNI own resource has identified weaknesses that could impact on the quality of the data on the basis of which Member States’ GNI contributions are established.
The Court recommends the Commission: 3.54.
The recently adopted Recommendation on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities (COM(2005) 217), which includes a European Statistics Code of Practice, should in any event help to strengthen the quality of macroeconomic statistics, including GNI. | (a) to perform (direct) verification checks on selected National Accounts aggregates (see paragraph 3.35); (a) The Commission is currently examining ways in which more direct verification, in the sense indicated by the Court, might be carried out. | (b) to expand its checks on Member States’ inventories of sources and methods applied in the compilation of National Accounts and to improve its system for documenting checks (see paragraphs 3.41-3.42); (b) The Commission will endeavour to improve documentation within the limits of its resource constraints. | (c) to pursue that all Member States comply with ESA 95 requirements in respect of illegal activities in GNI (see paragraphs 3.43-3.44); (c) The Commission is already pursuing this actively. | (d) to review in consultation with the Member States how best practices for supervision and controls in respect of the National Accounts compilation can be implemented (see paragraphs 3.47-3.49); (d) The Commission encourages best practices in national accounts compilation through the GNI Committee.
The control cycle of two to three years between visits leads to a time-lag in the beneficial effect of this policy. | (b) recommends that the Commission should increase its efforts to reduce the number of long-standing reservations (see paragraphs 3.30 and 3.32); (b) The reduction in the number of longstanding reservations depends mainly on the capacity of the Member States’ administrations to meet an adequate quality standard.
It examines questions concerning the implementation of the own resources system, as well as the estimates of own resources.

Graphs 4.1 and 4.2 show how the money was spent.
These payments are primarily intended to compensate farmers for reductions that have been made in CAP prices. | | 4.3.Virtually all CAP expenditure is effected by the paying agencies of the Member States.
Observations on the reliability of the accounts are set out in Chapter 1, paragraphs 1.12, 1.13, 1.15 and 1.16. | | Supervisory and control systems IACS 4.6.The Integrated Administrative and Control System (IACS) is the key management and control tool for area aid and animal premium schemes and covers 59 % of agricultural expenditure.
Claims for a number of other Community aid schemes must be compatible with the system. | | 4.7.In 2004, the Court continued its examination of the way IACS is functioning in a further five paying agencies in four Member States as well as following up earlier findings in Portugal after the merger of two paying agencies.
IACS checks in the five paying agencies visited other than in Greece are generally operational and satisfactory (see Annex 2); IACS functioning is comparable to that of the paying agencies audited in previous years, although there is still scope for improvement in risk analyses, administrative checks and on the spot inspections. | 4.7.Although the Commission considers some of the Court’s assessments in Annex 2 to be too severe, its audit results generally concur with the Court’s own findings, and further enhancements are being achieved as from 2005 with implementation of the Geographical Information Systems obligatory as from 1st January.Regulation (EC) No 118/2004, amending IACS legislation as from 2004, will still further improve the already generally satisfactory situation. | 4.8.More than seven years after the deadline for full implementation IACS in Greece can still not ensure compliance with legality and regularity for area aid and animal premium payments (see also paragraphs 4.28(b) on the Commission’s reservation in respect of the implementation of IACS in Greece and 4.44 on the results of the Court’s transaction testing).
None of the data in the system is secure and it can be and is modified by the farmers’ unions at any time before payment.
For 2004 expenditure, farmers’ unions changed data for more than 22000 parcels more than five months after the claim period ended.
Analysis shows that these irregular changes have an estimated financial impact of at least 10 million euro, and the impact over the whole claim period could be significantly more;(b)the quality of on-the-spot inspections is low.
Some reports do not seem to be based on genuine inspections. | 4.8.Facing the IACS situation in Greece, the Commission has regularly applied important financial corrections (384 million euro from 1999 to 2004).
These actions on the part of the Commission and the setting up of a new paying agency in Greece (Opekepe) have led to good progress, so that by the end of 2004 (2005 financial year) the different elements of the IACS system were in place.
However the Commission will continue to identify and assess the remaining deficiencies in the functioning of the IACS in Greece, and to apply appropriate financial corrections.As regards the weaknesses mentioned by the Court, the Commission has repeatedly criticised the role of the farmer’s unions in the claim procedure and the weakness of supervision.
This subject, as well as the insufficient quality of the on-the-spot inspections, already identified by the Commission, will be pursued through the ongoing clearance of accounts enquiries. | Post-payment checks under Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 — Backlogs and insufficient information on results of checks performed 4.9.Member States are required to carry out annual programmes of post-payment checks of commercial documentation for a range of CAP subsidies, including export refunds, processing and transformation subsidies, processing of cotton, olive oil and tobacco and some rural development expenditure, in total some 37 % of agricultural expenditure.
The Court examined the Commission's monitoring of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 checks and found that: | 4.10. | (a)the analysis of the reports provided by Member States is of limited value as the existing regulation does not require coordination bodies to present statistics in a format which permits meaningful analysis (for example, reporting the rates of error for different categories of expenditure); | (a)The Commission considers the reports provided by Member States to provide valuable information, although it accepts that reporting in respect of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 could be improved.
Moreover, new ways of identification and reporting of the backlog are envisaged so that scrutinies not completed during the reporting period can be followed up in the reports in respect of subsequent reporting periods. | (b)in 2003, the Court examined the application of post-payment checks in 11 Member States and concluded that fewer than one in three were wholly satisfactory.
In response, the Commission has visited three Member States in 2004, the first visits since January 2001 dedicated to the full examination of the post-payment checks.
However, the number of scrutinies planned by most Member States exceeds significantly the minimum number required.
On this basis the shortfall is less than 40 %.While some scrutinies are not completed at the end of the scrutiny period, they must be followed up and be completed in the following scrutiny period.
The Commission is investigating the reasons for the failure to complete in due time control programmes in certain Member States and, where appropriate, will request clarification from Member States. | Graph 4.3 shows the number of checks carried out and the number of irregularities discovered for the last six reporting periods as presented by Member States.
In 2004, refunds accounted for some 3,6 billion euro, 7,5 % of CAP expenditure (8,3 % in 2003).
Member States are required to physically check 5 % of exports to ensure that they are correctly described and entitled to the export refund claimed.
The Commission's main preliminary findings indicate weaknesses relating to:(a)quality and/or frequency;(b)procedures for selection of consignments;(c)prior notification;(d)statistics.These weaknesses of variable importance were not found in all Member States visited. | 4.12.As the Court states, the remarks are of preliminary nature and the Commission can only finalise its position once the Member States have exercised their right of reply. | 4.13.The Commission was unable to provide information on the value of transactions physically checked and the value of irregularities detected.
During 2004, the Commission adopted a regulation requiring Member States to report this information with effect from the 2005 report.
Table 4.1 summarises the numbers of declarations checked and of irregularities detected for the period 2001 to 2003. | 4.13.Following the Court’s recommendation, made for the first time in its 2002 Annual Report, the Commission responded in timely fashion by adopting Regulation (EC) No 1454/2004, which stipulates that, as from 2005 the value of transactions checked, as well as irregularities exceeding the amount of 200 euro, have to be communicated by Member States.Until 2005, the information on the value of irregularities depended on the reliability of the communication of irregularities referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 595/91 delivered by the Member States to OLAF and did not comprise irregularities below 4000 euro. | 4.14.The Commission’s Annual Activity Report 2004 contains information on the number of export declarations lodged, the number checked by the Member States and the number of irregularities found.

A certifying body must be operationally independent of the paying agency [15].
The Commission took its Financial Decision on 13 May 2005 [16].
The Commission has already initiated a procedure to recover any material undue payments (see also paragraph 4.20). | 4.20.
The Commission approved the accounts of 86 of the 91 paying agencies, and postponed its clearance of the accounts of five paying agencies (representing 4 billion euro, 9 % of the total expenditure declared) because of imprecise or insufficient work by the certifying bodies concerned [17].
It intends to make financial corrections, totalling some 7 million euro, in respect of 14 paying agencies [18]. | | Paying agency accounts not approved (disjoined) in previous years 4.21.
In 2004, the Commission completed work on the accounts it had not cleared in the financial decision of 2001 and 2002, in most cases because of inadequacies in the work performed by certifying bodies or because of the need to clarify some information.
Where those audits do not reveal any deficiencies or lead to subsequent improvements of the systems, they are also relevant for the legality and regularity of related expenditure in subsequent years.
Table 4.3 shows the results of the Commission’s clearance decisions in respect of 1991 and subsequent years.
The situation in June 2005 is that 94,3 % of the audits carried out in 2001 (which allow financial corrections back to 1999) and 78,7 % of the audits carried out in 2002 (which allow financial corrections back to 2000) have been closed. | 4.25.
Graphs 4.4 and 4.5 set out the distribution of corrections in decisions taken by the Commission during the period 1999 to 2004 [22], by Member State and market sector.

Such tests provide good evidence of whether expenditure on area aid is legal and regular (see paragraphs 4.35 to 4.38) and, to a lesser extent, animal premiums (see paragraphs 4.39 to 4.42) where physical evidence is usually available to the auditor.
By contrast, in areas such as export refunds (see paragraphs 4.49 and 4.50) or aids paid on the basis of the quantity produced (see paragraph 4.43), the auditor can only check documents.
The extent to which such documents provide reliable evidence is influenced by both the nature of the transaction (see paragraph 4.48) and the control system concerned (see paragraph 4.54). | | Annual Activity Report of the Director-General for Agriculture for the year 2004 Some improvement from last year 4.27.
The report states that: (a) Directorate-General for Agriculture (DG AGRI) is in overall compliance with the internal control standards although further work is required in some areas [23]; (b) IACS provides, except in Greece, an excellent means of ensuring the proper use of Community funds; (c) post-payment checks provide reasonable assurance that the expenditure concerned complies with Community legislation; (d) the certification procedure provides assurance about the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the accounts of the paying agencies and a certain degree of assurance about the functioning of their internal control systems and their ability to ensure that payments are legal and regular; (e) for the 2004 expenditure, the audit work on control systems will be concluded, and final financial corrections decided, at the earliest, in 2006; (f) there is a risk that ineligible expenditure has been financed, but this expenditure may be audited in subsequent years under the conformity procedures and may be subject to financial corrections [24]; (g) the financial corrections under the clearance procedure along with the recoveries in Member States cover the "global financial risk". | | 4.29.
The sources of information on which the Director-General bases his declaration provide limited coverage of, and assurance on, the legality and regularity of 2004 expenditure.
In order to obtain reliable information on the legality and regularity of payments to final beneficiaries, the Director-General would need: (a) either to make arrangements for certifying bodies to extend their work to final beneficiaries, through extending their sample tests to the level of farmers or by doing more work to verify and validate IACS inspections statistics and post-payment checks [25]; or (b) to require his own staff, on the basis of an appropriate sampling method, to verify the legality and regularity of transactions for the year at the level of final beneficiaries. 4.29 and 4.30.
The Commission takes the view that the Director-General already has sufficient information to have reasonable assurance of the legality and regularity of agricultural expenditure.
As already indicated in response to the Court’s annual report 2003 the set-up and accreditation of the Member States' paying agencies, the annual certification procedure and the application of the various management and control systems, including IACS, permit a great deal of reliance to be placed on the control over expenditure declared.
The Director-General’s declaration and the accompanying AAR need to be placed in the broader regulatory framework for the clearance of the EAGGF accounts set out in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999.
Where Commission audits subsequently identify deficiencies, the risk of ineligible expenditure will be determined and appropriate financial corrections applied.
The Commission considers the total financial corrections in respect of a given year, together with the sanctions imposed on final beneficiaries at national level, to give a valuable estimation of the overall level of irregular payments. | Internal Control Standards — Some standards are not fully implemented 4.33.
One of the innovations introduced in the framework of the reform of financial management in the Commission services was the requirement to meet 24 Internal Control Standards which were made more concrete in the form of 71 baseline requirements.
DG AGRI’s 2004 self-assessment concluded that all standard and baseline requirements had been met (see paragraph 4.28(a)). | | 4.34.
DG AGRI’s Internal Audit Capability (see Chapter 1, paragraph 1.81) reports issued during 2004 confirmed this. 4.34.
The Commission must emphasise that DG AGRI by the end of 2004 was in compliance with all the baseline requirements laid down by the Commission for the 24 ICS.
This does not exclude that improvements in some areas are still possible and desirable, which DG AGRI also indicated in its assessment of the situation at the end of 2004. | The Court’s assessment of areas of CAP spending Area aid schemes 4.35.
Spending on arable crop subsidies paid on an area basis amounted to 17475 million euro in 2004, 39 % of CAP expenditure.
Member States reported to the Commission that they checked 8,1 % of claims on the spot, representing 11,4 % of the total area claimed.
For the 14 Member States that have implemented IACS satisfactorily, their random checks showed an error rate of 1,6 %.
It is correct to say that in some Member States random checks appear to be more effective.
Because of the quality of the IACS system, including 100 % administrative checks, the frequency of anomalies detected on the spot is low, so that the difference in results achieved between random and risk-based inspections is marginal, and possibly explained by the difference in sample sizes.
NB 2: Test performed in year N are relevant to payments made in year N + 1.

As in previous years, errors of this nature and scale, while frequent, have no marked impact on overall expenditure; (c) a small number of cases were affected by larger errors, but the number and impact of such cases was however lower than in previous years. 4.38.
The Court’s remarks broadly correspond to the Commission’s own findings of a generally satisfactory situation in the great majority of Member States. | Animal premium schemes 4.39.
Spending on animal premiums amounted to 9019 million euro in 2004, 20 % of CAP expenditure.
For the sheep and goat premiums the percentage of missing animals increased from 7,2 % in 2002 to 8,2 % in 2003.
Italy and Greece report significantly higher levels of error for sheep and goat premiums than the other Member States; the rate of error for the remaining 13 Member States in 2003 was 1,8 % (2,2 % in 2002). 4.40.
The figures reported show an improvement in terms of detecting animals miss- or over-declared by farmers.
The situations described for Greece and Italy are also the result of improved checking procedures following actions encouraged under the clearance of account procedure. | 4.41.
Overall, the rate of error found by IACS inspections of cattle in 2003 shows small variations from Member State to Member State, except for Italy where the percentage of ineligible cattle is still very high (10,2 % of animals claimed for the suckler cow premium and 22,3 % of animals claimed for the special beef premium). 4.41.

The EU subsidises olive oil, cotton and tobacco production (4132 million euro, 9,2 % of CAP expenditure in 2004) on the basis of the quantity produced, rather than the area used to grow the crop.
These cases are closely followed up by the Commission. | 4.45.
The findings of the olive oil control agencies in the four Member States concerned are set out in Tables 4.6 and 4.7.
However these proposals are often not implemented by authorities in the Member States (see Annual Report 2003, paragraph 4.39). 4.45.
This includes not only the quality of the control itself, but also the quality of the follow-up of the control agencies' proposals.
Schemes of this kind frequently have relatively complex eligibility conditions which are difficult and costly to check and which therefore present a high risk of irregularity. | | 4.47.
In two cases the Commission has already started the follow-up of the weaknesses identified (Greece and Luxembourg). | | 4.48.
The Court’s Special report on agri-environment measures (see paragraphs 4.98 and 4.99), the largest type of expenditure in the rural development area, concludes that the verification of such expenditure poses particular problems and that verification can rarely lead to reasonable assurance of the legality and regularity of expenditure at a reasonable cost. 4.48.
See also reply to paragraphs 4.98 and 4.99. | Other expenditure 4.49.
Expenditure not discussed in paragraphs 4.35 to 4.48 amounts to 8674 million euro.
The Court examined how the Commission has monitored the application of two regulations relevant to expenditure not covered by IACS and predominantly classified here as other expenditure. | | 4.51.
Taking these factors into account, the Court considers that the Commission did not have a sufficient basis to take assurance from the work performed (see paragraph 4.10). 4.51.
Considering - that post-payment checks provide an additional supplementary level of controls to the pre-payment checks (which for the majority of measures provide already reasonable assurance), and - that the major part of the required minimum number of post-payment checks had been performed by the end of 2004, and - that the Member States have communicated in their annual reports the number, value and nature of irregularities identified and the value of transactions tested, the Commission had sufficient basis to take part of its assurance from the work performed (see also reply to paragraph 4.52).
Physical and documentary checks on goods under Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 at the time of export should cover at least 5 % of most subsidised exports.
Regarding physical checks, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to publish specific findings before they have been dealt with in the clearance of accounts procedure.
Therefore irregularities for export refunds are more likely to exceed the 4000 euro threshold for being reported under Regulation (EEC) No 595/91. | 4.54.
The Court found weaknesses in subsidies for dried grapes (Greece, also reported on in both 2002 and 2003 Annual Reports) and nuts (Spain). 4.54.
The Commission concludes from this observation together with the points made under paragraphs 4.38 and 4.42 that for the agricultural expenditure managed and controlled by the IACS the situation is satisfactory, the risks identified by the Court being concentrated on the other CAP measures (see paragraph 4.57).
Even though the elements that constitute IACS are formally in place in Greece, there are serious deficiencies in the functioning of the system with the result that the system is not reliable (1000 million euro). 4.56.
Important weaknesses in the application of the system still exist in Greece, and these are followed up in the framework of the action plan consisting of an enhanced clearance of accounts audit programme for Greece, see also the reply to paragraph 4.8. | 4.57.
In view of the limited scope of the Commission’s monitoring action (involving visits to only 3 Member States to check full implementation in 2004) and of the backlog of incomplete checks, and given that weaknesses were already reported in the Court’s 2003 Annual Report [40], the Court cannot agree with the basis of the Commission’s statement in the Annual Activity Report 2004 that "Based on the information received and based on on-the-spot missions undertaken annually in order to evaluate the application of the Regulation it can be concluded that the controls pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 provide reasonable assurance as to the compliance with Community legislation of the expenditure in the sectors covered by the Regulation". 4.58.
As outlined in paragraph 4.10, the Commission is of the view that it has fulfilled all of its obligations as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89.
In addition to the three missions mentioned by the Court, another six are scheduled in 2005.
Furthermore, regular missions covering specific aspects of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 regarding export refunds have been taking place since 2001.
Considering the above reasons as well as the following: - that post-payment checks provide an additional supplementary level of controls to the pre-payment checks (which for the majority of measures provide already relatively complete assurance), and - that the major part of the required minimum number of post-payment checks had been performed by the end of 2004, and - that the Member States have communicated in their annual reports the number, value and nature of irregularities identified and the value of transactions tested, the Commission is of the view that Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 checks contribute to the overall assurance on the legality and regularity of the 2004 expenditure. | Clearance of accounts 4.59.
The reports of the certifying bodies provide assurance that financial information provided by the paying agencies (and incorporated in the Commission’s accounts) is materially accurate [41].
As already indicated in the response to the Court’s annual report for 2003, the set-up and accreditation of the Member States' paying agencies, the annual certification procedure and the application of the various management and control systems, including IACS, permit a great deal of reliance to be placed on the control over expenditure declared.
Commission’s conformity decisions, whereby it can exclude expenditure from Community financing, were not complete for any year later than 1998 (see paragraph 4.24). 4.61.
As indicated in the response to paragraph 4.24, the situation in June 2005 was that 94,3 % of the audits carried out in 2001 (which allow financial corrections back to 1999) and 78,7 % of the audits carried out in 2002 (which allow financial corrections back to 2000) have been closed. | Annual activity report of the Director-General for Agriculture 4.62.
The report does not assert that irregular payments are recovered through the clearance of accounts procedure and through the recovery procedures in the member states. 4.62.
The Annual Activity Report and the annual declaration of DG AGRI are based on the assurance which can be gained from the systems in place and their functioning.
This is inherent to the system of shared management, in conformity with EU legislation, and should not be seen as a limiting factor for the Director-General for providing the annual declaration.
The assurance will be further consolidated with the annual statements of paying agencies provided in the new CAP Financial Regulation as well as by other measures proposed by the Commission in its communication COM(2005) 252 final on a road map to an integrated internal control framework. | Recommendations 4.63.
It should assess the quality of checks performed, and if appropriate, programme further visits to Member States (see paragraph 4.10(b)) and take appropriate measures to ensure the completion of planned programmes (see paragraph 4.10(c)); (b) First, the Commission accepts that reporting in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 could be improved and will introduce a proposal to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 4/2004 to this effect.
The Commission is, in this respect, also investigating the reasons for the failure to complete in due time control programmes in certain Member States and, where appropriate, will request clarification from Member States. | (c) ensure that control and supervisory systems provide assurance on the legality and regularity of the transactions at the level of the final beneficiary; (c) The Commission is of the opinion that the existing management and control systems, if properly placed in the context of a multi-annual process, already provide reasonable assurance on the legality and regularity of the transactions at the level of the final beneficiary.
The Commission follows up on the national recovery procedures on the basis of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999. | (e) distinguish in the declaration of assurance of the Director-General, on the one hand, expenditure which has been verified (and has been subject of corrections where necessary) for which the Director-General can give reasonable (or no) assurance and, on the other hand, expenditure which is the subject of further verification (and possible correction); (e) The Commission considers that it would not be appropriate in the AAR to distinguish, as the Court suggests, between expenditure which has already been verified and expenditure which will be subject to further verification.
However, it should be noted that with decreasing levels of irregularity, and effective 100 % administrative checks, the difference in results achieved between random and risk-based on-the-spot checks is expected to be marginal. | NEW MEMBER STATES: TRANSITION Accreditation of the EAGGF paying agencies in the new Member States 4.64.
Of the 11 paying agencies, seven have been granted accreditation [43], but two of them were accredited for a limited period of time [44] and four have provisional status. | | 4.67.
Meetings between the Commission services and each of the new Member States were held.
As can be seen from Table 4.8, accreditation reports indicate that five paying agencies have attained a satisfactory level of compliance.
The Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (SAPARD) [48] aims to help the 10 beneficiary countries of central and eastern Europe [49] to deal with the problems of the structural adjustment in their agricultural sectors and rural areas and to contribute to the implementation of the common agricultural policy and related policies (see chapter 8). | | 4.70.
The Commission is aware of the potential risk, and will take it into account in its audits, but has so far found no evidence of a financial risk arising. | 4.71.
On 28 September 2004 the Commission cleared the 2003 SAPARD accounts for seven countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia) but postponed its decision on the accounts for Poland, Bulgaria and Romania.
Once this assessment is finalised, and considered satisfactory, the Commission shall proceed with the clearance of those Sapard accounts. | 4.72.
The Commission is paying increased attention to the respect of deadlines. | 4.73.
The Court visited two SAPARD Countries, Hungary and Slovenia, to check a sample of payments for 20 projects and to review the procedure, descriptions and checklists used by the SAPARD paying agencies.
The review of payments, covering the main measures implemented at the time of the audit, revealed the following weaknesses and errors although with minor financial impact some of which are similar to those found for other SAPARD Countries [52]: (a) some major business plan figures were not evidenced with supporting documentation; (b) in the project file the evidence of the checks on the total eligible cost was inadequate; (c) the work actually carried out by the authorities during the on-the-spot visits was not clearly evidenced or was not appropriate leading in one case to a payment for an investment only partially completed; (d) errors of non-compliance with the three price offer procedure [53] [54]. | | 4.75.
On the basis of the audit work performed and excepted the findings in paragraphs 4.73 to 4.75), the Court reiterates the opinion [55] that the SAPARD supervisory and control systems generally worked in practice. | | FOLLOW-UP TO PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS CMO in the Banana sector 4.77.
As it has already pointed out in its reply to the special 2002 Court report, it feels that the CMO objectives in the banana sector correspond to those laid down for the common agricultural policy in Article 33 of the Treaty and that the detailed description and quantification of the CMO objectives are comparable to those of other CMOs.
A more thorough and, where necessary, a review of the CMO objectives will be based on the results of the impact analysis evaluation which the Commission is going to undertake in the second half of 2005. | 4.78.
The Court recommended that the Commission should carry out the in-depth evaluation of the CMO, and a full analysis of the risks, costs and benefits associated with various possible options in view of the transition to tariff-only system foreseen on 1 January 2006.
The delay in the evaluation has deprived the Commission of important management information allowing it to make an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of the compensatory aid, prevented it from evaluating the extent of the contribution of the Structural Funds measures to the CMO, and hindered an impact analysis of the aid measures for ACP producers. 4.78 and 4.79.
The evaluation report as well as the report of the Court of Auditors will be the basis for the planned impact study.
In view of these details and the public debate which it intends to open, the Commission plans to present its proposals for reform to Parliament and to the Council in 2006. | 4.80.
The Commission reported to the budgetary authorities in February 2005 [59], as required by Article 32 of the framework Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 [60].
Article 32 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, requires the Commission to present a report on the operation of the CMO to the European Parliament and the Council no later than 31 December 2004.
In view of the transition to a tariff-only system in the EU’s banana imports foreseen to take place no later that 1 January 2006 [61], the Commission agreed to the Court’s recommendation that a thorough analysis of the impact of the transition on all the parties involved would be made at the time of the abovementioned review exercise.
The arbitration process is ongoing. | | 4.82.
The banana aid scheme for Community producers grants one of the highest levels of support per hectare (in average over 8800 euro/ha [62]).
However, in the follow-up assessment of its 2001 Action Plan [63], the Commission found that import control problems still prevailed and instructed the Member States to solve them.
After discussions with the various Commission services involved, taking input from the Customs Code Committee meeting of 13 July 2005 and the views of banana traders, the Commission is preparing a proposal for adoption before autumn 2005. | 4.84.
Like the Court, the Commission considers it advisable to complete the CMO evaluation with an impact analysis which is to be launched in the second half of 2005. | Pre-financing of export refunds 4.85.
Subsidies for the export of certain agricultural products (export refunds) are paid to exporters up to four months in advance of the date of export (pre-financed).
The products concerned have to be placed under customs control and a complex system of checks put in place to ensure that goods for which refunds have already been paid are physically exported. | | 4.86.
Subsequently, in its decision on discharge [64], the Parliament requested the Commission to present a proposal for the abolition of pre-financing by December 2004. | | 4.87.
The Commission reacted to the Court’s recommendations by implementing two new regulations establishing horizontal rules, and a further three new sector specific regulations in relation to prefinancing [65].
The Court considers that a system reliant on making payment up to four months in advance of export in order to pay a special refund rate to a limited number of commercial traders and achieve efficient control is fundamentally flawed. 4.91.
As the Court indicates in paragraph 4.89, in 2004, the Commission services made an intermediary analysis.
As a result of the risk analysis based on a variety of risk factors including findings of the Court, the audit work programme for 2004 for clearance of accounts which was established in 2003 did envisage an enquiry into potato starch.
During the audit missions carried out in 2004, the issues raised by the Court were also addressed.
Parameters and the calculation method used for the calculation of the production refunds for cereal and potato starch are specified in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1548/2004. | 4.94.
An evaluation [69] in 2002 addressed the lack of information and analysis of production refunds on the competitivity of the EU non-food starch industry, and on the impact of direct support on the incomes of starch potato producers noted by the Court, and served as the basis for modifications to the support scheme in the context of the CAP reform.
However, the Council favoured only a partial decoupling of the direct aid of 40 %. | 4.95.
The Commission proposed in July 2004 (COM(2004) 490 final) to reinforce the evaluation requirements for the future rural development framework. | (c) contrary to the requirements of the relevant regulation, forestry measures are frequently not based on national or sub-national forest programmes; (c) At the beginning of the present programming period only few Member States had developed national forest programmes.
However, Member States made progress over the last years in the formulation and implementation of their national forest programmes. | (d) the system in place for implementing forestry measures is complex, creating difficulties for both managing authorities and beneficiaries.
The authorities approving projects should require sufficient evidence from the municipalities that the maintenance work is ensured. | (f) increasing woodland by grant-aided afforestation of agricultural land is very expensive, mainly due to compensation for loss of agricultural income over a period of 20 years.
Nevertheless, in its initial proposal for the post 2006 Rural Development framework, the Commission suggested to limit the compensation for income loss to 10 years.
The Court recommended that the Commission, Council and Parliament should consider, for AE in the new expenditure programming period commencing in 2007, how to take into account the principle that if a measure cannot be adequately checked, it should not be the subject of public payment. 4.98 and 4.99.
The Member States have systems in place to control agri-environment measures and these are checked in all Member States.
It is proposed that the roles and responsibilities under shared management will be further clarified as submitted by the Commission in its communication COM(2005) 252 final on a roadmap to an integrated internal control framework. | [15] Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95. [16] The 30 April deadline was not met due to translation difficulties. [17] The main reasons for not clearing these accounts were: a failure by the certifying bodies to quantify the financial impact of all identified errors (Bayern-Umwelt, (DE) AGEA, (IT)); inadequate audit by the certifying body for Luxembourg; a scope limitation for Madrid (ES) and failure by SDE (FR) to carry out the on-the-spot controls. [18] The certifying bodies identified material error (more than 1 % of expenditure declared) affecting either the whole account or specific areas in seven paying agencies (Navarra, Baden-Wurttemberg, Bayern-Umwelt, IFADAP, Region Wallonne, ONIVINS and SDE).
The Commission reached the same conclusion for three other paying agencies (La Rioja, ODEADOM and ONIFLHOR).
Furthermore, the Commission intends to make corrections based on financial errors detected in a further four paying agencies (Andalusia, Canary Islands, Forestry Commission and SERAD). [19] Commission decisions 2004/136/EC (OJ L 40, 12.2.2004, p. 31), 2004/457/EC (OJ L 156, 30.4.2004, p. 47) and 2004/561/EC (OJ L 250, 24.7.2004, p. 21). [20] These conformity decisions were offset against expenditure for the year 2004. [21] The flat-rate corrections are applied as follows: 2 % when key controls are satisfactory but secondary controls are partly or totally ineffective; 5 % when key controls are executed but the number, frequency or rigour required by regulations is not respected, and the risk of loss to the Fund is significant; 10 % when one or more key controls do not operate making it impossible to determine the eligibility or regularity of a claim, with, as a result, a high risk of loss to the Fund. [22] 1999 was the first year in which the Commission took conformity decisions under the revised procedure for clearance of accounts introduced in 1996. [23] Annual Activity Report 2004, section 3.2.1.1. [24] Annual Activity Report 2004, paragraph 4.2.2. [25] The critical aspect in checking the legality and regularity of the transactions is the existence and accuracy of the information declared by beneficiaries, many of which can only be verified by physical inspection at the final beneficiary level.
See Court Opinions No 2/2004 on the single audit model, paragraphs 21, 41 and 42 and No 1/2005 on the Financing of the CAP, paragraph 24. [26] See Opinion No 2/2004 on the single audit model, paragraphs 57 and 58. [27] In order to estimate the level of irregularities, an appropriate sampling method should be clearly defined (Opinion No 2/2004 on the single audit model, paragraph 48) and the legality and regularity of expenditure should be verified at the level of the beneficiary (Opinion No 1/2005 on the Financing of the CAP, paragraph 24). [28] Conformity decisions have the objective of excluding expenditure from Community financing where the Commission has found it has not been in compliance with Community rules (Council regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, Article 7(4).
These decisions are (in most cases) flat-rate corrections for disfunctioning key elements of the control systems.

By February 2004 only four remained to be partly implemented (4.23). | No answer | DG AGRI's 2004 self-assessment concluded that all standards and baseline requirements had been met (4.28(a) and 4.33).
The Court examined the implementation of eight standards and found that four of them showed room for improvement (4.34). | The Directorate-General for Agriculture should ensure these four standards are fully implemented (4.28(a) and 4.33 and 4.34). | Area aid schemes | The overall rate of error found in random checks is 2,4 %, compared to 1,5 % for checks selected on the basis of an evaluation of risk (4.26).
For some Member States it is remarkable that tests performed on a random basis show a higher rate of error than those selected on the basis of an analysis of risk (4.27). | The IACS Regulation has been amended as regards risk analysis, especially in introducing an obligation for Member States to review annually the efficiency of the risk factors used (4.26 and 4.27). | As in previous years and for some Member States risk-based transactions proved to have a lower rate of error than randomly selected transactions (4.37). | The Commission should ensure that the different samples taken by Member States are comparable.
However these proposals are often not implemented by authorities in the Member States (4.45). | Other expenditure | For the checks carried out under the requirements of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89, the Court found that: (a)coordinating bodies in the Member States generally prepared scrutiny plans in accordance with the Regulation, but only half of checks planned for the period were complete at the end of 2003;(b)one fifth of scrutinies examined by the Court were wholly unreliable;(c)the annual reports by the coordinating bodies do not present statistics on the results of scrutinies in a format which permits meaningful analysis and comparison;(d)the Commission had not put in place a programme of inspections to ensure the effectiveness of checks carried out (4.15). (See also paragraph 4.46(a)). | (a)According to the Member States’ annual reports the number of scrutinies completed was 2469 which is 63 % of the 3907 checks planned for the period.(b)The Commission will take these elements into consideration in its future work in relation to Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 controls.(c)Information received is analysed and treated by the Commission services in order to provide elements of comparison between Member States.(d)Such programmes of inspections have taken place in previous years based on risk analysis and another round is currently being carried out (4.15). | The Court examined the Commission's monitoring of Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 checks: (a)the existing regulation does not require coordination bodies to present statistics in a format which permits meaningful analysis;(b)in 2003 the Court concluded that only one in three post-payment checks for 11 Member States was wholly satisfactory.
The Commission ought also to intensify its scrutinies in the Member States and be more vigilant as regards observance by them of the time limits for completion of their inspection programmes (4.10 and 4.51). | For the checks of export refunds carried out under Regulation (EEC) No 386/90, the Court found that all Member States reported the number of checks performed to the Commission, but several did not communicate the number of errors detected.
During 2004 the Commission adopted a regulation requiring Member States to report this information with effect from the 2005 report.
The Court hopes that this regulation will effectively remedy these deficiencies (4.13, 4.52 and 4.53). | It is particularly important, in the light of the possibilities of non-export of the goods, substitution of exports, change of destination and finally of export carrousels (reimportation of subsidised products), that the Commission improves its monitoring of the on-the-spot checks that are compulsory for export refunds (4.13, 4.52 and 4.53). | The Court continues to find serious errors for dried grapes (Greece), reported on in the 2002 Annual Report (4.45). | The Commission has and will continue to propose financial corrections for deficiencies found in subsidies for dried grapes (4.45). | The Court continues to find serious errors in subsidies for dried grapes (Greece, reported on in both 2002 and 2003 Annual Reports) (4.54). | The Commission ought to take action in particular in connection with the clearance-of-accounts procedure, while making sure that any regional derogations from the conditions of minimum yield and production are properly justified (4.54). | Rural development | Schemes of this kind frequently have relatively complex eligibility conditions which sometimes need to be checked over several years (4.41). | | For rural development expenditure the certifying bodies have qualified their audit opinion on the accounts of 12 paying agencies, even if the financial impact is limited.
Reasons for qualifying the accounts were material errors, ineligible expenditure, missing supporting documents and concerned mostly agri-environment measures and investments in agriculture and forestry (4.47). | The Commission should follow up the errors found and take appropriate action to remedy the underlying weaknesses (4.47 and 4.48). | The certifying bodies have qualified their audit opinion on the accounts of three agencies which specialise in rural development measures.
Errors affecting rural development expenditure are included in the audit qualification of a further five agencies (4.42). | The errors highlighted by the Certifying Bodies in respect of rural development expenditure will be followed up in the framework of the clearance of accounts procedure and financial corrections will be proposed if they are found to imply a risk for the Fund (4.42). | Most entitlements to rural development support are dependent on respect of commitments entered into by the beneficiaries, such as respect of good farming practices.
The Court's Special report on agri-environment measures concludes that the verification of such expenditure poses particular problems and that it can rarely lead to reasonable assurance at a reasonable cost (4.48). | -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX 2 IACS monitoring elements Source: Court of Auditors, review of paying agency IACS systems. | | Area aid | Animal premiums | Member State | Paying agency | Administrative procedures and controls to ensure correct payment | Risk analysis and selection procedures for inspections | Inspection methodology and reporting of individual results | Preparation and reliability of statistics on inspections and results | Administrative procedures and controls to ensure correct payment | Risk analysis and selection procedures for inspections | Inspection methodology and reporting of individual results | Preparation and reliability of statistics on inspections and results | ES | Castilla y León | | 1 | 2 | | 3 | 1 | | | PT | Ifadap/INGA | 4 | 1 | 5 | | 6 | 1 | 7 | | UK | Scotland, Seerad | 8 | 1 | | | 9 | | 10 | 11 | DE | Saarland | 12 | 1 | | | 13 | 14 | | 15 | DE | Thüringen | 16 | | | | 17 | | | | | IACS is still not reliably implemented in Greece (see paragraph 4.56) | | | | | EL | Greece, Opekepe | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | | A | Works well, few or minor improvements required | | B | Works, but improvements are necessary | | C | Does not work as intended | 1 | Inadequate evaluation of effectiveness of individual risk criteria.
Although Commission Regulation (EC) No 118/2004 of 23 January 2004 makes this obligatory only from campaign year 2004 (payment year 2005) the ECA considers this evaluation to be an essential element of risk analysis.
Insufficient quality control over delegated body. | 13 | Insufficient monitoring of corrections to be made to the bovine database in order to resolve discrepancies between the results of on-the-spot inspections and the data in the bovine database. | 14 | More than 70 % of animal inspections were concentrated to the area aid remote sensing control window.
They can modify or complete claim data in computer system at any time, huge numbers of modifications and corrections are made by Unions throughout the procedure without any audit trail. | 19 | Regions selected for remote sensing are known to farmers' unions. | 20 | On-the-spot inspections are of poor quality, they are badly documented; there is no quality control at local level over inspections; for many inspections there are serious doubts about their reality; step measurement is considered to be a valid method of measurement; dual parcel reference system leads to situation where computer cross-checks exclusively use the digitalised reference code whilst inspections are carried out on the basis of old cartographic reference of a parcel and there is no link between the two reference systems.

The measures are financed by the four Structural Funds: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, "Guidance" section, (EAGGF-Guidance) and the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG); and by the Instrument for Structural Polices for Pre-accession (ISPA) and the Cohesion Fund. | | 5.2.The Structural Funds co-finance socioeconomic development programmes in the Member States.
ISPA supports the development of transport and environmental protection projects in applicant countries. | | 5.3.Each programme or project must be approved by the Commission and is accompanied by an indicative financial plan which specifies the amount of Community aid and the contribution by the Member State or applicant country.
Expenditure in the Community budget in 2004 mainly concerns ongoing payments for the current programme period (2000 to 2006) and final payments for the previous programme period (1994 to 1999). | | 5.4.For the 1994 to 1999 period the Commission approved 1104 Structural Funds programmes and 920 Cohesion Fund projects.
Most of the expenditure is directed towards the three priority policy objectives of the Structural Funds:Objective 1: promoting the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind;Objective 2: supporting the economic and social conversion of areas facing structural difficulties;Objective 3: supporting the adaptation and modernisation of policies and systems of education, training and employment. | | 5.6.For the 1994 to 1999 and previous programme periods, contributions from the Structural Funds were paid in the form of advances (based on progress achieved with implementation, as evidenced by the expenditure declarations submitted by the Member States) and final payments, the latter constituting the "closure" of the programmes.
The Commission seeks to obtain its assurance through the certification by the national paying authority of the expenditure declared and the statement (the winding-up declaration) by the independent audit body at closure, through the annual control reports of the Member States and through the audit work of its own services to check the effectiveness and compliance of the national systems. | | Management and control systems for structural measures: the main regulations and processes 5.8.The basic elements required of the management and control systems for the 1994 to 1999 period are set out in the Financial Regulation and the framework regulations.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2064/97, which entered into force in November 1997, introduced a number of specific requirements for the management and control arrangements for structural measures expenditure for the 1994 to 1999 programme period.
The principal points are:(a)the requirement for the Member States to put in place management and control systems which provide satisfactory certification of the validity of claims for payments (the expenditure declarations) and including in particular;(i)a sufficient audit trail, permitting the reconciliation of declarations of expenditure made to the Commission and the accounting records in the Member States, as well as the identification of the allocation of the Community funding;(ii)a minimum level of checks (at least a 5 % sample), additional to the day-to-day checks of operations, to verify the effectiveness of the management and control systems, the respect of Community requirements and the accuracy of the expenditure declarations;(iii)at the closure of each programme, the presentation to the Commission by the Member States of a statement drawn up by a person or organisation functionally independent of the implementing service; this statement should summarise the conclusions of the checks made in the previous years and provide an overall conclusion as to the legality and regularity of the operations underlying the final declaration of expenditure;(b)the requirement for the Commission to ensure, in cooperation with the Member States, that the financial control objectives set out in Regulation No (EC) 2064/97 are achieved. | | 5.9.For the 2000 to 2006 period, the new framework Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, implemented by Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 438/2001 and 448/2001, maintained and developed these principles.
Member States also have to take responsibility in the first instance to make any necessary financial corrections.
The checks carried out during the implementation of projects (the day-to-day management checks) and the sample checks to verify the effectiveness of the systems and the accuracy of expenditure declarations (the independent 5 % sample checks) have been more clearly differentiated (see paragraph 5.11).
The Commission provides guidance on eligibility issues both generally and on precise questions. | 5.11.The roles of the Commission and the Member States in the management and control systems for the 2000 to 2006 period can be summarised as follows:(a)the managing authority in the Member State receives applications from potential beneficiaries for EU and national co-financing for projects;(b)the managing authority in the Member State approves or refuses the projects;(c)for each approved project, the beneficiary submits periodic declarations of expenditure incurred by the project in order to claim the co-financing;(d)the managing authority performs checks that expenditure incurred by projects is legal and regular and is eligible for co-financing (day-to-day management checks);(e)the paying authority satisfies itself that the expenditure meets all the required conditions before certifying the aggregated declarations which it sends to the Commission;(f)bodies in the Member State, independent of the services responsible for implementation and payment procedures, perform audits of the management and control systems and sample checks of the expenditure declarations, covering at least 5 % of the total eligible expenditure of each programme (independent checks);(g)at the closure of each programme, a body (which may be the same as referred to in (f)) in the Member State independent of the implementing service submits a declaration to the Commission, which assesses the validity of the application for payment of the final balance and the legality and regularity of the transactions;(h)on the basis of the systems descriptions and annual control reports supplied by the Member States, and its own audit work, the Commission reviews the operation of the management and control systems in the Member States in order to satisfy itself that the systems meet the standards required by the regulations. | | 5.12.Besides the specific requirements on the Structural Funds, there are other requirements for the Commission which are intended to improve its general control environment.
A risk assessment was also made early in 2004 and an action plan implemented to reduce the risks identified in the exercise.Concerning the same Standard, surveys by the Internal Audit Capability of the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, show that, following the actions taken, there is continuous progress in staff’s knowledge of the internal control standards.With regard to Standard 17, the assessment by the Directorates-General for Regional Policy and Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities of the operation of management and control systems is not solely based on the on-the-spot audit work of the Commission services, but also on their desk-checks of systems descriptions, on the audit activity of the Member States and on the national annual control reports.As part of their systems audits both Directorates-General carry out desk checks of a large number of project files at the level of the responsible authorities, together with compliance tests of a sample of transactions.In 2004, the Directorate-General for Regional Policy did not audit projects of the 2000 to 2006 period, but carried out system reviews in the first phase of an enquiry which are being completed by a second phase of project audits in 2005.
With regard to the ESF, the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities feels that its audit methodology enables it to use its resources efficiently and thus to form an opinion on a maximum number of systems involving a large number of projects (see also reply to 5.42). | 5.18.The Directorate-General for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs (DG FISH) had not fully complied with the baseline requirements on implementation for five of the internal control standards at the end of 2004 (standards 11, 12, 17, 20 and 22).
The Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI) in its self-assessment for 2004 concluded that all standard and baseline requirements had been met.
As mentioned above (paragraphs 5.8 to 5.9), the regulatory requirements for the management and control systems for the 2000 to 2006 programmes were increased by comparison to the 1994 to 1999 period. | 5.19.The Commission is examining the Court’s findings in these cases in the light of the replies of the authorities of the Member States concerned and any additional information obtained where necessary.
However, important failures still remain, as demonstrated by the results of the review of the selected 2000 to 2006 programmes (see Annex 1).
The following findings illustrate the kind of problems which the Court found for both periods. | 5.20.The Commission notes that for certain aspects of the management and control systems, in particular recovery procedures and independence of the winding-up body, arrangements were generally satisfactory.
It also notes the positive conclusions on the audit trail and independent checks in the report referred to in point 5.37. | Unclear definition, allocation and separation of functions 5.21.In four of the 16 programmes audited, the Court noted problems related to the definition, allocation and separation of functions.
In two cases, checks underlying the certification of expenditure by the paying authority were made by a department which was not independent from the authorising service.
The failure to ensure the proper implementation of these basic elements of management and control increases the risk of allowing the declaration and certification of expenditure which is not legal and regular. | 5.21.The Commission notes that two of the programmes were for the 1994 to 1999 period and two for the 2000 to 2006 period.
The Annual Activity Report (AAR) of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development for 2004 included a reserve for expenditure in Puglia, and this issue is under review with the Italian authorities on the basis of elements provided to the Commission. | Failure to provide a sufficient audit trail 5.22.The Court identified problems with the audit trail in seven programmes.
In another case, for two programme measures examined, the Court identified a lack of reconciliation between payments by the managing authority and expenditure by projects.
In the absence of an adequate audit trail, there is no straightforward basis for certification of expenditure by the Member State. | 5.22.The Commission notes that four of the cases relate to the 1994 to 1999 period and three to the 2000 to 2006 period.With regard to the 2000 to 2006 programme for Belgium (1999BE053DO002), since the audit by the Court, the managing authority has reconstituted the expenditure declared to the Commission for one of the three files in question and the two other projects are under examination.
Concerning the 1994 to 1999 Finnish programme (956001FI8), following a special audit on the social allowances by the Commission in November 2002, the system was also deemed insufficient.
The progress has been monitored by the Commission services and the situation has improved since then.Concerning the 1994 to 1999 Spanish programme (940112ES1), the Member State's underdeclaration has not had a negative financial effect on the Community budget. | Failure to carry out adequate checks 5.23.In nine cases in the Court’s sample, the day-to-day management checks of operations were found not to be working or to contain shortcomings.
With regard to the Greek programme, the Commission, following its examination of the management and control system in Greece, is now satisfied that the measures taken adequately ensure the establishment of procedures for management checks that meet the requirements of the regulations.Concerning the 2000 to 2006 Swedish programme, (1999SE161DO002), the Commission will make sure that the improvements made also include the verification of the actual implementation of the operations. | 5.24.Shortcomings in day-to-day management checks were identified in six cases.
In a further two cases, no checks were made of activities performed by third parties and the Court found no evidence that this expenditure was eligible. | 5.24.With regard to the 2000 to 2006 programme for Belgium (1999BE053DO002), the Commission will ensure that the beneficiary provides the Managing Authority, on the basis of his analytic accounts, with the details of the actual costs included in internal invoicing, as the Managing Authority has checked the eligibility and grounds for this expenditure. | 5.25.For the 2000 to 2006 programmes audited, satisfactory progress was achieved on the 5 % checks except in one case where the checks were lagging behind in terms of coverage.
Nevertheless, the Court also identified weaknesses in the independent checks in 11 programmes in its sample.
Delays in reporting the results of the checks were noted in two cases.
For one programme, the checks did not sufficiently cover the whole programme period and the sampling did not take account of risk analysis. | 5.25.The Commission notes that six of the 11 cases concern the 1994 to 1999 period and five the 2000 to 2006 period.Before making the final payment for the 1994 to 1999 Industria e Servizi progamme, the Commission, noting the lack of audits of projects below LIT 3 billion in value, required further audits of such projects and in the final payment, based on the average rates of error found by measure, applied financial corrections to all projects in this category. | 5.26.Checks made by the paying authority before certifying statements of expenditure were found not to be working or to contain shortcomings in seven cases.
In two other cases, the paying authority had no overview of the day-to-day management checks which had been carried out on the programme concerned.
The paying authority now requires information on management checks and independent audits on projects before it certifies expenditure from the projects.With regard to the 2000 to 2006 programme for Italy (1999IT161PO011), quarterly reports detailing these controls are now being sent to the paying authority. | 5.27.If adequate checks are not performed at the various levels, there is an increased risk that expenditure which is not legal and regular will be declared to the Commission. | 5.27.The adequacy of the checks is assessed by the independent body at the closure of the programmes for the purposes of the closure statement.
The Commission also took measures to address this risk in the procedures for closure of the 1994 to 1999 programmes. | Closing of 1994 to 1999 programmes: delays and systems weaknesses in complying with the regulations Examination by the Court 5.28.The Court reviewed the action taken by the Commission in closing programmes from the 1994 to 1999 programme period.
Before the closure process, the Commission had carried out systems audits in all Member States.
It also issued general guidance on these requirements and on the closure process.With regard to the 1997 to 1999 Lorraine programme, nearly 20 % of expenditure had been checked by the Member State.
As far as the Zuid-Limburg programme is concerned, 24 out of 100 projects had been checked in a first systems review by the national audit body and 12 % of expenditure was subject to in-depth checks.
This has inevitably delayed the date of closure in some cases, especially where Member States have contested the Commission’s closure proposals involving financial corrections.For the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, four of the cases mentioned refer to programmes which had been closed and in respect of which the delays were the result of the constraints linked to the appropriate handling of irregularities.Concerning the closure of the 5 FIFG programmes mentioned by the Court in footnote 48, one is already closed, for two the closure proposal will shortly be sent to the Member States concerned and for the other two the closure procedure is ongoing.For the ERDF cases mentioned there were complex points which required exchanges with national authorities and which were protracted because of the overall work volume in the closure process. | 5.31.Table 5.1 provides information on the closed programmes for each of the Structural Funds as at 31 December 2004 and 31 March 2005.
It shows that DG AGRI closed 137 programmes during 2004, so that 158 of its 388 programmes remained open at the end of 2004.
DG FISH closed three programmes, leaving 41 out of 52 open.
DG EMPL closed 335 programmes (out of a total of 786) in 2004 and 264 remained to be closed.
DG REGIO closed 317 programmes (out of a total of 944) during 2004, leaving 333 programmes open. | 5.31.The tables show programmes that have been completely closed in the sense that both the final payment and the final decommitment have been made.
Where a Member State contests the Commission’s determination of the final payment due, the Commission cannot make the final decommitment until this has been settled, which in some cases means at the end of a formal procedure under Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88.
DG EMPL made a limited examination of closure procedures in four Member States.
For the Belgian case mentioned, the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities considers that the flat rate correction made by the Member State was sufficient in regard to the problems found for the years audited by the Member State's independent authority. | 5.34.
In the opinion of the Court, the quality of these audits was satisfactory. | | Results of substantive tests of projects Examination by the Court 5.35.
The Court carried out substantive tests of 167 projects in the Member States, under the programmes it had selected for audit (paragraph 5.19 above), in order to obtain further evidence on the operation of the Funds. | | Various problems found by the Court The weaknesses in the management and control systems outlined above (paragraphs 5.20 to 5.27) give rise to an increased risk as regards the legality and regularity of the underlying expenditure.
It will take appropriate action, including the application of corrections for those cases where there is a financial impact. | Work of other auditors 5.37.
The Working Group, comprising nine Member States [61], carried out parallel audits in 2003 to 2004 to examine how two specific regulatory requirements [62] for the management and control systems for the 2000 to 2006 programme period were applied in their countries - provision of a sufficient audit trail (Article 7) and organisation of independent sample checks of operations (Articles 10 to 12). | | 5.38.
Among their main conclusions were: | 5.38. - in most countries there is a sufficient audit trail as defined by the Regulation.
The most significant weaknesses identified were the lack of complete documentation of examinations carried out, and the lack of definition of the distinction between irregularities and simple errors; - Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 on the reporting of irregularities is being amended in order to provide a clear definition of irregularity. | - in most countries the execution and reporting of the independent sample checks complied with the Regulation.
Furthermore, the Working Group expressed concern at the increased bureaucracy in the implementation of the provisions for the 2000 to 2006 programme period, resulting in increased staff and other costs. - The Commission answers questions from Member States on the interpretation of regulatory requirements and issues guidance.
The detailed implementation of the control framework in the 2000 to 2006 period is a matter for Member States.
The Commission again recognises the risk that the management and control systems in the Member States are not implemented with sufficient rigour to guarantee that the underlying operations for the programme period 2000 to 2006 are legal and regular. | | 5.40.
As an improvement compared to last year, the reservations made by DG REGIO have been quantified, especially concerning the payments made in 2004.
It should be noted that DG REGIO carried out only eight systems audits on 2000 to 2006 programmes (compared to the 15 scheduled) in 2004, with limited substantive testing of projects. 5.41.
The Director-General’s assurance in a given year is not based solely on the audit work carried out in the course of the year concerned, but on the assurance built up over previous years’ audit work under the Directorate-General’s audit strategy, as well as the assurance provided from the audit work of Member States. | 5.42.
The declaration of the Director-General includes a reservation for those management and control systems for which serious weaknesses were identified.
The Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Oppportunities pointed out in its annual declaration how difficult it was to quantify the financial impact of reservations connected with systemic weaknesses in the Member States.
Nevertheless, the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on the basis of the Commission guidelines (C(2001) 476 final), feels that the weaknesses identified by the systems audits would point to a maximum potential risk of 261 million euro, i.e. 3,4 % of the payments made under the ESF in 2004.
The systemic weaknesses detected by the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities and the corrective measures taken prompted the Director-General to maintain his reservation in his declaration. | 5.43.
Similarly to 2003, no reservation is made by the structural measures Directors-General for the 1994 to 1999 programme period [63], although - for example - the ex post audits performed by DG REGIO for this period show a significant level of error in nine Member States (paragraph 5.34). 5.45.
Annex 2 gives an indication of further actions required from the Commission concerning the key observations made by the Court.
One of these cases relates to a finding by the Court in its Statement of Assurance for 1998. 5.46.
The situation regarding the follow-up of the individual cases of error detected in the Court’s audits for the DAS of previous years is as follows.
For OP 94IT16002 — Italy (Sardinia), the procedure pursuant to Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 is ongoing. | Conclusions and recommendations Conclusions 5.47.
The Commission is taking action to improve effectiveness where necessary. | 5.48.
The Court found some weaknesses in the management and control systems across all the programmes in its sample for both the 1994 to 1999 and the 2000 to 2006 periods.
Concerning the 2000 to 2006 period, as in last year’s Annual Report, the Court’s findings this year again show that most of the systems examined need varying degrees of improvement in order to fully comply with the fundamental regulatory requirements for effective day-to-day management checks and/or independent sample checks of operations [65].
The Court also detected numerous errors of legality and regularity in the expenditure included in the declarations leading to payments by the Commission in 2004 (see paragraphs 5.19 to 5.27 and 5.35 to 5.36). 5.48.
The Structural Funds DGs have addressed the risk of systems weaknesses in the Member States for the 1994 to 1999 period through their respective strategies for the closure of the programmes and in particular their treatment of the closure statements issued by the independent bodies.
The Court found that the Commission closed some programmes although the closure statements submitted by the Member States did not contain complete information (see paragraphs 5.28 to 5.34). 5.49.
The cases of shortcomings have to be considered in the context of the high number of programmes to be closed and the complexity of the process. | 5.50.
Despite some improvements in the information provided in the annual activity reports and declarations of the Directors-General for structural measures, further effort is required, notably concerning the scope and impact of the reservations (see paragraphs 5.39 to 5.45). 5.50.
The action taken by the Commission to follow up previous observations of the Court has been generally satisfactory, although some delays have been noted (see paragraph 5.46). | | Recommendations 5.52.
It refers to its reply at paragraph 5.49. | 5.53.
For example there is a joint audit strategy for the Structural Funds Directorates-General for 2005, joint audits are being carried out in the new Member States, and the quality and timeliness of the annual control reports has improved.
The Court notes that proposals for new framework regulations for the 2007 to 2013 programme period have been produced by the Commission in 2004.
The Commission presented its proposals for Council regulations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds in July 2004 in order to ensure that the new framework was in place well before the beginning of the next period.
The examination was carried out at the Commission.
The Commission’s management of payments was examined on the basis of an assessment of the checks made by the Commission and a review of the declarations of expenditure submitted by the applicant countries for eight selected payments made in 2004 (Bulgaria five payments and Romania three payments).
The Court’s review did not give rise to particular observations. | | 5.56.
The Court notes that the Commission interrupted payments to Romania several times during 2004 and that the Director-General maintained the reservation expressed in 2003 for Romania due to important shortcomings in the set-up and functioning of the management and control systems. | | FOLLOW-UP TO OBSERVATIONS IN SPECIAL REPORT NO 3/2002 CONCERNING THE COMMUNITY INITIATIVE EMPLOYMENT — INTEGRA 5.57.
The Court’s Special Report examined the effectiveness of management processes, namely, the targeting and selection of projects, and the monitoring, evaluation, and dissemination of information, in relation to the Community Initiative Integra. | | 5.58.
The Commission, through its procedures for constant feedback, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of Structural Fund programmes, had been aware of the weaknesses inherent in the design of Integra even before the end of its period of operation.
The Equal Initiative includes in its design an obligation for the Member States to describe the lessons learnt from the Employment programme. | FOLLOW-UP TO OBSERVATIONS IN SPECIAL REPORT NO 4/2002 ON LOCAL ACTIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT 5.60.
The Court’s Special Report examined the Commission’s management of EU policy concerning local employment creation and its financial management of innovative projects in this area. | | 5.61.
The Court’s main recommendations were that: (a) a comprehensive assessment of the likely added value of local employment policy should be undertaken on all policy implementation levels; (b) Commission-managed actions in the area of innovative projects should be rationalised, along with a tightening of financial management procedures to ensure the regularity and cost effectiveness of funding. | | 5.62.
In 2003 it produced a report of a study into the availability of data for the measurement of employment performance at local level, while in 2004 a horizontal evaluation of local employment development, assessing the added-value of EU local development policy, was carried out. | | 5.63.
The Court considers that these actions constitute a satisfactory follow-up to its recommendations and that they will positively contribute to the cost effectiveness of Community funding in the policy area of local employment creation. 5.64.
The Commission welcomes the favourable comments from the Court on its follow-up to the special report on local actions for employment. | [52] For the audits by DG FISH concerning Finland (95FI14105, 95FI16002), Sweden (96SE14115) and United Kingdom (94UK16002, 94UK16005, 95UK16005); DG REGIO: France (Haute Normandie) 97FR16010 SPD Objective 2 1997-1999, Spain (Andalucia) 1994ES161PO001 1994-1999, Netherlands (Flevoland) 940713001 SPD Objective 1 1994 to 1999 and United Kingdom (Greater Manchester) 97UK16008 SPD Objective 2 1997 to 1999.

Key elements of the systems fail to meet the necessary standards (adequate separation of functions, the performance of effective day-to-day management checks and the organisation of independent sample checks designed to verify the effectiveness of the systems and the correctness of the expenditure declarations).
These systems weaknesses are corroborated by the errors found at individual projects, for programmes of both the 1994 to 1999 and 2000 to 2006 programme periods. (Annual Report 2001, paragraphs 3.56 to 3.64; Annual Report 2002, paragraphs 5.22 to 5.32; Annual Reprot 2003, paragraphs 5.12 to 5.27 and 5.41 to 5.56) | The Commission reviews the implementation of the management and control systems by the Member States, including audits of limited numbers of programmes.
The Commission has provided some guidance and has used its powers to suspend payments in cases where systems weaknesses may pose a risk of improper use of Community funds. | The Commission and the Member States should ensure the development of more robust management and control systems.
The Commission has made final payments although not all requirements of the regulations were respected. (Annual Report 2002, paragraphs 5.36 to 5.38; Annual Report 2003, paragraphs 5.28 to 5.39) | The Commission has checked the closure documents and performed audits in some cases, leading to the proposal of financial corrections.
The Commission and Member States should apply the lessons learned from the 1994 to 1999 closure process for the closure of 2000 to 2006 programmes. | The Commission’s closure strategy – involving pre-closure compliance audits, checking of declarations by the independent body accompanying final payment claims, and ex post audits of closed programmes followed by financial corrections – has significantly reduced the risk of undue payments.
A guidance note is currently being prepared. | Limitations in the Commission's assurance on the operation of the management and control systems The structural measures Directors-General confirm that the internal systems at the Commission provide reasonable assurance on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions, but do not take full assurance on the operation of the management and control systems in the Member States.
For the period 1994-1999, the Directors-General made no reservations for the four Structural Funds.
The Commission’s assurance with regard to the 1994 to 1999 programmes is based on the comprehensive closure strategy referred to above.
The Commission rarely extends its investigations beyond the samples examined by the Court, even when evidence exists that errors found may have a systemic effect. (Annual Report 2002, paragraphs 5.44 to 5.52; Annual Report 2003, paragraphs 5.63 to 5.65) | The Commission's follow-up action has improved, although delays persist. | The Commission should ensure a comprehensive follow-up, avoiding any undue delays. | The Commission has introduced computer applications to monitor follow-up and help ensure that it is comprehensive and timely. | -------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER 6 Internal policies, including research TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction Specific assessment in the context of the Statement of Assurance Audit objectives and scope of the audit Evaluation of supervisory and control systems Risk analyses Implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control Standards Appraisal in selected areas of activity Analysis of the Commission ex post financial audits in the IP area Results of the test of underlying transactions in the IP area Review of the Annual Activity Reports and the Directors-Generals’ Declarations Follow-up of previous observations in the context of DAS Conclusions and recommendations Follow-up of Special Report No 11/2003 "LIFE" THE COURT'S OBSERVATIONS | THE COMMISSION'S REPLIES | INTRODUCTION 6.1.The budgetary area of Internal Policies, including Research (IP) covers a wide range of activities contributing to the development of the single market leading to 9010 million euro commitments (see Graph 6.1) and 7255 million euro payments (see Graph 6.2) in 2004.
More than half of these appropriations related to Research and Technological Development (RTD). | | 6.2.The majority of the IP actions are directly managed by the Commission.

The audit focused on:(a)the operation of selected supervisory and control systems:eight of the Commission’s 24 Internal Control Standards for three Directorates-General: Research (DG RTD), Information Society and Media (DG INFSO) and Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO),management and control systems of the sixth framework programme (FP6) for Research and Technological Development (RTD), of the European Refugee Fund (ERF) in the area of Justice, Freedom and Security and of Community actions in the area of Public Health and Consumer Protection (SANCO),reports of the Commission’s ex post financial audits;(b)tests of a sample of commitments and payments authorised in 2004;(c)the Annual Activity Reports and Declarations of the Directors-General. | | Evaluation of supervisory and control systems Risk analyses 6.4.In the IP area, payments are mainly based on the reimbursement of the costs reported by the beneficiary.
This risk is amplified due to a multiplicity of contractual provisions, insufficiently clear definitions of eligible costs and a lack of sanction mechanisms. | 6.4.The annual activity reports by the Directors-General confirm that the frequency of errors in declarations presented by the beneficiaries is indeed a problem.
The risk of non-detection remains significant as certain types of errors can only be detected by ex post financial audits. | 6.5.Following action 1 in the 2001 summary report by the Commission, ex ante controls were stepped up.
The introduction of audit certificates should also be noted. | Implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control Standards Scope of the audit 6.6.The implementation and functioning of the Internal Control Standards is essential for the IP area given that most of the funds concerned are directly managed by the Commission itself. | | 6.7.The Court reviewed the implementation of eight out of 24 Standards in DG RTD, DG INFSO and DG SANCO.
Moreover, in 2005, these two analyses will be supplemented by a strategic risk analysis started in 2004. | The audit confirmed the observation made in the Annual Report 2003 regarding the insufficient compliance with Standard 12 "Adequate management information".
DG SANCO has taken the necessary measures to minimise the impact, although some adjustments of the audit programme were unavoidable. | DG SANCO complied only partially with Standard 18 "Recording exceptions" since the procedure in place was limited to exceptions regarding financial and contractual procedures. | SANCO will establish further guidelines for dealing with exceptions to non financial procedures, in particular, as regards the level of authorisation, formal requirements for recording and follow up actions. | Appraisal in selected areas of activity 6.9.The Court examined the management and control procedures of the sixth framework programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6), for the European Refugee Fund (ERF) and for Community actions in the area of Public Health and Consumer Protection (see Annex 2).
The operation of the most important controls was verified based on a sample of transactions (see paragraphs 6.25 to 6.35). | | Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6) Common IT system still not fully operational 6.10.The use of a common IT system is a key factor for the effectiveness of the Commission’s internal controls.
The Commission initiated in 2002 the development of such a system for the different stages of the management of indirect RTD actions (proposal evaluation, negotiation and selection, contract and project management).
In 2004, two years before the end of the FP6 programming period, neither a common nor an integrated IT system was fully operational, despite the Commission’s declared intention to do so.
This situation (already detected during 2003) affects the efficient operation of the internal controls concerning all management areas of FP6, especially those related to the authorisation of commitments and payments and the production of management indicators in relation to Internal Control Standard 12.
In summer 2004 a common management structure for supervision of the development of the FP6 IT System was agreed between all research DGs.However, differentiated needs and business procedures between research DGs led to date to integrated rather than a common system.The Commission considers that the development of an integrated IT system is important for the management of indirect RTD actions and will continue its efforts in this area, notably as regards processes which impinge on relations with proposers and contractors and which are relevant for reporting and management information.Concerning specifically the authorisation of FP6 commitments and payments workflow tools exist, either centrally or locally, to ensure that the appropriate approvals are given.
The question relating to Standard 12 concerns DG RTD and is dealt with in 6.8. | Obligation to provide audit certificates 6.11.One of the main modifications introduced by FP6 in order to reduce the risk of errors at final beneficiary level is the requirement to have the costs declared to the Commission certified by an external auditor.
The effectiveness of audit certificates in detecting errors is likely to improve with experience and the Commission intends to accelerate the process of improvement through targeted information to beneficiaries and auditors and a continuous assessment of the contribution of the audit certificates in the general control system. | European Refugee Fund (ERF) Obligatory checks of actions by the Member State not fulfilled 6.12.The Member States should ensure, by checks covering at least 20 % of the total eligible expenditure, that the action is managed in accordance with the applicable Community rules, and that the funds are placed at its disposal in accordance with the principles of sound financial management.
For instance, following an ex post control in a Member State, a financial correction was applied with regard to ineligible expenditure for a reason of that kind.The Commission feels that the eligibility criteria are applied in the case of asylum seekers whose requests have been rejected. (see reply to 6.34).Moreover, the legal framework relating to the concept of country of origin was clarified in Council Directive 2004/83/EC and in the new legal basis of ERF2 adopted in December 2004. | Community actions in the area of Public Health and Consumer Protection 6.15.A large part of the budget for the Public Health Programme is spent on cofinancing projects selected following annual calls for proposals.
However, at the central level of the Directorate-General, an additional ex ante verification of financial transactions is performed on a sample basis, a "Committee of Public Procurement" issues opinions on the conformity of the tendering procedures and an ex post financial control cell carries out audits at the final beneficiary level.
The internal audit function provides opinions to the Director-General on the quality of management and internal control systems. | | 6.17.The Court analysed the procedures introduced in 2004 and found them to be adequate.
However, errors detected in testing the underlying transactions (see paragraph 6.29) point to the fact that the procedures were not continuously and consistently applied in the past.
As regards advance payments, there was no evidence of a systematic a priori verification made by the authorising officer; | SANCO’s financial circuits are designed in compliance with the Financial Regulation and take into account the risks involved in the different financial transactions.
In the case of advance payments, it is the responsible Authorising officer who exercises personally the necessary verifications before authorising the expenditure.
These audits, either carried out by the audit services of the different Directorates-General or by external audit firms (EAF) on behalf of the Commission, focus on the cost statements that beneficiaries submit for reimbursement.
In addition, in some budget areas, the Commission required beneficiaries to submit a certificate (see paragraph 6.11) from an independent auditor in support of the cost statements. | | 6.19.The Court’s audit covered:the analysis of the evolution of the number, the results and the coverage of audits compared to previous years;the analysis of audit results on a sample of audit reports from EAF;a review of a sample of Commission audit reports concerning indirect research contracts and measures funded by DG ENV. | | Evolution of audits carried out 6.20.The Court’s analysis revealed that: | 6.20. | whereas some Directorates-General have increased their level of audit activities, the overall level has been reduced in 2004 (Table 6.1), from 552 completed audits in the previous year to 496, (which corresponds to 2 % of open contracts), but the recoverable amounts actually increased; | The situation varies greatly from one Directorate-General to another; Chapter 6 covers several different policies.
It confirms nevertheless that, even if the target has been exceeded by some DGs, it will have to reconsider its overall target of auditing 10 % of the FP5 contractors, because the final number of auditable FP5 contractors is considerably higher than anticipated. | Source: European Commission.
However, the number of 23375 has to be refined as it contains duplications of contractors.
The results of the audits carried out by external audit firms on behalf of the Commission were examined in order to assess whether they constitute a valid source of information for the appraisal of the legality and regularity of underlying transactions.
A sample of 31 files of audits were examined in the Directorates-General concerned (DG RTD, DG TREN, DG INFSO and DG ENTR). | | 6.22.
Other issues impacting the legality and regularity of the transactions, such as the achievement of contractual objectives or the timely provision of contractually agreed deliverables by the beneficiary which could be verified in some cases by the external auditor, are not covered by such audits. 6.22.
Financial auditors have not the required expertise to assess the scientific deliverables so that their work is limited to verifying if the amounts are claimed in accordance with the financial provisions of the contract. | 6.23.
The analysis of a sample of audit reports showed an average delay of 416 days between the initiation and the completion of the audit.
While a certain delay is inevitable to complete the audit process, some of the delays observed are excessive (ranging from 94 to 770 days) [35] (see Table 6.3).
The actual audit field work starts more than three months (on average 100 days) later in function of the planning of the EAF.
The Commission has systematically applied these penalties. | Table 6.3 — Number of days for completion of Commission financial audits Source: Court of Auditors Analysis.

The Court’s analyses of audit reports and files at DG ENV, established by the audit unit of this Directorate-General, leads to following observations [37]: | 6.24. - recovery orders are launched too late: In 2003, the Commission’s own auditors recommended the recovery of 391000 euro.
By November 2004, only 54 % of this amount had actually been recovered from the beneficiaries, due in part to a pending OLAF investigation.
Although the average delay between the receipt of the final audit report and the establishment of a recovery order went down from 152 days in 2003 to 138 in 2004, this delay is still excessive.
In contrast, the beneficiaries paid on average within 50 days from the issue of the recovery order, - Finalised ex post audit reports are sent to the operational unit(s), who inform the beneficiary of the results of the audit and invite them to provide with further comments or additional documentation.
In one case, the decision to launch an audit on the spot was taken only 16 months after the final payment was made, - It is agreed that the follow-up of audit findings needs to be subject to a more formal and measurable procedure in DG ENV.
The ex post audit unit has set up since the end of 2004 a monitoring format and method in order to remind technical units on a regular basis to send information on action taken on the basis of audit reports. | - for contractors receiving EU funds through more than one contract, where an audit reveals errors that can be considered as systematic, there are no procedures foreseen to inform the other Commission services concerned or undertake audits of the other contracts [38]. - With the implementation of the accounting reform (and in particular the creation of a register on contracts and legal entities), the development of a more general information exchange network could be envisaged at Commission level. | Results of the test of underlying transactions in the IP area 6.25.
A review of the Commission files was performed on a general sample of 107 payments [39] and eight commitments selected in the IP area; for 25 interim and final payments of this sample, the audit was extended at final beneficiary level.
The findings corroborate the weaknesses identified in the systems (see paragraphs 6.9 to 6.17). | | At Commission level errors were frequent but not material. 6.26.
The review of Commission files revealed that 58 out of the 107 payments were affected by issues of legality and regularity [40].
The Financial Regulation was not complied with for 20 % of payments, which were made late and in most cases the delay exceeded one month [42].
The Commission has decided to tackle the problem and measures have been taken both in the internal financial circuits and in the operational methods with those involved.
Moreover, the current definition of interest in the contracts is too vague to permit the Commission services to estimate properly the interest generated [44]. 6.28.
Out of 43 grant award procedures reviewed four were not regular due to the composition of the Evaluation Committee, the ineligibility of the beneficiary, the absence of a financing decision taken by the institution or the award of a grant outside any call for proposals.
In the Public Health area, the weaknesses identified by the Court refer to grants awarded in 2000, 2001 and 2002 under the previous eight separate public health programmes.
At the same time the rules and procedures for the funding of actions were considerably improved and the necessary steps were taken to avoid similar problems in the future. | High number of errors at final beneficiary level As in previous years the beneficiaries over-declare the costs [45] 6.30.
On average, costs reported for the seven FP5 actions audited at final beneficiary, representing an amount of 6 million euro, were overstated by more than 12 % due to ineligible costs or absence of supporting documentation.
This rate of over-declaration is higher than the average rate of 3,1 % resulting from the audits undertaken by the Commission (see Table 6.1).
For FP5, the Commission’s 286 financial audits resulted in an average rate of overdeclaration of 4,6 %. 6.30.
With regard to two of the seven cases audited by the Court, the Commission accepts the comments made and is going to take corrective measures.
In one case, the Commission does not agree with the Court's interpretation. | 6.31.
In most IP programmes, personnel and related costs represent the major category of the costs reimbursed: | 6.32. - for RTD actions, beneficiaries are required to record and certify the time charged on the project.
In 50 % of the cases audited by the Court, the system put in place by the beneficiary did not meet the contractual requirements or in some cases did not exist at all.
The existence of a time recording system is verified mainly by ex post audit at the beneficiary level, - The contractual provisions foresee that all costs claimed from the Commission for reimbursement need to be adequately substantiated by the contractors.
For FP5, the practice of the Commission’s auditing services is to take into account the seriousness of the non-compliance with contractual provisions before deciding on sanctions to be applied. | - in the area of Public Health and Consumer Protection, most of the beneficiaries audited on the spot (four out of five) were unable to provide sufficient evidence that all personnel costs declared had been actually incurred and were relevant for the project.
It increases the accuracy and consistency of the agreed budgets of the projects with the resources estimated necessary for their successful achievement. | Other issues Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development 6.33.
The audit of payments at national level revealed ineligible expenditure: | 6.34. - contracts concluded by one national authority concerning repatriation measures included also asylum applicants who have exhausted all appeal procedures and whose application and appeal were eventually refused by the Member State where they had applied for asylum.
These persons do not fall within the target groups specified in Council Decision 2000/596/EC [49] and the corresponding expenditure cannot be eligible for the ERF, - The Commission considers that expenditure incurred for the voluntary return of asylum seekers whose requests had been rejected is eligible for cofinancing under the European Refugee Fund. | - contrary to the legal requirements that only expenditure related to voluntary returns to the country of origin are eligible, one national programme also financed some voluntary departures to third countries due to specific cases. - With regard to certain cases referred to by the Court, the legal basis of the ERF, which refers to the concept of the "country of origin" is interpreted as covering specific situations which go beyond a strict reference to "country of nationality".
Likewise, other specific circumstances closely linked to the protection of persons can justify a wider interpretation as, for example, the case of the former Yugoslavia. | Public Health and Consumer Protection 6.35.
Substantive tests performed on the sampled actions revealed that in six cases the beneficiary had not respected the contractual reporting requirements by submitting reports late or not providing the required level of detail within the contractual deadlines (reports being one base for launching the Commission’s payments). 6.35.
DG SANCO accepts this delay in most of the cases on condition that reasonable assurance exists that it will finally benefit the quality of the report.
The analysis confirmed a further improvement in the structure, presentation and quality of the reports and the Declarations of Directors-General. | | 6.38.
All Directorates-General in the Internal Policies area stated that they had reasonable assurance that the internal control procedures put in place gave the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. | | 6.39.
However, for two Directorates-General that did not make any reservations, the Court considers that following reservations would have been justified: | 6.39. - following the analysis of the report of DG EAC, the Court considers that a reservation should have been made regarding the assurance that the Directorate-General can give in relation to programmes managed by National Agencies in Member States [53].
The audit of about one third of all National Agencies for EAC programmes [54] revealed that in about half of the National Agencies audited, weaknesses and recurring difficulties requiring an action plan were found.
In about 10 % of the National Agencies audited, significant and obvious shortcomings were detected that led the Commission to take measures to safeguard its financial interests.
More than 50 % of the budget of DG EAC is implemented through indirect centralised management, - On the basis of the systems audits which were launched in 2004 in accordance with the action plan accompanying the 2003 reservation, the Director-General of EAC did not consider it appropriate to maintain in 2004 the earlier reservation of principle which was prompted mainly by the uncertainty connected with the absence of such controls.
Moreover, following these audits in 2004 (which intentionally included agencies where it was thought shortcomings might exist), the agencies audited which showed weaknesses began improving their operating methods; with regard to the three agencies which presented significant deficiencies, the Commission took ad hoc measures before the end of the financial year.
Given these reactions as well as the volume of funds involved in the three agencies with significant deficiencies, the DG, referring to the results of the controls in the AAR, did not consider it appropriate to extend the 2003 reservation. | - the internal audit function of DG SANCO had advised a reservation regarding the risk of errors in grant management in the Public Health area in his contribution to the 2004 report.
Whereas the Court of Auditors mainly focuses on the regularity and legality of the underlying transactions, the Directors’ General opinion is based on the overall assurance provided by the different control systems that the important risks (impact and likelihood) are sufficiently managed or controlled to prevent them from materialising and harming the Commission. | Follow-up of previous observations in the context of DAS 6.40.
Regarding ex post audits of final beneficiaries participating in RTD framework programmes, the Commission is reconsidering its intention to reach the target of auditing 10 % of the FP5 contractors in 2006/2007 (see paragraph 6.20) and has adopted a common FP6 audit approach.
FP6 measurable audit objectives still need to be defined and an FP6 audit framework contract has yet to be agreed with an external audit firm (see Annex 1.1.a). 6.40.
The Commission refers to its comment in relation to point 6.20 above but also underlines that an important audit activity on FP5 contracts is still going on at present, as the Research DGs have launched in 2005 together some 280 additional audits.
These audits will be carried out by the external audit firm with whom a framework contract for auditing services was concluded towards the end of 2004.
The Commission's audit objective for FP6 will need to take account of this development. | 6.41.
DG TREN has audited 50 % of the total amounts related to final payments, which largely exceeds the target of 35 %.
As a result of the risk assessment and the geographical coverage that were at the basis of the audit selection process, the target to audit 20 % of the projects finalised in 2003 has not been fulfilled completely in 2004.
This target will be re-evaluated for 2005 and adapted if necessary.
Clear definitions of works and studies are contained in the application forms and in the draft for the new TEN Regulation COM(2004) 475 (Article 2, paragraphs 5 and 6). | Conclusions and recommendations 6.42.
The evaluation of the supervisory and control systems revealed that, despite progress achieved, not all baseline requirements of the Internal Control Standards in the IP area are fully operational yet (see paragraphs 6.6 to 6.8), and specific weaknesses exist in the systems of FP6, ERF and SANCO (see paragraphs 6.9 to 6.17). 6.42.
The Commission endeavours to ensure that the European Refugee Fund is applied uniformly in the Member States.
It should also be recalled that the points raised by the Court of Auditors relate to only one Member State; corrective measures have already been taken.
The Commission is continuing its efforts to improve its management systems, in particular its implementation of internal control standards (see point 6.6 to 6.9). | 6.43.
Thus it is not justified to reduce the number of audits, which has been the case in some areas of IP in 2004 (see paragraph 6.20).
Also, as reported already in the previous years, the follow-up of audits, in particular recovery of the Community funds is often too slow (see paragraphs 6.23 and 6.24). 6.43.
Timely implementation of corrective actions is closely monitored. | 6.44.
As in the previous years, the testing of transactions in the Internal Policies area for 2004 revealed a high incidence of errors at beneficiary level, that affected the legality and regularity of transactions.
No major improvement has been noted in that area, which also corroborates with the Commission’s own audit findings.
Progress has been made and these issues continue to be carefully followed up. | 6.45.
However, in two cases (see paragraphs 6.36 to 6.39) additional reservations would have been called for. 6.45.
Despite progress being made in certain areas, the audit findings related to the supervisory and control systems and the results of testing underlying transactions in the Internal Policies area do not provide sufficient assurance on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions.
As in previous years this conclusion is supported by the Commission’s own audit findings and the reservations made by the Directors-General. 6.46.
The Commission is continuing to try to reduce the frequency and impact of errors in declarations made by the beneficiaries.
Internal controls are being improved as called for in the Commission communication "on a roadmap to an integrated internal control framework".
The Commission is recommended to continue its efforts in order to reduce the risk of errors: 6.47.
To address these recommendations, the Commission intends as announced in its Communication on a roadmap towards an integrated internal control framework to present by the end of the year an action plan to address the gaps which in its view exist between the control framework in place and the general principles identified by the Court in its opinion No 2/2004 on the "single audit" model. | - to change the legal framework in order to simplify cost reimbursement systems by extending the use of "lump-sum", "unit-scales" and "flat-rates" payments [56], - Generally speaking, the proposals for revision of both the Financial Regulation and the Implementing Rules are designed to simplify rules and procedures, in particular, with regard to small grants.
It is planned that the revised Financial Regulation and Implementing Rules will come into force on 1 January 2007.
In this case, the rules of participation to be proposed for FP7 will be able to take advantage of the new possibilities opened up by the revised FR. | - to clarify procedures and instructions governing the different programmes, - Part of the simplification efforts of the Commission include the clarification of procedures. | - to use the errors detected by the ex post audits for improving the management and control systems, - Efforts in this respect will be continued by the DGs concerned. | - to take prompt action in cases where audits reveal potential for recovery, - The implemented procedures foresee timely action regarding the recovery of unduly paid amounts.
This is subject to regular management reports. | - to ensure the effective implementation of Internal Control Standards. - Ensuring effective implementation of ICS is a permanent action.
This objective will be pursued by the Commission's services avoiding an excessive administrative burden. | FOLLOW-UP OF SPECIAL REPORT No 11/2003 "LIFE" 6.48.
The Court’s Special Report No 11/2003 focused in particular on the management of the second phase of the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE II, 1996 to 1999) [57]. | | 6.49.
The Court’s main recommendations were to: - better define the programme objectives and clarify the link with Community environmental strategy, - improve the management organisation by generalising the use of outside experts, reinforcing complementarity with other Community measures and reviewing eligibility rules, - reinforce monitoring, control and evaluation, through better use of external auditors, and implement strategies for the dissemination of results. | | 6.50.
Most of the Court recommendations have been addressed; however | 6.50. - the programme’s objectives have still to be better defined, - The Council and European Parliament adopted Regulation (EC) No 1682/2004 on 15 September 2004 extending the Life III programme until 31 December 2006.
This weakness exists similarly for the audits undertaken by external audit firms in the Research DGs. [39] A general sample of 67 payments taken at random in the IP area plus specific samples representing a total of 40 additional payments: for FP6 (four payments), for Justice, Freedom and Security area (16 payments including eight payments for ERF), for Public Health and Consumer Protection (20 payments). [40] In the general sample of 67 payments the observations raised consisted of: late payments by the Commission (15 cases), late payments by the coordinator of the project to the other participants (five), errors not detected by Commission controls (10), no estimate of interests generated by prefinancing payments (nine), issues regarding the award procedure (five), issues regarding the contract or the Commission decision (four)… [41] See Annual Report 2003, paragraphs 6.20 and 6.22. [42] In the general sample of 67 payments, the delays for the 15 late payments were spread as follows: below one month (six occurrences), above one month (three), above two months (two), above three months (two), above five months (two).

[57] The current phase of LIFE III has been extended for two years until 31 December 2006: Regulation (EC) No 1682/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 September 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 1655/2000 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE).

Definition of measurable audit objectives for FP6, which can realistically be achieved, still outstanding. | Commission should define for FP6 measurable objectives, which can realistically be achieved. | the continuity of the Commission's audit activity depends on providing for the possibility to subcontract ex post financial audits (expiry of framework contract with external audit firm in 2003). | Award procedure for a new framework contract (for FP5 indirect RTD actions).
The audit of 24 decisions is ongoing and the audit of a further 20 decisions is planned. | The initiatives taken by DG TREN are welcomed.
The necessary measures should be taken to ensure that the target set by DG TREN of auditing each year at least 20 % of the projects and 35 % of total costs of projects finalised in the previous year is reached. | 2.
Supervisory and control systems — Verification of the eligibility of costs for TEN-Transport actions For TEN-T actions, eligible and ineligible costs are defined in the legal basis and the Commission Decisions (Annual Reports 2001 and 2002).
The Court found that these definitions are insufficiently specific to establish the actual costs incurred by the beneficiary;these definitions differ from those applied to similar infrastructure projects co-financed through Structural Measures;the use of different funding rates for studies and for works carries the risk that beneficiaries may maximise funding by wrongly allocating costs to studies; andthe absence of standardised cost statements forms complicates the Commission's verification work. | A new model Commission Decision has been adopted in 2004, including: a definition of eligible and ineligible costs;a modified definition of studies and works; and | | a table indicating the "Breakdown of estimated eligible costs during the period of programmed activities" which could be used by beneficiaries for the reporting of costs incurred. | In addition to the measures undertaken in 2004, model cost statements or financial progress reports should be included in the model financing decisions which are of obligatory use by beneficiaries.
Table 2.1 shows the funds spent in 2004 for financial perspective heading 4 (commitments: 5198 million euro; payments: 4606 million euro). | | 7.2.In 2004 the devolution process, by which functions and tasks were redistributed from the Commission's headquarters to its Delegations, (see paragraphs 7.48 to 7.51) was completed for the thematic programmes.
The audit comprised a review of the supervisory and control systems which are designed to ensure the legality and regularity of transactions, supported by tests of transactions at the Delegations and implementing organisations, and a review of the Annual Activity Reports of the Director-General of EuropeAid and of the Director-General of DG ECHO. | | 7.4.For the projects audited by the Court, advance payments are made by the Commission to implementing organisations that can take various forms, such as NGOs, government ministries, international organisations, etc.
The more frequent use of these intermediary organisations for the financial management and accounting of projects and the absence of national authorising officers are the main differences in the manner activities are implemented as compared to the EDFs. | | 7.5.This audit was carried out at Commission headquarters, at five Delegations (Bosnia, Cambodia, Kazakhstan, the Philippines and Syria) and at 17 implementing organisations.
According to EuropeAid, all baseline requirements as adapted for Delegations had been implemented by 31 December 2004.
The Court's audit confirms the Director-General's indication in the Annual Activity Report that improvements are still needed at both Commission headquarters and Delegations (see paragraphs 7.17 to 7.27). | | Directorate-General "Humanitarian Aid ECHO" Risk assessment 7.10.DG ECHO carried out a satisfactory risk self-assessment, rightly concluding that many risks in the area of humanitarian aid were beyond its control, with the exception of the quality of the implementing partners.
Consistent with previous years, efforts to reduce the risks were therefore concentrated on the selection procedure for implementing partners together with a system of audits of those selected. | | Audit of implementing partners 7.11.DG ECHO has a comprehensive approach of auditing the implementing partners.
This was complemented by detailed testing of expenditure of projects implemented by the partners. | | 7.12.In 2004, DG ECHO completed 130 audits, of which 70 had been realised at the headquarters of implementing partners.
The remaining 60 audits related to projects audited in the field (28 reports), grants (19 reports) and DG ECHO offices (13 reports).
The main improvement in 2004 was that the "Programming, internal control and ex post control" unit took sole responsibility for ex post verifications (see paragraph 7.23).
Clearer instructions to be issued. | More audits carried out; terms of reference and follow-up to be improved. | — | | Risk assessment 7.17.
Regular monitoring allows the Commission to take appropriate measures to correct or re-address projects. | Information and reporting 7.18.
The financial information focuses on decisions, contracting, commitments and payments made at Commission level. | | 7.19.
In a sample of 13 EAMR reports covering 2004 reviewed by the Court, the information on internal control standards was only provided in five of the reports and information on the findings of audits launched by the Delegation in one report. 7.19.
As indicated in reply to paragraph 7.18 of last year’s report, all delegations were subject to a systematic verification exercise before devolution was held to be operational (2001 to 2004).
EuropeAid intends to develop the use of best practice for these assessments, building on the experience acquired. | Audit of implementing organisations 7.21.
In most cases headquarters' services did not have the information on a continuous basis on the audits launched by the Delegations. "CRIS-audit", a module that should contain comprehensive information on audits, has been incorporated in EuropeAid's CRIS financial information system but the data is not complete and should, as a matter of urgency, be linked to the corresponding project monitoring information for the purpose of enabling a continuous monitoring of legality and regularity requirements. 7.21.
As already stated in the 2003 Annual Report, it is questionable whether these assessments should be carried out by the internal audit capability unit, considering the very limited staff resources available.
The internal audit capability unit's priority should be geared towards evaluating the systems which should ensure the legality and regularity of transactions and towards assisting the Director-General in formulating a well-founded annual statement in particular, on the quality of the control procedures and reporting systems, both at headquarters and Delegations. 7.22.
The "Programming, internal controls and ex post controls" unit carried out ex post checks on a sample of EuropeAid payments made during the first nine months of 2004.
The low level of errors found was confirmed by the Court's own work on these types of transactions (see paragraph 7.29). | | Transaction controls 7.24.
External audits provide an independent assurance on the quality of the management systems put in place for project implementation and on the eligibility of the expenses incurred.
Financial procedures and controls have been set up with the aim of establishing a balance between the level of risk and the controls effected, taking into account the different management modalities. | Supervisory and control systems at the level of the Delegations 7.25.
The review of the supervisory and control systems at the Delegations indicated that the procedures carried out were generally sufficient to ensure that the commitments and payments processed by the Commission were legal and regular. | | 7.26.
Such provisions were worded vaguely in the financing agreements whose external audit reports were reviewed by the Court.
Contract provisions for "certification audits" have also been improved.
In the countries visited by the Court, 14 external audit reports (13 contracted by implementing organisations and one by the Commission) of the projects were reviewed, of which 12 related to projects audited on the spot by the Court.
Regarding the remaining 12, the Court's review, together with the results of the checks carried out at some projects which had been subject to these external audits, indicated that the external audit reports were of satisfactory quality in relation to what was foreseen in their specific terms of reference.
The revised standard grant contract will contain terms of reference for the use of beneficiaries.
The work carried out by the Court on payments made to implementing organisations revealed only a low level of errors. | | Audit of transactions carried out at implementing organisation level 7.30.
The Court's audits of the projects revealed, in three out of 17 implementing organisations visited on the spot, weaknesses in their internal controls due to a lack of a proper segregation of duties between the authorisation and accounting of payments. 7.32.
The Commission, over the last years, has taken action to address deficiencies in the application of contractual procedures by implementing organisations through the introduction of standard contracts, including the introduction of audit reports according to which auditors are required to check the respect of applicable rules by the beneficiaries.
The review concentrated on the parts of the reports which dealt with the Commission's follow-up of recommendations given by the Court of Auditors, the Commission's internal auditors and of the actions formulated in the Commission's action plan (attached to its Synthesis of Annual Activity Reports on 2003 [9]) as well as on the internal control standards.
The Court examined whether and to what extent the statements regarding the control procedures set up to ensure the legality and regularity of underlying transactions made by the Directors General were justified and based on sufficient evidence. | | 7.34.
The Court found that the information presented in the reports was accurate and that, it reflected fairly the activities carried out on the follow-up to action plans and on the implementation of the internal control standards.
Both DG ECHO and EuropeAid have taken appropriate actions to remedy short-comings identified in 2003 and to complete and improve the compliance with the internal control standards. | | 7.35.
Nevertheless, in the sample checked by the Court, this was not always being done consistently (see paragraph 7.19). 7.35.
The Commission refers to its reply to paragraph 7.19. | 7.36.
Nevertheless, the Commission continues to develop and implement the audit methodology referred to by the Court. | 7.37.
The Director-General of EuropeAid declares that he had obtained reasonable assurance that the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, based on his own judgement and on information available to him.
However, the Court found that the systems which supervise the legality and regularity of expenditure underlying the financial reports presented by implementing organisations are still inadequate and should be strengthened (see paragraph 7.27). 7.37.
All the necessary supervisory and control systems were in place in 2004 to enable the Director-General to give reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of transactions carried out by EuropeAid in 2004.
As regards the use of audit results, external audits are not the only source of assurance available on the legality and regularity of underlying transactions.
The statement given by the Director-General of DG ECHO includes a reservation on the non-respect of the contractual procedures by a humanitarian organisation.
During 2004, the Commission continued to improve its supervisory and control systems in line with some of the Court's recommendations in the 2003 Annual Report as shown in Table 7.1.
The Court's audit revealed few errors affecting transactions at the level of the Delegations (see paragraph 7.29).
However, as in previous years, weaknesses in the internal controls (see paragraph 7.31), and a relatively high number of errors in terms of frequency and financial impact, were detected at the level of the project implementing organisations (see paragraph 7.32).
The Commission, over the last years, has taken action to address deficiencies in the application of contractual procedures by implementing organisations. | 7.40.
DG ECHO reduced the risk of illegal or irregular transactions by having an operational system of project audits although clearer instructions should be given to external auditors (see paragraphs 7.11 to 7.14).
As regards EuropeAid, the Commission agrees that all the system components of internal control can and should be improved.
However, all the necessary supervisory and control systems were in place in 2004 to enable the Director-General to give reasonable assurance as to the legality and regularity of transactions carried out by EuropeAid in 2004.
This would facilitate the quality control checks on external audits that the Commission should carry out. (e) As a result of its audit checks and risk analysis of the implementing partners systems, the Commission (DG ECHO) has focused its audit activities by emphasising the control of the tendering procedures operated by the implementing partners.
The revised standard grant contract will contain terms of reference (ToR) for the use of beneficiaries.
The Court published Special Report No 3/2001 concerning the Commission's management of international fisheries agreements in July 2001.
Thus the risk of inconsistency as expressed in the Special Report remains. 7.44.
The Fisheries Partnership agreements are an integral part of the common fisheries policy and as such contribute to the objectives set out in Article 33 of the Treaty. | Coordination with the structural aspect 7.45.
Moreover it has not drawn up the action plan for improving the evaluation of stocks outside Community waters which it promised to present before the end of 2002 [18]; or put in hand a new overall evaluation of the fisheries agreements, as announced in its report to the Council [19]. 7.46.
The Commission, however, systematically includes in the negotiation of fisheries agreements and protocols provisions to reinforce the scientific advices and stock assessments. | Effective use of fishing opportunities 7.47.
In May 2000, the Commission decided to devolve aid management tasks and responsibilities to its 78 Delegations over a period of three years to improve its delivery speed and quality.
The central services are moving away from direct management of projects, towards monitoring and supporting Delegations. | | 7.49.
More training sessions are now being organised overseas, and e-learning modules are being developed. | Special Report No 4/2005 concerning the Commission's management of economic cooperation in Asia 7.52.
For many of the bilateral as well as for the Asia-wide projects sustainability is in doubt. 7.54.
The delays between the identification phase and the start of the projects, as well as those delays that were identified in projects under implementation, concern bilateral projects designed before the reform of EC external assistance.
As a result of this reform, including the establishment of EuropeAid (January 2001) and the devolution of aid management to the Commission Delegations, together with the New Financial Regulation (January 2003), project delays will be limited and contained.
Within this monitoring exercise economic cooperation projects in Asia have scored well in terms of potential for sustainability. | 7.55.
The ongoing revision of AIDCO Practical guide to contractual procedures will simplify the application process for grants to the extent allowed by the Financial Regulation, as well as clarify the role of the delegations in the evaluation. | [8] Asia; Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia; the Mediterranean and the Middle East; Latin America.

For the eight Central and Eastern European countries that became Member States on 1 May 2004 no new expenditure was committed after accession (except for Sapard, where commitments were made until end 2004).
Payments however will continue until at least 2006. | | 8.2.The Phare programme and the pre-accession assistance programme to Turkey, implemented by the Directorate-General for Enlargement, provide support for institution-building and investment.
Payments to contractors and beneficiaries are, under decentralised management, made by national authorities, with ex post control by the Commission. | | 8.3.Sapard has a similar objective in the field of agriculture and rural development.
The conclusions are integrated into the general conclusions on pre-accession strategy in paragraph 8.37. | | 8.5.Expenditure in 2004 on pre-accession strategy totalled 3053 million euro.
Graphs 8.1 and 8.2 show a breakdown of the funds committed 1718 million euro and spent in 2004 (see paragraphs 2.4 to 2.29 for observations on the budgetary management). | | +++++ TIFF +++++ Graph 8.1 — Breakdown of commitments by budgetary area in 2004Source: 2004 revenue and expenditure accounts.Commitments in 2004 — 1718 million euroPhareTurkeySapardISPA47 %14 %13 %26 % | +++++ TIFF +++++ Graph 8.2 — Breakdown of payments by budgetary area in 2004Source: 2004 revenue and expenditure accounts.Payments in 2004 — 3053 million euroPhareTurkeySapardISPA56 %6 %19 %19 % | SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE Scope of the audit of the Phare and Turkey programmes 8.6.The Court:(a)evaluated the supervisory and control systems, with a specific focus on the operation of systems for the control of national co-financing agreements (see paragraphs 8.7 to 8.29);(b)carried out substantive tests on selected transactions in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Turkey (see paragraph 8.30);(c)examined the annual activity report and declaration by the Director-General for Enlargement (see paragraphs 8.31 and 8.32). | | Evaluation of supervisory and control systems Directorate-General for Enlargement 8.7.The Directorate-General for Enlargement is inter alia responsible for programming and commitment of expenditure, payments to National Funds, monitoring of the full project cycle including national co-financing, evaluations and closure audits.
The Court's audit has led to observations concerning programming and budgetary commitments (see paragraphs 8.8 and 8.9), co-financing (see paragraphs 8.20 to 8.26) and closure audits (see paragraphs 8.10 to 8.13). | | Need for improved project design 8.8.The projects from the programming years 2000 and 2001, to which most of the payments made in 2004 relate, suffer in some cases from weak design, complex objectives and unclear and unenforceable conditions, thereby increasing the risk of errors in implementation.
Consequently, the Commission had to frequently modify the project fiches. | | Budgetary commitments for Bulgaria and Romania 8.9.Budgetary commitments for the national Phare programmes in Bulgaria and Romania were increased from 360 million euro in 2003 to 578 million euro in 2004 (+60 %), in line with their accession roadmaps.
The Directorate-General for Enlargement is aware of several weaknesses in the management capacity of the national authorities and in the 2004 Annual Activity Report (see paragraphs 8.31 and 8.32) a reservation is made in respect of "Gaps in Romania's and Bulgaria's capacity to manage and implement increasing amounts of aid".
Moreover, the Commission pays particular attention to developments relating to the absorption capacities in its Regular and Monitoring Reports under Chapter 28 (Financial Control). | System of closure audits 8.10.In 2001 the Directorate-General for Enlargement adopted a closure audit strategy.
However, when contracting is rushed, which is not unusual in Bulgaria and Romania, the quality of the ex ante approval is at risk. | 8.14.The concerns of the Court on Bulgaria and Romania are reflected in the reservation in the Annual Declaration of the Director General.
The process of implementing EDIS has been a major step towards improving management capacity and control systems in the new Member States. | | 8.18.Bulgaria and Romania have drawn up action plans with the aim of having EDIS in place by January 2006. | | 8.19.For the first time systems put in place for DIS management were accredited for Turkey in October 2003.
The start of the first DIS managed programme has been delayed mainly because of staffing problems in the Contracting and Finance Unit (CFCU) and other bodies, which could have been eased if the authorities had learned from experience. | | The operation of systems for the control of national co-financing agreements 8.20.The Court examined the operation of the management systems put in place for the control of national co-financing agreements on the basis of a selection of 10 projects in five countries from the 2000 Phare programme. | | New reporting requirements introduced but… 8.21.The Directorate-General for Enlargement has improved the reporting requirements for national co-financing.
Therefore, countries were able to legally choose between the two forms or indeed to combine them during the course of implementation, provided all other legal requirements were fully respected (such as the 25 % minimum rule for investment projects).
This rule is followed in the case of joint co-financing, in which the national contribution is managed along the same lines as the Phare money. | 8.24.The rules and practices regarding co-financing for Phare have been evolving over a decade.
In the same note, expenditure provided as parallel co-financing was accepted up to one year after the expiry date of the Financing Memoranda. | 8.25.In order to mitigate the more restrictive rules than those applying to Member States, in September 2002 the Commission’s guidelines on the "Principles for co-financing" also included the Structural Funds’ "Rules of Eligibility" (which do allow VAT under certain conditions) as a guidance document.
In fact it was aligned with those followed in the Structural Funds as most of the recipients had become Member States. | 8.26.The Directorate-General for Enlargement’s acceptance of VAT as eligible expenditure under parallel co-financing does not have a legal basis.
The Phare regulation excludes VAT from community funding, and the prepose of that exclusion would be circumvented if VAT were eligible for co-financing. | 8.26.The Commission considers that treatment of VAT as eligible expenditure, in some cases under parallel co-financing, is consistent with the Phare regulation, since the Commission considers that this regulation sets out the rules applicable to Community financing only. | Insufficient verification of parallel co-financing at national level 8.27.The National Funds collect data on parallel co-financing when preparing Requests for Funds.
Instead, the Director-General for Enlargement has made a new reservation about weaknesses in the administrative systems and gaps in Bulgaria's and Romania's capacity to manage and implement increasing amounts of aid. | | 8.32.The Court agrees with the Commission’s assessment.
However, it is of the opinion that, in as far as risks for future management are referred to, these should not be expressed as a reservation against the Declaration on activities in 2004, but rather in the context of risk assessment in the annual activity report. | 8.32.As explained in the text of the reservation, the reason for making this reservation in 2004 is that the risks refer to the future sound financial management of budgetary commitments which were made in 2004 and were therefore subject to the Director-General’s declaration in 2004.
However, risks of varying degrees still exist at the level of implementing organisations in the candidate countries for all programmes (see paragraphs 8.29, 4.76 to 4.77 and 5.56).
The Court's audit has not identified material errors in the underlying transactions. | | -------------------------------------------------- CHAPTER 9 Administrative expenditure TABLE OF CONTENTS Administrative expenditure of the institutions and Community bodies Introduction Specific assessment in the context of the Statement of Assurance Introduction Supervisory and control systems Observations concerning transactions Annual activity reports and declarations of the authorising officers by delegation Specific observations Parliament Council Commission Court of Justice Court of Auditors Economic and Social Committee Committee of the Regions European Ombudsman and European Data Protection Supervisor Overall conclusions and recommendations Principal observations in Special Reports Special Report No 1/2005 concerning the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) Special Report No 5/2005 concerning interpretation expenditure incurred by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council Agencies and other decentralised bodies The European Schools THE COURT'S OBSERVATIONS | | ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND COMMUNITY BODIES Introduction 9.1.Heading 5 of the financial perspective, "Administrative expenditure", contains the institutions’ and other bodies’ administrative appropriations.

However, in 2004 the adoption of new staff regulations and of a new system for calculating staff remunerations, as well as the implementation of new systems in the framework of the new Financial Regulation, have introduced specific risks (see paragraphs 9.5 and 9.6). 9.3.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The phased introduction of a new salary payment system in 2003 and early 2004 created a new risk, like any new application (see reply to paragraph 9.5).
The number of errors found ex post was very small. | Table 9.2 — Follow-up to observations from past annual reports Observations | Action taken | Further action needed? | Parliament's reply | Standing orders Annual Report concerning 2003, paragraph 9.14: The Parliament's internal rules for implementing its section of the budget allows for the possibility of making payments using a standing order.
REPLY BY THE COUNCIL The Internal Control Standards (ICS) for the Council were been adopted on 20 July 2005. 9.4.
As the Court mentions in paragraph 1.87, 93 % of the baseline requirements were complied with, which could be considered as being practically fully implemented in an ever changing environment. 9.4.
REPLY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE The implementation of the main measures resulting from the adoption of the internal control standards is now scheduled over a two-year period (2004 and 2005).
Concerning one of those elements, in March 2005 NAP programmes were amended, the amounts paid in 2004 recalculated and, where necessary, corrected.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT While the near simultaneous introduction of the new Financial Regulation, the new Staff Regulations and the NAP payroll system did indeed give rise to major problems, the real nature of the latter needs to be properly understood.
While the manual entry of payroll data does also constitute a risk, the latter is not new and thus required no specific control measures beyond those already in place, although the NAP is a factor in leading Parliament to reinforce ex post controls on the payroll. 9.5.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The phased introduction of the NAP in 2003 and early 2004 created a new risk; such a risk is inherent in the launching of a new computer application.
The Commission departments addressed this situation by making a large number of manual controls on the results of the various provisional calculations of the monthly salary payments and immediately corrected errors detected by the IT teams before the final monthly calculation and authorisation of salaries.
The number of errors found ex post was very small.
Provisional modules were therefore brought in to limit the impact on the beneficiaries.
In 2003, the existing controls were evaluated and reorganised with a view to ensuring compliance from 1 January 2004 with the principle of initiation and ex ante verification as set out in the Financial Regulation. 9.5.
Those difficulties have on several occasions been brought to the attention of the Commission staff managing the NAP and have been discussed at regular meetings with those services.
Encoding is not therefore carried out in respect of the data already encoded within the personnel management system Centurio. 9.5.
Validated data are transferred directly from this system into NAP through an automated procedure.
Contrary to this rule, all the institutions, except the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the Ombudsman, provided in their internal rules for the payment of a flat-rate sum, ranging from 30 % to 60 % of the maximum allowable amount, to staff who do not produce any evidence of having incurred accommodation costs.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT The dispersion of Parliament’s activities, over three places of work, gives rise to particular problems with regard to missions, one consequence of which was that it was in no position to introduce new rules by 1 May deadline.
REPLY BY THE COUNCIL The GSC will examine, together with the other institutions, the possibility of changing its internal rules on reimbursing accommodation costs without supporting documents. 9.6.
However, the Commission is going to examine whether such a rule is well-founded. 9.6.
The number of cases found was significant in some institutions [4]. 9.7 and 9.8.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The errors mentioned were found in other institutions and not in the Commission. 9.7.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE This paragraph deals with cases in which the consequences of a change in an official’s rights in respect of his family situation have not immediately been reflected in changes to the right to the transfer part of remuneration.
REPLY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE The analysis of the supporting documents of transfers of part of the remuneration with a weighting coefficient is part of the systematic ex post checks which are currently ongoing.
A lack of control procedures concerning pension payments were noted in some institutions.
However no check had been performed in recent years to verify the actual place of residence of former officials [5]. 9.8.
REPLY BY THE COUNCIL On the basis of a risk assessment, the GSC carried out, in March 2005, a survey concerning pension payments to United Kingdom residents leading to corrections by the administration which, in turn, resulted in two court cases. 9.8.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Parliament notes the Court’s observation and will continue its efforts to improve its procedures. 9.9.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE The Court of Justice’s administration will endeavour to strengthen yet further its supervision of procurement contracts and to develop the training of managers in that area. 9.9.
REPLY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE One underlying reason for the weaknesses concerning the planning of the procurement activity and the operational management of the contracts was too much decentralisation of responsibility for procurement and contractual management to the different operating services, which do not have sufficient specialist skills in this area.
In early 2004, it was proposed to establish a new unit responsible for coordinating financial and contractual activity throughout the Joint Services of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, which manage the vast majority of public procurement activities within the EESC.
The unit includes two completely new posts specifically involved in procurement and contractual management in the Joint Services.
It should also be noted that the considerable impact during 2004 on the various operating services of the activity relating to the enlargement and the change of premises of the two Committees contributed to the weaknesses that have been identified. | Observations concerning transactions 9.10.
Several cases producing a long-lasting financial impact were found concerning remuneration of staff where the expenditure was not justified: 9.11 and 9.12.
At the EESC, which is a small institution, the management options are the following: in order to increase individual motivation and collective efficiency, heads of unit have full responsibility and are accountable for the organisation and development of the activities in their sector as well as for the management of their human resources.
The EESC Decision No 442/04 A states that, in order to be appointed head of unit at the EESC, a staff member must either: - have major responsibilities in the definition, development and implementation of the EESC’s policies, or have major responsibilities in sensitive areas, or - have major responsibilities in the field of staff or financial management, or perform the duties of authorising officer within the meaning of the Financial Regulation in important areas or for large amounts, or - manage an administrative unit made up of at least nine officials.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE Reference is made to the answer to paragraph 9.7.
The Commission considers that the weaknesses reported at the level of supervisory systems and controls do not materially affect the legality and the regularity of the underlying transactions. 9.13.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE So far as the annual activity report is concerned, it must be borne in mind that the time limit of 15 June, laid down in Article 60(7) of the Financial Regulation for sending to the budgetary authority a summary of the annual activity reports, is applicable to the Commission alone.
The following section concerns specific observations relating to each of the institutions. | | Parliament 9.15.
Paragraphs 9.6 and 9.9 apply to the Parliament.
In one of the cases the amount paid was overstated by 0,7 million euro. 9.15.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT As regards paragraphs 9.6 and 9.9 cited by the Court, see the relevant replies above.
Weaknesses were also observed, as in the past (see paragraphs 9.21 and 9.22 of the 2002 Annual Report), in the supervisory and control systems related to the payment of allowances to Members of the Parliament (MEPs).
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT As regards the secretarial assistance allowance, fresh changes to the PEAM Rules were approved in 2004 with the aim of strengthening checks on the use of the allowance, in particular in connection with contracts for the provision of services.
Paragraphs 9.4, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.11 apply to the Council.
REPLY BY THE COUNCIL The GSC’s reactions to paragraphs 9.4, 9.6, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.11 can be found above.
REPLY BY THE COUNCIL The GSC envisages to gradually eliminate the stocks of compensatory leave for staff of the A and B categories granted before 31 December 1997; the most recent step in this process is presented in staff note 80/05 of 17 May 2005.
Since the beginning of 2005, these stocks have been reduced by 2500 days resulting in a stock of 9317,5 on 7 September 2005. | Commission [9] 9.19.
Paragraph 9.9 applies to the Commission.
Paragraphs 9.4, 9.7, 9.9, 9.11 and 9.13 apply to the Court of Justice.
In one case concerning indexation of rents, lack of supporting documents attached to rent payment orders and insufficient follow-up of the lease contract resulted in the obligation for the Court of Justice to pay the lessor in September 2004 716000 euro for rent arrears, due to the non-indexation of the rent since 1999. 9.20.
It was only by letter of 28 September 2004 that the Receveur des Domaines (collector of revenue from State/Crown property) replied, demanding the payment of rent due following its adjustment to the changes in that index for the period 1999 to 2004. | 9.21.
Such an involvement in the carrying out of financial operations is not compatible with the tasks of an independent internal auditor.
Since his appointment in 2003, the Internal Auditor did not complete any of the audits included in his work programme. 9.21.
REPLY OF THE COURT OF JUSTICE Ex ante verification activities and internal audit activities are performed by different people.
Last, a Category A* official recruited on a reserve list arrived to reinforce that team in September 2005.
The division is now in a position to carry out its activities to the full. | Court of Auditors 9.22.
Certificate and report will be published in the Official Journal. | | Economic and Social Committee 9.23.
Paragraphs 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.9 and 9.11 apply to the Economic and Social Committee.
REPLY OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE Please refer to the EESC' comments on these points and on paragraph 9.4. | Committee of the Regions 9.24.
Paragraphs 9.6, 9.7, 9.9, 9.11 and 9.13 apply to the Committee of the Regions.
Internal Control Standards were approved only in November 2004, but not all the measures needed to achieve full compliance with them were taken.
THE REPLY OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS The Committee of the Regions undertook all possible efforts throughout 2004 to recruit a new Internal Auditor as well as the rest of the staff of the Audit Service.
However, as very few eligible officials applied for the vacant posts, it was impossible to fill them on a permanent basis at that time. | European Ombudsman and European Data Protection Supervisor 9.25.
THE REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT Full compliance with the requirements of the new Financial Regulation will take some time.
The Commission departments addressed this situation by making a large number of manual controls on the results of the various provisional calculations of the monthly salary payments and immediately corrected errors detected by the IT teams before the final monthly calculation and authorisation of salaries.
The number of errors found ex post was very small.
In 2003, the existing controls were evaluated and reorganised with a view to ensuring compliance from 1 January 2004 with the new principle of initiation and ex ante verification as set out in the Financial Regulation. | 9.27.
The costs of services are specified more precisely in order to avoid the risk referred to by the Court. | (c) grading of staff under the new staff regulations; (c) and (d) REPLY OF THE COMMISSION See reply to paragraph 9.7 and paragraph 9.8.
THE REPLY OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS The Committee of the Regions will fully implement the Court’s recommendations contained in paragraph 9.28 of the draft final audit and shall continue its efforts with a view to improving the existing documentation on procedures while giving particular attention to the question of the ex post verifications concerning the regularity of expenditure. | Principal observations in Special Reports Special Report No 1/2005 concerning the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF 9.29.
The Court's Special Report, together with the replies of the Commission, were published in OJ C 202 on 18 August 2005. | | Special Report No 5/2005 concerning interpretation expenditure incurred by the Parliament, the Commission and the Council 9.30.
The purpose of the Court's audit was to assess the soundness of the financial management of interpretation services at the Parliament, the Commission and the Council. 9.30.
According to the special report of the Court, savings can also be made in other ways, like lower freelance interpreter (ACI) costs or better interinstitutional cooperation. | 9.31.
The audit of the European Union's agencies and other decentralised bodies (ADBs) is the subject of specific annual reports [12].
The ADBs' budget totalled 872,3 million euro in 2004, as against 778 million euro in 2003.
Their combined authorised posts increased from 2009 in 2003 to 2233 in 2004.
The principal data on the ADBs are set out in Table 9.3 [13]. | | Table 9.3 — EU agencies and other decentralised bodies — Principal data Agencies and other decentralised bodies of the European Union | Headquarters | Year of establishment | Budget (million euro) | Authorised posts | 2004 | 2003 | 2004 | 2003 | European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training | Thessaloniki | 1975 | 16,6 | 14,7 | 88 | 83 | European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions | Dublin | 1975 | 18,1 | 16,8 | 91 | 88 | European Environment Agency | Copenhagen | 1990 | 33,6 | 27,5 | 115 | 111 | European Training Foundation | Turin | 1990 | 18,4 | 17,2 | 104 | 104 | European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | Lisbon | 1993 | 12,2 | 10,5 | 77 | 63 | European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products | London | 1993 | 99,1 | 84,2 | 314 | 287 | Translation Centre for the bodies of the European Union | Luxembourg | 1994 | 29,8 | 29,0 | 181 | 158 | Community Plant Variety Office | Angers | 1994 | 11,3 | 11,1 | 38 | 35 | Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market | Alicante | 1994 | 190 | 157,4 | 675 | 675 | European Agency for Health and Safety at Work | Bilbao | 1995 | 10,7 | 14,6 | 38 | 33 | European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia | Vienna | 1997 | 7,9 | 6,6 | 34 | 30 | European Agency for Reconstruction | Thessaloniki | 2000 | 374,6 | 358,6 | 114 | 120 | Eurojust | The Hague | 2002 | 9,3 | 8,1 | 76 | 53 | European Aviation Safety Agency | Cologne | 2002 | 11,3 | 4,7 | 95 | 80 | European Maritime Safety Agency | Lisbon | 2002 | 13,3 | 4,5 | 55 | 40 | European Food Safety Authority | Parma | 2002 | 29,1 | 12,6 | 138 | 49 | European Network and Information Security Agency | Heraklion | 2003 | — | — | — | — | European Railway Agency | Valenciennes | 2003 | — | — | — | — | Total | 885,3 | 778,1 | 2233 | 2009 | | 9.33.
The Court also noted a few cases of non-respect of the principle of specification (irregular or insufficiently justified transfers of appropriations), the principle of universality (appropriations entered in the budget were set-off against negative expenditure), and the principle of budgetary accuracy (amounts entered in the budget which did not correspond to the requirements of the financial year). 9.33 and 9.34.
The Court noted that in certain cases the systems of internal control developed in the ADBs needed improvement, in particular because of the absence of a satisfactory risk analysis. | | 9.35.
A number of agencies, though not all, have taken advantage of the services offered. | 9.36.
Almost one in three ADBs presented its financial statements on an accruals accounting basis.
In the case of the ADBs preparing accruals based accounts, problems were noted in the identification of carry-overs to be regarded as charges for the financial year. 9.36.
The Commission has provided the ADBs with specific documentation to assist them in identifying the adaptations to be carried out, in particular an IPSAS accounting questionnaire, the future reporting package for consolidation and a guidance document and form concerning the opening balance sheet as at 1 January 2005.
The communication process will be further intensified during the second semester of 2005 in order to ensure a successful first consolidation of the ADBs. | 9.37.
REPLY OF THE COMMISSION The Commission underlines that the responsibility for the preparation of the annual accounts is ultimately the responsibility of the accounting officer of each ADB. | THE EUROPEAN SCHOOLS 9.38.
The Schools' budget of 222,1 million euro was financed principally by Commission grants (118,4 million euro) and by contributions from the Member States (47,3 million euro).
The EU holds shares in two financial institutions being the European Investment Fund (EIF) [6] and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) [7].
These two capital participations in related organisations totalled 277,5 million euro at 31 December 2004 [8]. | | 10.5.
There is no evidence proving that other Commission services are informed and, consulted as necessary, to check compliance with Community policies or rules. 10.6.
However, as far as compliance with Community objectives is concerned, the Commission believes that the creation, in mid-2005, of the Compliance Function in the EIF (at the request of the Board of Directors and strongly supported by the Commission nominees) is a further important step in providing assurance of compliance with Community policies. | 10.7.
With regard to financial reports in relation to the EIF, the Commission has full confidence in the work performed by the independent internal and external auditors and the EIF Audit Board.
The shareholders ordinary annual meeting deals with the approval of the annual report and related financial statements and nominations matters.
All extraordinary decisions are subject to decision by the Commission preceeded by a formal interservice consultation.
The EIB, as majority shareholder, with around 60 % of the shares, faces particular group requirements which the Commission with 30 % does not.
The EIF Corporate Plan is first reviewed and approved by the EIF Board of Directors before inclusion in the EIB Group Plan.
For the consolidation process, some financial data are made available by the accounting services of the EIF to the EIB within the context of the very specific consolidation need of the EIB Group accounts.
The Commission is not aware of other differences in the treatment of shareholders. | 10.9.
In respect of the participation in the EBRD [12], the Commission has one member [13] and one alternate member on the EBRD's Board of Directors who report regularly on the situation and developments to the responsible Commissioner and the Director-General of DG ECFIN. | | 10.10.
According to the Commission, one of the aims of this EU participation in the EBRD is to ensure compliance with EU policies, for instance in respect of environmental standards that are not legally binding in non-EU Member States.
Through participation, it also ensures compliance with EU legislation, for instance in respect of the environment, and EBRD promotion of international standards in non-EU countries, which are not bound by EU legislation. | 10.11.
Although the monitoring is managed by the same Directorate-General, the level of information available in respect of the EBRD monitoring is more detailed than for EIF and includes the results of the consultations with other services. 10.11.
The Commission considers that the monitoring of its participation in EBRD and EIF must be carried out taking into account the legal framework specific to each institution.
The audit revealed that the monitoring and management information concerning the EBRD provides the Commission with reasonable assurance that their activities are in compliance with EU policies and do not conflict with applicable EU legislation.
The introduction in mid-2005 of a Compliance Function in the EIF, with a particular mandate to ensure appropriate compliance arrangements, is in place with respect to EU policies and legislation provides an opportunity to further enhance this assurance.
Furthermore, the Commission will examine the need to clarify, in the internal procedures of the relevant service, the ad hoc consultation process referred to in paragraph 10.6. | OVERVIEW OF ASSETS HELD BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE COMMISSION 10.13.
These assets are provided for measures that are carried out by financial institutions on behalf of the Commission in order to implement certain EU policies [14]. | | 10.14.
The Court assessed whether the Commission has a complete and up-to-date overview of the assets held by financial institutions on behalf of the Commission. | | 10.15.
According to the Commission the amounts [15], kept in the trust and special accounts under the supervision of DG ECFIN, totalled 360,9 million euro at the end of 2004. | | 10.16.
It is already the responsibility of each authorising officer to ensure that the assets under his/her control are subject to regular and adequate monitoring (See Article 60 of the Financial Regulation).
The purpose of the Guarantee Fund for External Actions [16] is to reimburse the Community's creditors [17] in the event of a beneficiary’s defaulting and to avoid direct calls on the Community budget. | | 10.20.
The Court's audit focused on the sound financial management of the Fund for the financial year 2004 [18]. | | 10.21.
Table 10.1 shows the development of the Fund over the 10 years to the end of 2004.
The Court found that the Guarantee Fund was managed in a satisfactory manner during 2004. | | 10.23.
The Commission is in discussion with the EIB in order to obtain, in future, an audit certificate on the outstanding loans covered by the Guarantee Fund.
The manual of procedures will then be updated to integrate document controls already carried out. | THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY IN LIQUIDATION 10.24.
The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community expired on 23 July 2002.
The objective of the Court's audit was to obtain reasonable assurance as to the proper implementation of the legislation governing the ECSCi.L. | | 10.26.
This was necessary to protect ECSC interests following the restructuring of a major infrastructure loan in 1998, in which all lenders were treated equally and which resulted in the conversion of three of ECSC’s loan tranches into a variety of instruments. | [6] 20 % was called up (120 million euro valued at 176 million euro per 31 December 2004 in the Communities consolidated balance sheet) out of the participation of 600 million euro (30 % of the authorised capital totalling 2000 million euro). [7] 26,25 % was called up (157,5 million euro: 138,9 million euro were paid and the remaining 18,6 million euro are payable during 2005 to 2009) out of the participation of 600 million euro (3 % of the authorised capital totalling 20000 million euro). [8] In addition to these participations, there is a Community participation in the "Galileo Joint Undertaking" of 282 million euro (called-up amount per 31 December 2004 valued at 192,7 million euro per 31 December 2004 in the Communities consolidated balance sheet) out of the participation of 520 million euro (90 % of the capital totalling 575 million euro).
