Accordingly, Malta is invited to achieve compliance with the data requirements. (2) The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth to pick up from 0.6 % in 2004 to 1.8 % on average over the rest of the programme period.
The programme's projections for inflation also appear realistic. (3) On 5 July 2004, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in Malta and recommended to correct it by 2006. (4) The programme aims at reducing the deficit below the 3 % of GDP reference value in 2006.
In particular, on the one hand, the fiscal target of a general government deficit of 5.2 % in 2004 seems within reach, on the other, concerning 2005 and beyond, the prudent underlying macroeconomic scenario and the nature of the announced measures aiming at reducing the deficit, as well as budgetary projections set up in the programme make the consolidation path broadly plausible within the currently projected external environment. (6) In view of this risk assessment the budgetary stance in the programme seems sufficient to reduce the deficit to below 3 % of GDP by 2006 and seems to provide a sufficient safety margin against breaching this threshold with normal macroeconomic fluctuations in the programme period.
However, a number factors, which partially offset the effects of significant privatization proceeds (more than 2 % of GDP in 2005 and 2006), call for a more detailed information on, and closer monitoring of, below-the-line operations. (8) There are risks with regard to the long-term sustainability of public finances, reflecting the projected cost of an ageing population.
In view of the above assessment, the Council is of the opinion that Malta should: (i) do the necessary to ensure the correction of the excessive deficit in 2006; (ii) ensure that the debt ratio is declining towards the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value at a satisfactory pace; (iii) make further progress in the design and implementation of the pension and health care reforms. | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | Real GDP(% change) | CP Dec. 2004 | 0,6 | 1,5 | 1,8 | 2,2 | COM Oct 2004 | 1,0 | 1,5 | 1,8 | n.a. | CP May 2004 | 1,1 | 1,7 | 2,1 | 2,1 | HICP inflation(%) | CP Dec. 2004 | 2,9 | 2,4 | 1,9 | 1,9 | COM Oct 2004 | 3,7 | 3,1 | 2,6 | n.a. | CP May 2004 | 3,4 | 2,1 | 2,1 | 2,0 | General government balance(% of GDP) | CP Dec. 2004 | -5,2 | -3,7 | -2,3 | -1,4 | COM Oct 2004 | -5,1 | -4,0 | -3,3 | n.a. | CP May 2004 | -5,2 | -3,7 | -2,3 | -1,4 | Primary balance(% of GDP) | CP Dec. 2004 | -1,4 | 0,3 | 1,6 | 2,4 | COM Oct 2004 | -1,3 | -0,2 | 0,4 | n.a. | CP May 2004 | -1,4 | 0,1 | 1,4 | 2,2 | Government gross debt(% of GDP) | CP Dec. 2004 | 73,2 | 72,0 | 70,5 | 70,4 | COM Oct 2004 | 72,4 | 73,7 | 74,2 | n.a. | CP May 2004 | 72,1 | 72,4 | 70,5 | 70,4 | [1] OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 1 --------------------------------------------------
