The 2013 programme will actively contribute to the realisation of this Strategy by continuing to develop cooperation between tax administrations in order to ensure that taxation systems fulfil the following objectives: - common application of Community tax legislation; - the protection of national and Community financial interests; - the smooth functioning of the internal market through the combating of tax avoidance and evasion including its international dimension; - the avoidance of distortions of competition; and - the continuing reduction of compliance burdens on administrations and taxable persons alike. | 130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal The Fiscalis 2013 programme is the successor of the Fiscalis 2003-2007 programme. | 141 | Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | Consultation of interested parties | 211 | Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents All participating countries participated in the mid-term evaluation e-survey, while case study visits were conducted in five of them.
Participants in programme events are regularly asked for feedback as part of a built -in monitoring system for the 2007 programme. | 212 | Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account Stakeholders consider the Fiscalis programme highly relevant to the needs of the participating countries and agreed that the Fiscalis programme helps to bring about better cooperation and confidence building between their administrations and officials.
These recommendations have been taken into account when drafting the new proposal. | Collection and use of expertise | 229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 230 | Impact assessment A first policy option, the stopping of the Fiscalis programme, will have an immediate and devastating effect for the Internal Market in general and for the functioning of the tax systems in particular.
The total amount to be borne by the Community’s budget is EUR 156,9 million for the 2008-2013 period.
The 2013 programme will support the tax related systems that are being developed or which are operational at the entry into force of this decision as well as the development of any new tax related systems established under Community legislation.
The EMCS system will be integrated into the 2013 programme as from 2009.
The 2013 programme will continue to encourage Member States to use this type of action, increase their number and improve their quality.
Article 10: Training activities The mid-term evaluation of the 2007 programme confirmed the need to continue to develop common training.
Article 11: Participation in activities under the programme Representatives of international organisations, administrations of third countries, taxable persons and their organisations may take part in activities organised under the programme whenever this is essential to carry out the objectives of the programme.
Article 12: Information sharing The mid-term evaluation of the 2007 programme has confirmed the need to organise in a more structured way information sharing and knowledge exchange between administrations and between administrations and the Commission as well as the consolidation of knowledge created during programme events.
Therefore, the 2013 programme will pay particular attention to information sharing and knowledge management. | 1. 2006/0076 (COD) Proposal for a DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing a Community programme to improve the operation of taxation systems in the internal market (Fiscalis 2013) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[4], Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[5], Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, Whereas: (1) The major objectives for the Community over the next years are to create growth and jobs , as laid down in the re-launch of the Lisbon strategy.
Decision No 888/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 30 March 1998 establishing a programme of Community action to ameliorate the indirect taxation systems of the internal market (Fiscalis programme)[6] (hereinafter "the 2002 programme") and Decision No 2235/2002/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 3 December 2002 adopting a Community programme to improve the operation of taxation systems in the internal market (Fiscalis 2003 – 2007)[7] (hereinafter "the 2007 programme") have significantly contributed to the achievement of those objectives for the periods 1998 to 2002 and 2003 to 2007.
A similar approach should be taken to potential candidate countries. (4) In order to support tax reforms in countries participating in the European Neighbourhood Policy, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility, under certain conditions, of their participation in selected activities of the programme. (5) The trans European computerised secure communication and information exchange systems financed under the 2007 programme play a vital role in reinforcing the taxation systems within the Community and should therefore continue to be financed.
It should remain possible to develop a new type of actions to respond more effectively to the needs. (7) The experience gained from the 2002 and 2007 programmes has indicated that the coordinated development and implementation of a common training programme contributes significantly to the objectives of the programme, in particular in achieving a higher common standard of understanding of Community law.
It is the responsibility of the countries participating in the programme to provide the necessary language training for their officials. (9) It is appropriate to provide the possibility to organise certain activities with the participation of administrations of third countries, representatives of international organisations and taxable persons or their organisations. (10) The mid-term evaluation of the 2007 programme[11] has confirmed the need for organising in a more structured way the information sharing and knowledge exchange between administrations, between administrations and the Commission as well as the consolidation of knowledge created during programme events.
Therefore, particular attention should be paid to information sharing and knowledge management. (11) Although the primary responsibility for achieving the objectives of the 2013 programme rests with the participating countries, Community action is needed for the coordination of such activities as well as for the provision of an infrastructure and the necessary stimulus.
Since the objectives of the measures laid down in this Decision cannot be sufficiently achieved by the participating countries and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the effect of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Article 2 Definitions For the purpose of this Decision the following definitions shall apply: (1) “taxation” means the following taxes applied in the countries participating in the programme: (a) Value Added Tax; (b) Excise duties on alcohol and tobacco products and energy products; (c) Taxes on income and on capital as mentioned in Article 1(2) of Council Directive 77/799/EEC[14]; (d) Taxes on insurance premiums as defined in Article 3 of Council Directive 76/308/EEC[15].
