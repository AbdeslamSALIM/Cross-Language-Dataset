Table 2 in section 5.3 of the full Impact Assessment indicates which specific options are feasible under which of the 'high level' policy options. 5.1.
Option B: a substantially new and comprehensive Postal Directive anticipating a fully competitive postal market in 2009 and providing a fully harmonised approach to all sector issues.
Impact on Consumers: Options A and B, and in the medium term (given the risk of declining sector competitiveness) Option C also, may trigger a lowering of universal service standards as defined at EU level, and consequently this risks a negative impact for consumers, and for territorial and social cohesion.
Specific Policy options Ten specific policy options have been shortlisted covering policy areas of: i) universal service scope, ii) universal service standards, iii) reserved area and universal service financing mechanisms, iv) access to essential means, v) downstream access.
For a description and fuller analysis of all options, see sections 5 and 6 of the full Impact Assessment.

Option 12 would explicitly authorise the National Regulatory Authority to intervene if required to avoid this, and is therefore recommended .
