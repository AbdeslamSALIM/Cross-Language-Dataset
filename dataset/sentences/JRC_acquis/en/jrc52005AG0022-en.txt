The European Economic and Social Committee delivered an opinion on 15 February 2000 [2].
The European Parliament completed its first reading and delivered an opinion on 6 July 2000 [3].
On 4 April 2005, the Council adopted its Common Position as set out in Document 5467/05.
On 25 May 2000, the Council examined the file but was not able to reach agreement on a common position.
Amendments 1, 3, 4, 6 and 8 have been accepted in principle, though redrafted.
New recitals 6 and 9 to 15 have been added, to indicate that a temporary ban is already in force and to clarify the relationship between the phthalates to be banned, the precautionary principle and the risk assessment procedures.
Article 2 has been redrafted to introduce the obligation for the Commission to review these measures within four years from their entry into force.
The Council believes that this will greatly assist towards adopting a permanent ban, subject to a continuous review, leading to an even broader ban, should new scientific evidence arise after its entry into force.
