PROVISIONAL MEASURES (1) By Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92 (2), the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of potassium chloride originating in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine.
As explained in recitals 8 to 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the potassium content (expressed as the percentage of the weight of the dry anhydrous product represented by K2O) of both grades varies.
Each grade has three different specifications: K2O content of 40 % or less, K2O content of between 40 and 62 %, and K2O content of over 62 %.
It is therefore unnecessary to distinguish between the standard and granulated grades in the case of potash with a K2O content of over 62 %.
DUMPING (a) Normal value (7) Since Belarus, Russia and Ukraine are still considered non-market economy countries, normal value had to be calculated in accordance with Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
DUMPING MARGIN (15) The final examination of the facts revealed that potash from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine had been dumped.
The dumping margin is equal to the difference between the normal value and the export price.
The average weighted dumping margin so calculated was 24 % of the total cif value of the exports in question.
INJURY (16) The Commission pointed out in its preliminary conclusions that substantial injury had been caused to Community producers (recitals 24 to 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92).
CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN DUMPING AND INJURY (17) In recitals 34 to 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the Commission pointed out that the increase in the volume of cheaper potash exports from the countries of the former USSR had coincided with growing losses in the Community industry.
The Commission investigation, moreover, did not yield any findings proving or likely to constitute proof that the Community producers' management practices could have contributed to the injury sustained. (18) In the light of the foregoing and the reasons put forward in recitals 34 to 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the Council confirms that dumped imports of potash from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, taken in isolation, have caused serious injury to Community producers.
DUTY (19) The Commission has recalculated the level of duty needed to remove the injury according to the method set out in recital 38 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92.
Since no new arguments have been advanced on this issue, the Commission has concluded that an anti-dumping duty should be adopted in the form of a minimum price. (20) Since the value of the products is related essentially to their K2O content, the minimum price should be calculated definitively for the standard and granulated grades of each of the three specifications according to the method set out in recital 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92.
The Council confirms the Commission's conclusions, contained in recitals 41 to 48 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, that it is in the Community's interest to remove the injury caused by the observed dumping of exports from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, and thus to halt the decline of Community output without denying the exporters concerned access to the Community market.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of potassium chloride (KCl) falling within CN codes 3104 20 10, 3104 20 50 and 3104 20 90, originating in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.
The duty shall be equal to the difference between the minimum prices shown below and the net, free-at-Community-frontier price before customs clearance: - potassium chloride with a K2O content of 40 % or less: - standard grade: ECU 57,95 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 10*10), - granulated grade: ECU 65,76 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 10*20); - potassium chloride with a K2O content of over 40 % but less than or equal to 62 %: - standard grade: ECU 86,93 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 50*10), - granulated grade: ECU 98,65 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 50*20); - potassium chloride with a K2O content of over 62 %: ECU 133,87 per tonne of KCl. 2.
Article 2 The amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92 shall be definitively collected up to the levels resulting from the application of the definitive duties imposed in Article 1 (1).
Article 3 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
