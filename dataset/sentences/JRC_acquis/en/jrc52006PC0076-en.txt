In addition, another Member State has requested that the current EUR 175 monetary threshold should be increased substantially, in order to minimise the administrative burdens on both travellers and Customs authorities and help Customs authorities to focus their efforts on combating large scale smuggling.
In addition, its budgetary impact is negligible/not measurable. | LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | Summary of the proposed action The Commission proposes: to increase the current limit of EUR 175 and to introduce at the same time a distinction between air travellers (EUR 500) and other travellers (EUR 220).
The increase of the EUR 175 threshold to EUR 220 is justified on the ground that it restores its real value at the time the threshold was last agreed (in 1994).
Pursuant to Article 152 of the EC-Treaty a high level of human health protection should be ensured by all Community policies.
to introduce a quantitative limit for beer of 16 litres and increase the quantitative limit for wine from 2 to 4 litres.
In order to provide some consistency for all alcoholic beverages, a quantitative limit for beer of 16 litres and an increase in the quantitative limit for wine from 2 to 4 litres is proposed.
to delete the option for the Member States to exclude goods falling within CN codes 7108 and 7109 from exemption.
Accordingly, it is appropriate to introduce a limit for beer whereas the limits for perfume, coffee and tea should be discontinued. (7) It is appropriate to allow Member States to set lower limits with regard to the monetary threshold for children and to exclude under-aged persons from the exemptions for tobacco products and alcoholic beverages, in order to ensure a high level of health protection. (8) Given the need to promote a high level of human health protection for Community citizens, it is appropriate to allow Member States to apply reduced quantitative limits for the exemption of tobacco products. (9) In order to take account of the special situation of certain people with regard to their location or working environment, it should also be possible for Member States to apply narrower exemptions in the case of frontier workers, persons residing near Community frontiers and the crew of the means of transport used in international travel. (10) For Member States which have not introduced the euro, a mechanism should be set up to enable amounts expressed in national currencies to be converted into euro and thus ensure equal treatment in the Member States. (11) The amount on which Member States are free not to levy taxes on the import of goods should be increased in order to reflect current monetary values. (12) Since the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
The territories referred to in paragraph 1 are the following: (a) Mount Athos; (b) the Canary Islands; (c) the French overseas departments; (d) the Åland Islands; (e) the Channel Islands; (f) the Island of Heligoland; (g) the territory of Buesingen; (h) Ceuta; (i) Melilla; (j) Livigno; (k) Campione d’Italia; (l) the Italian waters of Lake Lugano; (m) Gibraltar; (n) San Marino, only as regards the application of VAT.

Chapter IV GENERAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS Article 15 Member States may choose not to levy VAT or excise duty on the import of goods by a traveller when the amount of the tax which should be levied is equal to, or less than, EUR 10.

Member States may maintain the monetary thresholds in force at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 if, prior to the rounding-off provided for in paragraph 2, conversion of the corresponding amounts expressed in euro would result in a change of less than 5% in the exemption expressed in national currency or in a lowering of this exemption.
