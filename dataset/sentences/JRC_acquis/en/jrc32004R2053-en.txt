Existing measures (1) Following an expiry review, the Council imposed by Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 [2] (the original Regulation), inter alia, definitive anti-dumping duties of 58,6 % on imports of tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings) of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, falling within CN codes ex73079311 (TARIC code 7307931199), ex73079319 (TARIC code 7307931999), ex73079930 (TARIC code 7307993098) and ex73079990 (TARIC code 7307999098) and originating in the People's Republic of China (PRC). 2.
Initiation (6) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 395/2004 [3] (the initiating Regulation) initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of tube or pipe fittings originating in the PRC by imports of tube or pipe fittings consigned from Sri Lanka, whether declared as originating in Sri Lanka or not and pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, directed the customs authorities to register imports of tube or pipe fittings consigned from Sri Lanka, whether declared as originating in Sri Lanka or not, under CN codes ex73079311 (TARIC code 7307931194), ex73079319 (TARIC code 7307931994), ex73079930 (TARIC code 7307993094) and ex73079990 (TARIC code 7307999094) as from 4 March 2004.
Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. (8) No producer or exporter in the PRC submitted a reply to the questionnaire and no reply to the questionnaire was submitted by any importer in the Community.
No producers or exporters in Sri Lanka made themselves known or submitted questionnaire replies. 5.
Investigation period (9) The investigation period covered the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003 (the IP).
Data from 2000 up to the end of the IP were used to investigate the change in the pattern of trade.
General considerations/degree of cooperation (a) Sri Lanka (10) No producers or exporters of tube or pipe fittings originating in Sri Lanka cooperated in the investigation.
It was made clear to importers and to the authorities of Sri Lanka that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Product concerned and like product (13) The product concerned by the alleged circumvention is tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings) of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, currently classifiable within CN codes ex73079311 (TARIC code 7307931194), ex73079319 (TARIC code 7307931994), ex73079930 (TARIC code 7307993094) and ex73079990 (TARIC code 7307999094). (14) In the absence of cooperation by any parties in Sri Lanka and considering the change in the pattern of trade as described in the following section, it must be inferred, in the absence of any contrary evidence, that the tube or pipe fittings exported to the Community from the PRC and those consigned from Sri Lanka have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and have the same uses.
Change in the pattern of trade (15) As stated in recital 4, the change in the pattern of the trade was alleged to stem from transhipment via Sri Lanka. (16) As no Sri Lankan company cooperated in the investigation, exports from Sri Lanka to the Community had to be established on the basis of the facts available, pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
Eurostat data, which were the most appropriate information available, were therefore used to establish the export prices and quantities from Sri Lanka to the Community. (17) Imports of tube or pipe fittings from Sri Lanka increased from 0 tonnes in 2000 to 302 tonnes in the IP.
Imports into the Community of tube or pipe fittings from the PRC increased from 44 tonnes in 2000 to 287 tonnes in the IP.
Indeed, the volume of the Chinese exports in the IP amounted to less than 10 % of the volume exported in the period under consideration in the original investigation.
In particular, for the IP, Sri Lanka held 2,5 % of total import volumes of the product concerned into the Community, whereas the largest exporting country during said year (the Slovak Republic) held 12 %.
In addition, Sri Lanka is the 12th largest exporter of the product concerned to the Community, out of a list of 36 exporting countries. (22) With regard to prices of the products consigned from Sri Lanka and in the absence of cooperation and of any contrary evidence, Eurostat data revealed that average export prices of imports from Sri Lanka during the IP were lower than (i) the average export prices established for the PRC in the previous investigation; and (ii) the prices of the Community industry.
It has been established that prices of imports from Sri Lanka were more than 12 % lower than the Chinese export prices during the IP. (23) On the basis of the above, it is concluded that the change in trade flows, together with the abnormally low prices of exports from Sri Lanka have undermined the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in terms of the quantities and prices of the like products. 6.
Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for like or similar products (24) In order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the product concerned exported to the Community from Sri Lanka during the IP, export prices established on the basis of Eurostat data were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation. (25) Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation requires evidence of dumping in relation to the normal values previously established for the like or similar products.
