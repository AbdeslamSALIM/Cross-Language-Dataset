The programme complies with the data requirements of the "code of conduct on the content and format of stability and convergence programmes". (2) The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages real GDP growth of 5.3 % in 2004 and to stabilise around 5.2 % on average over the rest of the programme period.
Both expenditure and revenue ratios are on a declining trend over the programme period, although the former increases in 2005 as a result of recent budgetary measures.
At the same time, a significant programme of public investment is being implemented, which results in an average general government investment ratio over the programme period of just below 4 % of GDP (equivalent to just below 5 % of GNP).
On the one hand, the forecast of receipts appears to be plausible and the inclusion of contingency provisions in the projections for 2006 and 2007 might point to the possibility of a better than projected outturn.
In the absence of acquisition of non-general government assets by the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), the debt ratio would be falling significantly throughout the programme period. (7) Ireland appears to be in a relatively favourable position with regard to the long-term sustainability of its public finances.
Overall, the economic policies outlined in the update are broadly consistent with the country-specific 2003-2005 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines in the area of public finances, which recommended the Irish authorities to enhance the efficiency of public spending, improve the medium-term budgetary framework and prioritise the infrastructural elements of the National Development Plan. | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | Real GDP(% change) | SP December 2004 | 5,3 | 5,1 | 5,2 | 5,4 | COM | 5,2 | 4,8 | 5,0 | n.a. | SP December 2003 | 3,3 | 4,7 | 5,2 | n.a. | HICP inflation(%) | SP December 2004 | 2,3 | 2,1 | 2,0 | 1,9 | COM Oct 2004 | 2,3 | 2,4 | 2,4 | n.a. | SP December 2003 | 2,3 | 2,0 | 2,0 | n.a. | General government balance(% of GDP) | SP December 2004 | 0,9 | -0,8 | -0,6 | -0,6 | COM Oct 2004 | -0,2 | -0,6 | -0,5 | n.a. | SP December 2003 | -1,1 | -1,4 | -1,1 | n.a. | Primary balance(% of GDP) | SP December 2004 | 2,1 | 0,6 | 0,6 | 0,7 | COM Oct 2004 | 1,2 | 0,7 | 0,8 | n.a. | SP December 2003 | 0,3 | 0,1 | 0,3 | n.a. | Cyclically-adjusted balance(% of GDP) | SP December 2004 | 1,2 | -0,2 | 0,1 | 0,0 | COM Oct 2004 | 0,1 | 0,0 | 0,3 | n.a. | SP December 20031 | -0,7 | -0,8 | -0,5 | n.a. | Government gross debt(% of GDP) | SP December 2004 | 30,5 | 30,1 | 30,1 | 30,0 | COM Oct 2004 | 30,7 | 30,7 | 30,6 | n.a. | SP December 2003 | 33,3 | 33,5 | 33,3 | n.a. | [1] OJ L 209, 2.8.1997, p. 1. --------------------------------------------------
