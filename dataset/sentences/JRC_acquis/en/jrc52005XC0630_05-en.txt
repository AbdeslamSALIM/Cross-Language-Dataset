Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain plastic sacks and bags originating in the People's Republic of China, Malaysia and Thailand (2005/C 159/07) The Commission has received a complaint pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [1] ("the basic Regulation"), alleging that imports of certain plastic sacks and bags, originating in the People's Republic of China, Malaysia and Thailand ("the countries concerned"), are being dumped and are thereby causing material injury to the Community industry. 1.
Complaint The complaint was lodged on 17 May 2005 by thirty European producers of certain plastic sacks and bags ("the complainant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Community production of those plastic sacks and bags. 2.
Product The product allegedly being dumped is certain plastic sacks and bags containing at least 20 % of polyethylene and of a thickness not exceeding 100 micrometres originating in the People's Republic of China, Malaysia and Thailand ("the product concerned"), normally declared within CN codes ex39232100, ex39232910 and ex39232990.
Procedure Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that the complaint has been lodged by or on behalf of the Community industry and that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission hereby initiates an investigation pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. 5.1.

Non-cooperation In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated. 9.
It is a confidential document pursuant to Article 19 of the basic Regulation and Article 6 of the WTO Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the GATT 1994 (Anti-Dumping Agreement). --------------------------------------------------
