Before the Commission could take a decision, the measures in question were included in the programme act of 2 August 2002. (2) On 19 March 2003 the Commission decided [2] to initiate the formal investigation procedure provided for in Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [3] against particular aspects of the programme act of 2 August 2002 (with the dossier now registered under the new number C 20/2003) and to approve the remainder of the provisions of the programme act for the maritime transport sector. (3) By Royal Decree of 7 May 2003 the Belgian authorities implemented all the provisions of the programme act for the maritime sector (Articles 115 to 127 of the said programme act), specifying in the preamble to the Royal Decree that the decree provided "no legal basis to taxpayers for claiming vis-à-vis the tax administration or before the national courts the application of the fiscal aid measures whose compatibility is being investigated by the Commission" in accordance with the Commission's decision of 19 March 2003. (4) By letter of 7 May 2003 the Belgian authorities submitted their comments on the Commission's decision of 19 March 2003. (5) By letter of 26 June 2003 the Commission put a number of additional questions to the Belgian authorities.
After the Commission had sent a reminder on 18 August 2003, the Belgian authorities replied by letter of 12 September 2003. (6) On 17 January 2004 new Community guidelines on State aid to maritime transport were published in the Official Journal of the European Union [4].
Title of the aid (7) This decision concerns the tax measures for maritime transport contained in the programme act of 2 August 2002, Title V — Finance, Chapter I — Maritime navigation. 1.3.
Recipient of the aid (8) The beneficiaries of the various aid schemes are undertakings established in Belgium that are engaged in maritime transport, exploitation of maritime resources and towage. 1.4.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AID (10) The programme act provides for a series of tax measures for maritime transport in Belgium: - a flat-rate taxation scheme based on shipping company tonnage, - a package of measures designed to benefit shipping companies that did not opt for flat-rate taxation based on tonnage, including accelerated depreciation of ships, relief from tax on capital gains resulting from the sale of ships subject to reinvestment conditions, and tax deductions for the purchase of ships, - abolition of registration duties payable for the registration of mortgages on ships, - a flat-rate taxation scheme based on tonnage for persons managing ships on behalf of third parties that provide services on behalf of shipowners. (11) Under the tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme [5] the tax base used to calculate corporation tax for shipping companies that have opted for this scheme is replaced by a flat-rate amount determined on the basis of the tonnage of the fleet concerned.
Flat-rate taxation scheme (13) Ships may be eligible under the flat-rate taxation scheme if they are used for the following eligible activities: - operating a ship for the carriage of goods or passengers by international maritime transport and for the exploration or exploitation of natural maritime resources, - profits accruing from operating a ship, with clearance certificate, for towage, assistance and other activities at sea, - all activities directly connected with the abovementioned operation. (14) By letter of 5 September 2002 the Belgian authorities pointed out that activities of the fishery sector could not be eligible. (15) The amount of corporation tax for shipping companies [6] that have opted for this scheme is fixed at a flat rate on the basis of the net tonnage of their eligible ships.
Article 119(2) of the programme act provides that taxable profits determined on a flat-rate basis in accordance with the above rates are reduced to: - 50 % of the flat rate per day for ships that are less than five years old, to be counted from the date of delivery; - 75 % of the flat rate per day for ships that are at least five years old but less than 10 years old, to be counted from the date of delivery. (18) The age of a ship is determined on the basis of the date of delivery as fixed by the registrar of maritime and inland waterway ships' mortgages or the competent registration authority. (19) Under Article 120(2) of the programme act, losses sustained in previous financial years may not be deducted from the tax base determined on a flat-rate basis.
Tax measures for shipping companies that have not opted for the flat-rate taxation scheme (20) For all tax periods in which a shipping company has not been subject to flat-rate taxation, it may benefit from three types of tax concessions which derogate from the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992. 2.2.1. (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) [8] (21) Ships acquired new or second-hand which become the property of a Belgian taxpayer for the first time, parts of such ships and expenses incurred for major repairs and alterations carried out when acquiring second-hand ships may be depreciated as follows: - 20 % for the accounting year when the ship is taken into service; - 15 % for each of the next two accounting years; - 10 % for each subsequent accounting year until full depreciation. (22) Depreciation shortfalls during the first three accounting years, counting from that in which the ship is taken into service, may be recovered during taxable periods following that in which the shortfall occurred, even beyond the depreciation period, provided that the total annual amount of depreciation per ship in no case exceeds 20 % of the investment value. (23) Ships thus depreciated may not benefit from the digressive depreciation scheme provided for in Article 64 of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992. (24) Ships that are not acquired new and do not become the property of a Belgian taxpayer for the first time may nevertheless be depreciated linearly over the normal length of use. (25) The special depreciation scheme provided for in the programme act lays down in legislation an administrative measure which has already been applied in Belgium for several decades.
If the investment taken into account for re-investment has been replaced in this way, the same rules on gains shall apply for the disposal of the asset acquired as a replacement. (29) In the event of a sale after the end of the period in which the tax base is determined in relation to tonnage, for the calculation of gains, the net tax value shall be established on the basis of the normal rules on depreciation, including for the period in which profits from shipping are determined in relation to tonnage. 2.2.3. (1) (2) (3) (4) [11] (30) Resident companies or Belgian branches of non-resident companies which exclusively engage in eligible activities [12] may benefit from an investment deduction of 30 % of the purchase price when buying new or second-hand ships which become the property of a Belgian taxpayer for the first time. (31) A tax deduction not granted because of a lack of profit or because of insufficient profits in the corresponding accounting year shall be successively carried forward to the profits of subsequent taxable periods.
Reduction of registration duties for mortgages on ships (32) The Belgian Code on registration, mortgage and court registry duties is amended so that the raising of mortgages on a ship is no longer subject to the payment of proportional registration duties, irrespective of whether the ship is or is not subsequently subject to the flat-rate taxation scheme.
This reduction of registration duties concerns mortgages on vessels for maritime shipping and those for inland waterway navigation. (33) Under the current Belgian scheme, the charges made for registering a mortgage (in addition to a number of very limited fixed duties) are, on the one hand, a 0,052 % fee payable to the registrar of mortgages and, on the other hand, a 0,5 % registration duty payable on the amount of the mortgage.
According to the Belgian authorities, this latter duty is a disincentive for registering ships under the Belgian flag.
Under the new scheme, the registration duty payable on registering a mortgage is changed to the general fixed duty of €25 provided for in Article 11(2) and (3) of the Belgian Code on registration, mortgage and court registry duties. (34) The transfer of a mortgage on a vessel following debt transfer against payment, contractual subrogation or any other agreement against payment is also subject to 0.5 % registration duty in accordance with Article 92(2) [13] of the said Code.
In accordance with Article 93 of the Code, this registration duty is paid from the amount of the sums guaranteed by the mortgage, excluding interests or arrears over the three years guaranteed by Article 87 of the Mortgages Act of 16 December 1951. 2.2.5.
Tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme applicable to persons managing ships on behalf of third parties [14]. (35) Under Article 124 of the programme act, persons managing ships on behalf of third parties are also covered by a flat-rate taxation scheme but with a scale of rates ten times more advantageous than that provided for in the scheme applicable to shipping companies because the same rates apply in this case to the ships being managed not per 100 NT tranche but per 1000 NT tranche: (EUR per 1000 NT) | Up to 1000 net tonnes | 1,00 | Between 1001 and 10000 net tonnes | 0,60 | Between 10001 and 20000 net tonnes | 0,40 | Between 20001 and 40000 net tonnes | 0,20 | 40001 net tonnes and over | 0,05 | (36) However, coverage by the scheme is subject to the condition that at least 75 % of the ships managed are registered under the Belgian flag. (37) Those managing ships on behalf of third parties are in general service companies which prepare the ships, fit them out as required and provide crews on behalf of the shipowner.
Other aid for maritime transport (38) Maritime transport in Belgium also benefits from three other aid schemes: - the scheme for exemption from the payment of employers' social security contributions and partial exemption from the payment of employed persons' contributions (approved by the Commission by decisions of 24 February 1998 [15] and 23 June 1999 [16]); - the scheme for exemption from the advance payment on earnings (approved by the Commission by decision of 27 June 2000 [17]). 2.4.
Rates for ships over 40000 tonnes (40) While the Community guidelines allow such a rate in principle, the Commission has considered whether introducing a EUR 0,05 rate per tranche of 100 tonnes above 40000 tonnes could lead to a distortion of intra-Community competition as none of the flat-rate taxation schemes previously approved by the Commission make provision for such advantageous rates for ships exceeding this tonnage. (41) The following table shows, for the flat-rate taxation schemes already approved by the Commission, the rates for the determination of the tax base which is itself subject to the corporation tax rate.
Table 1: Rates for determining the tax base in flat-rate taxation schemes of particular Member States Source: Commission Rates in euros per tranche of 100 tonnes and per day | | NL | DE | DK | UK | ES | IE | FI | FR | 0-1000 NT | 0,91 | 0,92 | 0,94 | 0,97 | 0,9 | 1 | 1,38 | 0,93 | up to 10000 NT | 0,67 | 0,69 | 0,67 | 0,73 | 0,7 | 0,75 | 1,03 | 0,71 | up to 25000 NT | 0,46 | 0,46 | 0,4 | 0,48 | 0,4 | 0,5 | 0,69 | 0,47 | above 25000 NT | 0,23 | 0,23 | 0,27 | 0,24 | 0,2 | 0,25 | 0,57 | 0,24 | (42) Accordingly, by letter of 30 October 2002 the Commission asked Belgium to provide all the information and arguments that may justify the EUR 0,05 rate for ships over 40000 tonnes, bearing in mind that the rates which the Commission had previously accepted for recent flat-rate taxation schemes in other Member States range from EUR 0,20 to EUR 0,25 for the highest tonnages. (43) In their letter of 5 December 2002, the Belgian authorities provided the following information to justify the introduction of a specific rate for ships over 40000 tonnes.
Even though this type of ship represents only 4,5 % of the world fleet in terms of number of vessels, it accounts for 34,17 % in terms of carrying capacity [18]. (44) Only 143 of these ships, i.e. 0,5 % of the world’s fleet in number of vessels and 3,5 % in capacity, are registered in a Member State, as shown in the following table supplied by the Belgian authorities.
This is why the Commission has initiated the investigation procedure in respect of the introduction of the EUR 0,05 rate per tranche of 100 net tonnes applicable to ships over 40000 tonnes. 2.4.1.2.
In their letter of 5 December 2002, the Belgian authorities provided a list of eligible activities, for some of which the Commission has had strong doubts as to whether they have a direct link with transport, namely: - ancillary and temporary activities carried out by the company in order to make full use of the personnel and assets assigned to the company’s principal activity, to the extent that these activities are minimal compared with that principal activity, - sale of products not intended for consumption on board such as luxury goods and provision of services not directly linked with maritime transport such as gambling, gaming tables and casinos and excursions for passengers, - advertising and marketing, - revenue from short-term investment of operating capital, excluding, however, revenue from financial fixed assets, - ship brokerage activities for its own ships, - disposal of operating assets such as immovable property which serves management purposes and operating resources used to load and unload ships operated. (48) The Commission considers that such ancillary activities are not directly connected with maritime transport and do not directly contribute to providing a transport service. (49) In this case, the Commission therefore expressed doubts in its decision of 19 March 2003 as to whether the extension of the flat-rate taxation scheme to the abovementioned activities is compatible with the common market. 2.4.1.3.
Deduction from the flat-rate tax of losses suffered by other divisions not subject to the flat-rate taxation scheme (50) (1) [19].
Article 120(1) provides for the possibility for companies simultaneously engaged in eligible and non-eligible activities to deduct from the tax determined at a flat-rate on the basis of tonnage any losses incurred by other company divisions to the extent that such losses could not be deducted from the profits of any other division for the relevant accounting year. (51) The Commission has taken the view that this rule was in conflict with the general principle that eligible activities should be strictly separated from non-eligible activities for the determination of tax, a principle which has been observed in the other flat-rate taxation schemes already approved. (52) Consequently, the Commission has expressed its doubt on the advantage that would thus be granted to shipping companies subject to Belgian tax and has sought the views of the other Member States and of any other interested party on the possible consequences which this provision might have for competition.
Moreover, this provision would lead to a distinctly lower flat-rate tax for ships less than 10 years old than would have been the case for these ships in other Member States that have introduced a flat-rate taxation scheme approved by the Commission. (55) For this reason, the Commission has initiated the formal investigation procedure with regard to the deductions provided for in Article 119(2) of the programme act for ships less than 10 years old. 2.4.2.
In its decision of 19 March 2003, the Commission therefore expressed doubts about the compatibility of this depreciation scheme as regards its application to ships other than those intended for maritime transport and those carrying out eligible activities. 2.4.2.2.
The said regulation does not allow the grant of such aid. (59) In its decision of 19 March 2003 the Commission therefore expressed doubts that the reduction of registration duty for ships other than those intended for maritime transport activities is compatible with the common market. 2.4.2.3.
Comments from the Union Royale des Armateurs Belges (67) By letter of 26 August 2003 the Union Royale des Armateurs Belges (hereinafter referred to as the Union Royale), a non-profit-making association of Belgian shipowners, transmitted to the Commission its comments on all the points covered by the formal investigation procedure. (68) The Union Royale first of all emphasises that the low rate applicable to the tranche above 40000 tonnes is designed to bring ships above this tonnage back under a Community flag, recalling that these ships represent only 4,5 % of the world fleet (1257 units of a total number of 28155 units worldwide) but account for 34,17 % of worldwide carrying capacity (253430610 of a total of 741600000 tonnes deadweight). (69) With regard to the tax deduction for newer ships (50 % for ships less than five years old and 25 % for those between five and ten years old), the Union Royale stresses that it is primarily intended to promote young fleets with safer and more environmentally friendly ships.
It adds that these reductions may also contribute to maintaining attractive and high-quality jobs in the maritime sector and on shore and maintaining maritime know-how in Europe. (70) According to the Union Royale, prohibiting the possibility for a maritime shipping company to deduct losses incurred in its other divisions from the flat-rate tax would lead to discrimination among Belgian companies as companies that do not have a maritime division may offset the losses of the year incurred in particular divisions against profits from other divisions whereas such losses cannot be deducted from profits based on tonnage. (71) With regard to the list of ancillary activities on which the Commission has expressed doubts, the Union Royale points out that the Belgian Government took its cue from the OECD's commentary and tonnage tax schemes in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.
It emphasises in particular that ship brokerage activities performed for a company's own ships are perfectly consistent with the spirit of the Community guidelines. (72) With regard to the scheme for accelerated depreciation of ships, the Union Royale notes that it was in fact the Union Royale itself which had asked the Belgian Government to confirm through legislation a tax scheme which, it argues, already existed before the entry into force of the Treaty in order to enhance legal certainty with regard to this scheme. (73) With regard to the reduction of registration duties for registering mortgages on ships other than those intended for maritime transport activities, the Union Royale points out that this tax does not exist in most of the other Member States.
The Union Royale further stresses that the measure would help to improve the competitive position of the inland shipping sector. (74) With regard to the management of ships on behalf of third parties, the Union Royale emphasises that the proposed scheme requires that at least 75 % of the ships managed fly the Belgian flag.
Comments from the Zentralverband der Deutschen Seehafenbetriebe (75) By letter of 3 July 2003, the Zentralverband der Deutschen Seehafenbetriebe (Federation of German sea port companies, hereinafter referred to as the Federation) transmitted its comments to the Commission.
Comments from the Handelskammer Hamburg (77) By letter of 18 July 2003, the Handelskammer Hamburg (Hamburg Chamber of Commerce) transmitted its comments to the Commission as the representative of the Hamburg economy and its companies. (78) The Handelskammer Hamburg is concerned that the Belgian tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme distorts competition not only between towage companies but also between the ports of northern Europe.
Comments from Bugsier (79) By letter of 2 June 2003, the Bugsier company (Bugsier Rederei- und Bergungs-Gesellsschaft mbH) transmitted to the Commission its comments as an interested party, asking that all its letters sent to the Commission between 2000 and 2003 be taken into account.
COMMENTS FROM BELGIUM (80) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, the Commission has sent the following documents to the Belgian authorities for its comments: - the comments from the Zentralverband der Deutschen Seehafenbetriebe by letter of 7 August 2003, - the comments from the Handelskammer Hamburg by letter of 7 August 2003; - the comments from Bugsier Rederei- und Bergungs-Gesellschaft mbH by letter of 7 August 2003, - the comments from the Union Royale des Armateurs Belges by letter of 17 September 2003. (81) The Commission has not received any observations from the Belgian authorities on the comments transmitted. (82) By letter of 7 May 2003, the Belgian authorities transmitted to the Commission their observations on the Commission's decision of 19 March 2003 to initiate the formal investigation procedure with regard to certain aspects of the planned fiscal measures for maritime transport. 4.1.
Low rate beyond 40000 tonnes for the flat-taxation scheme [23] (83) In its decision of 19 March 2003, the Commission considered whether the introduction of a EUR 0,05 rate per tranche of 100 tonnes above 40000 tonnes could, even though not prohibited by the Community guidelines on aid to maritime transport [24], lead to a distortion of intra-Community competition.
None of the flat-rate taxation schemes previously approved by the Commission have laid down measures that are equally favourable for ships over 40000 tonnes.
The Belgian authorities also note that the purpose of this measure is not to distort intra-Community competition but to promote the return under the Belgian flag of ships over 40000 tonnes. (85) The Belgian authorities recall that ships of more than 40000 tonnes represent only 4,5 % of the world fleet, namely 1257 units.
Only 143 of them are registered in the Community, or 11,38 %.
Most of these (108 ships or 75,52 % of the "European" fleet over 40000 tonnes) are registered in Greece.
Taking account of the small number of ships involved, the Belgian authorities assume that the other Member States have hitherto not introduced specific measures for this type of ship. (86) Nevertheless, Belgium has wished to attract large-capacity ships to its flag by granting a rate that is, among other things, adapted to their specific features.
Application of the flat-rate taxation scheme to profits from particular activities without a direct link with transport activities (89) In compiling the list of eligible activities included in the reply which it sent to the Commission on 5 December 2002, Belgium referred to the following: - the OECD commentary on the model convention with respect to taxes on income and on capital, and in particular the comments concerning Article 8 on shipping and air transport, - the tonnage tax schemes established by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, approved by the Commission by decisions of 20 March 1996 and 2 August 2000. (90) As the list of eligible activities is based on certain existing schemes, the Belgian authorities consider that the Commission ought to treat them in the same way as it has done for the other Member States. (91) Specifically, the Belgian authorities note that for the connected and temporary activities which a company pursues in order to make full use of the personnel and assets assigned to the company's principal activity, if these activities are minimal compared with that principal activity, the text has been modelled on the tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme of the United Kingdom [25]. (92) With regard to the sale of products not intended for consumption on board such as luxury articles and the provision of services not directly linked with maritime transport such as gambling, gaming tables and casinos and excursions for passengers, the Belgian authorities argue that the description of the measure has likewise been modelled on the tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme of the United Kingdom. [26]. (94) With regard to revenue from short-term investment of operating capital, ship brokerage [27] for the company's own ships and the disposal of operating assets such as immovable property for management purposes and operating facilities for loading and unloading ships, the Belgian authorities have based their arguments on the explanatory memorandum [28] pertaining to the Dutch tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme [29]. 4.1.3.
The Belgian authorities maintain that these arguments are contrary to reality and are without foundation and they refer to an extract from the Review of Maritime Transport of 2002 [30] which they enclosed with their letter of 7 May 2003. 4.2.
Scheme for accelerated depreciation (100) According to the Belgian authorities, the accelerated depreciation scheme was set up in 1951 and has already undergone several amendments, most recently in 1996.
Scheme applicable to managers acting on behalf of third parties [31] (104) In response to the observations made by the Commission in the decision of 19 March 2003, the Belgian authorities indicate, referring to the explanatory memorandum to the draft for the programme act, that the flat-rate taxation scheme was established in order to make the technical management of ships more competitive and to make it possible to make crews available on the basis of a management contract.
The programme act provides that at least 75 % of ships managed must be registered in the Belgian register of ships.
For the above reasons, the various measures in question which are the subject of the formal investigation procedure constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. (109) The scheme for accelerated depreciation of ships, offering depreciation rules that are even more generous than those provided for in Articles 61 to 64 of the Belgian Income Tax Code 1992, is specific in that it applies only to a limited category of assets.
The Belgian authorities have not supplied any information to show that this registration duty is a unique case in the Community and that none of the other Member States have an equivalent tax on the registration of a mortgage on a ship. (111) The Commission notes that this registration duty is paid for mortgages taken out on immovable property and that the scheme in question is not confined to ships, whether used for maritime transport or inland navigation.
It is therefore aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. (114) Moreover, the Commission notes that it was already established in the decision of 19 March 2003 that it is tantamount to aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.
In fact, the Belgian authorities have not disputed this evaluation in the comments they submitted on the said decision. (115) As a general rule, the Commission considers that the aid subject to the formal investigation procedure is unlawful as there is no longer any legal or administrative impediment to its implementation following the promulgation of the Royal Decree of 7 May 2003, even though no advantages have as yet been granted in practice.
The Commission considers Article 87(3)(c) as the appropriate legal basis applicable in the case under scrutiny. (117) Aid for the maritime sector should be examined in particular in the light of the Community guidelines on State aid for maritime transport.
This view has been called into question by various interested parties even though they were not invited in the decision of 19 March 2003 to comment on this aspect of the programme act.
Rates for ships over 40000 tonnes (121) First of all, the Commission notes that the Belgian authorities have given a commitment not to apply the EUR 0,05 rate so long as the Commission has not ruled on its compatibility with the common market following the outcome of the formal investigation procedure.
Moreover, the Commission does not have sufficient experience with these schemes to know whether the rates have been sufficiently attractive to encourage shipowners to bring large-tonnage ships such as those covered by the EUR 0,05 rate back from the flag of a third country to a Community flag. (123) The Commission considers incompatible with the common market the plan of the Belgian authorities to apply the special EUR 0,05 rate for ships over 40000 tonnes also to ships already flying the flag of a Member State.
Such a condition would make it possible to attain the objective laid down in the Community guidelines to transfer ships controlled by Community shipowners and registered under the flag of a third country to Community ships' registers without running the risk of adversely affecting intra-Community trade. (125) Accordingly, the Commission considers the introduction of a EUR 0,05 rate per tranche of 100 tonnes above 40000 tonnes, such as provided for in Article 119(1) of the programme act of 2 August 2002, as compatible with the common market provided that the ships concerned are new or else have been registered for at least the last five years under a non-Community flag.
As the Belgian authorities pointed out in their letter of 7 May 2003, Belgium took as the basis for this indicative list the OECD model tax convention on income and on capital and the tonnage tax schemes established by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. (127) The Commission notes that the list of activities in respect of which the procedure was instituted includes income-generating activities – for which the question whether these activities are eligible or not is completely relevant – and activities which only generate costs for shipowners, for which this question does not appear to be relevant.
However, if advertising and marketing are ancillary activities for the shipping company that are not directly linked with its maritime transport services, the Commission takes the view that they cannot be considered eligible. 5.3.2.4.
If the financial products hail from exceptional assets of the shipping company or if they relate to long-term investment or originate from resources generated by ineligible activities, the Commission is of the opinion that the latter cannot be eligible under the flat-rate taxation scheme. (141) The Commission therefore considers that including short-term investment revenue from operating capital is compatible with the common market if such revenue relates to financial products from the shipping company’s normal working capital from eligible activities. 5.3.2.5.
Consequently, the situation described by the Union Royale could not arise. (155) The Commission deems it necessary to maintain a strict separation between the accounts for eligible and ineligible activities and therefore considers the provisions of Article 120(2) of the programme act, under which any losses suffered by other divisions that are normally taxed may be deducted from tax determined on a flat-rate basis as incompatible with the common market. 5.3.4.
Deductions for ships more than 10 years old (156) The Commission notes that the Belgian authorities intend to favour newer ships in order to foster the development of a safer and more environmentally friendly fleet.
Nevertheless, it notes that none of the tonnage-based flat-rate taxation schemes implemented by other Member States and approved by the Commission comprise specific rates varying according to the ship’s age. (157) Moreover, the Commission notes that while the nominal rates fixed by Belgium make the level of taxation comparable with schemes of other Member States which the Commission has previously approved, this is no longer the case if 25 % or 50 % reductions are applied to the newest ships.
However, the scheme in question is "existing aid" within the meaning of Article 1(b) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (163) Outside maritime transport the various Community rules applicable to the various sectors to which this reduction of registration tax may apply, such as fisheries [39] and inland shipping [40], do not permit the grant of such aid. (164) The Commission considers that the Decision of 19 March 2003 initiating the formal investigation procedure also serves as an invitation to Belgium to submit its comments under Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (165) Taking account of the unjustified advantage which this scheme gives ships not engaged in eligible activities, the Commission deems it necessary to make proposals for appropriate measures in this case, in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999.
By the present decision, the Commission therefore proposes that Belgium take the following appropriate measures: before 30 June 2005, Belgium should abolish the special option scheme applicable to depreciations, as provided for by Article 121 of the programme act, in respect of all ships not engaged in eligible activities.
Before 31 December 2004, Belgium should inform the Commission of its decision to abide by the said appropriate measures. 5.4.2.
Reduction of registration duty on mortgages on ships not intended for maritime transport (166) As in the case of the measure just examined, the Commission notes that outside maritime transport the various Community rules applicable to the various sectors to which this reduction registration tax may apply, such as fisheries [41] and inland shipping, do not permit the grant of such aid. (167) While such investment aid may be accepted in the framework of the Community guidelines, as the Commission noted in its decision of 19 March 2003, this does not apply in respect of ships which by their nature are not intended to be used in maritime transport (tugs, dredgers, vessels for inland shipping, etc.).
Accordingly, the Commission considers that the reduction of or the exemption from the payment of registration duty on mortgages on ships not intended for maritime transport is State aid incompatible with the common market. 5.4.3.
Flat-rate taxation scheme for persons managing ships on behalf of third parties (168) The Commission notes that no interested party apart from the Union Royale des Armateurs Belges has submitted comments on the scheme for ship managers, even though it was covered by the formal investigation procedure initiated on 19 March 2003. (169) The Commission wonders whether persons managing ships on behalf of third parties engage in a maritime transport activity.
His activity can therefore not be treated as a transport service. (170) The new Community guidelines published on 17 January 2004 on aid to maritime transport provide that ship management companies may receive aid for the ships for which they are responsible for crew management and overall technical management [42].
According to the example provided by the Belgian authorities, there is a 1:100 ratio between a ship manager's and a shipowner's turnover for a ship of the Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) type.
In the absence of such a study, the Commission takes the view that on the basis of the information currently at its disposal it cannot accept a 1:10 ratio in the taxation rates on the basis of tonnage between shipowners and ship managers. (172) In view of the above and of the information available, the Commission believes that a flat-rate taxation scheme for persons managing ships on behalf of third parties, with taxation based on the tonnage of the fleet managed, is compatible with the common market if the rates relating to tonnage are the same as those applicable to shipping transport companies and if the managers in question are at the same time responsible for crew management and technical management of ships, in accordance with the requirements of the Community guidelines published on 17 January 2004 on aid to maritime transport. 6.
CONCLUSIONS (173) In conclusion, the Commission considers with regard to the flat-rate taxation scheme for shipowners as provided for in the programme act of 2 August 2002 that: (a) the introduction of the EUR 0,05 rate per tranche of 100 tonnes above 40000 tonnes (Article 119(1) of the programme act) is compatible with the common market, provided that the ships concerned are new or else have been registered at least for the past five years under a non-Community flag; (b) inclusion in the flat-rate taxation scheme of revenue from the following activities (Article 115(2) of the programme act) is incompatible with the common market: - ancillary and temporary activities, - the sale of products not intended for consumption on board such as luxury articles, and the provision of services not directly connected with maritime transport such as gambling, gaming tables and casinos and excursions for passengers, - short-term investment of operating capital if it does not correspond to revenue from the company's normal cash resources accruing from eligible activities [44], - advertising and marketing provided that they do not relate to the sale of advertising space on board eligible ships, - ship brokerage activities for ships of third parties, - disposal of operating assets if by their nature they are not intended for maritime transport. (c) inclusion in the flat-rate taxation scheme of revenue from the following activities (Article 115(2) of the programme act) is compatible with the common market: - short-term investment of operating capital if it corresponds to revenue from the company's normal cash resources accruing from eligible activities [45], - advertising and marketing provided that they relate to the sale of advertising space on board eligible ships, - ship brokerage activities for the company's own ships, - disposal of operating assets if by their nature they are intended for maritime transport. (d) deduction, from taxation determined on a flat-rate basis in relation to tonnage, of the losses of other divisions which for the relevant accounting year could not be deducted from profits of any of the company's other divisions (Article 120(1) of the programme act) is incompatible with the common market; (e) the reduced rates used to calculate the flat-rate tax on ships less than ten years old (Article 119(2) of the programme act) are incompatible with the common market. (174) With regard to the tax measures outside the flat-rate taxation scheme for shipowners, the Commission considers that the following are incompatible with the common market: - the special depreciation mechanism provided for in Article 121 of the programme act for all ships not used for eligible activities, - reductions, for ships not intended for maritime shipping, of the registration tax on mortgages on ships not intended for maritime transport. (175) On the basis of the information at its disposal alone, the Commission cannot consider as compatible with the common market the flat-rate taxation scheme for persons managing ships on behalf of third parties as provided for in Article 124 of the programme act.
Article 2 The introduction in the flat-rate taxation scheme for shipowners of a rate reduced to EUR 0,05 per 100 tonnes for the tranche above 40000 tonnes is compatible with the common market, provided that the ships over 40000 tonnes to which this reduced rate is applied are new or have been registered under the flag of a third country during the five years preceding their entry into the flat-rate taxation scheme.
Their inclusion in the flat-rate taxation scheme for shipowners is incompatible with the common market. 2.
Article 4 Deduction of losses of other divisions of a company liable for taxation that are not subject to the flat-rate tax from the tonnage-based flat-rate tax for ship owners is incompatible with the common market.
Article 5 Reductions of tax rates of flat-rate taxation for shipowners in respect of ships less than 10 years old are incompatible with the common market.
Article 6 Application of the scheme for the accelerated depreciation of ships to ships that by their nature are not intended for maritime transport is incompatible with the common market.
As appropriate measures, it is proposed that Belgium abolish the special option scheme applicable to the depreciation of ships not intended by their nature for maritime transport before 30 June 2005.
Before 31 December 2004 Belgium shall inform the Commission of its decision to adopt the said appropriate measures.
Article 7 Reduction of or exemption from the payment of the registration duty on mortgages on ships which by their nature are not intended for maritime transport is incompatible with the common market.
Article 8 The tonnage-based flat-rate taxation scheme for persons managing ships on behalf of third parties is compatible with the common market provided that the latter are simultaneously responsible for the management of crews and the technical management of ships, in accordance with the provisions of the Community guidelines in force on aid for maritime transport and provided that the tonnage-related rates are the same as those applicable to maritime transport companies.
Article 9 Within two months of the notification of this decision, Belgium shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to ensure that the programme act of 2 August 2002 is in conformity with the present decision and, where appropriate, recover incompatible aid granted illegally under the said programme act.
Interest shall be calculated in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 794/2004 [46], in particular Articles 9, 10 and 11 thereof.
