Krystallidis, lawyer] Defendant(s): Commission of the European Communities Form of order sought - The annulment of the Commission Decision of 2 May 2005 received by the Applicants on 31 May 2005 refusing to open an in-depth investigation of the costs and revenues of AIA SA related to the provision of passenger security services, passenger terminal facilities and car parking services in order to establish whether the charges levied by the Athens International Airport SA constitute an abuse of a dominant position; - an order that the costs of, and occasioned by these proceedings be borne by the Respondent.
The applicants invoke an error of law and a manifest error in the appreciation of facts in so far as the Commission considered that the passenger security controls do not constitute an economic activity within the meaning of Article 82 EC and that the car parking services do not constitute a relevant market.
Finally, the applicants invoke a violation of Article 253 EC in that the Commission did not indicate the costs and revenues of Athens International Airport of Spata on which it based its conclusion that Athens International Airport of Spata does not engage in excessive pricing.
