Article 4 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
Done at Brussels, 30 October 1990.
the %quot%H'' point and the %quot%R'' point and their relationship, 2.1.2.
The %quot%H'' point is located in the centre of the centreline of the device which is between the %quot%H'' point sight buttons on either side of the 3 DH machine.
Data presentation For each seating position where reference data are required in order to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of the present Directive, all or an appropriate selection of the following data shall be presented in the form indicated in Appendix 3 to this Annex: 3.1.1.
the coordinates of the %quot%R'' point relative to the three-dimensional reference system; 3.1.2.
The coordinates of the %quot%H'' point and the value of the actual torso angle obtained by the procedure set out in item 4 below shall be compared, respectively, with the coordinates of the %quot%R'' point and the value of the design torso angle indicated by the vehicle manufacturer. 3.2.2.
The vehicle shall be preconditioned at the manufacturer's discretion, at a temperature of 20 ± 10 gC to ensure that the seat material reaches room temperature.
If the seat to be checked has never been sat upon, a 70 to 80 kg person or device shall sit on the seat twice for one minute to flex the cushion and back.
At the manufacturer's request, all seat assemblies shall remain unloaded for a minimum period of 30 minutes prior to installation of the 3 DH machine. 4.2.
A line through the %quot%H'' point sight buttons shall be parallel to the ground and perpendicular to the longitudinal centreplane of the seat. 4.7.
Where possible the left foot shall be located approximately the same distance to the left of the centreplane of the 3 DH machine as the right foot is to the right.
The spirit level verifying the transverse orientation of the 3 DH machine is brought to the horizontal by readjustment of the seat pan if necessary, or by adjusting the leg and foot assemblies towards the rear.
The line passing through the %quot%H'' point sight buttons shall be maintained perpendicular to the longitudinal centreplane of the seat. 4.7.1.2.
Tilt the back pan forward against the forward stop and draw the 3 DH machine away from the seat-back using the T-bar.
Apply a 100 ± 10 N load to the back and pan assembly of the 3 DH machine at the intersection of the hip angle quadrant and the T-bar housing.
The direction of load application shall be maintained along a line passing by the above intersection to a point just above the thigh bar housing (see figure 2 of Appendix 1 to this Annex).
Care must be exercised throughout the remainder of the procedure to prevent the 3 DH machine from sliding forward. 4.11.
Maintain the 3 DH machine level. 4.12.
Care shall be exercised in holding the T-bar and rocking the 3 DH machine to ensure that no inadvertent exterior loads are applied in a vertical or fore and aft direction.
The feet of the 3 DH machine are not to be restrained or held during this step.
If any movement of the feet has occurred during the rocking operation of the 3 DH machine, they must be repositioned as follows: Alternately, lift each foot off the floor the minimum necessary amount until no additional foot movement is obtained.
Check the lateral spirit level for zero position; if necessary, apply a lateral load to the top of the back pan sufficient to level the 3 DH machine's seat pan on the seat. 4.13.
Holding the T-bar to prevent the 3 DH machine from sliding forward on the seat cushion, proceed as follows: (a) return the back pan to the seat-back; (b) alternately apply and release a horizontal rearward load, not to exceed 25 N, to the back angle bar at a height approximately at the centre of the torso weights until the hip angle quadrant indicates that a stable position has been reached after load release.
Care shall be exercised to ensure that no exterior downward or lateral loads are applied to the 3 DH machine.
If another level adjustment of the 3 DH machine is necessary, rotate the back pan forward, re-level, and repeat the procedure from item 4.12. 4.14.
Take all measurements: 4.14.1.
The coordinates of the %quot%H'' point are measured with respect to the three-dimensional reference system. 4.14.2.
The actual torso angle is read at the back angle quadrant of the 3 DH machine with the probe in its fully rearward position. 4.15.
The 3 DH machine should not be left loaded on the seat assembly longer than the time required to perform the test. 4.16.
If the seats in the same row can be regarded as similar (bench seat, identical seats, etc.) only one %quot%H'' point and one %quot%actual torso angle'' shall be determined for each row of seats, the 3 DH machine described in Appendix 1 to this Annex being seated in a place regarded as representative for the row.
This place shall be: 4.16.1.
in the case of the front row, the driver's seat; 4.16.2.
