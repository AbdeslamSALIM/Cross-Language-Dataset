The maximum permissible positive or negative error, (a) on the nominal length, or (b) on any other distance between any two non-consecutive scale marks, shall be expressed in millimetres as a function of the length in question by the formula (a + bL), in which: - L is the length in question, rounded up to the next whole metre above, - a and b are coefficients fixed for each precision class according to the following table: 1.2.3 // // // // Precision class // a // b // // // // I // 0,1 // 0,1 // II // 0,3 // 0,2 // III // 0,6 // 0,4 // // // 7.4.
Limiting quality level (LQ 5) The limiting quality is the quality level of the lot submitted that corresponds in a sampling plan to a 5 % probability of acceptance. 11.1.5.
Acceptable quality level (SQL) The standard quality level is the quality level of the lot submitted that corresponds in a sampling plan to a 95 % probability of acceptance. 11.1.6.
If method 'A' is chosen, the body responsible applies, for acceptance or rejection of the lot submitted, a sampling plan with the following characteristics: - a standard quality level (SQL) between 0,40 and 0,90 %, - a limiting quality (LQ 5) between 4,0 and 6,5 %.
However, if the lot is not accepted after an inspection under No 4 in the order of submission, the body responsible must carry out a 100 % inspection of the lot 11.3.
