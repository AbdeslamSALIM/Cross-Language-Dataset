The macroeconomic scenario underlying the programme envisages that real GDP growth will ease from 8,4 % in 2005 to 7,2 % on average over the rest of the programme period.
The programme's projections for inflation and the current account deficit appear to be on the low side. (3) The programme broadly follows the model structure for stability and convergence programmes specified in the new code of conduct [2]. (4) The estimated general government deficit for 2005 in the present update is 1,5 % of GDP based on GDP growth of 8,4 %.
This means a slightly lower deficit and a significantly better growth performance than foreseen in the previous programme (deficit of 1,6 % of GDP, growth of 6,7 %).
The update identifies a medium-term objective (MTO) for the budgetary position, as meant in the Stability and Growth Pact, of a structural deficit of "around 1 % of GDP", and aims at achieving this position in the final year of the programme period.
As the programme's MTO is more demanding than the minimum benchmark (estimated at a deficit of around 2 % of GDP), its achievement should fulfil the aim of providing a safety margin against the occurrence of an excessive deficit.
In particular, a possible deterioration in the structural balance in 2006, implied by maintaining the 2006 target if the 2005 outcome is significantly stronger than expected, would correspond to significant fiscal easing in a context of continuing very high-demand pressures and relevant stability risks. (10) According to the Stability and Growth Pact, "major structural reforms" with a verifiable impact on the long-term sustainability of the public finances should be taken into account when defining the adjustment path to the programme's MTO or for allowing a temporary deviation from the programme's MTO.
However, for 2006 the adjustment, also taking into account the structural reforms, is not fully in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.
The suggestion above for a more demanding pace of adjustment towards the programme's MTO than implied by the programme seems feasible given that in the early programme years the estimated net cost of the pension reform is modest. (11) The debt ratio is estimated at 14,9 % of GDP in 2005, well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value.
The currently very low level of gross debt is projected to remain below the 60 % reference value throughout the 2005-2050 projection period.
Latvia is implementing a pension reform launched in 1996 which contributes significantly to contain the budgetary impact of ageing populations. (13) The envisaged measures in the area of public finances are broadly consistent with the broad economic policy guidelines included in the integrated guidelines for the period 2005-2008.
The public finance measures envisaged in the convergence programme are in line with the actions foreseen in the National Reform Programme.
