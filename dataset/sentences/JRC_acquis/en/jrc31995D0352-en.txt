For the Commission Franz FISCHLER Member of the Commission ANNEX I Provisional list of third countries from which imports of Crassostrea gigas intended to be relaid in the Community are authorized (AU) Australia (CA) Canada (NZ) New Zealand (US) United States of America ANNEX II Sampling procedures and diagnostic methods for declaring a zone free of the diseases Mikrocytos mackini and Oyster Velar Disease (iridoviroses) A.
Sampling should therefore be carried out twice a year (spring/autumn) for Mikrocytos and for iridovirus. 1.3.
Sampling size During the initial two-year period which precedes the granting of approved status, the sample size for each sampling point is 150 or a sufficient number to ensure detection at a 95 % confidence level of pathogen carriers at a prevalence of 2 %. 2.
DIAGNOSTIC METHODS (a) Mikrocytos mackini 1.
Dip the slides in the first bath for 4 to 5 seconds, then immerse immediately in the second bath (3 seconds).
An observation time of 5 minutes per slide is sufficient. 1.2.
PREPARATION AND EXAMINATION OF SAMPLES FOR IRIDOVIRUS 1.1.
The slides are stained using Merck's Hemacolor Kit (with reagent solution 2 (ref. 11956) for red staining and reagent solution 3 (ref. 11957) for blue staining).
Dip the slides in the first bath for 4 to 5 seconds, then immerse immediately in the second bath (3 seconds).
It is sufficient to examine each slide for 5 minutes.
Viral particles with icosahedral symmetry (228 Â± 7 nm diameter) and with a capsid consisting of two bilayered membranes.
For each consignment a visual check of at least 1 000 oysters randomly selected for each place of origin shall be carried out by the competent authority. 2.
The batch will pass the test if the check referred to in point 1 does not reveal the presence of molluscs other than Crassostreas gigas.
