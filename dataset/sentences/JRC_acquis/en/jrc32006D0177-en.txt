2006/177/EC: Commission Decision of 19 May 2004 on State aid No C 4/2003 (ex NN 102/2002) implemented by Italy for WAM SpA (notified under document number C(2004) 1812) (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Decision of 19 May 2004 on State aid No C 4/2003 (ex NN 102/2002) implemented by Italy for WAM SpA (notified under document number C(2004) 1812) (Only the Italian version is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (2006/177/EC) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof, Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof, Having regard to the decision [1] by which the Commission initiated the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of aid No C 4/2003 (ex NN 102/2002), Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above and having regard to their comments, Whereas: I.
By letter dated 13 December 1999 (D/65224), the Commission communicated to the complainant the reply of the Italian authorities submitted by letter A/37761 of 11 October 1999, and announced that it intended to carry out a formal investigation. (3) At the same time, a survey on national support schemes for foreign direct investment outside the EU (FDI) was being carried out by the Commission and was expected to result in a Commission communication on the matter. (4) By letter dated 18 December 2001 (D/55270), the Commission asked Italy for further information following renewed action by the complainant (two reminders were addressed to the Commission by letters A/32799 of 31 March 2000 and A/38320 of 11 October 2000), given that the FDI survey had been postponed by the Commission. (5) In the light of the information provided by the letters of 20 February 2002 (A/31323) and 27 March 2002 (A/32370), further questions were put to the Italian authorities by letter of 12 April 2002 (D/51694). (6) The Italian authorities replied by letter of 21 May 2002 (A/33699).
Meanwhile, the case had been transferred to the non-notified aid register and had been given the number NN 102/2002. (8) By letters D/53325 of 26 June 2002 and D/55544 of 4 October 2002, the complainant was kept informed of the progress of the dossier.
It asked to be informed of the procedure to be followed. (22) By letter A/34750 of 4 July 2003, Morton Machine Company Limited, which is the complainant, announced that it had been summoned to appear before an Italian court by WAM SpA, which in its turn claimed compensation, and asked the Commission whether it could have the summons withdrawn. (23) By letter D/54481 of 10 July 2003, the Commission replied to the two above mentioned letters from Morton Machines Company. (24) By letter A/35044 of 16 July 2003, interested third parties submitted comments, with the request that they be dealt with confidentially. (25) On 23 July 2003 a meeting took place between the Commission departments and the Italian authorities.
The Commission replied by letter D/55473 of 28 August 2003. (27) By letter A/36444 of 19 September 2003, Italy submitted to the Commission its observations on the opening of the procedure. (28) By letter A/37525 of 3 November 2003, Italy submitted its observations on the comments notified by third parties and transmitted to it by Commission letter D/56068 of 25 September 2003. (29) Further to the request for compensation submitted by WAM SpA (2003/A/35486 of 30 July 2003), the refusal of access to the documents was confirmed by the Secretariat-General by letter SG/B/2/IS/D(2003) 330353 of 16 September 2003. (30) The folders missing from the reply of 19 September 2003 (A/36444) were provided by Italy by letter A/30263 of 14 January 2004.
In particular, Law No 394/81 allegedly supports Italian companies wishing to establish a subsidiary abroad, in the form of representative offices, shops and warehouses. (34) The Italian authorities confirmed the granting in 1995 of aid in the form of a subsidised loan amounting to ITL 2281450000 (some EUR 1,18 million) for WAM SpA for projects in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
According to the Italian authorities, the recipient was actually granted an amount of ITL 1358505421 (some EUR 0,7 million) as the planned projects in Korea and Taiwan were not implemented on account of the economic crisis in those countries. (35) The subsidised loan covers 85 % of the eligible expenditure.
The interest-rate subsidy may amount to 60 % of the reference rate.
A grace period of two years is envisaged. (36) The subsidised interest rate on the specific loan (equal to 4,4 %) was calculated with reference to a market rate of 11 %.
The following costs, expressed in ITL million, were taken into account: Eligible costs | Loan granted (ITL million) | PERMANENT STRUCTURES Rent, insurance, miscellaneous facilities | 122,56 | Operating costs (in particular, personnel, fittings, equipment for permanent structures) | 556,94 | Display models | 38,23 | Consultancy | 29,43 | Subtotal 1 | 747,18 | TRADE PROMOTION Storage of goods | 456,28 | Market surveys | 40,95 | Fairs and exhibitions | 12,19 | Advertising | 94,39 | Business trips | 7,52 | Subtotal 2 | 611,33 | Grand total | 1358,51 | (38) Moreover, by letter A/33699 of 21 May 2002, the Italian authorities, in reply to a precise question from the Commission, stated that WAM SpA was granted another subsidised loan of ITL 1940579808 (some EUR 1 million) under the same scheme on 9 November 2000. (39) The Commission was not aware, at the time of the opening of the procedure, of any other details concerning this additional aid.
By Decision 97/241/EC of 5 June 1996 [8], the Commission approved a scheme subject to the aid being granted only for foreign direct investment by SMEs — provided that all the conditions laid down for the granting of state aid to SMEs were met — and subject to any aid for large enterprises being notified individually. (50) The only notification of an individual aid to a large enterprise on the basis of the above mentioned decision resulted in a negative decision [9]. (51) The Italian authorities then pointed out in their letter of 24 October 2002 (A/37783) that no aid has ever been granted directly to "WAM Engineering" and that there was no undertaking registered as such in the Italian business register. (52) First of all, it has to be noted that "WAM Engineering Ltd" is the subsidiary for the United Kingdom and Ireland of "WAM SpA".
Secondly, following their letter of 11 October 1999, the Italian authorities announced that in 1995 "WAM SpA" had been granted a subsidised loan under Law No 394/81 and added, by letter A/33699 of 21 May 2002, that the "WAM group" has been granted another subsidised loan under the same scheme on 9 November 2000. (53) According to Article 10(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty [10], "Where the Commission has in its possession information from whatever source regarding alleged unlawful aid, it shall examine that information without delay." (54) In conclusion, having regard to the above, the Commission expressed strong doubts as to whether the aid granted in 1995 to WAM SpA under Law No 394/81 might qualify, pursuant to any provision, for an exemption under Article 87(3) of the EC Treaty.
This aid should have been repaid in full by April 2004. (62) As far as the second subsidised loan granted to WAM SpA in 2000 is concerned, the Italian authorities provided clarification, after the opening of the procedure, by letter A/35269 of 25 July 2003 that its actual overall amount was ITL 3603574689 (EUR 1861091,01), instead of ITL 1940579808 (about EUR 1 million), as previously declared by letter A/33699 of 21 May 2002 and mentioned in the decision to initiate the procedure, since the latter figure referred only to the part of the loan which had already been paid at the moment the letter was written, irrespective of the overall amount of aid granted. (63) Two more instalments of the aid were, in fact, paid.
The Commission observes, first of all, that such a guarantee, or its equivalent, would normally have been requested even by a private credit institution granting loans according to the market economy investor principle and, secondly, that it emerges from letter A of the specifications annexed to the contract that the overlapping of aid for the same programme is not permitted, except for aid related to the guarantee, which consequently is deemed itself to be eligible for aid. (71) As regards WAM SpA’s exports inside and outside the EU, the following data were provided: Year | Exports inside EU | Exports outside EU | Total exports | 1995 | 10237196 | 4477951 | 14715147 | 1996 | 9338640 | 5592951 | 14930762 | 1997 | 9974814 | 5813442 | 15788256 | 1998 | 10780161 | 5346514 | 16126675 | 1999 | 11885473 | 5276525 | 17161998 | (72) The Italian authorities informed the Commission that the total export figures above represent between 52 % and 57,5 % of WAM SpA’s total annual turnover. (73) Finally, while the Italian authorities acknowledge that the two loans under examination are covered neither by Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 nor by Regulation (EC) No 70/2001, they take the view that the incentives for Community enterprises designed to support programmes to be implemented outside the EU do not fall within the scope of Article 87 of the EC Treaty.
Lawfulness of the aid (80) The Italian authorities declared, in their letter of 11 October 1999 (A/37761), that the legal basis for the aid granted to WAM SpA, namely Law 394 of 29 July 1981, had been notified to the Commission and to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) under Article 25 of the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (WTO-GATT 1994) [13]. (81) The Commission observes that, by way of notification, the Italian authorities intend to include some very concise data relating to the scheme in the aid schedule transmitted to the Commission for the purposes of the annual report on State aid in the European Union, at least since the sixth report (1996).
First loan granted to WAM SpA (85) Evidence has been provided by the Italian Government that, at the time of the granting of the first loan (1995), WAM SpA fulfilled the requirements for it to be considered an SME within the meaning of Commission recommendation 96/280/EC [14].
To be more precise, WAM SpA was a medium-sized enterprise as it had 163 employees, an annual turnover of EUR 16,8 million and a balance sheet total of EUR 20,1 million.
This concept was laid down for the first time in the de minimis rule, as included in the 1992 SME guidelines [17].
It was subsequently reworded in the Commission notice on the de minimis rule for State aid [18] and finally confirmed in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty to certain categories of horizontal State aid [19], on the basis of which Commission Regulation (EC) No 69/2001 [20] was adopted. (95) The Commission also recognizes that the wording of the 1992 de minimis rule, which was in force when the first aid measure was granted, did not explicitly exclude export aid; as a consequence, an amount of aid of up to ECU (now EUR) 50000 could be deemed admissible, even with respect to the costs taken into consideration in granting the aid under examination, to the extent that WAM SpA did not benefit from any other subsidy in the form of de minimis aid during the relevant three-year period.
This has been confirmed by the Italian authorities. (96) In addition, in the light of the last paragraph of the Commission notice on the determination of the applicable rules for the assessment of unlawful State aid [21], where, at the time of a decision, guidelines have been replaced by a regulation, the Commission considers that the rules set out in the regulation must apply to the extent that they are more favourable than those of the guidelines [22]. (97) Thus, an additional assessment of the aid in question has to be made in the light of Commission Regulations (EC) No 70/2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises [23] (aid in favour of SMEs) and (EC) No 69/2001 [24] de minimis. (98) Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 clearly stipulates in Article 1(2)(b) that it does not apply to aid to export-related activities [25].
Consequently, none of the expenditure listed at point 89 of the present decision can be considered to comply with that Regulation. (99) Likewise, export aid does not fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 69/2001.
Second loan granted to WAM SpA (100) At the time the second loan was granted in 2000, WAM SpA was on the admission of the Italian authorities themselves, a large undertaking.
As a result, the grant equivalent of the second loan at the time the final decision was adopted has been calculated at EUR 104930,65 (106366,60 – 1435,95). (121) Since it has been classified as aid to export related activities, neither the 1996 de minimis rule [36], nor the 2001 de minimis Regulation [37] applies to this specific aid. (122) It is the Commission’s standard practice, in accordance with Article 87 of the EC Treaty, to require recovery from the recipient of aid which, under that Article, has been unlawfully granted and is incompatible with the common market, provided that the aid is not covered by the de minimis rules.
This practice was been confirmed by Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999. (123) In accordance with Article 14(2) of that Regulation, the aid to be recovered pursuant to a recovery decision must include interest at an appropriate rate fixed by the Commission.
Article 5 This decision is addressed to the Republic of Italy.
