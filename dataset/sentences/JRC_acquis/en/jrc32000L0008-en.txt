Fontaine For the Council The President J.
The application for type-approval of a type of vehicle with regard to its fuel tanks pursuant to Article 3(4) of Directive 70/156/EEC shall be submitted by the vehicle manufacturer. 3.2.
In the case of a vehicle equipped with a tank made of another material: two additional tanks, with their accessories. 4.
A model for the EC type-approval certificate is given in Appendix 4. 4.3.
An approval number in accordance with Annex VII to Directive 70/156/EEC shall be assigned to each type of vehicle approved.
SPECIFICATIONS 5.1.
Tanks must satisfy, when equipped with all accessories which are normally attached to them, the leakage tests carried out according to Section 6.1 at a relative internal pressure equal to double the working excess pressure, but in any event not less than an excess pressure of 0,3 bar.
Moreover, tanks made of plastic material must also be tested according to the specific procedure set out in Section 6.3. 6.
The tank must be completely filled with a non-flammable liquid (water, for example).
After all communication with the outside has been cut off, the pressure must be gradually increased, through the pipe connection through which fuel is fed to the engine, to a relative internal pressure equal to double the working pressure used and in any case to not less than an excess pressure of 0,3 bar, which must be maintained for one minute.
The tank and all its accessories must be mounted on to a test fixture in a manner corresponding to the mode of installation on the vehicle for which the tank is intended; this also applies to systems for the compensation of the interior excess pressure. 6.2.2.
The test fixture shall rotate about an axis lying parallel to the longitudinal vehicle axis. 6.2.3.
The test will be carried out with the tank filled to 90 % of its capacity and also 30 % of its capacity with a non-flammable liquid having a density and a viscosity close to those of the fuel normally used (water may be accepted). 6.2.4.
The tank must be rotated back to its normal position.
Afterwards, the tank must be rotated back to its normal position. 6.3.
Impact resistance 6.3.1.1.
During this test the tank temperature must be 233 K ± 2 K (- 40 °C ± 2 °C). 6.3.1.3.
The centre of percussion of the pendulum must coincide with the centre of gravity of the pyramid; its distance from the axis of rotation of the pendulum must be 1 m.
The total mass of the pendulum must be 15 kg.
The energy of the pendulum at the moment of impact must be not less than 30 Nm and as close to that value as possible. 6.3.1.4.
No leak must result from the test. 6.3.1.6.
The tank and all its accessories must be mounted onto a test fixture in a manner corresponding to the mode of installation on the vehicle for which the tank is intended.
The tank must be subjected to a relative internal pressure equal to double the working pressure and in any case to not less than 0,3 bar at a temperature of 326 K ± 2 K (53 °C ± 2 °C) for a period of five hours.
During the test, the tank and its accessories must not crack or leak; however, it may be permanently deformed. 6.3.3.
Fuel permeability 6.3.3.1.
Prior to the test, the tank must be filled to 50 % of its capacity with testing fuel and stored, without being sealed, at an ambient temperature of 313 K ± 2 K (40 °C ± 2 °C) until the weight loss per unit time becomes constant. 6.3.3.3.
The tank must then be emptied and refilled to 50 % of its capacity with test fuel, after which it must be hermetically sealed and be stored at a temperature of 313 K ± 2 K (40 °C ± 2 °C).
The maximum permissible average loss of fuel is 20 g per 24 hours of testing time. 6.3.3.4.
If the loss due to diffusion exceeds the value indicated in Section 6.3.3.3, the test described there must be carried out again, on the same tank, to determine the loss by diffusion at 296 K ± 2 K (23 °C ± 2 °C), but under the same conditions otherwise.
The loss so measured shall not exceed 10 g per 24 hours. 6.3.4.
Resistance to fuel After the test referred to in Section 6.3.3, the tank must still meet the requirements set out in Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2. 6.3.5.
If the tank is only designed for installation on vehicles equipped with a compression-ignition engine, three tests must be carried out with tanks filled with diesel fuel; 6.3.5.2.3.
Immediately prior to the test the tank must be filled with the specified fuel to 50 % of its capacity. 6.3.5.3.
The pan must therefore exceed the horizontal projection of the tank by at least 20 cm, but not more then 50 cm.
The side walls of the pan must not project more than 8 cm above the level of the fuel at the start of the test. 6.3.5.5.
Either the pan, or the testing fixture, or both, must be freely movable. 6.3.5.6.
During phase C of the test, the pan must be covered by a screen placed 2 cm ± 1 cm above the fuel level.
There must be no gap between the bricks and they must be supported over the fuel pan in such a manner that the holes in the bricks are not obstructed.
The length and width of the frame must be 2 cm to 4 cm smaller than the interior dimensions of the pan so that a gap of 1 cm to 2 cm exists between the frame and the wall of the pan to allow ventilation. 6.3.5.7.
Phase A: Pre-heating (figure 1) The fuel in the pan must be ignited at a distance of at least 3 m from the tank being tested.
After 60 seconds pre-heating, the pan must be placed under the tank. 6.3.5.8.2.
Phase B: Direct exposure to flame (figure 2) For 60 seconds the tank must be exposed to the flame from the freely burning fuel. 6.3.5.8.3.
Phase D: End of test (figure 4) The burning pan covered with the screen must be moved back to its original position (phase A).
The fixture used for the test must match the manner of installation of the tank on the vehicle, including the way in which the tank vent works. 6.3.6.2.
The tank filled to 50 % of its capacity with water at 293 K (20 °C) must be subjected for one hour to an ambient temperature of 368 K ± 2 K (95 °C ± 2 °C). 6.3.6.3.
The trade name or mark must be affixed to the tank; it must be indelible and clearly legible on the tank when the latter is installed on the vehicle. 7.
CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION 8.1.
Measures to ensure the conformity of production shall be taken in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC. (1) As defined in Annex II, Part A to Directive 70/156/EEC. (2) OJ L 76, 6.4.1970, p. 1.
