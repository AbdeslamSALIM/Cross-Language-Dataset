Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament On the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products {SEC(2006) 1218} /* COM/2006/0558 final */ EN Brussels, 29.9.2006 COM(2006) 558 final REPORT FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT On the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products {SEC(2006) 1218} 1.
Introduction Article 41 of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 [1] provides that the Commission shall submit to the Council and the Parliament a report on the implementation of this Regulation by 31 December 2005.
Moreover, the Commission services organised consultations by way of questionnaires and received responses from 22 Member States and 3 stakeholders.
Pursuant to Article 32 of the Treaty, fishery products fall under “agricultural products” and, therefore, are subject to the principles of the common agricultural policy.
The Council of Ministers adopted a first market organisation in fishery products by way of Regulation (EEC) No 2142/70 [2].
The CMO was created to achieve the objectives laid down in Article 33 of the Treaty in the fishery sector, in particular to provide market stability and to guarantee a fair income for producers.
The current CMO laid down in Regulation 104/2000 has moved away from a mere intervention system and now lays more emphasis on sustainability-supportive fishing and marketing activities.
The CMO is run on the basis of 23 implementing Regulations (see Annex 1).
The 2003 Act of Accession introduced sprat and dolphin-fish and added new marketing sizes for Baltic herring. 2.
The Commission services carried out 15 inspection missions in the Member States in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate compliance with marketing standards.
The application of the standards improves where producer organisations (POs) are involved in controls performed in single points like auctions.
Infringements were detected in 9 Member States.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1181/2003 [8] introduced new trade descriptions for 20 sardine-type species and maintained the name “sardines” for the species Sardina pilchardus.
The number of modifications varied from 1 to 12 and the species added ranged from a few to 164.
In 2002 and 2003, the implementation by Member States of the Regulation gave rise to many questions about their correct interpretation.
Producer organisations 4.1.
Recognition of producer organisations In 2005 there were 203 POs recognised in 16 Member States [10] (see also Annex 2).
As regards affiliation, more than 50% of the fishermen belong to POs in 10 Member States.
In order to stimulate cross-border co-operation between POs, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1767/2004 [11] introduced the recognition of associations of POs from different Member States.
Extension of rules Four Member States applied the extension of PO’s rules to non-member producers. 2 applications were accepted in Belgium, 2 in Spain, 7 in France and one in Italy.
Annex 3 shows the evolution of these expenses.
The continuation of this aid under the EFF for 2007-2013 is currently being discussed. 5.
Interbranch organisations In 2005 there were only 4 organisations recognised in 3 Member States: 2 in Spain (catch and aquaculture sectors), one in France (aquaculture) and one in Italy (catch and aquaculture).
Prices and intervention 6.1.
Annex 4 shows the evolution of market prices and guide prices during 2001-2004.
The market for white fish experienced considerable price drops in 2002 and 2003.
For a number of whitefish species, for example, average first-sale prices stagnated or even decreased between 2000 and the first half of 2005 (see Annex 5).
This is reflected in a moderate yearly expenditure between €9 million and €12 million for 2001-2004.
Annexes 7, 8, 9 10 and 11 show the expenses of the different intervention mechanisms.
The Commission performed audits of intervention expenditures in 3 Member States in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
During 2001-2004, the quantities withdrawn accounted for less than 2% of the production of pelagic species and around 1% of the production of whitefish (see Annex 12).
Yet withdrawals of white fish species with reduced Community production increased significantly in 2002 and 2003.
The information did not always correspond with the quantities actually withdrawn in 3 Member States. 6.2.2.
The information did not always correspond with the quantities actually withdrawn in 2 Member States. 6.2.4.
Only one Member State applied the private storage scheme in 2002 and 2004.
On 28 January 2004, the Court of First Instance delivered a judgement in cases T-142/01 and T-283/01.
Trade Policy measures Regulation No 104/2000 introduced tariff suspensions for certain products intended for processing.
Multi-annual autonomous tariff quotas were opened for 2001-2003 (see Council Regulation (EC) No 2803/2000 [20] and Council Regulation (EC) No 1771/2003 [21]) and 2004-2006 (see Council Regulation (EC) No 379/2004 [22]).
Annex 13 shows the evolution of the products and the volumes of the quotas applicable from 2001 to 2006.
Moreover, Council Regulation (EC) No 2801/2000 [23] established temporary suspensions for some products not available in the Community.
Since the completion of the Uruguay Round, safeguard measures are governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 [24].
The expenses derived from withdrawals have decreased in accordance with the objectives of Regulation No 104/2000. 2.
Recourse to intervention very much differs with the Member States. 3.
The Community market is increasingly dependent on imports from third countries in order to satisfy the needs of consumers and processing industry. [1] OJ L 17, 21.1.2000, p. 22.
