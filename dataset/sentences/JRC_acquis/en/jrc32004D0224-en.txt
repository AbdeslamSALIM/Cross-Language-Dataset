These descriptive elements are indicated in forms 2 to 6 by a merging code that is specified in box 1.
FORM 2 Description of the exceedance of the limit value %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes to Form 2: 1.
Sub b: The pollutant shall be indicated by %quot%SO2%quot%, %quot%NO2%quot%, %quot%PM10%quot%, %quot%Pb%quot% for lead, %quot%C6H6%quot% for benzene and %quot%CO%quot%. 3.
Sub l and m: The %quot%surface area (km2) above the LV%quot% indicates the size of the exceedance area concerned.
FORM 3 Analysis of the causes of exceedance of the limit value in the reference year %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes to Form 3: 1.
Sub b and c: The background level is the concentration of pollutants on a larger scale than the exceedance area.
The regional background level is the level that is estimated to occur in the absence of sources within a distance of the order of 30 km.
Sub d: The contributions of the local sources shall be expressed as a sequential number, using %quot%1%quot% for the largest contributor, %quot%2%quot% for the second largest contributor etc.
Sub g: Exceptions local topography shall be indicated by %quot%+%quot%.
FORM 4 Baseline level %gt%TABLE%gt% Notes to Form 4: 1.
