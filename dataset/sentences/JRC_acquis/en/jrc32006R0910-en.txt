Blue Wing Airlines (20) There is verified evidence of non-compliance with specific safety standards established by the Chicago Convention.
These deficiencies were identified by France, during a ramp inspection performed under the SAFA programme [7]. (21) Blue Wing Airlines did not respond adequately to an enquiry by the civil aviation authority of France and the Commission regarding the safety aspect of its operation. (22) Therefore, on the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that Blue Wing Airlines does not meet the relevant safety standards.
Sky Gate International Aviation (23) While Sky Gate International Aviation’s Air Operator’s Certificate was issued by the Kyrgyz Republic, there is evidence showing that the airline does not have its principal place of business in Kyrgyzstan as indicated by the Kyrgyz civil aviation authority, contrary to the requirements of Annex 6 to the Chicago Convention. (24) Sky Gate International Aviation did not respond adequately to enquiries by the civil aviation authority of United Kingdom and by the Commission regarding its principal place of business. (25) The authorities of the Kyrgyz Republic with responsibility for regulatory oversight of Sky Gate International Aviation have not provided evidence of their ability to conduct the safety oversight operations of this carrier. (26) Therefore, on the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that Sky Gate International Aviation does not meet the relevant safety standards.
GST Aero Air Company (32) The authorities of Kazakhstan with responsibility for regulatory oversight of GST Aero Air Company have provided Italy with a list of three aircraft with valid certificates of airworthiness and equipped with the necessary safety equipment.
In addition they have informed Italy that a corrective action plan has been established in order to correct the safety deficiencies identified during ramp inspections performed by Italy on GST Aero Company [8]. (33) However there is still no evidence of the implementation of an appropriate action plan for the deficiencies which have been identified in the operational procedures of GST Aero Air Company. (34) Therefore, on the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that GST Aero Air Company does not meet the relevant safety standards and it should consequently remain included in Annex A.
Air carriers from Mauritania (35) As envisaged in recital 99 of Regulation (EC) No 474/2006, an evaluation of the authorities of Mauritania with responsibility for regulatory oversight of Air Mauritanie and the undertakings under its responsibility should have been conducted before 23 May 2006.
General considerations concerning the other carriers included in the list (37) No evidence of the full implementation of appropriate remedial actions by the other carriers included in the list established on 24 March 2006 and by the authorities with responsibility for regulatory oversight of these air carriers has been communicated to the Commission so far in spite of specific requests submitted by the latter.
Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
