MEASURES IN FORCE (1) The measures currently in force on imports into the Community of certain electronic weighing scales (REWS) originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) are definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2605/2000 [2].
CURRENT INVESTIGATION 1.
electronic weighing scales for use in the retail trade, having a maximum weighing capacity not exceeding 30 kg, which incorporate a digital display of the weight, unit price and price to be paid (whether or not including a means of printing this data), normally declared within CN code ex84238150 (TARIC code 8423815010) and originating in the PRC. 4.
The fact that the audit reports were silent as regards most of the breaches of the IAS indicates that the audit was not carried out in accordance with IAS. (18) It should also be underlined that the auditor’s report concerning the financial year 2001 of one of the two related Chinese producers had already noted the problems regarding inventories, while the auditor’s reports concerning the financial years 2002 and 2003 noted that the company had not established the relevant policy on provisions for impairment of assets.
Concerning the producer in the analogue country, the findings are set out in recitals 29 to 41. (26) In view of the above findings, it was concluded that the conditions set out in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation were not met by the applicant and, therefore, MET should not be granted. 3.
The Indonesian producer who had cooperated in the original investigation also cooperated in the current review and completed the Commission’s questionnaire. (32) It should also be noted that, before a decision on the selection of the most appropriate analogue country was made, questionnaires were also sent to producers in the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Japan, but these producers did not cooperate. (33) In view of the above, and in particular the fact that Indonesia was used as the analogue country in the original investigation, and that there are no indications that the suitability of Indonesia as analogue country would have changed, it is concluded that Indonesia constitutes an appropriate analogue country in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. (34) The applicant considered as a discriminatory change of methodology between the original investigation and this review the fact that no verification visit was carried out at the premises of the Indonesian producer during the review, while such visit was carried out during the original investigation.
The applicant, based on information in the non-confidential file, argued that the reply to the questionnaire of the Indonesian producer was apparently inadequate and there was only information to make a rough calculation of constructed normal value. (35) In accordance with Article 16 of the basic Regulation, verification visits are not mandatory.
It would thus appear that the methodology used in the original investigation was changed to the detriment of the applicant.
Furthermore, it merely argued that it was unusual to choose the profitability in the original IP of a market other than that of the analogue country. (41) With regard to these arguments, as set out in recital 37 above, constructed normal value with the profit on domestic sales during the original investigation in Taiwan was used because the domestic sales in the Indonesian market during the investigation period were considered insufficient for establishing normal value on the basis of sales prices.
Export price (42) The two related Chinese exporting producers sold their REWS to the Community through related companies (traders) registered in Samoa and Taiwan.
RETROACTIVE LEVYING OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY (59) In the light of the above findings, the anti-dumping duty applicable to the applicant should be levied retroactively on imports of the product concerned which have been made subject to registration pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1408/2004.
Their comments were considered and taken into account where appropriate. (61) This review does not affect the date on which the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2605/2000 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1 1.
