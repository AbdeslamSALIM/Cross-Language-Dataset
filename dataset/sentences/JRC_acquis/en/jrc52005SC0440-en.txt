Recommendation for a Council opinion in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of Greece, 2004-2007 /* SEC/2005/0440 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 6.4.2005 SEC(2005) 440 final Recommendation for a COUNCIL OPINION in accordance with the third paragraph of Art. 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the updated stability programme of Greece, 2004-2007 (presented by the Commission) EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies[1] stipulates that participating Member States, that is, those which have adopted the single currency, have to submit stability programmes to the Council and the Commission.
In view of a general government deficit of 3.2% of GDP and a debt ratio of 103.0% of GDP recorded in 2003, the Council decided that Greece was in excessive deficit on 5 July 2004 and recommended that the excessive deficit be corrected by 2005 at the latest.
On 17 February 2005, also upon a Commission recommendation in accordance with Article 104(9), the Council decided to give notice to Greece to take measures for the deficit reduction below the 3% of GDP threshold by 2006 at the latest.
The first stability programme of Greece, covering the period 2000-2004, was submitted on 19 June 2000 and assessed by the Council on 12 February 2001.
Greece submitted the update of its stability programme covering the period 2004-2007 on 17 December 2004.
The targets in the programme take into account the budgetary impact of a fiscal package, made public by the government on 29 March, to underpin the implementation of the revised programme, including a public commitment to target a deficit below 3% of GDP in the 2006 draft budget.
Finally, in the third scenario, real GDP is projected to grow at 2.9% in 2005 and marginally accelerate to 3% in 2006 and 2007, which is essentially in line with the Commission services spring 2005 forecast.
The data in the scenario imply a rate of potential output growth that gradually eases over the programme period from around 3.3% in 2005 to 3% in 2007.
This deficit is 0.8 percentage points higher than the figure of 5.3% of GDP estimated by the Greek government at the time of the September 2004 EDP notification.
The fiscal adjustment is frontloaded and concentrated in 2005 and, to a lesser extent in 2006, while in 2007 the adjustment amounts to just 0.5 percentage point of GDP.
In addition, there are negative risks to the budgetary outlook for 2005 and beyond on both the revenues and expenditure side.
Therefore, in line with their commitment announced on 29 March, the Greek authorities may have to implement additional measures in 2006, on top of those already announced for 2005, to effectively bring the deficit below the 3% threshold.
Hence, the budgetary stance in the programme does not provide a sufficient margin against breaching the 3% of GDP reference value with normal cyclical fluctuations nor does it achieve the Stability and Growth Pact’s medium term objective of a budgetary position of close-to-balance or in surplus throughout the programme period. - The debt ratio is projected to decline from 110.5% of GDP in 2004 to only 109.5% in 2005 and then to 107.2% in 2006 and 104.7% in 2007.
On the restructuring of expenditures, the 2005 budget foresees a reduction of consumption expenditure by over 16% in nominal terms.
On 5 July 2004, the Council decided that Greece was in excessive deficit and recommended its correction by 2005 at the latest.
To that end, the Greek government has adopted a package of fiscal measures for 2005, in addition to those included in the 2005 budget, which have lasting effects on subsequent years.
The reference scenario targets a reduction of the nominal general government budget deficit by 3.6 percentage points over the programme period, from the outturn of 6.1% of GDP in 2004 to 2.4% in 2007.
The primary balance is projected to improve substantially from a deficit of 0.4% in 2004 to a surplus of 1.8% of GDP in 2005 increasing to 3.3% of GDP at the end of the period. 6.
There is a risk that the budgetary outcome for 2005 and beyond may be worse than in the programme.
The debt ratio is projected to decline from 110.5% of GDP in 2004 to only 109.5% in 2005 and then to 107.2% in 2006 and 104.7% in 2007.
The considerable increase projected in age-related spending suggests that additional measures to control public pension expenditures, including the resolute implementation of reform measures enacted, are necessary. 9.
