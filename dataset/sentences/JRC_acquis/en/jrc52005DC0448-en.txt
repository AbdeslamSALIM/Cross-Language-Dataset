For this reason, the Commission has announced its intention to set out in 2005 a roadmap to an integrated internal control framework.
B) STATEMENT OF ASSURANCE (DAS) AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION (COMMISSION WORKING DOCUMENT, POINTS 6-11) In June 2005 the Commission adopted a communication setting-out the abovementioned roadmap to an integrated internal control framework.
c) Budgetary management (Commission working document, points 5 and 12-13) The Commission has taken due note of Council’s request for more accurate and updated budget estimates and more information on outstanding commitments and budgetary implementation.
Moreover, the 2004 report on Budgetary and Financial Management analyses the cumulative state of implementation of the Communities’ main multi-annual programmes.
E) The common agricultural policy (Commission working document, points 16-21) The Commission will work more actively with Member States in order to improve the control systems in areas that are not checked through IACS and where serious problems such as high risks and recurrent errors still occur.
Furthermore, the results of the IACS checks made by Member States have been included in the 2004 Annual Activity Report of the Director General for Agriculture.
Concerning annual activity reports, tables summarising the main findings including reservations have been included in the Directors'-General reports for 2004 and will appear in these reports in future.
All new Member States had received accreditation decisions for PHARE funds by early 2005 and could rely on the (albeit phasing out) assistance of the PHARE Transition Teams in the local Commission Representations.
CONCLUSIONS ON THE FOLLOW-UP OF THE 2002 DISCHARGE (Commission working document, points 44-54) The Commission has taken or is taking the recommended actions to follow-up the conclusions on the 2002 discharge, for instance as regards improvements in supervisory and control systems concerning the areas of agriculture, TEN-T, external actions, pre-accession aid and banking operations.
Concerning the Stabex funds, the Commission has issued instructions, with deadlines, to the Delegations, in order to ensure closer financial monitoring and the rapid approval of all outstanding Frameworks of Mutual Obligations. * * * [1] See also Article 147 of the Financial Regulation [2] 2003 General Budget Discharge, 2003 EDF Discharge, 2003 Agencies Discharge
