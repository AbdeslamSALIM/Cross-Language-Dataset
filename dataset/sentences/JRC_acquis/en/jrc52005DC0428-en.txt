The combined effect of the implementation of European security standards and the various quality control actions, including the Commission’s inspections, has made it possible to harmonise and redouble the efforts made by the Member States since 11 September 2001. 5.
On the basis of this policy conclusion, on 10 October 2001 the Commission adopted a legislative proposal for a framework Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security[2].
THE NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CIVIL AVIATION SECURITY 2.1.
These provisions became applicable on 19 January 2003.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security [7] came into force on 19 April 2003.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1217/2003 laying down common specifications for national civil aviation security quality control programmes [8] came into force on 28 July 2003.
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1486/2003 laying down procedures for conducting Commission inspections in the field of civil aviation security[9] came into force on 12 September 2003.
Commission Regulation (EC) 68/2004[10], which came into force on 5 February 2004, was the first amendment to Regulation 622/2003 and adds more detailed aviation security requirements complementing the general requirements laid down in the framework Regulation, specifically as regards prohibited items .
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1138/2004 establishing a common definition of critical parts of security restricted areas at airports[11] came into force on 1 July 2004.
It comes into force on 1 July 2006.
On 30 June 2005, 23 Member States had already been inspected by the Commission at least once.
By the end of June 2005, 14 national authorities had been inspected.
Inspections of a suitable sample of airports A total of 29 airport inspections were carried out in the 22 Member States between February 2004 and June 2005[18].
The sample included the following: - 11 inspections of airports handling more than 10 million passengers a year, including several of Europe’s largest airports; - 13 inspections of airports with between 1 and 10 million passengers, including 2 airports with very strongly seasonal traffic in southern Europe; - 1 inspection of an airport with less than 1 million passengers; - 1 inspection of a small regional airport; - 3 inspections of airports mainly handling freight, from among the 10 largest ones.
Implementing legislation to improve this situation is underway and the first Regulation ensuring harmonised standards for x-ray equipment has already been adopted on 24 May 2005[19].
The existing legal system including the powers to ensure proper enforcement rules as well as legal requirements more demanding than the obligations and recommendations laid down in Annex 17 to the Convention of International Civil Aviation allows for the conclusion that the quality of aviation security in the EU is standard-setting in a global context.
