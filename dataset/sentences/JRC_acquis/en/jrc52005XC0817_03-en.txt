Notice published pursuant to Article 27(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in Cases COMP/C2/39152 — BUMA and COMP/C2/39151 SABAM (Santiago Agreement — COMP/C2/38126) (2005/C 200/05) (Text with EEA relevance) 1.
INTRODUCTION (1) On 17 April 2001, the copyright management societies BUMA, Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte (GEMA), The Performing Right Society Ltd. (PRS) and Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique (SACEM) notified to the Commission a number of bilateral reciprocal agreements they entered into with each other as well as with other societies.
Therefore, according to the Statement of Objections, although the infringement of Article 81 derives from the limitation in each society's authority to license to its own territory, the multi-lateralisation of this limitation throughout the network of bilateral agreements, supported on a multilateral reassurance that all other collecting societies will be subject to the same territorial limitation, leads to a standardisation of the licensing terms throughout the EEA, preventing the market from evolving in different directions and crystallising the exclusivity enjoyed by each of the participating societies. 3.
COMMITMENTS (8) BUMA and SABAM replied to the Statement of Objections separately from the other addressees.
By letters of 20 April 2005 (BUMA) and 10 May 2005 (SABAM), they submitted to the Commission undertakings within the meaning of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003.
To this end, pursuant to Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, it invites interested third parties to submit their comments to it within one month of the publication of this notice. (14) Interested third parties are also asked to submit a non-confidential version of their comments, in which commercial secrets and other confidential passages are deleted and are replaced as required by a non-confidential summary or by the words "[commercial secrets]" or "[confidential]". (15) Comments should be sent to the following address, mentioning the references COMP/C-2/39152 — BUMA and COMP/C-2/39151 — SABAM (Santiago Agreement).
