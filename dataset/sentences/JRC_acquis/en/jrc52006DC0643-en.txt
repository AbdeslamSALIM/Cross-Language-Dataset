Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament The application of Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin /* COM/2006/0643 final */ [pic] | COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES | Brussels, 30.10.2006 COM(2006) 643 final COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT The application of Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin 1.
Some Member States brought in new, comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation, although anti-discrimination measures can be found in many Member Statesâ€™ constitutional provisions as well as in both civil and criminal legislation, which can make it difficult to identify the applicable procedure.
Further information on the transposition of Directive 2000/43/EC in each Member State, along with links to publications, national legislation and the equality bodies is available at the following address (http://europa.eu.int/comm/antidiscrimination). 3.
Dissemination of information The importance of information on the right to non-discrimination was a key finding of the public consultation organised by the Commission in 2004 in connection with the Green Paper on Equality and non-discrimination in an enlarged EU[8].
The role of the social partners %amp% NGOs The Directive stresses the role the social partners can play in promoting equal treatment.
On the one hand, positive action measures aim to ensure full equality in practice by preventing or compensating for disadvantages linked to having a certain racial or ethnic origin.
In particular, 2007 has been designated as the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, a very effective way of raising awareness of the right to non-discrimination, and a catalyst for action at national level.
