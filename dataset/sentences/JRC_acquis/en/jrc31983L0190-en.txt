The measurements must begin as soon as the axis of the rear axle of the tractor is perpendicular to point D = 0 on the roadway, and end as soon as the axis of the front axle of the tractor is perpendicular to point D = 100 of the test roadway (see the table in Appendix 3 to this Annex).%quot% Item 2.5.3.2.2 shall be replaced by the following: %quot%2.5.3.2.2.
Measurements shall be taken at a speed of 12 ± 0,5 km/h.
The speed of 12 km/h must be reached after a run-up track has been traversed.
Driver's mass The tests must be carried out with two drivers : one with a total mass of 59 ± 1 kg, of which not more than 5 kg may be carried in a weighting belt around the body ; the other with a mass of 98 ± 5 kg with a maximum mass of 8 kg in the weighting belt.%quot% Item 2.5.3.3.2 shall be replaced by the following: %quot%2.5.3.3.2.
Position of the accelerometer To measure the vibrations transmitted to the driver, an accelerometer is fixed on a flat plate with a diameter of 250 ± 50 mm, the central part of which must be rigid up to a diameter of 75 mm and must include a rigid device to protect the accelerometer.
To measure the vibrations at the seat attachment, an accelerometer must be fixed near to this attachment at a point not more than 100 mm from the median longitudinal plane of the tractor and not outside the vertical projection of the seat surface on the tractor.%quot% Item 2.5.3.3.3 : In the English version only, the symbol %quot%Hz%quot% shall be inserted after the figure %quot%80%quot% to indicate the unit of measurement.

Procedure used for determining the weighted vibration acceleration of seats intended for Category A tractors%quot% Items 2.5.5.1 and 2.5.5.2 shall be deleted.
For each of the two drivers referred to in Item 2.5.3.3.1, the weighted vibration acceleration must be measured at the seat over a period of 28 seconds.
The measurement must begin at the set-value signal corresponding to t = 0 seconds and end at the set-value signal t = 28 seconds (see Appendices 4 and 5 to this Annex).
The measured values must not deviate from the arithmetic mean by more than ± 5 %.
Each complete sequence of set points must be reproduced in a time of 28 ± 0,5 sec.%quot% Item 2.5.5 shall be replaced by the following: %quot%2.5.6.

Instead of the set values specified in the second paragraph of Item 2.5.3.1.1 (see Appendices 4 and 5 to this Annex), sinusoidal oscillations of ± 15 mm amplitude with a frequency of 0,5 to 2 Hz are generated.
The frequency range is to be run through with a constant rate of frequency change in not less than 60 seconds or at intervals no greater than 0,05 Hz with increasing frequency, and in an identical manner with decreasing frequency.
Appendices 8 and 11 shall become Appendices 7 and 8 respectively.
This provision is applicable only if the values specified for the depth and the width of the seat surface (i.e. 400 ± 50 mm and at least 450 mm respectively) cannot be adhered to on grounds relating to the tractor.%quot% Item 4 : In the French version only, %quot%Annex I%quot% shall be replaced by %quot%Annex V%quot%.
