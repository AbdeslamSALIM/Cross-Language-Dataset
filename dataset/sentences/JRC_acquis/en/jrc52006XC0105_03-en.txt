The mother company Biria AG is located in Neukirch, Lausitz, Sachsen, an assisted area pursuant to Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty.
The mother company, Biria AG, was created in 2003 through a merger of Biria (old) with one of its subsidiaries, Sachsen Zweirad GmbH.
The loan was repaid in January 2002 (measure 2).
To support the same restructuring as measure 2 a public investment company granted in March 2001 a participation in Checker Pig amounting to EUR 1789521 with a duration until March 2006 on the basis of an approved scheme for restructuring aid (measure 3).
In March 2001 a public investment company granted a silent participation in Bike Systems amounting to EUR 2070732 with a duration until the end of 2010 (measure 4).
The same investment company also acquired 20 % of the shares of Bike Systems Betriebs- und Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, which is a subsidiary of Biria AG and which owns Bike Systems, for a price of EUR 0,51 (measure 5).
In March 2003 the Land Saxony granted an 80 % guarantee for an operating credit of EUR 5,6 million in favour of Sachsen Zweirad GmbH.
The guarantee was given back in January 2004 (measure 6).
In 2003 the Land Saxony granted an 80 % guarantee for an operating credit amounting to EUR 24,9 million in favour of Biria GmbH.
The guarantee only entered into force on 5 January 2004 once the guarantee to Sachsen Zweirad (see measure 6) had been given back (measure 7).
The Commission also considers that measure 5 does not constitute State aid.
The silent participation was provided at a fixed remuneration of 8,5 % plus a variable remuneration of 3,5 % which would depend on the realisation of profits.
The Commission is of the opinion that Sachsen Zweirad GmbH and its successor company Biria GmbH are to be considered as companies in difficulty at the time of the granting of the guarantees.
The Commission therefore comes to the conclusion that the granting of measures 6 and 7 does not comply with the aid scheme.
