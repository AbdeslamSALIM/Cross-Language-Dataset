Any reference to this Action Plan includes a reference to Table 1. 2.
By way of exception for those populations listed in Categories 2 and 3 in Column A only and which are marked by an asterisk, hunting may continue on a sustainable use basis where hunting of such populations is a long-established cultural practice.
TABLE 1 STATUS OF THE POPULATIONS OF MIGRATORY WATERBIRDS [1] Key to classification The following key to Table 1 is a basis for implementation of the Action Plan: Column A Category 1: (a) Species which are included in Appendix I to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory species of Wild Animals; (b) Species which are listed as threatened in Threatened Birds of the World (BirdLife International 2000); or (c) Populations, which number less than around 10000 individuals.
Category 2: Populations numbering between around 10000 and around 25000 individuals.
Category 3: Populations numbering between around 25000 and around 100000 individuals and considered to be at risk as a result of: (a) Concentration onto a small number of sites at any stage of their annual cycle; (b) Dependence on a habitat type, which is under severe threat; (c) Showing significant long-term decline; or (d) Showing extreme fluctuations in population size or trend.
For species listed in categories 2 and 3 above, see paragraph 2.1.1 of the Action Plan contained in Annex 3 to the Agreement.
Column B Category 1: Populations numbering between around 25000 and around 100000 individuals and which do not fulfil the conditions in respect of column A, as described above.
Category 2: Populations numbering more than around 100000 individuals and considered to be in need of special attention as a result of: (a) Concentration onto a small number of sites at any stage of their annual cycle; (b) Dependence on a habitat type, which is under severe threat; (c) Showing significant long-term decline; or (d) Showing extreme fluctuations in population size or trend.
Column C Category 1: Populations numbering more than around 100000 individuals which could significantly benefit from international cooperation and which do not fulfil the conditions in respect of either column A or column B, above.
Western Palearctic As defined in Handbook of the Birds of Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (Cramp %amp% Simmons 1977).
Western Europe North-west Europe with Portugal and Spain.
