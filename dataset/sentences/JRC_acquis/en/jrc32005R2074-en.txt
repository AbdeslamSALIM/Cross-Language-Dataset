Commission Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down implementing measures for certain products under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and for the organisation of official controls under Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, derogating from Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (Text with EEA relevance) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down implementing measures for certain products under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and for the organisation of official controls under Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, derogating from Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (Text with EEA relevance) THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs [1], and in particular Article 13(2) thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin [2], and in particular Articles 9, 10 and 11 thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [3], and in particular Articles 16, 17 and 18 thereof, Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules [4], and in particular Article 63 thereof, Whereas: (1) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific requirements concerning hygiene rules for food of animal origin.
It is necessary to lay down certain implementing measures for meat, live bivalve molluscs, fishery products, milk, eggs, frogs' legs and snails, and processed products thereof. (2) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 lays down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.
It is necessary to develop certain rules and further specify other requirements. (3) Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 establishes at Community level a harmonised framework of general rules for the organisation of official controls.
The food chain information should be analysed by the official veterinarian and used as an integral part of the inspection procedures. (8) Existing systems for information flow should be used as much as possible and adapted to comply with the requirements for the food chain information laid down in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004. (9) In order to improve animal management at holding level and in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 854/2004, the official veterinarian should record and, if necessary, communicate, to the food business operator of the holding of provenance and to any veterinarian attending the holding of provenance or any competent authority involved, any disease or condition observed at the slaughterhouse in respect of individual animals or the herd/flock and which may affect public or animal health or endanger animal welfare. (10) Regulations (EC) Nos 853/2004 and 854/2004 set out the requirements governing parasite checks during handling of fishery products on shore and on board vessels.
The analysis methods that are scientifically recognised for checking TVB-N should continue to be used as a matter of routine, but a reference method should be specified for use where there is doubt regarding the results or in the event of dispute. (12) The limits for Paralytic Shellfish Poison (PSP), Amnesic Shellfish Poison (ASP) and lipophilic toxins are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.
Bioassays are the reference method for detecting certain toxins and preventing toxic shellfish from being harvested.
A common framework should be laid down for the presentation of relevant information to other Member States and to the public. (16) Section XI of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 sets out the requirements governing the preparation of frogs' legs and snails intended for human consumption.
Specific requirements, including model health certificates, should also be laid down for imports from third countries of frogs' legs and snails intended for human consumption. (17) Sections XIV and XV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lay down rules on the production and placing on the market of gelatine and collagen intended for human consumption.
In particular in order not to disappoint consumer expectations, the sale as fresh meat of poultrymeat treated with water retention agents should be banned. (22) The opinion of the European Food Safety Authority adopted on 30 August 2004 has demonstrated that fishery products belonging to the family of Gempylidae, in particular Ruvettus pretiosus and Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, may have adverse gastrointestinal effects if consumed under certain conditions.
It is, therefore, necessary to clarify the rules applying to those products and amend Section X, Chapter II of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 accordingly. (26) Section XIV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific health rules for gelatine.
This reference method is already established for live bivalve molluscs from areas A in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs [7].
Consequently, ISO 16649-3 should be specified as the reference MPN (most probable number) method for analysis of E.
coli in bivalve molluscs originating in areas B and C too.
Article 2 Requirements concerning fishery products for the purpose of Regulations (EC) Nos 853/2004 and 854/2004 Requirements concerning fishery products as referred to in Article 11(9) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and Article 18(14) and (15) of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 are set out in Annex II to this Regulation.

CHAPTER II FEEDBACK TO HOLDING OF PROVENANCE 1.
The official veterinarian may use the model document laid down in Appendix I for the relevant inspection results that must be communicated to the holding where the animals were raised before slaughter in the same Member State in accordance with Chapter I of Section II of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004. 2.
CHAPTER II VISUAL INSPECTION 1.
Depending on the system of gutting used, the visual inspection must be carried out: (a) in the case of manual evisceration, in a continuous manner by the handler at the time of evisceration and washing; (b) in the case of mechanical evisceration, by sampling carried out on a representative number of samples being not less than 10 fish per batch. 2.
Unprocessed fishery products belonging to the species categories listed in Chapter II shall be regarded as unfit for human consumption where organoleptic assessment has raised doubts as to their freshness and chemical checks reveal that the following TVB-N limits are exceeded: (a) 25 mg of nitrogen/100 g of flesh for the species referred to in point 1 of Chapter II; (b) 30 mg of nitrogen/100 g of flesh for the species referred to in point 2 of Chapter II (c) 35 mg of nitrogen/100 g of flesh for the species referred to in point 3 of Chapter II.
The reference method to be used for checking the TVB-N limit involves distilling an extract deproteinised by perchloric acid as set out in Chapter III. 2.
The routine methods which may be used to check the TVB-N limit are as follows: - microdiffusion method described by Conway and Byrne (1933), - direct distillation method described by Antonacopoulos (1968), - distillation of an extract deproteinised by trichloracetic acid (Codex Alimentarius Committee on Fish and Fishery Products (1968). 4.
The sample must consist of about 100 g of flesh, taken from at least three different points and mixed together by grinding.
CHAPTER II SPECIES CATEGORIES FOR WHICH TVB-N LIMIT VALUES ARE FIXED 1.
Species belonging to the Pleuronectidae family (with the exception of halibut: Hippoglossus spp.). 3.
This procedure is applicable at TVB-N concentrations of 5 mg/100 g to at least 100 mg/100 g. 2.
Definition "TVB-N concentration" means the nitrogen content of volatile nitrogenous bases as determined by the procedure described.
The concentration shall be expressed in mg/100 g. 3.
Brief description The volatile nitrogenous bases are extracted from a sample using a solution of 0,6 mol perchloric acid.
The TVB-N concentration is determined by titration of the absorbed bases. 4.
Unless otherwise indicated, "solution" means an aqueous solution as follows: (a) perchloric acid solution = 6 g/100 ml; (b) sodium hydroxide solution = 20 g/100 ml; (c) hydrochloric acid standard solution 0,05 mol/l ((0,05 N), Note: When using an automatic distillation apparatus, titration should take place with a hydrochloric acid standard solution of 0,01 mol/l ((0,01 N); (d) boric acid solution = 3 g/100 ml; (e) silicone anti-foaming agent; (f) phenolphtalein solution = 1 g/100 ml 95 % ethanol; (g) indicator solution (Tashiro Mixed Indicator) 2 g methyl-red and 1 g methylene-blue are dissolved in 1000 ml 95 % ethanol. 5.
This is mixed with 90,0 ml perchloric acid solution as specified in point 4(a), homogenised for two minutes with a blender as described in point 5(b), and then filtered.
The steam distillation is regulated so that around 100 ml of distillate is produced in 10 minutes.
The distillation outflow tube is submerged in a receiver with 100 ml boric acid solution as specified in point 4(d), to which three to five drops of the indicator solution as described in point 4(g) have been added.
The volatile bases contained in the receiver solution are determined by titration with standard hydrochloric solution as specified in point 4(c).
Calculation of TVB-N By titration of the receiver solution with hydrochloric acid as in point 4(c), the TVB-N concentration is calculated using the following equation: V1 = Volume of 0,01 mol hydrochloric acid solution in ml for sample V0 = Volume of 0,01 mol hydrochloric acid solution in ml for blank M = Weight of sample in g.
The applied method is correct if the difference between duplicates is not greater than 2 mg/100 g. 2.
CHAPTER IV TVB-N STEAM DISTILLATION APPARATUS +++++ TIFF +++++ -------------------------------------------------- ANNEX III RECOGNISED TESTING METHODS FOR DETECTING MARINE BIOTOXINS The following analytical methods shall be used by the competent authorities to check compliance with the limits laid down in Chapter V(2) of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and, where appropriate, by food business operators.
CHAPTER I PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISON (PSP) DETECTION METHOD 1.
The biological testing method may be carried out in association, if necessary, with another method for detecting Saxitoxin and any of its analogues for which standards are available. 2.
CHAPTER II AMNESIC SHELLFISH POISON (ASP) DETECTION METHOD The total content of amnesic shellfish poison (ASP) of edible parts of molluscs (the entire body or any part edible separately) must be detected using the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method or any other recognised method.
CHAPTER III LIPOPHILIC TOXIN DETECTION METHODS A.
Biological methods 1.
Where two out of three mice die within 24 hours of inoculation with an extract equivalent to 5 g hepatopancreas or 25 g whole body, this shall be considered a positive result for the presence of one or more toxins as referred to in Chapter V(2)(c), (d) and (e) of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 at levels above those laid down. 4.
Where two out of three mice die within 24 hours of inoculation with an extract equivalent to 5 g hepatopancreas or 25 g whole body, this shall be considered a positive result for the presence of okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins and azaspiracids at levels above those laid down in Chapter V(2)(c) and (e) of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. 5.
A diarrhetic response in any of the three rats shall be considered a positive result for the presence of okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins and azaspiracids at levels above those laid down in Chapter V(2)(c) and (e) of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.
Alternative detection methods 1.
A series of methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorimetric detection, liquid chromatography (LC), mass spectrometry (MS), immunoassays and functional assays, such as the phosphatase inhibition assay, shall be used as alternatives or supplementary to the biological testing methods, provided that either alone or combined they can detect at least the following analogues, that they are not less effective than the biological methods and that their implementation provides an equivalent level of public health protection: - okadaic acid and dinophysistoxins: a hydrolysis step may be required to detect the presence of DTX3, - pectenotoxins: PTX1 and PTX2, - yessotoxins: YTX, 45 OH YTX, homo YTX, and 45 OH homo YTX, - azaspiracids: AZA1, AZA2 and AZA3. 2.
CHAPTER II FORMAT FOR NATIONAL WEBSITES A.
Each Member State shall provide the Commission with a linking address to a single national website containing the masterlist of lists of approved food establishments for products of animal origin as defined in point 8(1) of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. 2.
Operational chart 1.
