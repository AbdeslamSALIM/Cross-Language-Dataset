PROCEDURE (6) In December 2002, the German company Degussa AG informed the Commission of the existence of a cartel in the Methacrylates industry and expressed the wish to cooperate with the Commission under the 2002 Leniency Notice.
The Oral Hearing, which all the addressees attended, was held on 15 and 16 December 2005.
The Commission notes that in 2005, the most recent financial year preceding this Decision, the total turnovers of the undertakings were as follows: Degussa AG: EUR 11,75 million; Total SA: EUR 143,168 million and ICI PLC: EUR 8,49 million. (16) Accordingly and in line with previous decisions, the Commission considers it appropriate to multiply the fine for Total/Atofina, Degussa and ICI.
On 27 January 2003 the Commission granted Degussa conditional immunity from fines in accordance with point 15 of the Leniency Notice.
Lucite was awarded a reduction of 30 % of the fine.
Immunity under point 23 (24) Lucite’s evidence enabled the Commission to extend the cartel from 28 February 2001 until 12 September 2002.
