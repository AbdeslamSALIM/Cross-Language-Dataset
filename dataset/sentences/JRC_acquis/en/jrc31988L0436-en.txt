However, in respect of vehicles equipped with a direct-injection compression-ignition engine, that date shall be postponed until 1 October 1996.
Article 4 Before the end of 1989, the Council shall decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, the implementation of a second stage for further reduction in the limit values for particulate pollutant emissions.
Article 5 This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

For a vehicle of a given category the mass of the carbon monoxide, the combined mass of the hydrocarbons and the nitrogen oxides, the mass of the nitrogen oxides, and - in the case of vehicles equipped with compression-ignition engines - the mass of the particulates obtained in the test must be less than the amounts shown in the table below: Engine capacity C (in cm³) Mass of carbon monoxide L1 (g/test) Combined mass of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides L2 (g/test) Mass of nitrogen oxides L3 (g/test) Mass of particulates (¹) L4 (g/test) C %gt%2 000 25 6,5 3,5 1 400 §C §2 000 30 8, C %lt% 1 400 45 15, 6, aa A a A s 1,1 (¹) In the case of vehicles equipped with compression-ignition engines. 6. 8. 88 Official Journal of the European Communities Vehicles equipped with compression-ignition engines whose engine capacity exceeds 2 000 cm³ must comply with the limit values for the emission of pollutant gases, corresponding to the category of engine capacities ranging from 1 400 cm³ to 2 000 cm³.' 5.2.1.1.4.1.
These limit values are deemed to be met if they are not exceeded by the results of tests on a vehicle type in which the individual masses of pollutants are multiplied by the relevant deterioration factor set out in the table below: Exhaust gas clean-up system Deterioration factor CO HC NOx Particulates (¹) 1.
Compression-ignition engine 1,1 1,0 1,0 1,2 (¹) In the case of vehicles equipped with a compression-ignition engine.
The sampling probe for the test gas flow for particulates shall be so arranged within the dilution tract that a representative sample gas flow can be taken from the homogeneous air/exhaust mixture and an air/exhaust gas mixture temperature of 52 gC is not exceeded at the sampling point.
The temperature of the gas flow in the flow meter cannot fluctuate more than ± 3 K, nor can the mass flow rate fluctuate by more than ± 5 %.
The mass m of particulate pollutant emissions from the vehicle during the test is defined by weighing the mass of particulates collected by the two filters, m¹ by the first filter, m² by the second filter: - if 0,95 (m¹ + m²) § m¹, m = m¹, - if 0,85 (m¹ + m²) § m¹ %lt% 0,95 (m¹ + m²), m = m¹ + m², - if m¹ %lt% 0,85 (m¹ + m²), the test is cancelled.
Its internal diameter may not exceed 105 mm. 2.4.3.
The sample gas flow measuring unit consists of pumps, gas flow regulators and flow measuring units. 2.4.7.
It must have a minimum internal diameter of 4 mm. 2.4.8.
Emissions of gaseous pollutants are calculated by means of the following equation: Mi = Vmix · Qi · kH · Ci · 10-6 where: Vmix: Mi: Pollutant i emissions in g/test; Vmix: Volume of the diluted exhaust gas expressed in l/test and corrected to standard conditions (273,2 K and 101,33 kPa); Qi: Density of the pollutant i in g/l at normal temperature and pressure (273,2 K and 101,33 kPa); kH: Humidity correction factor used for the calculation of the emissions of nitrogen oxides (there is no humidity correction for HC and CO); Ci: Concentration of the pollutant i in the diluted exhaust gas, expressed in ppm and corrected by the concentration of the pollutant i in the dilution air. 1.2.
HC measurement for compression-ignition engines The average HC concentration used in determining the HC mass emissions from compression-ignition engines is calculated with the aid of the following formula: ce = t2 cHC · dt t2 cHC · dt ce = t1 t2-t1 where: t2 t1 cHC · dt: Integral of the recording of the heated HFID throughout the test (t2 - t1), ce: Concentration of HC measured in the diluted exhaust, in ppm, ce: is substituted directly for Chc in all relevant equations. 2.2.
Add the following under the Title. ´The systems coincide with those described in item 3 in Appendix 5 to Annex III, with the exception that in each case three sample bags for exhaust gas samples and ambient air samples are arranged in parallel in such a way that they can in turn have the sample gas flow directed towards them via quick-acting valves.
Accordingly, in the tests on vehicles equipped with diesel engines, three pairs of particulate-measurement filters are arranged in parallel.' APPENDIX 8: This appendix now reads as follows: ´APPENDIX 8 CALCULATION OF THE EMISSION OF POLLUTANTS 1.
Pollutant emissions are calculated by means of the following equation: Ms = 0,43 MicT + Mis + 0,57 MiHT + Mis Ms = 0,43 MicT + Mis ScT + Ss + 0,57 MiHT + Mis SHT + Ss where: MiHT: Ms: pollutant emissions in g/km for the complete test; MicT: pollutant emissions in grams during the first phase (transient cold); MiHT: pollutant emissions in grams during the final phase (transient hot); Mis: pollutant emissions in grams during the second phase (stabilized); ScT: distance covered (in km) during the final phase; SHT: distance covered (in km) during the final phase; Ss: distance covered (in km) during the second phase. 2.
The total emission is calculated in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Appendix.' EWG:L111UMBE07.96 FF: 1UEN; SETUP: 01; Hoehe: 508 mm; 114 Zeilen; 5825 Zeichen; Bediener: FJJ0 Pr.: B; Kunde: 42161 l111umbe07
