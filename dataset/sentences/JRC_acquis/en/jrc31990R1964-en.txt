ANNEX 1.2.3 // // // // Description of goods // Classification CN code // Reasons // // // // (1) // (2) // (3) // // // // // // // 1.
An electrical control apparatus, known as a 'joystick', consisting of a plastic housing (dimensions: 8 × 8 × 5,5 cm) with, on its top, a lever and two push-buttons.
The computer reads the resistance values, 'translates' them and converts them into cursor movements on the monitor screen. // 8473 30 00 // Classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 8473 and 8473 30 00.
Inside the housing there is a plastic contact bearing, two rollers at 90 ° to each other, a stroboscopic disc, a light source and a printed circuit board with diodes and an integrated circuit. // 8473 30 00 // The classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 8473 and 8473 30 00.
Battery-backed integrated circuit sockets consisting of: - a 28-pin, dual in-line package socket measuring 18 × 36 mm, - not more than two lithium batteries in the socket, - a C-MOS controller circuit in the form of an integrated circuit filled to the socket.
In this way, the stored data are write-protected and preserved for a period of several years. // 8506 19 10 // The classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 3 (b) and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomencalture and by the text of CN codes 8506 and 8506 19 10.
The character of the unit is given by the lithium battery which provides, as required, the principal function. // 4.
The socket is for attachment to the base of a cathode ray tube in order to enable this tube to be easily connected to the circuitry of the television receiver. // 8535 90 00 // The classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, by note 2 (a) to Section XVI and by the text of CN codes 8535 and 8535 90 00.
These goods are not parts of cathode ray tubes but rather sockets used to connect such a tube to the circuitry of the finished apparatus. // // // // Description of goods // Classification CN code // Reasons // // // // (1) // (2) // (3) // // // // // 6.
The bins are double skinned with a layer of foam plastic between the skins. // 9403 20 99 // The classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature and by the text of CN codes 9403, 9403 20 and 9403 20 99.
