Initiation (1) On 28 May 2004, the Commission announced by a notice ("notice of initiation"), published in the Official Journal of the European Union [2], the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America ("USA") and Russia and the initiation of an interim review of the anti-dumping duty on imports of certain grain oriented electrical sheets with a width of more than 500 mm originating in Russia. (2) The anti-dumping proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 13 April 2004 by the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries ("Eurofer" or "the complainant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 90 %, of the total Community production of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel.
The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the said product and of material injury resulting there from, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. (3) The interim review was initiated by the Commission on its own initiative, pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, in order to allow for any necessary amendment or repeal of the definitive anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 151/2003 [3] on imports from Russia of grain oriented electrical sheets with a width of more than 500 mm.
The interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation. (5) The exporting producers in Russia and the USA, as well as Community producers, importers/traders and users made their views known in writing.
Replies were also received from four Community producers, 16 users and one importer not related to an exporting producer in the countries concerned. (8) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping, resulting injury and Community interest.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies: Community producers - ThyssenKrupp Electrical Steel UGO, Isbergues, France - ThyssenKrupp Electrical Steel AST, Terni, Italy - ThyssenKrupp Electrical Steel GmbH, Gelsenkirchen, Germany - Orb Electrical Steels Limited, Newport, United Kingdom Users in the Community - Areva S.A., Paris, France - Specialacciai srl, Novi Ligure, Italy Exporting producers in Russia - Novolipetsky Iron %amp% Steel Corporation ("NLMK"), Lipetsk - VIZ Stal, Ekaterinburg Exporting producers in the USA - AK Steel Corporation, Butler, Pennsylvania Related importers in the Community - AK Steel BV, Oosterhout, The Netherlands - AK Steel GmbH, Köln, Germany - AK Steel Ltd., Baldock, United Kingdom - AK Steel s.r.l., Genova, Italy - Duferco Commerciale SpA, Genova, Italy - Duferco GmbH, Mülheim, Germany Related importers outside the Community - Duferco SA, Lugano, Switzerland - Stinol AG, Lugano, Switzerland (9) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (the "investigation period" or "IP").
Measures in force (10) By Council Regulation (EC) No 151/2003, definitive anti-dumping duties were imposed on imports from Russia of grain oriented electrical sheets with a width of more than 500 mm ("large GOES"), following an investigation that was initiated pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.
By that Regulation, anti-dumping duty rates were set for imports from VIZ-Stal at 14,7 % and for imports from NLMK at 40,1 %, the latter rate at the same time being the residual duty rate for imports of these products from other companies in Russia. (11) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1000/2004 [4], undertakings, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of large GOES originating in Russia, were accepted from NLMK and Viz Stal and their related sales companies for a period of six months until 20 November 2004.
Undertakings were accepted for a further period of six months until 20 May 2005, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1995/2004 [5], because the conditions for their acceptance were considered to be still in existence. 5.
Consequently, the claims made by this exporting producer were rejected. (22) It is therefore concluded that, for the purpose of the present anti-dumping proceeding, all types of the product concerned are regarded as one product. 2.
Like product (23) The product exported to the Community from Russia and the USA, the product produced and sold domestically in Russia and the USA, as well as the one manufactured and sold in the Community by the Community producers were found to have the same basic physical and technical characteristics as well as the same basic uses and are therefore considered as like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
General Methodology (24) In order to determine the normal value, the Commission first established, for each exporting producer, whether its total domestic sales of the product concerned were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community.
In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, domestic sales were considered representative when the total domestic sales volume of each exporting producer was at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community. (25) For each type sold by the exporting producers on their domestic markets and found to be directly comparable with the type of the product concerned sold for export to the Community, it was established whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
Domestic sales of a particular type of GOES were considered sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable type of GOES exported to the Community. (26) Subsequently it was examined whether the domestic sales of each type of the product of each exporting producer could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the type in question. (27) In cases where the sales volume of the GOES type, sold at a net sales price equal to or above the calculated cost of production, represented more than 80 % of the total sales volume of that type and where the weighted average price of that type was equal to or above the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of the prices of all domestic sales made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not.
In cases where the volume of profitable sales of a GOES type represented 80 % or less of the total sales volume of that type or where the weighted average price of that type was below the cost of production, normal value was based on the actual domestic price, calculated as a weighted average of profitable sales of that type only, provided that these sales represented 10 % or more of the total sales volume of that type.
Moreover, it was established that the weighted average selling price of the domestic transactions was below the weighted average per unit cost of production during the IP. (30) As a consequence, domestic prices of the product concerned sold by the exporting producer could not be used in order to establish normal value.
The amounts established for SG%amp%A costs and profit were those applicable to production and sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the same general category of steel products for the exporting producer in question in the domestic market, in accordance with Article 2(6)(b) of the basic Regulation. (32) The full cost of production was determined for each relevant product type, according to steel grade, thickness and the fact whether the product concerned was sold as a full coil or as a slit coil.
Export price (33) The export prices were determined on the basis of the prices paid or payable for the product concerned when sold for consumption in the Community in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation. (34) The exporting producer did not sell any quantity of the product concerned directly to independent customers in the Community.
Comparison (35) For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price at an ex-works level and at the same level of trade, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences that were claimed and demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
Adjustments were made in respect of transport costs, insurance, credit costs and related bank charges, import charges and slitting costs where applicable and justified. (36) The adjustment for slitting costs was necessary in order to allow for the proper comparison of GOES according to whether they were imported as full width coils and subsequently sold as such in the Community or imported as full width coils and sold after slitting in the Community or imported as slit material and sold as such or after further slitting in the Community, in accordance with Article 2(10)(k) of the basic Regulation.
Dumping margin (37) In accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export prices per product type, as determined above. (38) On that basis, a dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the CIF Community frontier price duty unpaid was established as follows: AK Steel Corporation, Middletown: 47,6 % (39) For USA, since there was evidence of a known exporter that deliberately did not cooperate to the investigation, the residual dumping margin for this non-cooperating exporting producer should be set at the level of the highest margin measured for sales of representative product types by the cooperating producer in the Community i.e. 60,6 %. 3.
For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were claimed and demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability.
A dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the CIF import price at the Community border, duty unpaid is the following: NLMK, Lipetsk: 11,5 % VIZ STAL Normal value (50) It was found that domestic sales of the product concerned were overall representative, but not made in the ordinary course of trade since such sales were made in substantial quantities below per unit cost, in this case more than 90 % of the volume sold in the transactions under consideration.
Export price (55) Viz Stal did not sell the product concerned directly to independent customers in the Community.
All sales were made to related subsidiaries in the Community.
Adjustments were made in respect of transport costs, insurance, handling costs, bank charges, credit costs and related bank charges, import costs and slitting costs where applicable and justified. (57) The adjustment for slitting costs was necessary in order to allow for the proper comparison of GOES according to whether they were imported as full width coils and subsequently sold as such in the Community or imported as full width coils and sold after slitting in the Community or imported as slit material and sold as such or after further slitting in the Community, in accordance with Article 2(10)(k) of the basic Regulation.
Dumping margin (58) In accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the dumping margin was established on the basis of a comparison of the weighted average normal value with the weighted average export prices per product type, as determined above. (59) Regarding the exports made by this exporting producer to the Community, the investigation did not lead to a finding of dumping. (60) The conclusion of non-dumped imports into the Community was reached for both full coils and slit coils of all different product types and consequently covered both large and narrow GOES.
The residual dumping margin was set at the level of the margin for the exporting producer for whom dumping was found.
COMMUNITY INDUSTRY 1.
It should be noted that these three producers belong to the same group.
The total production of these four companies was found to represent around 90 % of the total Community production of the product concerned. (65) It is therefore considered that these four Community producers constitute the Community industry within the meaning of Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation and will hereafter be referred to as the "Community industry". (66) As to the two remaining Community producers, one remained silent and the other one, although supporting the proceeding, could not be considered part of the Community industry since it only provided some basic information on its production and sales volume.
Community consumption (67) Community consumption was established on the basis of the sales on the Community market of (a) the Community industry, (b) the other Community producers, which also provided some general information, and (c) the imports into the Community market from all third countries as reported by Eurostat and also considering the data submitted by the cooperating exporting producers in the countries concerned. (68) On this basis, the Community consumption developed as follows: | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Community Consumption (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 108 | 96 | 92 | 92 | (69) The Community consumption firstly increased by 8 % between 2000 and 2001, but then significantly and continuously dropped by 15 %.
During the overall period under examination, the decrease in consumption was 8 %.
Imports from the countries concerned Cumulative assessment of the effects of the dumped imports concerned (70) The Commission considered whether the effects of dumped imports from the countries concerned should be assessed cumulatively, on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 3(4) of the basic Regulation.
This led to an overall price depression of GOES sold by the Community industry. (74) It is therefore concluded that the dumped imports originating in the countries concerned should be assessed cumulatively.
Volume and market share of the dumped imports concerned Dumped Import volume | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Import volume (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 161 | 191 | 323 | 357 | (75) The above table shows that the imports of GOES from the countries concerned into the Community more than tripled during the period under examination.
Market share of dumped imports | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Market share | 3,3 % | 5,0 % | 6,6 % | 11,8 % | 13,0 % | (76) The constant increase in market share took place in the context of an overall decreasing Community consumption.
The average price decrease was especially marked between 2002 and 2003 (–20 %).
During the overall period under examination the decrease of the average unit price of the dumped imports was 2 %.
Undercutting (78) The Commission has examined whether the exporting producers in the countries concerned undercut the prices of the Community industry during the IP.
These prices have then been compared to the Community industry's ex-works prices at the same level of trade, and at the level of comparable product types. (79) One Russian exporting producer claimed that when assessing price undercutting (and injury elimination margin), adjustments should be made with respect to quality differences between GOES produced and sold by this exporting producer and those produced by the Community industry.
The claim was therefore rejected. (82) On the basis of the cooperating exporting producers' prices, the undercutting margins found, by country, and expressed as a percentage of the Community industry's prices, are as follows: Country | Price Undercutting | USA | 14,4 % | Russia | Between 6,1 % and 26,6 % | (83) As far as Russia is concerned, the undercutting margin of 6,1 % was established for the exporting producer for which no dumping margin was found.
Production, production capacity and capacity utilisation | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Production (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 104 | 101 | 99 | 98 | Capacity (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 104 | 107 | 104 | 104 | Capacity utilisation | 86 % | 86 % | 81 % | 82 % | 81 % | (86) During the overall period under examination, the Community industry's production volume decreased by 2 %.
The increase in production capacity in the years 2001/2002 was designed to match the surge in demand in 2001.
It should also be noted that the increase in capacity occurred at a time when the Community industry was still profitable.
Stocks | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | metric tonnes | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 109 | 160 | 182 | 122 | (89) Certain types of the like product are specifically produced by the Community industry to order and are therefore not destined for stocks.
It is therefore clear that the overall increase of stocks during the period under examination indicates that the Community industry faced difficulties to sell the more standardised types of the like product especially during 2002, when stocks increased by 46 % compared to 2001, and in 2003 when they further increased by 3,5 % as compared to the previous year. (90) The decrease of the stocks (23,5 %) between 2003 and the IP is explained by an overall increase of sales during that period.
Sales volume | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | metric tonnes | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 109 | 90 | 76 | 81 | (91) The Community industry's sales volume on the Community market decreased by 19 % during the period under examination, from around [...] tonnes in 2000 to around [...] tonnes in the IP.
The increase between 2003 and the IP can be explained by the fact that the Community industry decreased its sales prices (see below) in order regain market share.
Market share | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | In % Community consumption | 68,6 % | 69,1 % | 63,8 % | 56,5 % | 60,4 % | (92) During the overall period under examination, the Community industry faced a drop of market share of 8,2 percentage points.
More specifically, in spite of a 9 % increase in sales volume between 2000 and 2001, the Community industry could barely maintain its level of market share which only increased by 0,5 percentage point during those years.
In the period from 2001 to the IP, the Community industry's market share dropped by 8,7 percentage points.
Sales prices | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | EUR/metric tonne | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 109 | 111 | 106 | 99 | (93) The average unit sales price first increased by 8,6 % in 2001, then rose by 2,6 % in 2002.
Thereafter, the Community industry faced a significant and continuous drop in prices, which was especially marked between 2003 and the IP when prices fell by 6,3 %.
hot rolled coils representing on average around 70 % of the total cost of production of the product concerned: Index: 2000 = 100 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | unit price | 100 | 109 | 111 | 106 | 99 | unit full cost of production | 100 | 103 | 107 | 105 | 106 | (97) In the period 2001/2002, sales prices have on average increased more than their corresponding costs.
In 2003, prices significantly dropped, and profitability became negative, in spite of a decrease of the average cost during that year.
Profitability and return on investments | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | % Profit on net turnover | Around 0 % | Around 5 % | Around 3 % | Around 0 % | Around –5 % | Return on investments | Around 0 % | Around 25 % | Around 20 % | Around –5 % | Around –30 % | (98) The financial results of certain Community producers in 2000 were significantly affected by start-up costs and also technical problems related to a significant investment in 1999, concerning the production tool.
The Community industry's sales on the Community market became profitable during the years 2001 and 2002, also in view of a higher demand from the downstream industry and a satisfactory price level.
Thereafter, the significant drop in prices had a direct negative effect on the profitability.
It went up from around 0 % in 2000 to around 20 % in 2002 and then decreased continuously to around –30 % in the IP.
Cash flow and ability to raise capital | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | ‘000 EUR | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 181 | 141 | 7 | –83 | (100) The net cash in(out) flow from operating activities, developed from around XX million EUR in 2000 to around -XX million EUR in the IP.
It peaked in 2001 and 2002, but subsequently dropped sharply in 2003 and reached a low during the IP.
As a consequence, the Community industry is, on average, increasingly resorting to debt in order to help finance its current activity and investment. (101) The investigation has shown that capital requirements of several Community producers have been adversely affected by their difficult financial situation.
Investments | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | ‘000 EUR | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 137 | 105 | 76 | 49 | (102) The Community industry's total investments related to the like product decreased by around 50 % between 2000 and the IP.
Growth (103) Between 2000 and the IP, Community consumption decreased by 8 %, while the sales volume of the Community industry decreased by 20 %.
Employment | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Total employees | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 100 | 99 | 97 | 95 | (104) The level of employment of the Community industry remained stable between 2000 and the 2001.
It was reduced in the following years resulting in a total reduction of 5 % compared to the beginning of the period under examination.
Wages | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Wages (000 EUR) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 99 | 102 | 97 | 94 | Avg.
Productivity | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Production (m tonnes) (a) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Employment (b) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Productivity (a)/(b) | 160,4 | 166,9 | 163,9 | 164,2 | 166 | Index 2000 = 100 | 100 | 104 | 102 | 102 | 103 | (106) Productivity of the Community industry's workforce, measured as output per person employed per year, first increased by 4 % from 2000 to 2001, then dropped by around 2 % between 2001 and 2002, and rose again in 2003 and the IP.
The increase in productivity may be partially explained by the investments aimed at improving efficiency of existing equipments as stated in recital (102) above.
Community industry price increase (112) It was argued that the Community industry announced a price increase after the investigation period, and that this price increase was of an exceptional nature since it is described in the press as unusually large. (113) Actual data have been gathered by the Commission services and the evolution of the average Community sales price on the Community market are presented in the table below: Average sales price | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Apr-Dec 2004 | EUR/metric tonne | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 109 | 111 | 106 | 99 | 104 | (114) From the above table it can be seen that if prices indeed increased after the investigation period, this price increase is far from being unusually large.
Indeed, the average price for the 3 last quarters of 2004 increased by only 5 % as compared to their IP level, but prices did certainly not recover as compared to the previous years' level. (115) In addition, even if it was considered that the price increase was indeed of an exceptional nature — which it is recalled is not the case here — consideration should also be taken of the evolution, after the investigation period, of the price level of the other operators on the Community market, and especially that of the countries concerned, as well as the fluctuation of the raw material price, in order to verify whether the increase of prices would indeed make the imposition of the anti-dumping duties manifestly inappropriate.
Therefore, any possible price increases, even if they were of an exceptional and lasting nature, would not, taken in isolation, make the imposition of measures inappropriate, if they were not accompanied by similar developments of other injury indicators in such a way that the complete injury picture were affected. (117) For the above reasons, it is considered that the Community industry price increase that might have occurred after the investigation period does not make the imposition of measures inappropriate.
Closure of one producer of the Community industry (118) Certain interested parties claimed that the closure of one of the producers that is part of the Community industry calls for the non imposition of measures since it would result in a significant decrease of the production capacity in the Community, thus possibly generating a shortage of GOES on the Community market. (119) In that respect, it is noted that Article 6(1) of the basic Regulation concerning events occurring after the investigation period does not apply to the determination of the Community interest which is dealt with by Article 21 of the basic Regulation.
Reference is therefore made to recital (174) where the issue related to production capacity is addressed in the framework of the Community interest analysis. (120) It should nevertheless be confirmed that the plant closure of the producer located in Italy has been announced, and that production there will continue at reduced level as from June 2005 and is expected to completely cease in September of the same year. (121) Moreover, even if the envisaged closure of a plant might constitute an exceptional event, of a lasting nature, and were therefore considered in the context of the analysis, it would only reinforce the above findings that the Community industry was suffering injury during the investigation period, and that this precarious situation continued after the investigation period. 5.
Conclusion on injury (122) In spite of the existing anti-dumping measures concerning imports of large GOES from Russia, the economic situation of the Community industry significantly deteriorated between 2000 and the IP.
In addition, reference is also made to the recital (17), where it is explained that the anti-dumping measures in force against large GOES from Russia were avoided by cutting the coils of grain-oriented electrical steel in two halves not exceeding 500 mm. (123) Over this period under examination sales volume decreased by 19 %, production decreased by 2 %, stocks significantly increased by 18 %, and market shares dropped by 8 percentage points.
As a result, the industry made losses in 2003 and in the IP.
Employment and investments respectively decreased by 5 % and 50 % over the period under examination. (124) More specifically, the economic situation of the Community industry developed as follows.
This resulted in a profitable situation and the industry was therefore in a position to invest and slightly increase its production capacity.
Even if sales volume and market shares dropped in 2002, the Community industry managed to maintain its price level, and to remain profitable, albeit at a level below that of 2001 in view also of the increasing cost of production at that time. (125) As from 2003, the Community industry could no longer maintain its prices, which significantly dropped, in conjunction with a strong fall in sales volume and market shares.
Indeed, after the investigation period, the production plant of one of the Community producers will have to close down. (126) In the light of the foregoing it is concluded that the Community industry has suffered material injury within the meaning of Article 3 of the basic Regulation.
Introduction (127) In accordance with Articles 3(6) and 3(7) of the basic Regulation, the Commission examined whether the dumped imports of the product concerned originating in the countries concerned have caused injury to the Community industry to a degree that enables it to be classified as material.
Effects of the dumped imports (128) The significant increase of the volume of the dumped imports, which more than tripled during the period under examination, coincided with the deterioration of the economic situation of the Community industry, which materialised amongst others by a drop in sales volume of around 20 % during the same period.
As a matter of fact, in the period 2002/2003, the dumped imports gained more than 5 percentage points of market shares, while the Community industry's share dropped by around 7 points.
This resulted in an important drop in the Community industry's sales volume during the corresponding period.
This had however a direct negative impact on its profitability which became negative and reached –7,4 % of turnover during the IP. (130) In view of the clearly established coincidence in time between, on the one hand, the surge of dumped imports at continuously decreasing prices and, on the other hand, the Community industry's loss of sales volume, market shares and price depression resulting in a loss-making situation, it is concluded that the dumped imports played a determining role in the injurious situation of the Community industry. 3.
Effects of other factors Exchange rate effect (131) One interested party claimed that the injury suffered by the Community industry was caused by the development of the USD/EUR exchange rate, which had a decreasing impact on the prices of imports from the USA.
This situation thus favoured the USA imports which were able to increase their market shares. (132) The table below compares the development of the USD/EUR exchange rate with the average import prices of the product concerned originating in the US. | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | USD/EUR exchange rate | 1,082 | 1,116 | 1,068 | 0,894 | 0,860 | Index 2000 = 100 | 100 | 103 | 99 | 83 | 79 | Import price US (EUR) | 1945 | 1741 | 1543 | 1171 | 1133 | Index 2000 = 100 | 100 | 90 | 79 | 60 | 58 | (133) It appears from the above data that there is no clear correlation between the development of the USD/EUR exchange rate and the average import prices of the product concerned originating in the USA.
Indeed, during the period 2000-2002 import prices already decreased by 21 %, while exchange rates remained stable.
Moreover, the above data clearly indicates that, over the period under examination, the decrease of the relevant average import prices (–42 %) was much stronger than the negative development of the exchange rate (–21 %).
Performance of other Community producers | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Sales volume (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | market shares | 9,2 % | 8,8 % | 8,3 % | 8,2 % | 8,3 % | (134) The above table shows that the sales of the other Community producers on the Community market decreased by almost 20 % during the period under examination.
The corresponding market shares have also decreased from 9,2 % in 2000 to 8,3 % during the investigation period.
Export performance of the Community industry | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Sales volume export (tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 92 | 117 | 145 | 141 | (135) One interested party claimed that part of the injury suffered by the Community industry could be attributed to the export performance of the Community industry.
In fact, in the year 2001, when the situation on the Community market became favourable, the Community industry increased its domestic sales volume, and exports sales were reduced. (138) In addition, it should be noted that the injury suffered by the Community industry did not only consist in a loss of sales volume and market shares on the Community market.
Non-dumped imports from the countries concerned | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Import volume (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Index: 2000 = 100 | 100 | 124 | 142 | 223 | 166 | Market shares | 3,3 % | 3,8 % | 4,9 % | 8,1 % | 6,0 % | (139) Non-dumped imports from Russia increased by 66 % during the period under examination, corresponding to a market share gain of almost 3 percentage points. (140) In that respect, it should firstly be noted that this increase of imports was less marked than that of the dumped imports, as stated in recital 75 above.
Indeed, whilst an undercutting margin of 6,1 % was established in the case of the non-dumped imports, the undercutting margin for the dumped imports ranged between 14,4 % and 26,6 %. (141) For those reasons it is concluded that any impact of non-dumped imports on the situation of the Community industry was limited and could not be considered as a determining reason for the injurious situation of the Community industry.
Imports from other third countries | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | IP | Import volume (metric tonnes) | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | [...] | Market shares | 15,6 % | 13,3 % | 16,4 % | 15,4 % | 12,2 % | Average unit price | 1370 | 1477 | 1581 | 1525 | 1509 | (142) The table above indicates that imports from other third countries decreased in absolute and relative terms.
It is therefore concluded that the imports from other third countries did not contribute to the injury suffered by the Community industry.
Whilst the Community industry, the other Community producers and the other third countries lost sales volume and market share during the period under examination, the volume of dumped imports more than tripled and gained significant market share during the same period.
As shown in the injury analysis, the demand declined by around 25000 tonnes during the period under examination, the Community industry's sales dropped by around 40000 tonnes but the imports from the countries concerned increased by around 30000 tonnes. (144) In this context, even if the decline in demand may have contributed to the sales decrease of the Community industry, it is concluded that the injury consisting mainly in a loss of market shares, price depression and a loss-making situation, can only be attributed, if at all, to a minor extent to that factor. 4.
Conclusion on causation (145) In conclusion, it is confirmed that the material injury suffered by the Community industry, which is characterised especially by a decline in sales volume, market shares and unit sales price resulting in a deterioration of the profitability indicators, was caused by the dumped imports concerned. (146) Indeed, there is a clear coincidence in time between the surge of dumped imports and the drop of the Community industry's sales volume and market share.
The Community industry tried to maintain its level of prices in 2003, but had no other choice than to follow the price level set by the dumped imports in order to maintain a certain level of sales.
The decrease in consumption may have contributed to a decrease in the Community industry's sales volume.
Finally, the development of the USD/EUR exchange rate did not explain the high level of dumping established for the USA and the injury suffered by the Community industry. (148) It is therefore concluded that the dumped imports originating in the countries concerned have caused material injury to the Community industry within the meaning of Article 3(6) of the basic Regulation.
This was the case in the years 2001 and 2002, when the Community industry also benefited from the anti-dumping measures in force against large GOES from Russia, and the level of the dumped imports concerned was not yet as significant as it was during the IP. (151) It is also recalled that this industry has undergone a major restructuring programme in the Community in 1999.
The merging of the three complainants at that time was intended to create a larger entity which could compete more effectively and increase investments. (152) As from the year 2002, the continuous increase of low priced dumped imports caused a general price depression on the Community market, which also faced a declining consumption.
In the absence of the imposition of measures, it cannot be excluded that the Community industry will face further plant closures. (154) In conclusion, any imposition of anti-dumping measures would allow the Community industry to recover from the effects of injurious dumping found. 2.
Interest of users in the Community (155) GOES are mainly used in the manufacture of power and distribution transformers.
According to the financial information they submitted, cooperating users would represent around 30 % of the overall Community consumption. (158) Users generally expressed their opposition to the imposition of measures.
Firstly, they claimed that the imposition of anti-dumping measures would result in the cessation of imports from the countries concerned and therefore make them dependent on the Community industry, which would arguably also find itself in a monopolistic situation.
They further claimed that the imposition of measures would result in a significant price increase, thus negatively affecting their competitiveness vis-à-vis the non-Community transformer industry.
There are two producers each in Japan, the USA and Russia, one each in South Korea, China and Brazil and six in the European Community (from which three are related).
In other words, cooperating users overall relied mainly on other sources of supply: 75 % of their purchases were from non-dumped sources, from which around 60 % was purchased from the Community industry.
Only one user exclusively purchased GOES from dumped sources, but it recently switched to Community industry supply. (163) Against this background, and considering the first claim made by the users that they would become dependent exclusively on the Community industry supplies, it should firstly be recalled that the objective of anti-dumping duties is not to close off the Community market from any imports, but to restore a situation of fair trade by removing the effect of injurious dumping.
Imports from the countries concerned are therefore not expected to come to an end, but to continue, albeit at non-dumped or non-injurious price levels. (164) This is certainly the case for Russia since no dumping margin was established for the major Russian exporting producer, representing around 75 % of the Russian imports during the IP, and since only a relatively limited margin of dumping, i.e. 11,5 % as established for the other exporting producer.
It is therefore expected that imports from the countries concerned will not cease. (167) Because the imports from the countries concerned are expected to continue, and since alternative sources of supply still exist, the claim that the imposition of anti-dumping duties would result in the Community industry being in a monopolistic situation is unfounded.
Indeed, not only imports from the countries concerned are expected to continue, but also those from other third countries.
Also, as already mentioned above, as far as Russia is concerned, in view of the level of the measures established by the present investigation and since those measures would replace the existing measures concerning large GOES (see recital 194, 195), anti-dumping measures based on the current findings would overall have a lesser impact than the measures in force during the IP.
Moreover, the Community industry's production capacity is larger than the overall Community consumption during the IP.
This argument is however ambiguous since it would, rather call for protection of the Community industry against dumped imports, in order to prevent further plant closures thus maintaining production capacity. (176) Moreover, it should be noted that even after the announced plant closure, the overall Community industry's production capacity will still be larger than the Community demand during the IP, and that it is the intention of the remaining producers to invest in their production capacities in order to further guarantee a sufficient supply on the Community market.
This gives an indication that any measures based on the current findings are also expected not to have a significant negative impact on the user industry. (178) For all the above reasons it can be concluded that, in case of imposition of measures, users of the product concerned overall would not exclusively depend on the Community industry, that in many circumstances the purchase price of the users would not be directly affected by the imposition of any measures, or only in a moderate way, and that there would be no shortage of GOES supply overall in the future on the Community market. 3.
Furthermore, it appears that around 75 % of this importer's turnover does not relate to the product concerned.
It should also be considered that it is also in the interest of the users that viable and competitive Community producers remain active on a market that is no longer distorted by unfair trade practices. (182) Indeed, in view of the limited sources of supply worldwide, it is also in the interest of the Community users that sources of supply in the Community are not further weakened by dumped imports which could result in a further decrease of the Community industry's activity, thus make users of GOES progressively more dependent on imported material.
It is to be noted that this level of profit was also used for the determination of the injury margin in the framework of the investigation that led to the imposition of the measures currently in place concerning GOES with a width of more than 500 mm.
Definitive duties (186) In the light of the foregoing, and in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, it is considered that definitive anti-dumping measures should be imposed in respect of imports originating in Russia and the USA at the level of the lowest of the dumping and injury margins, in accordance with the lesser duty rule. (187) On the basis of the above, the proposed definitive duties are as follows: Country | Company | Anti-dumping duty | United States of America | AK Steel Corporation | 31,5 % | | All other companies | 37,8 % | Russia | Novolipetsk Iron %amp% Steel Corporation (NLMK) | 11,5 % | | Viz Stal | 0 % | | All other companies | 11,5 % | (188) The individual company anti-dumping duty rates specified in this Regulation were established on the basis of the findings of the present investigation.
A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia, falling under CN codes 72251100 (products of a width of 600 mm or more) and 72261100 (products of a width of less than 600 mm). 2.
The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable, before duty, to the net free-at-Community-frontier price of the products described in paragraph 1 and manufactured by the companies below shall be as follows: Country | Company | Anti-dumping duty | TARIC Additional code | United States of America | AK Steel Corporation – 703, Curtis Street, Middletown, Ohio | 31,5 % | A669 | | All other companies | 37,8 % | A999 | Russia | Novolipetsk Iron %amp% Steel Corporation (NLMK) – 2, Metallurgov sq., Lipetsk | 11,5 % | A670 | | Viz Stal – 28, Kirov Street, Ekaterinburg | 0 % | A516 | | All other companies | 11,5 % | A999 | 3.
The imports mentioned in paragraph 1 shall be exempt from the anti-dumping duty on condition that: (a) the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the product described in Article 1(1), (b) a commercial invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex is presented to Member States' customs authorities upon presentation of the declaration for release into free circulation, and (c) the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the commercial invoice.
