PROCEDURE (1) By letter dated 12 February 2003 (recorded as incoming mail under number A/31217 on 14 February 2003), the Italian authorities notified, pursuant to Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty, an aid scheme providing for urgent measures to assist employment.
After a request for an extension of the deadline had been accepted by the Commission, Italy submitted additional information by letter dated 20 May 2003. (3) By letter dated 16 October 2003, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the Treaty in respect of the scheme.
No such comments were received. (4) Italy submitted comments by letter dated 22 December 2003.
The Commission asked for further information by letter dated 19 January 2004, to which Italy replied by letter of 11 February 2004. 2.
DESCRIPTION OF THE AID (5) The aim of the scheme is to safeguard jobs in firms in financial difficulty which are in a form of insolvency proceeding known as "special administration" (amministrazione straordinaria) and which have more than 1000 employees. (6) The legal basis of the scheme is Decree-law No 23 of 14 February 2003, which was converted into statute by Act No 81 of 17 April 2003. (7) The aid is granted to purchasers of firms that have the required characteristics (firms in financial difficulty, in special administration, and having at least 1000 employees). (8) The purchaser of such a firm qualifies for aid in respect of the staff of the firm whom the purchaser agrees to employ, up to a ceiling of 550 employees.
For each transferred employee the purchaser receives: - a monthly grant equal to 50 % of the special indemnity to which the worker would be entitled if laid off under the laid-off workers’ mobility scheme (collocamento in mobilità), - a reduction in employer’s social security contributions for the first 18 months, the rate of contribution charged being that for trainees.
Under the aid scheme notified, the same benefits are granted, up to a ceiling of 550 employees, to purchasers who agree to employ staff of the existing firm; these would not qualify for the laid off workers’ mobility scheme.
The benefits are granted in respect of a maximum of 550 employees transferred provided two conditions are met: (i) the transfer of employees must be provided for in a collective agreement concluded with the Ministry of Labour by 30 April 2003, and (ii) the purchaser and the firm purchased cannot have the same ownership, and there must be no relationship of control or association between them. (9) The scheme is applicable to transactions involving a transfer of employees approved by means of a collective agreement concluded with the Ministry of Labour by 30 April 2003.
The budget for the year 2003 amounted to EUR 9,5 million. 3.
The measure was therefore caught by the general ban on State aid, and could be considered compatible with the common market only if it qualified for one of the exemptions laid down in the Treaty. (11) Given that the measure aimed to safeguard jobs, and involved the purchase of firms in difficulty, the Commission considered whether the aid might be held compatible under the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (the rescue and restructuring guidelines) [3], or under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2204/2002 of 12 December 2002 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid for employment [4] (the Employment Aid Regulation), or, finally, under the guidelines on national regional aid [5].
The Commission expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the measure with the common market under any of these rules. (12) The Commission doubted whether the measure constituted a scheme of assistance to a general class of recipients; in view of its short duration it appeared rather to be aimed at very specific recipients (the legislation was adopted on 14 February 2003, and the deadline for the purchase of the firm and ministerial approval of the transfer of employees was 30 April 2003). (13) The Commission said that if Italy considered that the notification of the scheme was in fact an individual notification of restructuring aid to a single firm in difficulty, then the measure would have to be notified as such.
COMMENTS SUBMITTED BY ITALY (14) Italy submitted comments by letter dated 22 December 2003.
According to the Italian authorities Brandt Italia acquired Ocean at a market price and did not receive any direct economic advantage under the scheme. (15) The Italian authorities also stated: - that the measure under examination was not one that applied in specific areas or to specific recipients, - that if the Commission did not consider it a general measure, it should conclude that it did not affect competition, as it was aimed at restoring the productive activity of firms in difficulty and safeguarding the jobs involved, - that the scheme complied with the rescue and restructuring guidelines, as it did not increase production capacity but aimed to restore viability and safeguard jobs. (16) By letter dated 11 February 2004, Italy indicated that the amount of aid awarded to Brandt Italia under the scheme was, at that date, EUR 3197982,20 and that the granting of aid had begun in March 2003. 5.
The Commission cannot, therefore, assess the individual case of the sale of Ocean SpA to Brandt Italia SpA on its own merits. 5.5.
Indeed, as the measure concerns the sale of firms having more than 1000 employees, there are grounds for supposing that the firms concerned will for the most part be large. (33) The notified measure consequently cannot be considered compatible with the common market on the basis of the Employment Aid Regulation. 5.6.
Assessment under the guidelines on national regional aid (34) The Commission also considered whether the scheme could be assessed under the guidelines on national regional aid [8].
Moreover, the only case in which the scheme is known to have been applied is that of a company located in Verolanuova, Brescia, which is not in an area falling under the exemptions in Article 87(3)(a) or (c).
The notified measure consequently cannot be considered compatible with the common market on the basis of the guidelines on national regional aid. (36) Lastly, the notified measure is incompatible with the common market in that it contains no provision on overlapping aid from different sources. 6.
CONCLUSION (37) The Commission finds that the measure under examination constitutes State aid within the scope of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.
The interest rate referred to in paragraph 5 shall apply on a compound basis over the entire period referred to in paragraph 4.
