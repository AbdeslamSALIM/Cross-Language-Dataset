The oxaloacetate formed is split into pyruvate and carbon dioxide. %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% The quantity of NADH formed is proportional to the concentration of D-malic acid and is measured at a wavelength of 334, 340 or 365 nm. 2.

Use content of bottle 1 undiluted.
Dissolve content of bottle 2 in 4 ml double-distilled water. 3.
Dissolve content of one of bottles 3 in 0,6 ml double-distilled water.
Stability of the solutions The content of bottle 1 is stable for at least one year if stored at +4 °C; solution 2 is stable for three weeks if stored at +4 °C, and for two months if stored at - 20 °C; solution 3 is stable for five days if stored at +4 °C. 3.

The amount of D-malate in the cuvette should be between 2 and 50 μg.
PROCEDURE With the spectrophotometer adjusted to a wavelength of 340 nm, determine the absorbance using the 1 cm cuvettes, either using air to set zero absorbance (no cuvette in the optical path) or using water.
Add: %gt%TABLE%gt% Mix; wait until the reaction is completed (about 20 minutes) and measure the absorbances of the reference and test solutions (A2).
Calculate the absorbance difference (A2 - A1) for the reference (ΔΑT) and test (ΔΑE) solutions.
EXPRESSION OF THE RESULTS The general formula for calculating the concentration in mg/l is: %gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% where: V= volume of test solution in ml (2,95 ml) ν= volume of the sample in ml (0,1 ml) PM= molecular mass of the substance to be determined (for D-malic acid, PM = 134,09) d= optical path of the cuvette in cm (1 cm) ε= absorption coefficient of NADH: at 340 nm= 6,3 (1 mmol-1 cm-1) at 365 nm= 3,4 (1 mmol-1 cm-1) at 334 nm= 6,18 (1 mmol-1 cm-1).
The D-malic acid concentration is given in milligrams per litre (mg/l), with no decimal places. 7.
The values derived from the interlaboratory trial may not be applicable to ranges of analyte concentration and matrices other than those in Appendix B. 7.1.
Repeatability The absolute difference between two individual results obtained on identical matter submitted to a trial by an operator using the same apparatus, within the shortest time interval, will not exceed repeatability value r in more than 5 % of cases.
Reproducibility The absolute difference between two individual results obtained on identical matter submitted to a trial in two different laboratories will not exceed reproducibility value R in more than 5 % of cases.
COMMENTS In view of the degree of accuracy of this method, values of D-malic acid below 50 mg/l should be confirmed if necessary by another analytical method using another measuring principle such as that of Przyborski et al. (Mitteilungen Klosterneuburg 43, 1993; 215-218. 1993).
The wine sample in the cuvette should not exceed 0,1 ml, to avoid possible inhibition of enzymatic activity by polyphenols.
With a normal reaction, absorbance reaches a constant value after a certain time, generally 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the speed of the specific enzymatic reaction.
The substrate concentration is calculated on the basis of the difference in absorbance extrapolated at that time (Af - Ai).

To obtain the corrected calibration curve, prepare standard solutions as described in (f) by using 40 % ethanol instead of dichloromethane.
Analyse 1 ml of the standard calibration solution as described in D, E and F.
To each beaker, add l ml of internal standard PC solution C(e)(3) and water, to obtain a total volume of 40 ml (or 40 g).

Rinse the flask with 1 ml of dichloromethane and transfer the rinsing liquid to the tube.
Concentrate the sample to 1 ml under a weak nitrogen stream.
GC/MS analysis (a) Calibration curve Inject 1 μl of each standard calibration solution C(f) into the GC/MS.
Establish the concentration of EC (ng/ml) in the extract by using the internal standard calibration curve.
These responses are features of the main fragments (M - C2H2)+ and (M - CH3)+ and molecular ion (M)+ respectively.
The presence of EC is confirmed if the relative ratios of these ions are within 20 % of the ratios for an EC standard.
The extract may need to be further concentrated in order to obtain a sufficient response for the m/z 89 ion.
