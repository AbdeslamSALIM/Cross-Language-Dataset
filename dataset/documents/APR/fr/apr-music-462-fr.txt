In terms of becoming an overnight sensation after having worked with some notable success in the music business, you are hard pressed to find a better example than Carole King. Having written some early hits as "Will You Love Me Tomorrow," in the late 1960's King got the chance to record and sing her own songs. The result was "Tapestry," an album that basically everybody had to have (Think "Rumors" or "Thriller" if you are not old enough to remember). This is an album, to borrow a phrase, that announces it's presence with authority with the opening piano chords of "I Feel The Earth Move" and ends with a truly soulful "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman." In between there was the beautiful simplicity of "So Far Away" and "You've Got A Friend." This was really the first album after the Beatles broke up where you found had a more than one or two hit singles; at least that's the way I remember it. "Tapestry" remains a simple, classic album of pop music.
