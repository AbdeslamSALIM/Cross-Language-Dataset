sure you learn things about the life of this intellectual and on time, but what folly to try to embody sartre on film. sartre is far from perfect, both as a philosopher than as individuals, but it is still a character unique, extraordinary and unavoidable. trying to represent the film is an enterprise that was doomed to failure. what we have here is almost a parody.
