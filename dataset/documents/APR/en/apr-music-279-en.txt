usually it's always a pleasure to discover a new album by mike oldfield, but there is a real disappointment. and yet the music is not bad. what is striking is the absence of feeling, the later synthetic pop that many amateur musicians produce their pc. it's nice but it is 1000 miles of tubular bells, amarok or even platinum. we certainly find little bits of background music in the reporting of news on tv. the worst being that synthetic sax seems from a 80s synth or sound card low range. fortunately there is the single to be free (duplicated on the album), which alone is worth the price of the cd. another regret musicvr the cd included with the album promises to be interesting, but only the demo is available, a key fee must be purchased online.
