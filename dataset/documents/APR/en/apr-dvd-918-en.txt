this package offers two films of fellini is certainly tempting, but do not be fooled: behind these two masterpieces are hidden in the nightmare reality of true cinephile, since the two films can not be viewed in the original. the french version could be interesting: i tried the first 5 minutes of "la strada" (1954), in french: well, i almost cried. like "fever in the blood" (1961) elia kazan, dubbing the french are completely overwhelmed by the performances of players ... and it is felt widely. let my purchases for others!
