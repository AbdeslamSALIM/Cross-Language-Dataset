obviously, the bar is set so high that it is difficult today to surprise the viewer as we are. basically, this movie could try as much by the side of the space thriller that promised to be scary and terrifying than the distribution (angela bassett, too rare - unfortunately - james spader, ...). but now, a wobbly script as predictable as a bad tv movie and special effects second class never made a good movie ... the actors seem bored dailleurs as we! this dvd seems to me as a useless piece of meat when it is vegetarian! the trailer is so misleading about more ... i will end by this maxim: "if you've seen the trailer, you saw the movie .... and the so-called suspense that goes with it !!!!" .
