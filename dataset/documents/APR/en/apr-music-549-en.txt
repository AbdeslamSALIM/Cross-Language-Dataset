hooverphonic completely changes course with this album, not much really (any more?) trip hop ... and it's not terrible at all! where is the sensual side, gliding, deep (already old, admittedly) "new stereophonic sound spectacular"? (their first album, absolutely have to!) side a little "soup" of music, become more than "pop rock" than anything else, is terribly disappointing ... throw you on the previous album, or, in extreme cases, the limited edition with a second cd of remixes cool, especially that of thievery corporation.
