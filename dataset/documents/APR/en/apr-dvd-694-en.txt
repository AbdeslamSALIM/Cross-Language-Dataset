actors without charisma, character and poor, worse, a series of sequences that the director would probably tetanizing but that does not raise the viewer that yawns. the trouble lies in wait! and what about these creatures, heavily inspired by alien, bellicose and very little that we would have liked more surly? never they arouse the slightest frisson of fear ... in the same vein, prefer "the descent", which is infinitely superior!
