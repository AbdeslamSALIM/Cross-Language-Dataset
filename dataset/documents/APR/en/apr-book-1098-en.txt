i would have liked to put 5 stars but it can not match the first two volumes by cons .... it is essential to have all the answers and we are captivated from the 1st line ... scott card is really overkill and if you like his style and manner all his own to make us love the characters, read "the tales of alvin maker", it reads like warm milk ....
