i was not convinced at all ... hancock is a loner, perpetually ill-tempered, rude and rowdy, slightly moistened with alcohol, and even if he stops the bad guys and saves the gentiles, it is no longer the super hero person as it causes damage and made misjudgments. coached by an expert in public relations on the back, hancock takes the bull by the horns, before discovering that it is not the only one to have super powers ... apart from special effects that hold the road and two or three dialogues lend vaguely smile (sadly lost amid a lot of vulgarity), i do not have much positive to say about this movie, and i wonder why will smith is going to stick in there in part to amuse his kids.
