watching this dvd, we forget everything we have heard before. the musical has not been as successful as expected, yet it is the only one who can truly boast of being the heir to broadway! the musicians are live (not a soundtrack), and the singers are full of artists who dance, play the comedy (some passages are also only played, as in the tradition of the musical) surprising . it's lively, the music is haunting, the voices too. a pure wonder!! a special congratulations to ann'so, who plays mrs. cassim (what a voice!) and for genius, a true miracle by itself ...
