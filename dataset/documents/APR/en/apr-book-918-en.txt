mr banks and his team will simultaneously run two surveys. the murder of a teenager coming out of a pub and murder of an invalid. the second investigation is complex with multiple stakeholders, some of which have changed their identity. perter robinson does not spare us either the privacy of its investigators. and the topics are rather sordid. in short it is a bit indigestible.
