i would like to know why everyone thinks this series funny or hilarious, it's really anything you really look for the humorous passages, it sucks, replicas nazes home nazes several compare this series friends? what a shame it can not even and there will never hold a candle to friends. i made a critical fnac and was told it was too highbrow for me, except i do not see how this nerd. there's really comic series where we laugh almost every ten seconds: friends of course, married two children, will &amp; grace what i like about you or a nanny and malcolm. i find it incredible that everyone found this great series while not all, require a specialist to explain comic series, and even i do not think it will be enough.
