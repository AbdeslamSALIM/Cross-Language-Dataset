paper available at christmas because of the banner "nobel prize". my 1st jmg le clezio and probably my last so i felt little involvement in this story of a little girl lost in the "great history". i have found in previous comments and do not add much. the author portrays many characters that ultimately are evoked (eg xenia). and then the gradual shift towards the deportation of jews during the war: le clezio give in easily. is there anything new to say? short novel, not long (200 pages) does not provide me with emotion and does, in my opinion, no literary interest. the next book is scheduled the last "gaud√© ". a future review?
