biens√ªr this movie is getting any younger ... but i love it because it is a very structured story: the soldier stan remained at the bottom of his trench in 1914 and returned several years after the end of the war (sometimes reality is stranger than fiction remember the japanese solved 24 years after the end of the pacific war ...), this theme that comes through the fault of this poor stan laurel "there will be a fight" is pure l &amp; h, the gags are fine, not "pie the cream "! the endearing characters through this renewed friendship that does not please all of the wife laurel ... if you buy only one film of l &amp; h take it ... but then i'm sure you'll be tempted by the others!
