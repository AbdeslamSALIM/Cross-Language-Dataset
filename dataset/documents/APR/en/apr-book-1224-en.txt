inspector banks has just released a survey that has affected much more than he wanted, plunges headlong into a mystery that seems to relate closely his brother roy. despite threats and intimidation, and annie cabbott him go to the bottom of things and discover the properties squalid slums of london. i find the novels of peter robinson very uneven. some are excellent (like "dry season") other i have fallen in the hands of a few pages ( "blood at the root"). fortunately, "strange matter" belongs to the first category!
