i have done by this outstanding author to which i already read 3 novels exciting. this is often the same type of plot, a character for whom things are going pretty well, even a slight increase and then suddenly falling quite dramatically, when he hit bottom, we are desperate and clinging to the book point no longer sleep to read ..... and then a primer, it goes back, we feel he can cope, it begins to blow, to breathe but still can not release the book until the end. the one i preferred: "l the man who wanted to live his life "it took me a traitor because she is a woman who says, speaking (surprisingly good when you think it's written by a man) of her pregnancy, of confinement, the trauma of his bb resuscitation, her postpartum depression ... etc, so a little hard to read when you're pregnant ... but ... i do not tell the end but that's super! !
