for me, nothing to keep apart perhaps "in the evening" and the cover that i find beautiful ... the inspiration for the quartet has narrowed as a shrinking, plant has more trouble with his voice, in short it feels the tree for the group. prefer this album "presence" or even "coda" (collection of unreleased and b-sides "not straightening), which are still better.
