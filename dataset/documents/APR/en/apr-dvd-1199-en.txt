cult film by john mctierman, "in pursuit of the red october" is still regarded today as the best film of submarines ever built. it must be said that an exciting scenario, players at their best, a film that touches perfection, sublime music (and themselves cults), an inventive and rhythmic action make this film a little marvel. .. certe the dvd does not recognize the film (image dirty inlays forgotten, its just ok, no bonus ...), but it would be a shame not to possess! went for fun, ma worship scene: in the final battle, then we think that red october is lost and that the torpedo from a russian fighter alpha will destroy the uss dallas is interposed, the fact that the torpedo targeting, launches its countermeasures, expels its balastres, and "flies" at full speed ... cult!
