and exploit the suffering, distress, and property loss does different, making a film raccoleur, poor shot anyhow (like "open cannes film festival, and" blair witch 6 "). neither head nor tail, we cross the corridors of power behind future victims, and in case we would not have looked good, they re-crossed from another angle, with other students (3 or 4 times), but the same dialogues without counting the shots seen from behind the clouds, electricity poles !!!!!!!!!!. nothing about the "motivation" of the two psychopaths (1 minute 30 nazi video! a stick with a gun comes home !!!). extremely painful. final scene: 15 dead in 1 or two minutes. there might be ways to treat such a subject without falling into voyeurism, or there was no need to treat at all. the horror is sufficient in itself. oh yes we will explain the title!
