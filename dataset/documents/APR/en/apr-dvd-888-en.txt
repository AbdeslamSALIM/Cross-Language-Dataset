a movie in the world of hollywood and with humor? one can not help thinking to get shorty. unfortunately this panic in hollywood, despite his casting choices (de niro, sean penn, bruce willis, john turturro ...), and some successful sequences, is particularly annoying at other times. the film would have needed a little humor now and more especially of a true pace. it is better to revise get shorty lot funnier and more successful.
