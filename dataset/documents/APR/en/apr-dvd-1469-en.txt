attention lovers of the original version, this edition contains only the dubbed version of the film, which also is very very average quality both in sound than the image. it seemed to me that for such a film, the vost for granted. bitter disappointment ... i think it would be useful amazon stresses no vost rather than simply not reporting the subtitles, leaving the consumer in doubt.
