an album more mixed than the huge thriller and off the wall, containing absolutely monstrous tracks (dirty diana, smooth criminal, bad, leave me alone) and lower titers or naive (premise of what would become the musical productions of mj later, alas ...). fortunately, the magical interpretation of bambi and its unique aura, his clips still hallucinating still exert their magic and managed to raise the level of certain pieces, saved by dint of talent! consume with moderation, and it went very well!
