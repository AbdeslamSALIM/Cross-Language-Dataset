a few flashes, but overall "a man" ( "everyman" in english) is a meditation on illness, old age and the banality of life. it begins in a cemetery and ends on an operating table. the 'hero' is never called and we follow his last months, through a succession of surgeries when he remembers the episode of his life. "a man" is a good free, but n is not a big book of p. roth. his latest book, already available in the united states, "exit ghost" which is vaguely similar theme, is an entirely different class and demonstrates especially that roth did not give up to live and that "a man" is not his will, far from it. "a man" was of course some beautiful passages, but generally still a great melancholy without being overwhelming.
