do not count on me to make a discordant note in this chorus of praise on this album. i do not yet know well the artist's work unique and important as was frank zappa, but i can already say that one can hardly do better than "hot rats" (which involved among others jean-luc ponty , shuggie otis and don van vliet aka captain beefheart). sax raging, anthology of solo virtuosity, quasi-instrumental (one song sung), an album essential for any good nightclub, whether rock or not because at this stage of excellence labels are unimportant.
