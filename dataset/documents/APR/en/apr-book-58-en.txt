i board was very disappointed by this book. nothing to do with "the tree of possibilities." the news is antiquated, already addressed in his other novels! i was thrown over its release since i'm a fan .... but what regret! if mr. werber does more pace ... to publish less often but better quality (see thanatonnautes and the empire of the angels)
