book very readable. the atmosphere, the france of the expo is felt by the reader ... advance the plot little by little, the player tries to guess the reason for these deaths .... unfortunately no chance of finding him is give ... the end comes suddenly and there was an explanation of the entire book, but the shots we're a little disappointed ... disappointed to have a solution we could not find ... pleasant to read, but disappointed in the end!
