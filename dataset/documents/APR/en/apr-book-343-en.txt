what book exhausting! can not read it in one breath and one day the other one gets lost between the characters ... (i even re-reverse to put the murderer ... shame ... first time in my life as it happens ...) not counting-too-many descriptions on the streets and neighborhoods of philadelphia ,-very drunk and useless. so i asked a question the author made it a contest of pages of writing? yet the inside story is not bad. what a pity!
