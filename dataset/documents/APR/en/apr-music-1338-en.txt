if "set the world on fire" was a bit part in the band's discography by his side 100% heavy metal, remains is much more, by his experimental side. the beginning of the album in the cold back with "murder" which competes with "the box" as the worst start of album of all time, and sexecution or no love does not catch the fiasco. two riffs that turn loop, a sound very synthetic (electronic drums, but not only, even the guitar sounds less "true", probably to better suit the connection). it is the fault of the former wife of jeff, c it is he who says in the bonus, as if this interview had been set for the reissue 'excuse' this album to exist under the banner of annihilator ... funny that the music in the background of the interview comes from "refresh the demon" :-) as reported in another column, 3 tracks thrasybulus catching the disc a total flop, but three of 11 tracks is not much. to continue to paraphrase blaster, why change not, but i doubt that this mixture can actually seduce anyone. not quite unfair for fans of the genre, not metal enough for the purists, this album has definitely misguided ass between two chairs, so it has solved the sitting down. this dark period for jeff is happily past, and the guy we offir still very fine metal beads in the future. but not 97 ...
