this book is a juxtaposition of images of little brown bear who does not know what to do on his pot, he sings, he'll get his train, he read, he asks his mother a cake ... giving it! finally he called his mother but as she does not go get it with the pot without spilling. it seems boring like that ... well it is! that's what bothered me most in the end it transpires that the boredom associated with pot. to motivate our children end, we have seen better. in style i advise tchoupi, much more successful from my point of view. on the other hand the scope of the cake i really embarrassed myself because at the same time as the 'potty insist much on hygiene. i find it incredible image of the mother who gives food to her baby on the potty, it is beyond me. i wonder how the editor could pass it.
