not only technically, this film is a true jewel of innovation, i find it beautiful in all respects. aesthetically, it is a great time animation. the story is great, and especially what i like in nemo, it is the characters, each more wacky and endearing than each other ... the humor is not to remain in the film, i don ' had not laughed so much since the genius of aladdin. there are no children at home, yet this dvd is one of the favorites here: i am going on and returns to the big tirades dory, my favorite character (she looks like me, it seems!) i twist and laugh. a real film anti-depressant, which i'm sure will appeal to my children, whatever their age: there are things to take for everyone of all ages, all sexes, all cultures. a great moral lesson, and a magnificent film in every respect. a must see!
