everything has been said by previous amazoniaques!, but it's funny da'ttendre a bit to see how to use the thing called aging! this disc is unclassifiable! i think a lot of things by listening, but certainly not the last prods two of my favorite dinosaur (def lep, and the serpent, which seem really bland next to the bomb that i listen to since its release without weary). a bit of alice in chains, pearl jam, of foofighters to the sound of madness for the red hot rhythms, but also a bit of references british older and more "noble" as they say. few records have the ability to generate new attention as the first listening, and divert all the listeners. probably a cd found in the list called "ideal" but that will not fly his place.
