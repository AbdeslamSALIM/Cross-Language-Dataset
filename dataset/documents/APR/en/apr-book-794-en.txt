for 3rd and final part of the history of the spanish conquest in the new world in the midst of these bloody wars which opposed the incas to the spanish triumph of love there between the beautiful inca princess anamaya (which is considered like a goddess with her gift of clairvoyance), and the conquistador gabriel (whose totem animal is the puma revered in these parts). i would tell you that, but i invite you not only read the 3rd opus, of course after having read the 2 previous ones, because this trilogy is full of details about the history and beliefs of the incas, and the resulting shock the arrival of spanish conquistadors obsessed by gold. very good books to read by everyone, rich and well written.
