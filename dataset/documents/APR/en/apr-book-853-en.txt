after reading all the comments, i can barely write my own, so this book has touched me (and the film adaptation disappointed, oh how!) and inhabited. he still lives in me. everything in this story seems fair and realistic, sublimated into a beautiful language, great literature. everything is contained in this story-not a fairy-everything that makes the intensity sorry sentient beings, atypical. this book is unforgettable passages through the beginning, of course, the wandering of a young woman, memories of teenage hero and an unforgettable scene of bungee jumping, then how a man with manners of bear tries to save a little girl who is anorexic out of a coma. what the book does not end well actually its strength. "happy people have no history", and it leaves no room for humor, it is immediately in the tragic life circumstances, imponderables. thanks to pierre peju this narrative that i offered at least ten times.
