yes, i confirm! flee from this french edition disastrous, especially if you love the series and the doctor who! it lost every time the christmas episode, goes further, there is no bonus (while a making - of one hour for each episode are in england) is a shame ... but in 2008 allows a publisher to even out in france dvds private vo and subtitles in french, is simply incredible! sure that our fee was not used to that! shame too, france television!
