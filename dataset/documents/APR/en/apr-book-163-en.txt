nothing unusual in this novel, which tore yet in bookstores and often out of stock. for my part, it is a story already read, seen and heard. the killer has multiple personalities, some touching and other low machiavellian and domineering. maybe the fact that the killer has in him all these "people" gives the reader thread to retord. it may indeed be more impressive to see the film rather than reading. moving from one character to another is sometimes tiring to read. i much preferred his first novel "flowers for algernon"
