nothing new, except that in this little book the exercises are well explained and it makes you want to do. by experience i can advise you that 20 minutes of physical activity per day and a little attention at meals can make it good! do not hesitate to buy if your motivation is constant, as 10 minutes a day with no effort at hand, are useless!
