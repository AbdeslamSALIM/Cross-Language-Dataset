i had the chance to see this movie along with dominique abel presenting his work. it is a lovely man who has paid even a pot to people so that we can share with him the impression! i must say that i found this great film! it is a little gem of burlesque and emotion! there's terrible things throughout the movie and yet you laugh from beginning to end, i had seen anything so exciting since chaplin and some woody allen. in short, i have been waiting a long time out of this dvd! i hope you will share my excitement !!!!!
