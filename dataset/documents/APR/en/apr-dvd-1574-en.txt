long ago i saw this film stallone on television but had not kept a lot of memories. and so it's a good fan of stallone i bought this dvd. the tavern of hell is the first realization of stallone is also a screenwriter, in addition to being an actor. but stallone is on camera almost constantly and finally give the impression of playing for the first time in a film directed by a friend and want to be always in the image. it calms down a bit in the second half but not really ... the story could have a very good movie but the script does not exploit its possibilities, the implementation is rather bad and stallone is really annoying that makes the film even more disappointing. yes, my comment may seem harsh but it's not because i'm a fan of stallone as i find everything he does "super!" .
