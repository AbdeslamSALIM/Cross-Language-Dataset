with such a title and a 4th such coverage, marc ferro raises curiosity, but over the pages, it's the disappointment that takes precedence. indeed, the author has a style heavy and complicated. it demonstrates that superficial things and no fundamental or unique revelation occurs. i stay on my hunger and i think the author could have builds upon a bit more about it.
