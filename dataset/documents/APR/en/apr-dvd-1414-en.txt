based on a novel by nick hornby (if you do not know the author, obtain without further delay "yellow", "high fidelity" and "you get off?", it's worth a visit), "high fidelity" we tells the emotional troubles of a shop owner (rob gordon pretation by john cusack) who specializes in vinyl lp "vintage" and "garage rock". surrounded by two vendors (one-dick-shy as the dwarf of the same name, the other barry-aggressive as it is not allowed), rob takes stock of his life, his desires, failures, and finally discovered the soul sister, dick also found its way with a punkette; about barry, he eventually became musico. this film is hilarious, even if the action takes place in chicago instead of london. john cusack is corrugated, even atendre in his vain attempts to ask ... and then there are scenes of anthology where we discuss the merits of a particular group (here we touch the sublime ... readers rock and folk-for those of my generation and the yes fm listeners will understand. one day he will gleefully attest to the appalling bigotry which can show when we talk about rock bands) and above, especially the scene where barry farting sends a buyer, dressed up in suit and tie, came quietly to afford a vintage garage rock (hence the height). in short, a delicious film
