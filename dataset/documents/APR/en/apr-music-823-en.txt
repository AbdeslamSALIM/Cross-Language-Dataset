joe satriani, sammy hagar, michael anthony, chad smith ... hmmm there's a line-up that has the look! i had high hopes and expectations when i heard the formation of this very promising new group called "chickenfoot" i am a fan of the first hour of van halen, mr satch solo ansi that red hot! reaction to the first listening: bof bof ... frankly this is not terrible! but hey, give a second chance to chickenfoot! it returns the disc and the final result ... it's disappointing! yet sammy hagar pushes chansonette as his early days with montrose and van halen, anthony provides the bass, joe gratifies us a few games guitaristic and chad hit with the brass fire. but alchemy as expected did not work. it's bland, syrupy and without panache. chickenfoot is a real damp squib or rather "sissy". what a waste when you know the quality of the four protagonists! hear before you jump on them ...
