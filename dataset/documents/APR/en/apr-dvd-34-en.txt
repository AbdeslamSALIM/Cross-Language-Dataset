it's about a "jos√© van dam," which suddenly decides to stop his career to open a singing school for one student, cute, of course. in the street he heard a thief on the run he will train. the voices are beautiful, (van dam is not my favorite, i find his glory a little overrated, especially the new generation is amazing), costumes, scenery, too, but the story just indigent (as cliches ), and actors execrable! especially anne roussel, heartbreaking! so take a dvd of cecilia bartoli in concert if you like opera, or better, a concerto for viola da gamba in the church of your city, and there, even if the quality is average, the charm and emotion will be at the rendezvous.
