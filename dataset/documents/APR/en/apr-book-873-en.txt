often presented as the gods of history, especially for students with sciences po, s. berstein and p. milza are in these three volumes long and heavy. the story is not analyzed but rather spread out, as a result of events that connects them, but certainly almost entirely to the form. none of these three volumes not relieve the profound changes and prospects for the future. it's a bit of history as taught previously: a series of dates without end and without interest. not that the authors are not professionals, but for my part, i think the reputation of these three books is greatly exaggerated. to discourage those who want to learn so the mass of facts is immeasurable. to have all the same for the history of fact or to fill gaps. but not "learn" history, no.
