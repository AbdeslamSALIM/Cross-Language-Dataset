sinclair is known for her stage performances. it proves once again his great talent. all those who have already seen live end up with this cd the energetic atmosphere that prevails there. the sytle funky / jazzy / rock, re-instrumentalization of all songs, improvisation, and complicity with the audience ... we really feel like being there. a purchase will not regret it.
