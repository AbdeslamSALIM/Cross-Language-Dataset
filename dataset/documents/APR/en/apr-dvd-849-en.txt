the origin of batman, its genesis, the beginning of everything. the achievement is excellent in impressive scenery (watch the bonus, you'll be amazed!). the actors are excellent and we are carried away throughout the movie in a dark universe the image of the tortured mind of bruce wayne's a very good movie and much more (it is obvious that the franchise can not stop there, it would be attractive to continue in this direction, especially with the joker in the super - among other naughty!?).
