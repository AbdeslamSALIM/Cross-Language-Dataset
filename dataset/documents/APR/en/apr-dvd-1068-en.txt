king rising is such a must! sub lord of the rings without any inventiveness. no script, ridiculous costumes, special effects worthy of cosmos 1999. i put a star that represents for me a zero pointe such as turnip deserves none. highlights the tolkien trilogy, it is always better than wasting time watching this "thing".
