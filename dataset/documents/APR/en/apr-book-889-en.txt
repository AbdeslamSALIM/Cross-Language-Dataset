after the ants, i found the new encyclopedia of knowledge absolute and relative, in a supermarket. "new" because there are at least three, "the secret book of ants" being 1. there are, unfortunately, between these three books, redundancy agacante.donc, if you read one, flip the second before making the purchase. otherwise it's good, it makes us ask some questions interessantes.du style: "this sentence is false" ok, i admit if this assumption is that i find it true, or i act that was false!
