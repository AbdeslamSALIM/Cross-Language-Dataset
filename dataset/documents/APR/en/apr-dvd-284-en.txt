what you can do when you're a bad teacher? write a book to tell that is a bad teacher but well, it's not entirely his fault, the system is also much, eh. and if there really is a super bad teacher can also agree to make a film version. presumably cantet has watched its author with wide eyes. all trash sado-masochistic judeo-christian anarcho-syndicalist and macdonald-flunch, he had only let the camera run, everything was there, pre-chewed. oh no, the coupon has rehashed it took to rehearse students long for them to learn the true nature of filmmaking, you know, is not the same as real life people. we certainly believe it. what can we do when we are wrong in anything? try to be a little better the next day and respect those who try. this also applies to zauteurs.
