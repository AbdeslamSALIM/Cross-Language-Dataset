after 8 years of waiting, we were entitled to expect more. we must recognize that there is a real lack melodic in this album. even if one recognizes the "leg ac / dc", follow the tracks and it is hoped, in vain, that the following will finally make us vibrate. even if i am a fan for 30 years, we must admit that if we listen to this album was played by another group, we pass our way. as a fan, it seeks by all means to love at all costs. biensur so, i'm not saying that a random piece there is no portion where the grip and you say: "this is great!". but let's be frank: it should not be one of the largest and last great rock bands on earth end his career with an album as average. so, boys, work and springs us a new opus in the 2 years that followed, otherwise it is definitely too late.
