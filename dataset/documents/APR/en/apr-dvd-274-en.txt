if you saw "do not worry i'm fine" with the idol stage malherbe, so here you angry or sleepy like me, then that "little" french film you will have the same effect. all these films from new, derived itself from various facts of the "latest news langueux" look at pending the "final collapse": "will there be something" we usually imagine easily a third of the film, and that rule is pretty bogus. here the same principle: a question "why albert is it bad and that so offensive vis-à-vis friends, his wife, and even a little vis-à-vis their children? you will see at the time of finalizing this attitude could be weighted, and there was certainly another way to get a final message. these films which are ecstatic to even be blubbering, listening sergio sing on the end credits, not worth 9 (or even 10) euros in a dark room, but in the words of a visitor, a cushy evening of sunday evening. as the number of actor ... the camera is mainly fixed on dupontel, which (correctly) the issue for 80% of the film before releasing his secret. a scene caught my attention: the scene of jealousy with his wife. dialogue seems very plausible, actual, well thought out. that's it! nothing doing i bite into it, and i remain convinced that cinema here is not here!
