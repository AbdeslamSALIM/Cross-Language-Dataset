nothing to build on this album released in 1985, at the time it was the beginning of the wave-thrash metal, besides, they still spoke of "speed-metal"! nothing to build, it sounds like judas priest pulsating musicians are really top-level guitar question is the caliber of slayer, ditto for the battery and it's saying something! special mention to the singer david wayne, who died recently, was really a real singer in the line of rob halford! for the record, on this album is a cover of "highway star" deep purple, the legend says that ritchie blackmore himself would have appreciated the resumption ... in summary, a cd difficult to find opportunity, we can understand why given its quality!
