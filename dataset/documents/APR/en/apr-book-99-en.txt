i read until 3 in the morning ... can not let go ... it was long as it does not put arrived .... i will not repeat the story already pre-cited but ... the book has an indescribable charm, and because the hero is full of defects, a cad, but also with a game-ne-sais quoi that makes you admire him still ... and the heroine is 2 fingers of to marry his fiance for 4 years ..... the suspense of emotion, tenderness, love scenes very realistic, a goal coming out of the box .... this one brief stay in my library for future replay for sure !!!!!!
