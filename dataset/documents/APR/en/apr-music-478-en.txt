conceptual albums, there was the shovel: "sgt.pepper", "tommy", "the wall", "the lamb lies down on broadway," "tales from topographic oceans "..... etc.. .. etc ... but as it is successful, they can be counted on the fingers of one hand! despite what critics have said for many years (and even roger daltrey, who criticized pete townshend length concept and wanted to condense onto 1 disk !!!), this double album is perfect for the start the end! ruez you over .... you will not regret it!
