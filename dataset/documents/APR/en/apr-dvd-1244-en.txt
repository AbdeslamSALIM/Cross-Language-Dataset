since season 4, i have a little trouble with nip tuck, i am told that the move to la would put a little pigment, the fact is there are too many things in this season, eden is a true evil, écervellée, spoiled child ..., colleen rose officer sean, relations with matt and gina's daughter emme and finally burned. in short, i did not like to spend some cock to the ass in some episodes. otherwise i am still very interested in the various operations they have done, and there are still some interesting episodes, like the reality show, christian or gigolos. a late season leaves many questions unanswered, strongly thereafter.
