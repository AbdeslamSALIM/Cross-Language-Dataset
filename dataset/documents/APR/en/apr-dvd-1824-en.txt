ok guys, i'm a fan of sf movies / gore 80/90 years and appreciate the true value of a good or a good hellraiser warlock or wishmaster. i was attracted by the ba of this film and i indescribable intuition that i bought a great film ... great disappointment. great potential but a big disappointment. medium scenario, the special effects have aged badly, the characters are uninteresting to the possible .. final and not surprisingly bland ... short, i do not even recommend this movie for an evening student watered ... sorry!
