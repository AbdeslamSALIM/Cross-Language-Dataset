forward to the journey of the madman don quixote de la mancha. it's baroque, beautifully written and funny as one does not read more! we sailed in a highly poetic universe and our contemporary writers should take a leaf ... all characters are grotesque and both so real and endearing. a sample without any moderation ... however, arm yourself with a good dictionary: many words mentioned by cervantes are most used in 2005! good reading
