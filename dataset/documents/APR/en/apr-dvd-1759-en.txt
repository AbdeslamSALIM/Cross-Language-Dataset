pétillon had made a good album with the investigation of jack palmer. it was feared the move to the big screen. this is actually a result subdued. it lacks a touch of madness. so just go to the cartoon, he had to push the plug farther into the universe comics. so, we feel that the players do not have that "peps" necessary to run the machine at its true pace . jean reno is not really convincing and endorses once more, this role fighter with a big voice, which is very tiring. when change does it in style? where is the direction of actor! you look and you forget to use the bd pétillon or "asterix in corsica".
