this series was created by those of er. serie little known (it has always been played in the 2nd half of the evening) and yet so endearing, you follow the firefighters, police and paramedics in their lives everyday with their personal worries or problems with their ethics. this season starts in 1st quarter turn. each character is done well and has his own history, you never get bored at any time. the humor is present but knows how to be discreet in critical moments and even a bit immoral (even if we understand their actions). i'm very glad i bought this kit, since the time i was waiting for technical no complaints, i have even been quite amazed by the quality of picture and sound, by cons is the bonus level and packaging as it fishing (by cons pretty serigraphs). in short excellent series.
