a beautiful film ... but a misleading trailer! the trailer, the poster, you "sell" a fantasy film, like "narnia". this is not a fantasy film. it is a film about the harsh realities of the childhood. a film that will make you cry all the tears in your body, and is advising teenagers and parents, but not recommended for children under 10 years. a boy from a poor family, a father who wants to drive instruction realism to his son, and despise the attraction of it for art. a school where, as often, young brutes are the law in the playground, victimizing other children. the boy meets a girl who has a amazing imagination, original thinking, and which reverses the rules. she organizes a revolt against these bullies, she tries to understand the lives of each other, and, most importantly, it allows the young hero is closer to its aspirations to live a little this child. a wonderful story of friendship a message of hope and despair, a film that puts your face in the realities? and the reality is that childhood is not paradise. a set of wonderful actors (annasophia robb despite his age has an impressive charisma), great subtlety? what a shame that this film is directed by the studios to a different audience than hers!
