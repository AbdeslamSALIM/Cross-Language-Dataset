this book is an approach to as3, not a bible. this is handy when you do not know any concept, but it quickly limited when one wants to actually program something a little consistency. so much to start but far from top. and yet the exercises are boring like rain, do not hesitate to leave on something else to learn. the approach is very academic and often want too simplistic which generate codes of a quality not great. anyways here is useful to start, but quickly move on to something else!
