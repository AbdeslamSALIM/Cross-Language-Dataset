it's probably a very good album of the series' lefranc, with a scenario that leaves the beaten track and will drive out of habitual patterns. jacques martin raises themes rarely addressed in the comics (land speculation, heritage protection, weak states against corruption). in addition, in this album begins the psychological development of axel borg, who leaves the stereotype of the "big bad" to show a little more human complexity.
