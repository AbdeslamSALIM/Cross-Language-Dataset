good album. superb illustrations. jolie harmony boards. and a historic well-posed. one bad point (which is subjective, of course) without revealing anything i would simply say that i was slightly disappointed by the screenplay, especially the ending. after such a beautiful setting in the mouth hoping for something more surprising. anyway, i read no doubt future editions of the series.
