bergman bergman before? that's possible.toutes in this film shows a complete mastery of an academic classicism without. we can extract hundreds of pictures of beautiful, some earthy realism, others elegantly romantic. never anything released. yes, a certain aesthetic here is at its zenith. rest of story, very hard. it's hard not to side with harry, who is so quickly and courageously learning responsibilities. perhaps bergman would he have given us to see, and not seulemet to sense, what he is strong and legitimate desire of monk, so asocial and seeking a kind of natural freedom. you can also groaning (not my case) the very precise and sometimes even a little learning with bergman souigne important moments and characters. this relative lack of light is the counterpart of an effective narrative. in fact, the features properly bergmanian appear here with particular clarity: nudity shocking faces (the expression of fatherhood on the lars ekborg is inooublliable) exhibition quieter mas tenacious a singular symbolic material (of various vehicles loaded with old things ...). the latest plans raise the question of the immeasurable value of love, however short-lived. the young bergman, entry, set his film in the cinema, particularly high requirements.
