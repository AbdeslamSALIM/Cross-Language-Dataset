who did say that the wolf is evil? certainly not the toddlers who are in my class. school teacher in kindergarten, i heard several parents complained that their children's dreams were disturbed by the stories we told each wolf in school. what then? it is true that the wolf in children's literature is not always honored! never mind, "i returned" was imposed on me as the solution because at bottom, a wolf, is anything but bad: sometimes a little clumsy, sometimes left, but still funny this wolf has transformed the anxiety in my toddlers wonderful smiles and laughter galore. so, bad wolf who goes to your children the sweetness of the night? a final word: if it works for 25, i'm sure it will work for your bambino. and face the ridiculous price, this would be a shame to deprive themselves, right?
