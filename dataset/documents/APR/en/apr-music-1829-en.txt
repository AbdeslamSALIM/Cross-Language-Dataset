there is something unintentionally funny in this reissue of two of the supremes 33 t: one of the album is called "sing holland dozier holland," but the 24 songs on the cd are all signed the trips authors magical motown, the other album is titled "more hits, but only three missed the girl-group (" stop! "in the name of love" "back in my arms again" and "you keep me hangin on") are found across the cd as well say that disappointment is to put the least sloppy compilation of the three girls will contain many more jingles unstoppable sad that this cd, as most of the tracks present here consists of funds drawer directory group and the business strategy of the day (it floods the public of 45 t and 33 t, due to a 45 every two months and a 33 all four) shows its limits today. and not that this business strategy today is better: the sound of this cd is bad (only slightly better than the sound of devastation "where did our love go?" / "i hear a symphony" appeared in the same collection). but everyone knows that the compilation of hits is the only right way to address the directory of the supremes, and therefore the thin audience attracted by the sole interest of the cd (making available old 33 t missing from catalog) will inevitably be disappointed by the proposed quality sound. too bad, because for all their work diana ross and his accomplices deserve better than this botched cd.
