a star for the very aesthetic side of the book ... but the theoretical content that interests us! yoga child can not be compared to yoga adult. and that's what we found in this book ... with pictures of kids nothing on the construction of a course for children, only an accumulation of postures and advice decontextualized so that nothing can batir above without knowledge of the structure of a yoga class children, including the sequences (absent except hello ...). it's a shame.
