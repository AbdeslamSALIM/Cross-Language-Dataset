the last season is tied to incentives to switch to the atlantis versus pursuing the exploitation of the capital of sympathy, of course ... but we believe, the players continue to make us vibrate and for the duration of an episode was of real emotions like sitting in a "real movie". well, the scenarios are sometimes a little breathless but the next episode comes every time inflate interest in discovering distant worlds and adventures that leave us bloodless coups covered with dust and stars in the tunnel doors stars. the sets are excellent. good buy, i'd like the other seasons, i repay a tour from time to time, just to welcome daniel carter, tealc and o'neil.
