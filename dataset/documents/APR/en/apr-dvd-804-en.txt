what i liked most in this film: its objective side. view traffic of weapons on the side of traffic helps identify the problem and gives the public the choice of party. quite unusual for this kind of movie, it offers a vision not manichean. the acting is also very good and we appreciate (or not) black humor that emerges. a film that tells of a violent subject, trafficking in arms, without being violent, he prefers to suggest that show. short film worth seeing at least once.
