ok, my limited knowledge in music will not allow me to do a very thorough review of the disc, as it should, but meanwhile there are other more enlightened view, i'll try to do my best to make you want to discover this little wonder. listening to the album, it is difficult to define a specific style, saying that it contains a bit of rustic folk and blues, some passages that evoke the summers (i never knew, but you know what i mean) 60 years. sounds and perhaps a voice that is not without thinking about the white stripes more "calm" that would improbably crossed with the beach boys. the result was nothing joyful mess that my poor review suggests. you're dealing with an album where no song is throwing a concentrate of songs that you will find yourself singing over and over again. thanks to the production carried out by brendan canty of fugazi, the album has this overall tone, this little extra that makes you feel good when you listen (go, dare, you feel happy. joy, joy!). because this album is so "addictive", you'll hitch! to learn more, as this review is not enough, visit the website myspace benjy ferree which some extracts may allow you to make a more informed opinion.
