muse i liked the beginning with showbiz and especially after their latest opus, but smelly bait of easy money and pumping fans. make no mistake, those who love this album have been brainwashed to say, and have forgotten what muse (formerly) a very good rock band with a crazy energy. quick, forget this album and hope that the next is better.
