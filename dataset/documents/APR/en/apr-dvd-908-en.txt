the film is a classic, but the copy is very poor quality, hence the hardness rating! shame for not having made a transfer from the negative, because then the colors are somewhat faded and the whole image is poorly defined. in short, it is better to wait for the blue-ray editions of tf1 will be forced to leave the negative film, instead of merely a bad copy or a bad telecine. moreover, despite some scenes of anthology and a louis de fun√®s always so funny, the script is a bit dated ... this did not keep pace with the great mop, which itself has not taken a single ride (and a copy of which dvd is very good)
