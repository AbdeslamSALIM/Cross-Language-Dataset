what a disappointment! i devoured summer night and i quickly went shopping afterwards. i was really thrilled to the adventures of this gang of children, loved to scare me with the rendering truck, the soldier-zombies, even the topoi as holy water and communion wafers as weapons of war against the breakaway of hell really liked me ... well, after all, the dogs of winter is a platitude indescribable: the ghost of the soldier is still there, but it's the school that burned longer plays any role, even the dogs are explained at the very end and we can not say that this creates a wonderful surprise. i hope the other novels by the author that i purchased at the same time does not disappoint me as much.
