before my visit to namibia next year, i bought this dvd hoping to get an idea of what to expect and possibly change my route based on what i discover. well unfortunately this dvd has not learned much from the doc for travel agents and the little lady who made his drawings are very nice but a little too turned around. so a product if it is not without quality is not at all what i expected. as for the comments they are borrowing a naivety quickly annoying ... a book for those who will never let ......
