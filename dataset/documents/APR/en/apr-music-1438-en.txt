"the system has failed", far from wonderful, is allowed to listen. his little brother is nullissime. out of a "washington is next" very catchy and well constructed, this disc has no interest. and incidentally, we talk back to thrash metal on this disc ... where? no thrash here is the heavy missed. but after all, this is a story of etiquette. if the content had been up to ... recycled riffs, solos without head or tail puff all the space, especially one dave i foutiste who gets tired even to produce vocal melodies (it very simple, it speaks and recites all the way) or to treat its chorus (very frustrating when you know the know-how he had come to acquire in this area). you want to eat the solo on every floor? this disc is for you. but if you want to hear good songs, bring out more albums in the 90's redhead.
