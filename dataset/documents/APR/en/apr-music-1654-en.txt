i was born in the midst of the 80s, so i discovered this album, or rather, this wonder, more recently. no title is to throw. i consider this album as a best of such songs are catchy (a victory of love, to germany with love, in the mood). i am fortunate to have all 45 laps of their 2 first albums i been put on cd. on the b side there are the equally exquisite titles as "the nelson highrise sector 1: the elevator", "golden feeling" and a rhythmic version of "forever young". those who have their old 45s packed in a cardboard box in the attic, a council: resort-les!
