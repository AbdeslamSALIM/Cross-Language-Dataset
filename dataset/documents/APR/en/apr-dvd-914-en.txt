this is a classic in 74 minutes, as saying a blast of creative power. brilliantly exploited the theme here is that mental strength. telepathy, telekinesis, persuasiveness, all these paranormal forces based here in the brains of strange children of superior intelligence born the same day in a small village. but not necessarily in peaceful intentions. the intelligence is not necessarily an ally of tolerance and respect each other. and vice versa. a film to discover or rediscover absolutely!
