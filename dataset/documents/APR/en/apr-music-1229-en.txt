following the departure of uli roth in 1978, "lovedrive" had created in me a mini shock when the choices made by the group (and his game more compact and aggressive than in the past). fortunately "animal magnetism" puts the record straight melodic. indeed, the album is more spacious, while being very effective at guitars. it featured on this disc, the eternal ride unique to this group (this is the beautiful 'lady starlight' or training is surrounded for the 1st time, a mini orchestra with strings and horns!). the rest of the album nicely assaults the listener, but with civilized manners please! : it is not in motorhead &amp; co. here! (i have nothing against lemmy and his friends said that "... on the contrary !!!!). to return to 33 laps, but with the classic 'the zoo' which matthias jabs is superbly croak his talk-box and the brilliant title track that draws the leg to secretly hypnotize you better. if we wanted to compare with the albums of the period uli roth, i would say that "animal magnetism" is perhaps closer to "taken by force" in its construction and its very melodic side. it is probably the logical consequence of the latter, more than "lovedrive" who have found a better place just before "blackout" for example !....
