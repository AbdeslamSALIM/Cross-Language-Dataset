nothing too exciting in this comedy, despite an initial idea interesting (although eyeing). few gags, few issues. round trips between the two worlds and unexplained quickly prove tiresome. tailor-made for a story but poelvoorde sewn with white thread. many resources deployed (special effects, costumes, extras ...) for not much in the end. mess.
