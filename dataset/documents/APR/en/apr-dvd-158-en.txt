by dint of reading the comments have wondered whether it twilight is not a good movie. i have long asked the question and after reading the book i found this: the myth of the vampire is not present, not a vampire movie! the followers of true blood will appeal not only sy, true blood resume the basics of vampirism, not twilight revisiting the genre through a romantic film revolving around a teenager badly in his skin point. fans of the genre will love those action-oriented will be very disappointed. this film is suitable for teenagers, they identify easily the main character. to all: you should love provided you do not have near considered above. this is not a masterpiece of the 7th art, but an excellent hobby. as eragon, twilight excels at his level: for the basics of fantasy. this in no way being sarcastic, rather unrealistic, the film does not pretend to be a masterpiece, however some will find it fantastic. for those saying it was using too much blue and green filter, be aware that film is perfectly adapted the writings of the author, bella is just a fixet on the surrounding green at the 3rd page "everything was green, i was at the martians" this is one of the few movies have really taken account of the book they are inspiring. bravo to the writers. this marks dailleurs contrast with the phoenix desert, while this is described in the book and very well adapted in the film. ps: the music is beautiful to listen without risk of overdose.
