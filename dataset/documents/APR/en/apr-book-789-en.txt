if you want to know from where all the clichés of horror film, read "the legend of hell house." the house of the damned is the mount everest of haunted houses. it is well presented in the novel, it may also be out of it: there is absolutely all the clichés, all the strings (i should say the cables!) horror film series b. an unprecedented concentration, an example of what not to do. mal writing, no reading, no imagination, the book does not fear a second.
