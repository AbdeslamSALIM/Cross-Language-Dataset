here are the best training group chauncey hannibal - dave hollister - little levi and teddy riley. even if it was not only worked on it there's not to say teddy riley was really in top form at that time. result we are entitled to a succession of hit "baby be mine" u blow my mind, "" booti call, "" joy, "" tonight's the night "and so on. voices that agree to perfection ( that of chauncey hannibal &amp; dave hollister are impressive). he rises without problem among the three best albums out this year.
