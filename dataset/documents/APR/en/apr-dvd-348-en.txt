it was the film that martin scorsese dreamed of for ages. ca?!? so many years to do what? ca? the film is not finished (the own words of martin scorsese). dicaprio, as usual, invisible, without personality or charisma. the story ... good, well that's what. yeah, nothing more. it really was worth the trouble? i think not. now the disk is okay (good quality sound and picture, bonus complacent and not very interesting).
