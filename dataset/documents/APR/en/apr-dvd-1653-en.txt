strange that this film "night and fog in japan". after a quarter of an hour when our students often talk incessantly about historical materialism, class struggle and the role of vanguard in the proletarian movement, the wily oshima forks and we pass her pill with a good old whodunit families: here, a police informer had been captured in the faculty and then fled, a student revolutionary dying soon after. is there cause and effect? the student was he a spy? who helped the spy to escape? not satisfied with this enough syrup granted to spectators who love fiction, oshima also adds some love rivalries to keep its audience and the message: in the revolutionary struggle, the constant danger of the vanguard is its gentrification, in which d ' besides the unsuccessful party and the old stalinists who run it. idea brutally highlighted in the final scene which sees our hero literally bend in a speech section secretary who falls over like a lead blanket. why see this film now feel so good 60 years? well, for the style: it begins with a fixed camera that makes us pan at 180 degrees around the table of marriage, gears (40 years before dogville) by scenes in a black background, we have fun counting freeze, zoom artery or dissolves more subtle than the average - and one of shostakovich suffered without interruption for 1:47. the film makes its small effect in 1960, we understand why. it is fun to see him today, more by curiosity than in the spirit of seeing great success.
