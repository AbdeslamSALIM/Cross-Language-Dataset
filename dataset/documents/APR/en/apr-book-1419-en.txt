i am against this kind of works that have no scope to consolidate the people in this current wave of rejection that vomits psychoanalysis! how can you be swindled by an analysis? there was not that good psychoanalysts, but it provided the fault of psychoanalysis? challenging any psychoanalytic theory because of bad practitioners, or patients who believe that the analysis of any rule a magic wand is truly an aberration ... so i ask you, who are the real crooks? would it not rather the authors of this book, which only convey all the current cliches, and not least not to promote other theories, rather than behavioral, or encourage the patient medication? in our society, we want everything and immediately, and psychoanalysis actually do not stick with it ... and so much more!
