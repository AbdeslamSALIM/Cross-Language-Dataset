vantage offers probably one of the best ideas anyone had the film been long present an event from different perspectives. and why take the stars: dennis quaid (as we had not seen for a long time and we left with pleasure), sigourney weaver (as it is not long enough), forrest whitaker (flawless), matthew fox (a little too influenced by lost) or william hurt (very good). then do a scenario that takes place and does not become repulsive to 3 Â° perspective ... ah, there is something of a failure. while the scenario is not bad in the beginning, but later the ultra-classic hollywood film that takes from half that the film failed to really take us . the action scenes seem to be pale copies of the series 24. in short, we pass a good time, but was entitled to expect better.
