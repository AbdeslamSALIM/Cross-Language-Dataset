this book is very interesting but it came a bit late ... the mother of my friend died more quickly than expected. nevertheless, this book has helped him cope with illness and death approaching. if you want to do something and not being without reacting, read this book quickly and act while there is still time. time is against us, so please hurry ... especially to say all the love you have in you and you do not dare say even for stupid reasons like "being afraid of being ridiculous."
