is it a comedy debauchery also abandons all modesty of the eyes, becoming at times repugnant? we obviously do not expect the propriety of the seventeenth century, on the contrary, but we do not expect to pornography for free. but even beyond the new discovery of freedom ... instead of simply laughing at a bawdy story but nice, you feel as dirty! damage to the subject, we could draw better than this unhealthy atmosphere. i still, unfortunately with a very bitter taste ... damage also good players.
