the first two pf are critical success but did not really past the ramp to the general public.the therefore decided to enlist a renowned producer, capable of propelling the front of the stage, with his mastery of the studio also well as its expertise in synthesizers (they now want to include in their palette of sounds). the chosen one is fantastic but very prestigious todd rundgren (a living legend in the circles of rock and pop). l ' is transformed test with flying colors: the pop sensibility arrangements rundgren (keyboards, cello, backing vocals ...) and its production hypercréative, marry well with the dark atmosphere but rather weaves that generally the group around the grave voice chanteur.le the single from the record became their first hit across the atlantic and the critics will be very élogieuses.un deserved success.
