another book about the school, as told himself pennac. and as i like pennac, i say let "them", it will be nice. we will find the smell of glue, canned spinach canteen of transpiration in the locker room of sports. one imagines already hear the bell, the squeaky chalk on the table, shouts during recess. nope. all that is now well understood, from the pen of mr. pennac slight, but this is not the center of his narrative. the story has not even been in the center. it has 2 components: the dunce and the teacher. what is amusing nonetheless is that for once we speak the same person, dunce become a teacher. anecdotes and memories enchainent fluidly, as if well known to the author. we spend the dunce existential considerations in cases of conscientious teacher who tries not to drop the crabs he meets. in short, not bad, but nothing more. so should we read? yes if you like pennac, and yes if you are or become a teacher. otherwise not. he has written better.
