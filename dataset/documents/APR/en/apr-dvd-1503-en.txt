sorry for the title, but difficult to characterize a short 5 min. despite the presence of jean-claude dreyfus and stéphane rideau, this micro-film "leaves me pantois.mr dreyfuss at the terrace of a cafe, orders a coffee. at the same time and same place a boy buys a pack of cigarettes, descends into a subway station crosses stéphane rideau, enacts it stops smoking and gives the package he just bought a mr curtain. (end point ) from here we can all imagine or not imagine anything so we took short. in brief to advise amateur short film or film technique. for others, there is the bonus that lasts 40 minutes, or 8 times longer than the film.
