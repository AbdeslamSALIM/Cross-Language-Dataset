i waited impatiently as i waited all before them .... kiss, drink, take, 1964 here comes the embrace. i think being a true fan then yes i can say i am déçu.des melodies sometimes resemble old album (song 2) pieces words that also resemble the previous texts of lullabies for children (song 12). some songs float, text quality on some tracks but the music too douce.allez the 5, 8 and 1, but this once there i played a duet rather than a treble as i searched the 3rd. miossec go to job leave us a real album
