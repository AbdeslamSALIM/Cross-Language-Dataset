produce titles that are systematically at the top of the charts is a u.s. talent show. even if all this pseudo rap and r'n'b produced by the neptunes, is especially soup for mtv addicts. being a gifted recording studios is one thing. being able to write a piece is another. pharrell proves this with "in my mind." compositions of a yawning gap are brilliantly put into sound. ideal for testing his new stereo ... but all he has hoisted (gwen stefani, snoop ...) to the tops of charts trying (without much conviction that matter) to help pharrell to give birth to some something that might resemble a song. ... pharrell the new prince? the new james brown? and kiss kiss, the new bob dylan, is not it?
