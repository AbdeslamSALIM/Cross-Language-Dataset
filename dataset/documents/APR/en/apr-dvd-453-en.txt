there is also good and bombastic, and even ridiculous in this. good pasajes, panting, prevail, however. but we feel that the author has left fascinated by his subject without trying to control. interpretation is not always very catchy. too bad because it started on the wheel covers! the mediocrity of the bonus, this dvd makes an acquisition more recommended for fans of polanski which we prefer, for our part, many other films (including frantic).
