i still had a touch of sympathy for tapie, there are no more. as the president he has never been symatique and this book has done worse (i hope not to be summoned to commissariaat corner for this). i did not learn much, but as for playing the chained duck, this book makes sad about the world around us and is worrying about the men who govern us. read before voting
