certainly, reading this comment playful i can not help but give my opinion because it is completely the opposite of what i just read! i found this book as pathetic in terms of its plot full of cliches that its denouement that i found frankly ridiculous. being passionate about egyptology and adventure stories i find that this book is a beautiful scam.
