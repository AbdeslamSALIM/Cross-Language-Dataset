there is nothing to say about nevermind except it is simply great. it's simple: this cd contains no crappy songs. throughout the length of the album it is transported by the distinctive voice of kurt cobain. one of the main qualities of nevermind is the variety. on in utero and unplugged in new york, you get shit after five minutes. if you like nirvana, the purchase of any emergency, even if you do not like nirvana, buy the same when !!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
