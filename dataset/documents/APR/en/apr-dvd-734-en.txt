seeing the trailer it does not necessarily know what to expect, but it gives enough desire to go see the movie. also, reading "michael bay" at the bottom of the poster, i did not ask question! result, a great film, shot excellently (the aesthetics of the image is very good), there are many movements, the story is very original and great music (composed by steeve jablonski)! a action film to see for those who enjoy michael bay (as far too critical of the world as it is a good director)
