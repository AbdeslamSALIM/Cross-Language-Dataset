certainly we can do anything to suck viewers today! just hire a good actor, the muscles at the seams of the coat of oil to incorporate a love story very precious and some beautiful scenes of battle and voila! so much for respect for history, for the psychology of characters, for political analysis below actual war ... in short, a film tasteless, poorly played and especially completely wrong! for example, achilles died before the entry into troy and agammemnon was murdered by his wife and not by briseis. there is also the trojans for many innocent warriors who foolishly enter the horse into their city when in reality it is all a ploy devised by the greeks to push them to do! and that we find no trace in the film "to the purists, run rather buy the movie helen of troy is far better and far more emotional.
