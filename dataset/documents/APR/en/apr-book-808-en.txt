i already the 1965 edition that i bought during my stay as a student in paris. but i wanted the most recent edition of the century being terminated. i am especially satisfied with the information now included the subjects of theater and the novel since 1940 as beckett and ionesco, and also on the new novel, robbe-grillet, sarraute and butor. also sections on literature and autobiographical his stunning psychological analysis. i am very pleased with my purchase and my colleagues, all teachers of french, are envious. as the volume is not available in the libraries of montreal they all want me borrow. here is the reaction it provokes.
