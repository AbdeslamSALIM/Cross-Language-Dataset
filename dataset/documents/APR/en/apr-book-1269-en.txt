although jordan's work is always so good, i strongly advise against this volume to the fans. if you have the option but read the original version (also available on amazon) or the spanish translation. although the translation of previous volumes by arlette rosenblum, at shores, was inadequate in some respects that of black river is properly scandalous. the translator introduced missense. like "the aiel wear short swords" (instead of spears), which is contrary to their culture! the "water wars" become "sea feuds" ... strange for a people who live in the desert, right? friends of darkness become "elect the dark", which causes confusion with the outcasts, also called chosen. the pompom is "bloody ashes", formerly translated as "sacred blood and ashes", which become "fucking". on the one hand, the vulgarity has no place in such work, on the other hand, it loses a colorful expression that is a leitmotif in the story. those who know the series will surely s' outrage of several errors in the same grind, which makes reading difficult for those used in the cycle.
