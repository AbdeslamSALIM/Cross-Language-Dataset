why i bought season 5: just to avoid injury to my library of a series i thought hitherto brilliant ... but i await the 6th with envy, hoping that it will hold the promises it made us at first. from the first episode i have not hooked, carrie is transparent gloque samantha, charlotte and miranda changed completely the opposite of his character when i think the sixth is the last hope that my booking a good surprise . 8 episodes, a little expensive and very disappointing ... then i rvisionne four autresen loop !!!!! fro !!!!!
