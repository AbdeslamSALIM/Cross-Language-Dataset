this is not the first time one sees a dvd "mansfield park" and we would expect any new production attractive and neat, just the opposite: the actors are not very beautiful, their game is weak, the sloppy script, late so stupid ... come see the 2000 version of the bbc (with p√©tulente frances o'connor) is incomparably much better. and also there is no english subtitles. french version will satisfy the bad english. does not recommend for fans of the atmosphere austeenienne
