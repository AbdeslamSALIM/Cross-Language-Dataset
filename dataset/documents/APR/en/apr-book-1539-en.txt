at first reading, i was excited about this book. i, in particular, laughed at the scene where the narrator appeals to a young prostitute who turns out to be a big crazy wrinkled, bald and brainwashed ... a great moment. for the rest, we admit that this book is very light. so light that could even be described as odorless. from painless. if not useless. we spend a good time, certainly, but that is not the subject of literature. so it must be seen not as a piece of literature, but as a gentle gay entertainment.
