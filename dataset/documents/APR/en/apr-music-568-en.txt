cherubini's requiem for mixed voices dedicated to louis xvi was a profoundly inspired without overly austere. at no time, no one feels bored. the work is inspired yet very classical in design. she seems sincere. the final piece is impressive, at least it begins to finally be subsiding. many critics have focused on the latter part of this score that evokes the soul that is detached from the body gradually ... the interpretation is neat and in the spirit of the composer.
