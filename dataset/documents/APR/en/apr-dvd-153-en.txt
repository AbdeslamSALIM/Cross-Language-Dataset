scenario very weak and without logic, complexity and involuntary lack of links between the scenes, sets and actors pathetic caricature, invraissemblances which succeed, painful images (sets of light ill employees or employees while on-end ...), hallucinating zero mixing style that generated a sub-style (: type "stinking stew ")... i think i more or less list all the faults of this film ... and the qualities you will say, frankly i do not know what to say on this subject; seriously this movie is very bad (i've seen worse ... it is the only "compliment" that comes to mind about these rivers)
