what a disappointment compared to the 1st pane chainsaw massacre (and others), this film is really the intruder in the series "a bad b-movie slapstick worthy of turnips passing on cable channels!'s charisma letherface takes a blow: he falls in love!? chainsaw duel with dennis hopper, etc. ... the story itself is certainly crazy, but do not want the road! the family lives in a sort of "park amusement "under ground!? only the blood flows freely! (phew!) to see a single time ... if not avoided! those who did not see it, do not miss anything!
