this book can be useful if you want a list of all the cottages. but it completely lacks a geographical search! cities are not sorted alphabetically but by location. if you do not know the cities, you can not find the ideal location directly. i found a search with gps points of interest (poi) much easier. if the book was sorted by location but i would buy another as it is ca 20 â‚¬ too. in tribute!
