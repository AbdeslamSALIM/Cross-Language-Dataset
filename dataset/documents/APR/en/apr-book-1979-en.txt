a good beginning, a good idea, but a book that does not keep its promises. the tangled intrigue, the characters are caricatures, it no longer believes in a second. short, a huge disappointment - the kind of book one wants to return to his publisher wanting to be repaid (nothing to do with ellroy, higini clark or even patricia cornwell).
