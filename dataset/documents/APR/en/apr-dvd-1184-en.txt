i loved this film for its heavy atmosphere. the players play a fair role not as easy to interpret the context of the film is timely. far from being complacent, the film denounces racial inequalities and too easy to obtain weapons to the united states. i recommend this film because the ending is positive. there are still way out other than with violence.
