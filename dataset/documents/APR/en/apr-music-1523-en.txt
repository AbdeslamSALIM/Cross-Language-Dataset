this disc brings together two very different sessions in their minds, but both led by miles davis. the first is in the company of heavyweights bop including milt jackson and monk thelenious. it is surprising that the title "bags groove" has been isolated to its exit from the remainder of the meeting, a historic meeting which was marked by silence provocative (?) monk in "the man i love". finally the two doses of "bags groove" are beautiful and offer the best of this encounter between two giants of jazz with strong character! the second session is more classical but high quality. means miles quintet with a great sonny rollins and horace silver on piano. it was then that were engraved for the first time "airegin" and "oleo". two future classics of modern jazz. a disc so diverse, but highly recommended.
