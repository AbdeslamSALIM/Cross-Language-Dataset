no, no and no! it should never be able to finish such a novel ... it's too unfair! not 5 star but a constellation should be able to. what a shock when we close the book and return to the "truth". alas, we are not as fitz and have neither fiv nor art but many are trapped in our world. you understand nothing? i do it on purpose of course ... absolutely read this book full of adventures, emotions and characters with psychological characteristics more surprising than each other and you understand the commitment that there is later. and there are 6 volumes. enjoy! it is the quintessence of romance.
