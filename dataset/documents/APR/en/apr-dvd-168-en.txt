i wanted to play down the comments already on "the big lebowski." this movie is for me a real masterpiece. interpretation of jeff bridges is magnificent, it is remarkably supported by steve buscemi and john goodman. "technically, soundtrack and image are of excellent quality. the passage has also been taken by a mobile french. the dude" is cool incarnate, he lives full without any kind of aggression see re-view and to keep close to hand in case of rising stress
