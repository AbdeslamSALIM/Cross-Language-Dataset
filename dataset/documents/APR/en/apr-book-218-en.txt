i am eager to buy this book after reading the many comments of praise, but what a disappointment! i attribute all the same two stars but only because he reads very quickly and the better eventually, i was quite happy to move on. one comment said that the story is very farfetched and here i am in complete agreement, this novel has brought me nothing at all except may be a feeling of unease, a sense escapes completely to the point that i even asked if we were not in a genre sense, as in a nightmare where nothing happens normally. it could be a positive review but that no, it displeased me completely, i feel i have wasted my time and so i hope soon forget this story. i pass.
