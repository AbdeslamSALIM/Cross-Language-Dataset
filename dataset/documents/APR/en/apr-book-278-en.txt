the full color property ad anima killer, killer soul and animator killer. the scenes revealed by the author, producer famous for a small thirty years, are worthy of inclusion in insane asylums at best. facilitators collaro, ardisson, dumas (mireille) and nagui are not spared. that discovery for the uninitiated! the hypertrophy of the ego, despising the human race, except for themselves and silver (wealth) they earn are devoting to the cemeteries of horrors. anecdotes underpin a narrative lively, pleasant, humorous. malo (malauss√©na) admits himself, he took advantage of the system was a vile servant. this book is the first of its cathartic effect. self-criticism - in terms humanist - will come later. a good book.
