the content is very good, very complete. for the price paid is a good buy. of course there is the format. there is a disaster if you have a conventional tv (square). you lose 15-20% left and far right. plus a little upwards and downwards (least severe). from "blake edwards" for example there are only "wards" ... by cons, on the pc, it automatically runs in true 16:9 and we then realized all that is lost on television. in short, as everyone will soon have a plasma screen, a little patience to enjoy this show soon hair that has not aged ... final score: 1 star for the format and 5 stars for content.
