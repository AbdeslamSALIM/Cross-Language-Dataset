this film, atrociously ugly and serious mistake was probably made on the sole basis of his subject allegedly sulfur, namely vague emotional and sexual tribulations of a group of indistinct characters each more grotesque than others. one wonders what the producer has been crazy enough to advance the money (and we dare hope that this is not the cnc): all that is badly directed, badly acted, poorly framed, poorly filmed, badly written, poorly designed , wobbly and ugly a to z, as a sort of tv movie fourth area that would have transported into a world of pseudo-subversive operetta sexualo-consumerist. another prior effort to impress the citizens, fellow filmmaker! above all, before another effort to impress moviegoers!
