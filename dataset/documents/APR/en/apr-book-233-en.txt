well, even if my comment will be swamped by other praise, even when i add my grain of salt. although undisciplined player (i am unable to finish a book without being taped ..) i have to confess under the charm of this novel. it's intelligent without being learned, is informative but never boring, and it's a real blast elsewhere. this book is both a dive in history, and a ticket simple evasion. would recommend.
