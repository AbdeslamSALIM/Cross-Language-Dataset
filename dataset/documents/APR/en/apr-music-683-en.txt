the bastards do better over the years. this opus is beautiful, nothing to throw. a peach of hell, the enthusiasm you want in there, concrete music and voices in very good shape. that's happiness. tip: rather buy the dvd. it has a pcm track, ie a slightly higher quality to the cd, with bonus images. que demande le peuple?
