one can be a fan of michael, we can only be sad for him. this "new" album is without interest, except a few tracks ( "break of dawn", "butterflies", "rmw", "cry" or "whatever happens") embedded in the silliness and tempos commercial unoriginal ( "invincible" is a disaster, "speechless" a bit silly, "the lost children" something without a soul, "privacy" a concern which should not be, "you are my life" a slow wash-out). michael should be careful because for the first time he failed to innovate. i am happy to have been younger when he sang really know and use sounds to make something of musically respectable.
