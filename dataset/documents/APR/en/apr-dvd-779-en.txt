this film is a real slap. an admirer of houellebecq, the film does not merely reproduce bettement a book like today are a number of accomplishments, and plunging into the facility does not have to write a scenario, it represents the world premieres of works by houellebecq and especially one part of society today. it is exciting despite the long, funny despite the issues raised, ... this film has been hunanimite with people that i watch. undoubtedly the best film harel and garcia (this is only my opinion)
