there is always a little wary when we discovered the first publication. we did not stay long with these beautiful and very fine news. from the front lines, we abandon any reluctance, any reservation. perhaps because jhumpa lahiri is so authentic in his writing, perhaps because she does not hesitate at the outset, we give the gift of life through his words. and it is moved. and we are deeply touched by his sensitivity, which reveals a veritable rainbow sky of human nature. bravo and thank you to the young indian author!
