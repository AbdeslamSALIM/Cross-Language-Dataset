take your turn, but i'm a fan of cook, i read everything but then i realize that i am not alone in thinking that. as for "the dragon never sleeps" and his latest "tyranny of the night," qushmarrah dizzy. the title is symptomatic, but cook's why we balance in the face at the beginning of unpronounceable names?? and then there are these too many characters, the reader goes from one to another without the knowledge and especially without understanding what is happening. enough is enough. good advice, focus on the chronicles of the black company and garrett.
