to me, this 3rd installment is the best of the series, waiting to judge the volume 7, and secondly because it is one that we finally plunges into a world darker and more mature as the series keeps thereafter ( the first 2 books were awesome of course but with an atmosphere more "child"). already at the outset, the dementors well announce the color of the book - horrific and evil creatures but the prison guards of azkaban, in search of criminal sirius black to eliminate it; himself searching for the hero to do the same on behalf of the evil lord voldemort. a game of cat and mouse, which plunges us immediately into a breathless suspense, since we are placing on the side of harry, we fear for his life! the rest of the book maintains the suspense and can even make us shudder ... the final until everything which is not expected! what critics of the author has never read a single hp and accusing the series for being "too childish" or "too commercial" (for movies) then read the volume 3 to get an idea of what really exhaustive what the hp saga! perhaps a good majority of them will be convinced in the end, the adventures of the boy wizard does not necessarily rhyme with 'literature to 2 francs for children "!
