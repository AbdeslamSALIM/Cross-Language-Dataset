often considered the worst filmmaker in the world, uwe boll towel critics often murderous. i have nothing against him, with his rather enjoyed alone in the dark, and bloodrayne 2 movies that are certainly not masterpieces, but honorable entertainment. now about this king rising: its qualities: achieving honest, an imperial cast (jason statham, ron perlman, ray liotta, burt reynolds, leelee sobieski, claire forlani, john rhys-davies, kristanna loken, matthew lillard), special effects quite correct, fighting rather successful, a rather hectic pace (you never get bored); its defects: a scenario ridiculous cliches of the shovel (the farmer who becomes king, the noble and the wicked magician, the king, the castle, the army of creatures (the krugs), the people of the forest etc ...) that makes you truly 2 fingers of parody at times, and frankly we want to laugh at some crossings. and what of the hero (statham) who plays a farmer named farmer (mdr!)? last fault size, some actors: between jason statham is as expressive as steven seagal, ray liotta, which makes boxes making big eyes at each occurrence, burt reynolds that delivers the minimum union in the role of king, and matthew lillard, perfectly unbearable to a nephew of king grimacing, it is not spoiled. as a result, a film certainly not unpleasant, but so inflated by defects really enormous, it becomes really means. this is particularly unfortunate that the potential was there, the budget seemed correct, and with such a cast it would have expected much better.
