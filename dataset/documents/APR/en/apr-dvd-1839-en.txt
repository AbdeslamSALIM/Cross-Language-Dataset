i am shocked by what the person who posted the first comment, i think this person has absolutely nothing to the film and realized that's why she found none. this film is wonderful i would rate the best science fiction film of our time. bruce took his role very seriously, and i give brad a palm that is magnificent in his role of madman. so i recommend to all this masterpiece which unfortunately did not talk too much about him
