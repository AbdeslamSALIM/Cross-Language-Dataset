if you love the world of magic, then do not hesitate, you will not regret it! i was literally moved by this book that combines action and love in a mixture of magic quite taking! especially that it follows from 5 different books that we leave the tps to enjoy it. ... but beware if you hang on, do not count you undo! its become a obscession head until you finish the story! i myself greatly enjoyed the lord of the rings. if it is not better, it is at least as well with the advantage of being easier to read!
