i love calogero, i enjoyed his previous albums, but there ... that mean? already, i felt that the album included only two songs or declined in a somewhat different but very similar. as the words, oh, some titles are borderline ridiculous with puns incredibly stupid and unworthy of the music calo (ex.: "on my console i fly and therein, i saw high."). me, i do not laugh ... my conclusion? looks like an album made with pals on a whim. gender, ideas dropped in qq minutes during a meeting in a cafe (game over, apple c, etc..) qq-hour job (i'm nice ...) to write it on a paper towel and recorded ... to buy only if you are absolutely unconditional.
