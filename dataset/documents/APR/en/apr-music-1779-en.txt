queen of the stone age it will resume a singer guitarist and extra guitarist, a bassist and an extraordinary powerful dave grohl on drums. from the first song you feel the power that we will offer "song for the deaf," and then follows the beautiful as what "know one knows". but the album does not stop only at these 2 songs others are equally filled party guitar and drums sedan and the voice has nothing to envy to the rest.
