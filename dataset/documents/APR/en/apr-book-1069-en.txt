this is the first novel in this series that i bought for my kids (6 and 8 years) and this will not last! we meet lulu, who looks furiously at each girl france, or at least mine! her mother scolds her (too) often for her taste, she was alarmed, it saddens and finally found a nice solution. the tone sounds very fair and the solutions offered are realistic and joyful. as mom, i applaud, and my children ask for more!
