it is difficult to compare the muse album, but for me it is the verve and passion that emerge that attract me. it was at least true for the top three. this launches a 'supermassive black hole' enough at any musical level, says a tinge more pop and electronics. the texts become more political and everything looks like a commercial release. two or three stars? one thing is certain, i do not appreciate this album because i did not find what i loved in the previous two!
