an excellent album of korn ... anything different. it enters more into electronics here. the songs are catchy and the 5 bako open the ball with a real massacre "it's on!" they close their album of 25 tracks (eh eh) with one of their best song to date "my gift to you" ... the tone is set with the album title, guests are flocking to make this album one of the most original of its kind. korn has put the dishes in the large. bravo! ff
