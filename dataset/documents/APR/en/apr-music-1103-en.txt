this artist has not miscounted in the rock world: good bands, nice strong voice ... here he has clearly decided to go elsewhere, leaving the rock behind him like a (bad?) memory. is this a deliberate choice marked by the desire to survey new territory sound? if so, we noted this and we respect (even if musically it does not drive). if not (understand wallowing in this "music" to round up and feel more mainstream and trendy), well i did not really want good road. s'acquoquiner with timbaland, it is not, but really not rock'n'roll ...
