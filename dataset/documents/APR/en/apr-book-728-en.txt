yes i think ke is the word to describe this manga. funny, well done, a scenario that without breaking records of originalit√©e will keep you in suspense, epic battles, personages of endearing (even the "bad" as shishio, anji or sojiro). of me "nice" by contrast with cons kenshin by their relative weakness (special ball for official kenshin sano). but overall a must in the same way as berserk or gto.
