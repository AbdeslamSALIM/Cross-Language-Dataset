in all honesty, i was initially quite attracted by the idea of algan and cahuc, even if a kind of embarrassment not easily definable floated in my mind throughout the reading, the vague feeling that the analysis was perhaps too simple, too easy explanation, besides being perhaps a little biased ideologically. in short, a strange malaise. and then i read on the website "life of ideas" two texts particularly criticism of the book algan and cahuc, texts found online and are dated june 24, 2008 and january 13, 2009 . the first text, by nicolas delalande, highlights the weakness of the historical argument of algan and cahuc, focusing on a particular historical point, the second text, eloi laurent, highlights several theoretical and empirical shortcomings in the analysis of two economists. both texts helped me to better understand the embarrassment i felt when reading the book and they led me to ask the title of my comment. i hope qu'algan cahuc and take the time to respond to criticisms by delalande and lawrence.
