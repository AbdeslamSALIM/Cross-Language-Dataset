a dvd that fans were waiting with impatience, and that obviously does not disappoint, because apart from the incomparable song "the scientist", this dvd is full of imagination and originality in its design and layout .. . those who could not attend the coldplay concert at the olympia discover with pleasure the title "lips like sugar" on a parade of images of the group, with 2 versions of the clip "the scientist", an exclusive interview 2 min accompanies everything. a real little treat awaiting the dvd concerts and music videos .... ;) it definitely does not tire of these little english, and especially not the inimitable voice of chris martin ... so ... coldplay, coldplay and always ... coldplay forever ...!!
