a disturbing story that intrigues as well as "they will not realize." half fantasy, half science-fiction .... very weird. basically, a light and fresh love story, on which are grafted illness, boredom, obsession. sartre and black american jazz are favorite themes in the author, becoming the first same obsession with one of the characters. after reading this book, i asked myself: maybe did i not understand? maybe i did not appreciate the poetic style that everyone talks about ... maybe will it be that i reread in the future to understand and love this book. for after this first reading in 1999, i found "the foam of days" too strange.
