this film is a pale copy of the film "the dead poets society". the three young players and are very similar and it's hard to differentiate. the conservative discourse held by the director is completely delusional, it is not surprising then that the character of raj aryan (shahrukh khan) is seen human and sensitive. there are great lengths and dialogues monotonous and repetitive. i put a star for the costumes, color and choreography, but the whole film is disappointing.
