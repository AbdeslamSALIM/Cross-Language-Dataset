three years after the last roxy music ( "avalon") almost made it all by himself, bryan ferry puts the cover under his name. but this time, mayonnaise, if it takes in terms of arrangements, sumptuous, quickly turned round at the compositions, especially in the second half of the disc. the distinguished guests were there in vain (gilmour, knopfler, hakim), they do not prevent the boredom of early dawn. fortunately, there's always excellent "slave to love" and only 2-3 interesting titles ( "sensation", "windswept"). but we expect better from a ferry that 3 interesting tracks on 9! alas, the result is called "black beast" and will be even worse ... as bowie, ferry will begin well before the 80's to experience a huge "soft coup" that was almost fatal to him.
