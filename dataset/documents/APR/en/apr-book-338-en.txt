the manifesto is a valuable historical document. concise, accessible to everyone, it shows the power of analysis of society which were capable friedrich engels, and especially karl marx (engels admitted years after the publication of the manifesto that karl marx was the author almost exclusively). by placing the document in its historical context, we realize its extraordinary quality. we also note the qualities of visionary writers who we are already talking about globalization, the growing inequality in the distribution of wealth, the man reduced to a commodity, profit unlimited short, all defects engendered by capitalism. marx and engels also expose concrete main components of a system they would like to replace capitalism and we realize that communism has nothing to do with the totalitarian systems which have been established by following in the eastern countries under the guise of communism. if communism of marx has a window, it is embodied in the paris commune in 1871 and none in stalinism.
