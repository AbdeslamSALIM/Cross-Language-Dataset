frankly, after the cover album "the 7th wave" which left us on our hunger, recollection was really not necessary ... the singer has built around 77 rockcollection repeated back several times already, a concept album or between choruses of the sixties and seventies chained it up a few chords and melodic verses unpublished. only "jelly bean", the title ensuring the promotion of real interest. so we expected a real homecoming singer (remember "bubble star"), this disc ranges poorly defined (you never know really on what song it is) is disappointing.
