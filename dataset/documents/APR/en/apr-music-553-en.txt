i thought that this second album, sounding more electro than varieties, please me more than the first, but i found quite successful. what a disappointment! first, it starts badly with this package grotesque and hideous. the contents do not go back that first impression. the flagship single from the album, "berlin" is a vaguely electro piece composed without any talent. zazie's songs border on ridiculous, it had better look elsewhere. "heartbox" is not bad, but here we touch the limits of willem: it has everything to be the pop star is missing from the france, but can not express his true potential on songs anglo-saxon. however, there must be a majority of french songs to please his fans ... in addition, electro-pop present is of poor quality, and this album is no exception. do not choose between the french variety and the anglo-saxon style in which his voice is completely drowned in a din of instruments not very endorsement, he may end up tiring everyone. in short, i expected better from this singer that electro album that will surely delight fans of britney spears and rihanna but can not satisfy the ears in search of sounds pop quality.
