ralala ... the''chronicles of narnia''has always please me! i found the book tasteless, the film die (the trick was big budjet totally devoid of anything ..) and bo has to die of boredom ... already on the film we are not enamored by the music, then on the cd, i speak ... it's not particularly bad, but not especially well, even a touch of something that please ... i am frankly disappointed by this surpoduction that the''technical''side really succeeded. go your way on this cd, and keep your money for the gem
