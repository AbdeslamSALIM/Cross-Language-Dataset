it's a film that may disappoint the true fans of the series. imagine watching a movie with gabin and signoret lined by alain delon and isabelle adjani, have been valued by the actors do not recognize their voice leaves a bitter taste! otherwise, there is nothing to say. bonuses and feedback are always much appreciated. the story is still interesting but it's like eating a fish without the taste and smell. a book for those who discover the universe of star trek.
