the beginning of the movie is rather funny and welcoming and after the appearance of the queen anjelina jolie film sinks into the most incredible of gratuitous violence (i am not particularly sensitive i found these scenes of beatings repeated unbearable ) ... so for the director a little thin which suggests a surrogate matrix i put a single star. for the blu-ray: this disc can easily serve as a demonstration disc as the image quality is special, ditto for the soundtrack ... too bad the movie is so bad ...
