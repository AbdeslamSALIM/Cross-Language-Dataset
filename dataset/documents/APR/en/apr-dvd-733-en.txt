completely agree with previous reviews: a bit of "the prisoner", a bit of "gattaca" and "minority report" but also "suspicious deaths", excellent fleece years?? with mr. douglas. the subject is very interesant, the plot captivating at first, and then share here a little twist, from the time or the hero discovers his clone. too bad, but it's still leaves look, trying to miss the countless pubs disguised, but here it is more difficult.
