i am not a fan of compil 'trade insofar as the arbitrary decision for us the best songs of an artist again, the artists themselves are often not consulted. which is a shame. here, everyone has the hands-on and it is clear that the best are (finally mine !)... here is the problem, it lacks the beautiful things is true. but after all, why not go rummaging through their discography after listening to this excellent compil'vraiment.
