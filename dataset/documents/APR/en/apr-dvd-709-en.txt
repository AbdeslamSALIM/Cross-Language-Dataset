actually not a truly great film is rather a telefilm luxury. only the final scene justifies the superb packaging of the dvd, more magic to clean the universe operates absolutely not concerned. none of the characters are endearing and the dialogue sometimes border on the ridiculous, jeremy irons makes a ton and it does not pass pas.en conclusion is that both xena and hercules the warrior, but they are tv series!
