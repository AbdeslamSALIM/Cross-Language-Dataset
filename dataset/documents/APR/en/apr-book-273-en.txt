too cute! little brown bear watching this baby is sleeping, he proposes to play but the baby is too small, he holds in his arms but he is embarrassed, the baby does not want to release him the finger ... then when the baby starts crying, little brown bear then said he must be calm, and his mother gives him head while little brown bear offered him a biscuit. it changes us the image of bottle-fed baby!
