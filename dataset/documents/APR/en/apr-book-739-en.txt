take a pinch of banal story, the story of a man and a woman divorcing. complicate matters by adding a president and an attempt to ban publication of the book. bind the preparation with a portion of the editor that feels good deal (it's normal course). go to the media hot oven! this is the recipe for success of a book that requires only 2 small hours to leave a bitter taste that puts him, time to disappear. it remains unsatisfied, but this is not the lot of lovers of sensationalism? 1 star ingredients, ink and paper.
