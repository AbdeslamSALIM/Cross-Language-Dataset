although the author during his tv appearances has demonstrated a strong charisma and made me buy this book, the fact remains that it is very thin both in thickness, number of pages, and style. the latter might be more work to sort out on much more comic, ironic and satirical. the structure resembles a large catch-all without apparent logic or demonstration. finally, there is no introspection of the author, nor desire to find causes for his acts of stinginess. introspection unveiled on the mode of comedy would have served to assert the work instead of that the main character ends up being irritating disagreeable by his stinginess, and someone who was never particularly want to meet.
