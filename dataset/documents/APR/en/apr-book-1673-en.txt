fan of the series "tears of artamon" i also read the prequels volume 1, but then this volume 2 ...... there is a whole series of "cut scene" as we would in a dvd bonus shares enchainent with references to key passages in earlier books, roughly one knows where is the book and it's really hard to take ... the book focuses on dialogues worthless nothing gives taste to go further ... i force myself because considering the price .... in short it is a reccueil "what we do not say but will not prevent you from living."
