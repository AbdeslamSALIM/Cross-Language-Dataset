... it is rotten i exaggerate a little, but having listened to (too briefly, of course) a few pieces that had more, i love this cd. fatal error: only a few good moments have slipped between the various pumping ( "noooo but squarely !!!"), miles davis is purely technical demonstrations and (too) long sessions of" music to meter. "this disc is good for: - make a background sound when you take a drink with friends. - test depth, precision percussion and bass to your audio system. - perspective, if you're a bassist, menus progress made in recent months. by cons, lovers of good music, go your way.
