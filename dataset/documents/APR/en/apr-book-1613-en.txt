disconcerting, the first word that comes to mind when completing this book full of unexpected. the author, nan aurousseau, takes us into the unknown world of installers plumbers, one of the trades necessary for the proper functioning of a modern building. the hero is the only master on board, knowing his job as a true professional, it leaves no one to put a spoke in the wheels, no blame, no point did reach if the criticism is unfounded. we thus discover the necessary requirement of the slope due to a good flow of the narrative. and like any stream, the ultimate goal is to reach the sewers. i have one word to say bravo! this remarkable novel, well built, does not support the status quo of a forgotten book on the edge of a shelf. is it fear of violence makes me smile at times of conflict? is it necessary to know the epilogue makes me swallow without restraint to the plot winks very funny? in any case, it is a success, despite the use of a language very raw, certainly, a need to give the ambience of the place, the virility of the characters.
