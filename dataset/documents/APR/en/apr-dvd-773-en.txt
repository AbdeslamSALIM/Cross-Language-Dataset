once is not custom, i will praise produced by luc besson! indeed, this movie is great loads of fun. no real story, rather a series of skits with characters all the more delusional than the other! there are two belgian jean-luc and françois damiens couchard (monstrous!), dominique pinon, jérémie renier (who gets a face full head from beginning to end), the great florence foresti commissioner in lesbian and pretty faces of mélanie laurent (sparkling nymphette in idle) and the oscar-winning marion cotillard (in an astonishing job-cons). a movie with devastating humor, more in some cases all movies at 20 million entries (follow my eyes)!
