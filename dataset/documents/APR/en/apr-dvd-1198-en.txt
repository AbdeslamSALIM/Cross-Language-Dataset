i'm almost a little annoyed not to share the enthusiasm of other amazon reviews about this korean film ... warmly recommended by a friend, i expected a lot from this film, perhaps too ... i am not "entered" in this story actually rather flat, vaguely surreal (but the word is convenient and often abusive), less poetic and uglier than expected. and even if this seems like a detail, the dvd cover shows (front and back) the only scene of some kind of threesome that is in fact not at all about the film ... "sell" and the film solely on the image a little sensual, it's misrepresentation of the product! ;-) that said, i fully understand that this film can (a lot) please and i do not regret at all having seen. its originality, its overall quality, the stand out enough production "west" for which he already deserves to be seen, if only for that.
