both after the first opus seemed successful, as the third annoyed me beyond reasonable ... point of super heroes here, a poor wet rag to prompt self-pity and whining to systematically possible. mary jane takes on a dimension of grandma castrating and peter continues to roll to his feet. while in the comic, the hero spiderman is constantly torn between his personal life and his failed life super hero, but from there to make tons! i am a former player and compulsive strange marvel, i'm e not recognized in this film. there remain a few successful fight scenes, special effects quality (the least!), but nothing that saves this film from its monotony and brings a little magic to all this ... a faster forget
