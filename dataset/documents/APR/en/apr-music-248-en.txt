this album is part of those who changed the history of r &amp; b. here, exit r. kelly and his compositions post-old school new jack: aaliyah chose a new team, it's timbaland and missy elliott. the change in sound is dramatic. it is the advent of "electronic r &amp; b, with syncopated rhythms, close to the drum'n'bass and innovative sounds. in this style purely "new school", not to mention how "if your girl only knew", "4 page letter" and especially "one in a million", finally became a classic r &amp; b contemporrain. but the album, other side is also very "old school", as evidenced by the magnificent "choosey lover" (cover of isley brothers), "the one i gave my heart to" or the resumption of marvin gaye, "got to give it up". a transition album between the old school and new school in a way that precedes the emergence of r &amp; b-electro timbaland way, which will draw extensively from the neptunes later. any fan of r &amp; b can not afford not to have him in his nightclub! this album is a true pearl is the best album of his too short career, and also a classic r &amp; b contemporrain.
