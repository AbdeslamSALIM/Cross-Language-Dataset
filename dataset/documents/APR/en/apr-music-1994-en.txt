what a shame. the music of this selda, who blends traditional turkish and 70s rock sounds interesting. seems only for editing this cd does not include the soundtracks, but the original vinyl, vinyls who served obviously. it is mostly inaudible. it crackles, it does not seem at all remastered in short, is or is not to do. for insiders and fans only.
