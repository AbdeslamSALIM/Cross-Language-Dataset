no idea worthy of the name (whether the themes, events, types of character, everything has already been worn to the cord), a style mat, no strength, no real suspense, an ideology soft booby. in short, everything that could be a decent novel for harlequin brainwashed suburban type or a script for film mass holywoodien vaguely jepeto with known actors.
