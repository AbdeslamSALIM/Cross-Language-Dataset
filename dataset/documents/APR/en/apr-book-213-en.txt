... ... ... if you enjoyed reading my dots, you will enjoy reading this book. it nothing happens. one yawns, one hastens to turn pages to caress our literary consciousness in the grain. i read this book because it's a classic. i know it's a bad reason to get into reading a book, but afterwards, i do not really see any other reason that could get into a business so tedious reading. i'm not at all like the novel, but far from being pretentious posing as students who jubla the idea of spitting on all the so-called great works of literature, i put my aversion to the novel's account taste. i need that things happen in a novel to find it interesting. you can enjoy watching the stars for an hour but not overnight. i need a shooting star passes in the sky to move all that. ultimately, i think i need a second reading of the novel critical to understand the interest that many people seem to take him. in my case, the sentimental education by flaubert has not yet really begun.
