i really disliked this version, apart from brian cox, who is still considerably more sober anthony hopkins, and much more credible, the other players do not differentiate with dragon rouge. whether edward norton, ralph fiennes and philip seymour hoffman again, these players look like characters we imagine when we read the novel, while the actor who plays dolarhyde in manhunter is ludicrous and does not fear that because of its ugly shirts. clothes, this is a sore point of manhunter. in red dragon, the cops are dressed as a cop, white shirt and jeans. in manhunter, the bad taste 80s. if the staging rattner lack of something that could make a great red dragon movie genre, the michael mann version is dull, without atmosphere, to limit the tv series.
