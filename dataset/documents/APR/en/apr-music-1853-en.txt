the elegance of this box long box hides a kind of pagan holy grail: the 4 albums of velvet, together with a prodigious quantity of unpublished material, including demos of the first album, never appeared before. four albums are absolutely essential, at least three of which have marked the history of rock. the content is perfect and the price of the package makes impossible any hesitation. yet we can make several reservations. and first, what seems most embarrassing albums are not presented with the original sleeves. the designated adopted is that of cartons of studio bands, the artwork is reproduced on the back ... miniature. another big concern: bias chronological interesting fact that the album does not begin with respect to cd compilations "vu" and "another vu", the content it is dispersed. in short, this box with a remarkable attempt at comprehensiveness, the work of the velvet as a coherent whole. but each album is different and has its own coherence, which disappears a bit here. the listener never really feel like listening to an album, but part of a larger work. finally, the lives are obviously absent from this integral.
