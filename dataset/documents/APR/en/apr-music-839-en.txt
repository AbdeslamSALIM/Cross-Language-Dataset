i have this box (i have versions 33t at the time) and what is unforgivable is to "cut" the album: pendulum is featured on cd 2! (cosmo's factory followed by pendulum, obviously there was not enough room, when you see the price they could add a cd. it may not be a problem for those who have not experienced the album original, but a purist will regret this choice, more, frankly, the first 6 albums of original ccr enough, the rest is not worth the detour, except perhaps the first version of "walk on the water" which i find better than one on the album ccr.mÃªme albums "live" me not connected. only good thing with this box you complete ccr, but is it necessary to hold the best and worst of a band?
