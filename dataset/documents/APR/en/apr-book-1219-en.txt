i read this book without knowing anything about the author, and i made a fantastic diving in the countryside of early 20th century with all the effects of war on the lives and feelings of a young girl one discovers through his diary of 14 to his 18 years. war is in the background is the impact thereof on the rear which is here put in the foreground: the women in the fields, bereavement, returning maimed, the constant anxiety for the people ladies at the front. everything is rendered correctly with alternating passages very realistic view drives and other very soft. on the last page of the book devoted to the presentation of the author, i learned that it was born in 1951, and over 141 pages, she has performed brilliantly with a transfer of personality. a book to read to younger and is also suitable for adults despite his junior rank in literature.
