it is the story of the encounter between a singer of popular dance tired and melancholy young woman, whose real similarities are to be alone and to have been wounded by life. a touching film scenario not so predictable it seems, played masterfully by cecile de france and g√©rard depardieu (but how does he manage to be so good?) which still leaves a slight feeling of dissatisfaction in their desire to be chaste, the director shall the risk of frustrating the viewer who wants a bit more emotion "seen." nobody makes j'etais when singer's film bedside but among people i know everybody loves him. the dvd, with its many bonuses (including 5 songs from a singer depardieu in the 80s!) is a good investment if you want to spend a nice evening and do not be afraid of popular tunes that run and return to your head during the hours or even days!
