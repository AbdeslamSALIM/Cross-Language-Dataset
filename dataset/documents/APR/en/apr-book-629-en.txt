this book is good because it gives ideas for recipes for gluten-intolerant and milk, but the explanations are not clear what the type of revenue. it is often necessary to make adjustments. the sweet versions are not up to my expectations: not successful. yet in traditional cuisine version i'm doing well. i am disappointed.'s up to you to judge.
