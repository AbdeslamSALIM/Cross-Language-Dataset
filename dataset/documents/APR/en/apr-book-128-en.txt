a cry in the dark is one of the few novels i read this author and i found it as awesome, if not more, than others. it starts with love, happiness and joy, and it ends with anxiety. i found him different from his other novels, because there is no murder (almost) and no violence, the main subject is the psychology of erich, what makes the novel different and very interesting. i strongly advise you, like all other novels by mary higgins clark, too.
