obama and his team of advisers have drafted a great political speech that is likely to remain in the history books. the bottom is common sense. the form is absolutely brilliant call to patriotic and religious sentiments of american voters, personal anecdotes to create the emotional link between the glorious past, painful present and bright future to build ... all there. a book you can read in the first degree with tears in their eyes ... or with a small smile of appreciation to so many skills of communication. the best is probably to read it twice!
