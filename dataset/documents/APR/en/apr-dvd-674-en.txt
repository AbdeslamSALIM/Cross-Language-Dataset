"the crossroads of death" is not only one of che work of film noir, but also the best actor very underestimated today: vicor mature. this film is among the best american film noir for years 40/50. the story is excellent, the constant drama, staging and careful nerve. special mention to richard widmark in one of his best roles of psychopath. peit the only defect is that the end is hardly credible, but it is a dvd that must have if you love cinema!
