this book is a beautiful classical french essay, which has a title too short: "history of liberalism and the left would be more logical. unfortunately, it is written in a convoluted style: page 84," in a word, liberalism solidarity and tragic, devoid of any idealism. "i thought the book would be launched in the introduction, which is a very interesting analysis today, hence my disappointment.
