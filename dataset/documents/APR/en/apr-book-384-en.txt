i have not managed to finish this book by mankell i had chosen just for the author. i did read the 4/5Ã¨me. this novel is very different from previous ones. his hero is so unpleasant that we did not want to know him better. i'm going to finish this book because it's mankell, always well written. but this book depressing not only leads us, and it does not wait. who cares.
