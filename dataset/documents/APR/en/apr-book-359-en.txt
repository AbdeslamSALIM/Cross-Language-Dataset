titeuf, in general, can not fly very high ... i can not believe that anyone can have fun with over 7 years and at least 400 words of vocabulary! anyway, making a small effort, adult curious to understand why the kids seem more or less addicted, plank by plank, we can find a joke that is sometimes vague smile. but there ... filling, repetitions of warm, whatever! and a "plot" which has neither head nor tail. in short, it appears that the vein runs out ... but there are plenty of other good comics to read! (thankfully!)
