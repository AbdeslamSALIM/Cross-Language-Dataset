if you decide to watch this movie, you better be warned ..... if violence in film can sometimes seem entertaining, aesthetic see useful .... the extraordinary violence of this film is pure aberration! the story of a little innocent girl who sees live the death of his parents and his brother .. and more is known authors ....! both psychotic (poor vision fbi) are treated as heroes since the end chosen by the author of this turnip is just that or they continue to walk freely .... not such films are only the reflection a heart patient and willing to stay .. go your way there are so many good movies (even violent) to purchase and view ....!
