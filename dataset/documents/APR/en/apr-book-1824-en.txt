difficult to attract people's attention on the impasse of the current rating system. yet there is much literature on the subject and very often right. the truth is that nobody has the time or take time to learn properly and ask the right questions. it would take a book that is both simple, short, powerful, authentic and rigorous. "the hummingbird's share" of pierre rabhi perfectly meets this expectation. simple words, well chosen. a relentless analysis, complete and without hesitation. here, no demagogue speeches on the evils of the economy, progress and money. every word is weighed and sweating wisdom. everything is there: the inconsistency of our lifestyle with its benefits and across the world's beauty and absolute vein of our presence, our true place and finally a single track hi: humility. in 45 pages at most, the message is given: to stop the confrontation, the foundation of our history and our society, but above all, to stop the one between man and nature otherwise, the outcome will be fatal - for humans in all cases. finally, as if einstein did say "everything is relative". one author that i found on the internet has completely assimilated by marrying science and spirituality. here is a passage in his text on "the cosmos by chance or continuous creation": "with a more accurate understanding of the relativity of the universe and its present beauty, we can begin a sort of celebration. we can rejoice because of threshold of consciousness that we have reached, and because the spirit in the universe, is likely to be important. our lives have become more confident, more aware, more inventive. we can reach, in the cosmos, a form of harmony still unknown.
