and to think that the priest had already suffered from the time owen ripper ... is he going to recover from this insipid nostradamus? what happened to leaving something like that? it has some good ideas but they are a little scary given the level of good men: lack of inspiration? youth gone? evaporated talent? in short nothing very nice in fact. for apart from the title song - really successful - most others are even worse than angel of retribution successful not successful already. halford shows us nothing really exciting (although still what a singer!) for tipton and downing goes here more often to 2 per hour. my view is that the priest has released nothing interesting since painkiller. or is that too i get older.
