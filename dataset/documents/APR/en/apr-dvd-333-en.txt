begins to flirt with the b series?? it is squarely within the z series, with no other interest than to show us the tripe into madness without an ounce of intelligence or subversive .. when the horror cinema, once relevant and truly rebellious and dangerous unlike most only a sad copy of itself mired in pathos heavy to drag. a series of no interest, sad, even ugly .. the first original film is saying is totally pumped about "easter man", french short film of the early 2000s .... not even original, just gore without trace elements protesters who made films as varied as suspiria texas chainsaw massacre, maniac or schramm real social work, political and inherently subversive. the horror cinema is dying, who can then save it?
