after much applause you can only fall in love right? not tout.et i am not a piss froid.je say this because what i saw on many sites, those who dare to criticize 'les choristes' are laminer.donc i did not like ( and i am still very very nice) and i am keen to speak to offset any further notice qu'Ã©logieux (masterpiece altogether). what to say is that french cinema is bad (i mean its qualities and not its scores) and 'les choristes' does not help choses.pire: it's what people expect from the film and they set it apart in culturelle.a vomit.
