300 is a kind of mixture between rpg way of the lord of the rings (the movie) and the universe type video games, all to go through the mill fantasy history of sparta. this leads to a mind-blowing film made by teenagers for teenagers prepubescent prepubescent ... some comments talk of "fascism" (??), but good ... more seriously, we may note especially the great weakness of this film and its us-centric view of history (the spartans white cons of persian soldiers in physical type "arab-african"!; speech on "freedom" in sparta actually a slave, the reference to the clash of civilizations, etc.).. frank miller, it was good twenty years ago, the time of sin city.
