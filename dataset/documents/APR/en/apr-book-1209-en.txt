reading this book left me confused. dun side your baby can express its needs in tears. among those basic needs is that of being raised by his mother (i share this opinion!). but on the other, a baby should definitely express his emotions through his tears. and the fact of taking it into the arms would prevent. this is in fact one of the "automatic control" developed by the child. in short, at least, to be absolutely confident in the subtlety of her maternal instincts, and as the act of leaving her child crying in the first case would imply much damage in the long term not to let her cry in the second is a book in my opinion, extremely incriminating. not to mention the following paradox: one postulates that the author is the newborn knows what they need. who are we then to judge of his desire to manage her tears asking for a hug? finally, some assertions are given without qualification: it absolutely necessary for example breastfeed until 6 months, keep her child in his bed until his 1 year ... and when we realize too late that we did the opposite, the author promises a future more difficult. in short, this book may be interesting, perhaps ironic (or very subtle) and certainenent blaming.
