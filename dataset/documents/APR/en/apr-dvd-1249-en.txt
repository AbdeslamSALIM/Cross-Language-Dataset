two tv movies at the time or the graphics did not exist. so the special effects are kept to a more stringent (and worse the budget is not elastic) and the script follows the adventures of a friendly doctor arranged to gamma rays (that is not a trademark lavants) and when he anger pÃªter him a lead and turn green with rage. he become strong but without ever losing his pants. and this is the greatest mystery in this series ... but how does he manage to destroy all his shirts and pants that damn does not fall when it becomes very very tall and very sturdy. go to a second star to the greatest mystery of the world.
