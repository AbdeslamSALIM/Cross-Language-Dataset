an entertaining thriller, read before a trip australia, although the stereotypes are too pronounced, a little image of epinal. australians are much nicer than that, even and especially in the bush and the outback. anyway, this is not a sociological study, a novel fun, entertaining and funny too. read for a good time relaxing.
