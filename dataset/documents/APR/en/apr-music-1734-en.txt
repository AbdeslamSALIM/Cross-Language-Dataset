dad is still better than "get away with murder." more mature, more considered, more varied. the sound is lower quality than "get away" or "tragedy" but the quality of components offsets. this disc rotates in a loop without tiring! best since the beginning. these guys are in my opinion the perfect rock / hard / punk with a voice that fits perfectly in style. a reference for long!
