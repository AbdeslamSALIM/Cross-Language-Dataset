without claiming to have seen everything, i traveled a lot by plane, both in economy class and first in businness on air france and several american companies. i have never been treated as described in this novel that is as less than nothing (euphemistic understatement in english). even if the service varies from one company to another, and that u.s. companies are a little paranoid since september 11, 2001, developed to treat all non-us potential terrorists (i am still white as an aspirin), the staff has always been friendly. in short, this novel is so grotesque and establishment of the plot so long that it becomes laughable. a new style of literature is invented the novel terminal - the novel station. it's more modern, but equally bad.
