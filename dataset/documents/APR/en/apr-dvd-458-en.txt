the film, released last under the banner ksc is far from being the funniest thing i have seen. what starts to become problematic in my view, is precisely the "key" apatow and his friends. maybe they should start talking about their obsessions or otherwise someone else .... the low side of ceiling is not involved, a spring comedy frequent, usually effective and is particularly well played by ferrell and reilly all the idea was so novel that promise. what apatow remains fascinated by the void and he has found a way to earn a living is one thing, but it can not reduce the coarse humor to a string of nonsense where gravel luck smiles on fools because of the happy ending point into a full-fledged system of thought and behavior without being fatally clumsy. remain traits of sociology and realistic and touching one or two replicas that make sense. apatow and his buddies are and however sincere it does not make a mock trial in this movie: they speak with their own words is all. but they can do better: 40 year-old virgin is the finest example. go judd, hang on to your b. ..!
