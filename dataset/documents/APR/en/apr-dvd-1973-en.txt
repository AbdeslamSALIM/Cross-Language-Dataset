well i'm not going to give you yet another review to slayers next. this season is simply the best known and will mark the anime in time for its mix of humor and adventure (and final sound very dark and very classy) . in short if you liked slayers, slayers next you'll love. if you do not like slayers ... bah, you never know, it p'tet the cygnus give him a second chance (but no promises j'vous not eh!). the problem is that this edition is pretty pathetic. it surely will retort "yessss, but for ten euros what you expected?". i totally agree! i expected no packaging or crazy bonuses galore. the is not the problem. my concern is the subtitle: this is the first translation of clicks that was ... pathetic. cons-sense; errors; names of cities and lots skinned ... you'll miss the season if you do know that trans' probably made in a cellar with a dico russian. this is especially shameful in the meantime, declic released a collector's edition (better image better sound and a bonus film), with a new translation, still not perfect but even more serious. in short, if you really do not thunes, take this box, but if you can ... take rather the collector's edition. especially as the collector of clicks are really affordable.
