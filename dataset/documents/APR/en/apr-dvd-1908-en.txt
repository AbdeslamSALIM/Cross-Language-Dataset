i put 5 stars because i think this episode 1 is undoubtedly true of other episodes, the staging is perfect, the action (almost) ubiquitous, and study the characters, well built. the dvd looks just divine and wonderful (check out the test dvdrama) short all these qualities make the episode 1 a great film!
