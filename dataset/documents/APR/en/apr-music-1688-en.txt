there are several ways to approach this album. depending on your point of view it may seem cool, likeable or detestable. for my part, i am the middle lane. finally, here is that if gamma ray head back where it left off in 1999 (powerplant)? compared to the last two installments (no world order and majestic), quality arrangements jumped dramatically, there are so catchy that sound familiar to germans. the light enhances the production side "happy metal family. on the other hand, more than ever here, gamma ray proves what he has always been a group that in the absence of known draw inspiration from the others ideas to better interpret the sauce. while purists take offense: judas priest, iron maiden, helloween and i are happily forgotten pirated. each song contains a lot of borrowing more or less outrageous. it's a fun game to find them. conversely, the beginner will find his account: this cake is a kind of best-of what has been (better?) in the heavy metal classic . with this side "without making head," very direct, which characterizes the group. very direct, this album is a punch to it than no world order, with the sound of powerplant. it is greater than the first, but stand out in the second. in short, a hard difficult to judge. total lack of innovation (see ideas for short), stereotypes galore (yes, there are solos h√©roic-fantaisy, each title), refrains perched high in all standards. in short, an album worth more. in continuity, subject to ignore this accident that was majestic. but then, if loving the second level of metal (and its high potential nanardise), interpretation (vocals, guitars) and if its specific gamma ray, the direct and unpretentious incline me to indulgence. so 2 stars.
