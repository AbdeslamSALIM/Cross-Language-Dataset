... with kid a (i think). unlike hail to the thief, there is no weakness. the songs are accessible and even catchy, but prove over time thanks to a production very fair and sober, which cost the group a mere 2 years of work ... the result was worth it, with songs frantic (bodysnatchers) or stabbing (all i need, which recalls the last few depeche mode), rhythms swirling guitar (jigsaw) and sublime ballads (nude) and even the soul warm and intimate (house of cards). first song is joyous, with its asymmetrical rhythmic bouncing and screaming children, while the latter is typically a threnody yorke (see the eraser). in sum, a classical album by radiohead, a classic short.
