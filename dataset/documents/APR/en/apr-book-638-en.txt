indeed this volume 5 is monstrous! the graphics in black and white charly adlard are always so good, and history tells us that mr.r.kirkman is still involved. it does not read, so it eats it good! a true joy and true anguish as and when reading. i strongly recommend that readers loved the tv series, this plunge into this wonderful saga zombiesque.
