since small, i've heard versions: variety, country, rock, rap or r1b. but the only one that really makes me think of christmas, his pure and carefree side is the version of tino rossi! her voice is magical and fitting perfectly with christmas carols. even at my age, i enjoy listening to this disc (which i also in 33t) during the festive season. congratulations!
