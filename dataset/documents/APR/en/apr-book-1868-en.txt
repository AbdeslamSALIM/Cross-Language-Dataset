veronique genest is a nice actress who always seems to have fishing. from there to write the story of his treatment diet in brides-les-bains for his blog readers (for whom the text, subsequently published in hard copy), there is not one that is not useful crossing. many blabla painful and uninteresting on his treatment and jokes that if two bullets are funny twice is really long beard. cote regime is the degree zero of the utility: income poor (everything is based cheese at 0% and gelatin, bof), nothing new except to repeat that we must move and eat properly. we did not need to buy a book for that. it borders on nonsense when the author wrote (i summarize, i have the book handy) but of course everything i write here n 'is not used directly, everyone must make a personal assessment with a doctor who will draw up a suitable diet, etc.. what good writing anyway, so this book?
