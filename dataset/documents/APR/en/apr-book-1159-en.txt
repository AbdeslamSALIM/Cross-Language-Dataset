"the love i have seen on the beach at frejus.'s love for me, it lasted a month and this month fills my life. if you knew how." that's what 'm the most affected. a beautiful book of poetry in prose. a book very well written and who knows how to give emotions. a book that does not slip into the sexual descriptions as some writing. have you read the book? apart from some short passages in the first half of the book, there is nothing of this, and nothing is too much. and what is more, a book that interested me closer to the work of scott fitzgerald and zelda. a book that leads to other horizons of reading and giving this desire is necessarily a successful book.
