bruce springsteen is great, his music is great, his concerts are grand, but the sound of this dvd is unworthy of lui.comment can be marketed as a production m√©diocre.le mix is bad, his voice is too recessed etc. ... frankly, one wonders if bruce has controlled the final result ..... we can also regret the songs already on the dvd of the concert in new york. (which, by cons has an excellent sound). deeply dvd of the tour magic!
