i am very very far from packaged .... with all due respect i have for manu chao, i found this last album quite "ordinary" and "flat" compared to the rest of his discography ... it is for me more of a refresher than a real creation. almost half the songs are "occasions." indeed, when it is not words that are the instrumentals that are recycled ( "panik, panik" - "politik kills" (song on this album of amadou &amp; mariam - "need of the moon" (found on "siberia counted me" etc etc ....). in short, what started to be annoying on "proxima estacion" over here by horripilate ... for other bits "new" or the words are almost nonexistent, the song is hard as hell 2 minutes, or it is a bad old rock songs of the 80s .... frankly very disappointed!
