the 2 french unfortunately not fail to pass the cape of trois√®me album, it's a shame after such a great success. i speak of course of "discovery" which was after the masterpiece of animation director of albator. house, techno, funk, rock were mixed. in "human after all", there is nothing but aggressive sounds after a few seconds and you get tired very quickly of its sequences running in a loop without any depth and have no originality. my sister eight years could do as well on my pc. in short, we can expect another album in the coming years if it took courage after this unprecedented commercial flop.
