here is an example of formatted thriller from paramount. everything is nickel, which exceeds anything. it was therefore entitled to the usual cliches, stereotyped characters, and scenes invraissemblances agreed (even the scenes of suspense and action, we see them arriving at 100 km ...), before the inevitable final battle between the noble and the wicked , served by actors "bankable" (including john "scientology cult" travolta, a good mouth movie it is true). small question: will we ever get to see a film without anyone noticing the u.s. flag in a window or behind a boat? :)
