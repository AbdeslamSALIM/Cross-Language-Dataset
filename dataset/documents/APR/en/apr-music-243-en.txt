of course after 2 years of faithful viewing of the first album, surprising little gem, it was not easy to know what to expect ... nevertheless, it is with great impatience and curiosity that i went to visit the 2nd album ... then what to think? that i would have thought if i had listened to without preconceptions, without the commitment brought to the previous songs? i think i would frankly not notice this disk among other ... here, so i made the effort to go beyond the first feeling of disappointment, to get a little further. we found almost voice (sometimes very high pitched ... matter of taste ...), and especially originality emily loizeau, but is more mannered, less natural .... the instrumentation is inventive, but it lacks emotion, humor and poetry ... the prestigious names have apparently failed to address the lack of inspiration for emily ... not so much interest for this time ... no hard feelings but ... hoping to find a little later the other world miss loizeau ...
