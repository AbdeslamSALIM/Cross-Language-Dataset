the "tribute" is a difficult exercise. placebo it was much better illustrated with "bigmouth strikes again" the smiths. here is the minimum union: exit the sumptuous harmonies of "melody nelson" ... and the result is simply missed. the rest is the future: education and very often without an inch of originality. what is the point of this "i love you i either" identical? what is dani yet we inflict us again pours his boomerang (not enough royalties with daho probably). remain the rakes, franz ferdinand and especially their interpretation and terrifying "sorry angel" (good song to fade in the remaining repertoire of the great serge). this piece glue me chills, but not enough to save a record slump well bore.
