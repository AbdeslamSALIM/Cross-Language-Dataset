after having tried 4 boxes in 2 different signs, cabinets with yellow dot, the new default: 2nd dvd contains the same episodes as the 3rd. so it is wanting, and after 2 months, it is not resolved. will he have to wait until all boxes are sold for a correction?? in all cases it's very frustrating when you love the series!
