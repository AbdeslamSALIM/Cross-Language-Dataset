ms. jacqueline chabbi his book the lord of the tribes of islam mohammed, i find it very well detailed and historically comprehensive. by last-cons this is very disappointing, the aggressive messages, one wonders why? more you read this more aggressive and penetrating into the pulpit. a book that is certainly not innocent, pity for a historian?
