what a shame to see together a clarinetist high fly and two companions as bad, and which, moreover, cover the clarinet. the magic operates only in the solo passages, or yom actually tons in homage to the style full of self-mocking pr√©tigieux its predecessor. an album so discouraged, except to the curious and lovers of virtuosity. by cons are eagerly awaiting the next album yom, with real klezmer musicians this time!
