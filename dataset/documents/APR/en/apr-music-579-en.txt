if the first part of the album is great ( "joe's garage" and "catholic girls" in particular), the album tends to drag on later. in my opinion, the top of the album is "packard goose" where musicians make up the sauce for a final very catchy. an album of parody in the tradition of "sheik yerbouty" but just a notch below.
