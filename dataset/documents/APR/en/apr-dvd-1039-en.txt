the trilogy "the eye" we had used especially in the first and second component, has a disturbing story, touching frightening. i found nothing of any cele in "the eye 3: beyond). adolescents engage in communication with the beyond (following the rituals described in a book), the story is ininteressante without interrete, only a few appear strange, were stimulated. disappointing !!!!!
