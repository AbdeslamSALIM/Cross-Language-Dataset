one word can perfectly describe this film: turnip. which i made myself a joy to find any band that i loved to follow in all their other films, both say that i fell from above. it's simple, not a single positive point not occurred to me when i saw that. i had seen first time at the movies or i fell asleep in the first half hour, and frustrated at having to pay anything, i'm still risky to rent, well, i'd definitely nothing missed. the story does not hold, the characters are completely crazy in a role that does not go short, is zero.
