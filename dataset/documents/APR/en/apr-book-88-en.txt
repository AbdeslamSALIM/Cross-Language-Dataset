the suites are always exercises in risk. the proof is that cat murderer on the basis of a first story for which the basic idea was good, back in action. alas, the result is very disappointing speech, incoherent script, ornate scenes, words twisted , drawings very average. what could be done with great humor and a touch of nonsense proves to be indeed a terrible mash to digest. so, i am bristling cons as this series that poor tuffy cons may be the pastor!
