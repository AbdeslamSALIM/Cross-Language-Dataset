a real pleasure to read this book for children and end cm1 or cm2, but mainly just for personal enjoyment (like me). the writing is very interesting and engrossing to the end. the idea is rich and the pleasure it provides is just as much. the personality of this yann is overwhelming. the hold he has on his brothers is moving reality. a vision of today's society with the main themes: uncertainty, solidarity, mutual support, abandonment, look outside and especially the pervasive strength of character in this novel who has not left me indifferent . what can i say except that i strongly recommend this excellent book which reads very easily and almost at once. happy reading to all, take pleasure and .. bon voyage!
