even if i'm not a big fan i wanted to have a concert of sum 41, and after 10 minutes which seemed a disappointing level, i changed the audio track and i moved to 2.1 and j ' admits that this is excellent sound quality, we must think of a track has changed every time you launch dvd shame, because the 2.0 is of unacceptable quality. the video is pretty good, but the angle would chanegment could be nice, especially since most of the angles taken by the camera are fairly standard and sometimes even ugly. this is still a good dvd that particular level of sum 41 concert was not much choice.
