placebo i know from the very beginning, 1995, when rooms were small and were little known and slapped the compet 'with bands such as marion (dcd since). after a very strong and powerful album inspired concerts and more and larger but still very good, this last album was released after 3 years of absence and it is bad compared to previous and what we could expect from placebo. even if two or three pieces stand out this album is sealed by a majority of unworthy titles for this group who are just there to decorate on a budget. it lacks inspiration, adds nothing to the band's career, production is pompous and music with the addition of brass that attempts hide poverty musical r√©elle.a well limit the scam. even the new image wants to give the band sounds hollow and the album cover though cheap.a soon forget. damage
