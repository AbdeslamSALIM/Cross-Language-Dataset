henri-georges clouzot is one of the directors most inspired by french cinema. it was very personal film, very dark, cynical, violent charges against the contemporary ( "the raven"), and pouratnt very popular. who has not rocked before "the wages of fear" or "the murderer lived to 21. that success, as conventional. "quai goldsmiths' is probably the most beautiful of all. it may look ten times and keep the same freshness and preserve the same surprises. because its plot is so complex, its twists so rich that always forgets the ending. it is a thriller: a corpse, a cop, a survey. but what a cop! louis jouvet, whose playing can sometimes annoyed, but here imbues his character of grain that makes it pretty unforgettable. it is through his eyes sly old fox, disillusioned and tired that examines clouzot society and its mores. the suspect is the brilliant bernard blier, lovesick and crestfallen, flanked by suzy delair, cheeky, bubbly and untruthful as it is not allowed! a delight to see them all together. clouzot takes his story with incredible control, always clear, despite the many false leads. he paints a gallery of characters all lovable. there is not a plan or a line of dialogue too. everything is perfect, and the result is simply exhilarating! seeing him again and is a source of infinite joy, a wonder of each moment. and if it was the greatest french film? with "golden helmet" and "la grande illusion" it is not far from holding the top three!
