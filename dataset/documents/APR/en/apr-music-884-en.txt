i knew sigur ros "von" their first album, but i was not concaincu in style (rather pop-rock). i heard several times that ageatis byrjun were their best album. from there, nothing has thrown everything is innovative, magic, cold, spellbinding, all with a very heterogeneous tracklisting so little repetitive ... an album ki gave me something i do not know: in short the perfect album.
