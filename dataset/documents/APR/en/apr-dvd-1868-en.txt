i attended the fall 2007 in a film lyons, the magnificent live broadcast of the metropolitan opera house, this sumptuous boheme! i heartily recommend this for both performers, superb! especially r. vargas (rudolph), ludovic tezier (marcel), a. arteta (great musette), p. plishka (grand accustomed to prod. facility in benoit and alcindoro) and a. gheorghiu (very beautiful and very respectable mimi, but i expected better, and yes, hard to replace mr. freni!). the chorus and orchestra enchant facility under the direction of luisotti. finally, the costume (pj hall) sets and the staging of zefirelli are really beautiful and very, very far from the production called "dusty" facility of yesteryear. the met has repeated know benefit!
