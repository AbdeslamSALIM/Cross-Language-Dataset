encel is definitely heartbreaking. not content to opt for constant double-talk, it chooses through this book to be the spokesman for sharon. the plan he advocated for peace between israelis and palestinians? no return of palestinian refugees to israel "to ensure the specificity of the jewish country," complete demilitarization of the palestinian territories, in his words, will the weather be particularly placed under tutorship of the future israeli state and palestinian if necessary, all countries in the middle east. hence the question: and the israeli nuclear mr. encel, is it not a threat to the region? in any case, mr encel seems nice and kindly advise israel to retry the disastrous experience of southern lebanon and destroy everything related to islam ... did we really need such a speech?
