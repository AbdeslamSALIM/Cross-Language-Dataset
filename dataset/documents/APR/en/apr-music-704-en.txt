the packaging is superb, damage, however, not having been to reissue these albums on cd referring to the black vinyl (see the superb anthology of dylan recently published). i also regret the absence of the early singles compilation that was part of the shine on box set. finally, without wishing to revive an old debate, two of pink floyd album without roger waters did not have much to do here. first, when you replay all the albums, they pale in comparison, but that's a subjective point of view, but on the other hand, these two albums are, unlike the others, appeared directly in cd when they leave, so the nostalgia aspect mini vinyl is rather anachronistic. finally, when i see the reactions to my comment, i think that old debate at a tough life, it is still relevant.
