one of my favorite movies. why? because the actors are very good, because it is a film that may seem marshmallow but that does not take itself seriously, and dreyfuss is hair. for lady hepburn, delicious in its role of an angel, especially because in this movie are saying things that you never forget, and you will really see life differently ... it's rare enough to be stressed. it is a lesson in life when we laugh, we cry and we grew out. absolutely extra.
