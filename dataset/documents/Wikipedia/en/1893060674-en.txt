Mas tried two on condition they rode for the amateur Espoir Cycliste Saint-Etienne Loire (ECSEL) for a year. Mas and Pierre Rivory, of ECSEL, choose Andrey Mizurov and Vinokourov. Mizurov did not want to leave Kazakhstan and refused. Vinokourov arrived on 22 March 1997 after completing the Tour of Malaysia. According to Lavenu, Vinokourov won this race.As Vinokourov was settling in France, Andrei Kivilev was with an amateur team in Burgos in Spain. Being a friend and from the same sports school, he and Vinokourov kept phone contact. Vinokourov spoke to his club about a place for Kivilev. Kivilev had come 29th place in the Olympic road race the previous year so the club gave him the place originally reserved for Andrei Mizourov. Kivilev arrived in St tienne in May 1997.Vinokourov came second in a stage of the Tour of Auvergne two weeks after arriving and was best climber in a Coupe de France race a week later. Then, during a trial for the Casino professional team, the Tour of Saone et Loire, he won three of the four stages. the Essor Breton. Vinokourov won ten races for his club. Vincent Lavenu offered him a two-year professional contract during the summer of 1997 to ride for the Casino for the 1998 and 1999.Early professional careerHe won six races in his first year, including the Four Days of Dunkirk, Tour de l'Oise, and stages in the Tour of Poland and Circuit des Mines.At the start of 1999 season, he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana stage race and three months later won two stages of the Midi Libre. He followed this by winning the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, when he beat the American, Jonathan Vaughters. Vinokourov lost the yellow jersey to Vaughters after the Mont Ventoux time trial but regained it on the following mountain stage. After this display, he was seen as a potential future tour contender.In 2000 he joined Team Telekom. He won the combination competition in Paris-Nice and finished third in the Critérium International.  In the Tour de France he finished 15th after working for captain Jan Ullrich. His first win for the German team was stage 18 in the Vuelta a España in which he caught the two riders in the breakaway and sprinted past Roberto Laiseka and Vicente Garcia Acosta in the last 300 metres. Several weeks later, he came second in the Olympic Games behind Jan Ullrich in front of another Telekom teammate Andreas Kloden.In 2001 during the Deutschland Tour, Vinokourov time-trialed to a stage win and took the yellow jersey from his Telekom teammate Erik Zabel. The dominance of the Telekom team was evident the following day when Rolf Aldag won and Vinokourov gained a minute and a half over the peloton to ensure victory. He rode the Tour de France that year in support of Ullrich, where he finished 16th overall.In 2002, Vinokourov won Paris-Nice after he attacked Laurent Jalabert and Andrei Kivilev on Mont Faron. This earned him the leader's jersey. On the penultimate stage to the Col d’Eze which ended in a mountaintop finish, Vinokourov kept his lead and won Paris-Nice the following day. Later in 2002, he won the first mountain stage in the Tour de Suisse  but several stages later he fell on a mountain descent and was taken to hospital after the stage. He chose not to continue in the race in order to prepare for the Tour but two weeks later, it was discovered he had a fracture of the coccyx, at the end of the spine, and could not take part in the 2002 Tour de France. Due to the absence of Ullrich for Team Telekom, Vinokourov was to be the leader that year.2003 - the breakthrough yearDuring the second stage of the 2003 Paris-Nice (won by Davide Rebellin ahead of Vinokourov and Dario Frigo), a crash occurred in the peloton in which Andrei Kivilev and two other riders were brought down. While the other two were able to get back on their bikes, Kivilev fell into a coma. He died during the night. Vinokourov was shocked and two days later said he was more motivated than ever to win Paris-Nice. The following day Vinokourov attacked on Mont Faron to win and take the leader’s jersey. It was an emotional win in which he pointed to the sky. Two days later, Vinokourov won Paris-Nice and held up a photograph of Kivilev on the podium.Exactly 40 days later, the traditional period for mourning in Kazakhstan, Vinokourov won the Amstel Gold Race. Vinokourov got to the leading group with 10 kilometres left and at five kilometres got away. He built 15 seconds that he fought to maintain up the steep Cauberg hill, winning four seconds ahead of Michael Boogerd.On the flat first stage of the 2003 Tour de Suisse, Vinokourov put in an attack that only Russian Serguei Ivanov could match and won the stage and took the lead. On the first mountain stage, Francesco Casagrande dropped Vinokourov and closed the gap to six seconds . On the following mountain stage, Casagrande attacked again and took the jersey. But several days later in an individual time trial, Casagrande cracked as Vinokourov produced a solid performance for fifth to retake the jersey and win the race.Coming into the 2003 Tour de France, Vinokourov was for the first time riding to win. He was going to share this role with Columbian Santiago Botero. Vinokourov finished second on the stage to the l'Alpe d'Huez. On the following day, Vinokourov attacked on the final climb 9km from the finish and won the stage. He moved into second overall 21 seconds short of Lance Armstrong. Several days later in the individual time trial, won by Ullrich, Vinokourov took third position and kept it to the end . He was voted the most combative rider.2004In the 2004 Paris-Nice, Vinokourov missed the break that gained five minutes on the second stage  but he bounced back to win three stages. On the fifth he attacked towards the end of a small climb with 8km to go. He built ten seconds and won with four seconds to spare. He dedicated the win to Kivilev. In the finale of stage 7, Vinokourov attacked the lead group on the flat windy coastal road with 5km to go. He caught and passed Samuel Sánchez with 2km to go and won the stage. On the final stage Vinokourov won against Denis Menchov in a breakaway sprint.In Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Vinokourov finished third behind Davide Rebellin and Michael Boogerd. Boogerd and Vinokourov had been matching each other while Rebellin waited for the sprint and won. Vinokourov crashed on the second stage of the Tour de Suisse which tore several ligaments in his shoulder which prevented him from contesting the 2004 Tour de France.He returned for the Regio Tour at the start of August. On the second stage, he won the time trial. On the following stage, he won the bunch sprint and took the leader’s jersey to win. He then rode the Vuelta a España but due to food poisoning lost time during the first week. Vinokourov recoveredg and finished fourth in the time trial. He rode the world hampionship and took the bronze medal in the time trial.2005 SeasonVinokourov’s first season win in 2005 and the first for the team was Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Vinokourov broke away with Jens Voigt with more than 50km to go. Vinokourov attacked on the final short climb 6km from the finish but could not get away from Voigt. Instead he waited and beat Voigt in the sprint. In the Dauphiné Libéré, Vinokourov won the stage on Mont Ventoux. He had attacked the favourites for the Tour de France, reaching the breakaway before attacking at several hundred metres on the uphill finish to win the stage. Vinokourov travelled back to Kazakhstan to win the national championship ahead of Mizourov and Kashechkin.2005 Tour de FranceIn July 2005, , Vinokourov claimed he was in as good condition as 2003 when he achieved third place. While Lance Armstrong's teammates said they were riding for Lance, Vinokourov said he was riding for the team. The implication was that if he or Andreas Klöden (2nd in 2004, while Ullrich was 4th) rode better than Ullrich, he would be leader.Vinokourov achieved third place in the opening time trial, beating Ullrich and Klöden by 15 seconds and 1:08. In stage 8, Armstrong followed Vinokourov's attacks but allowed Klöden to go. Vinokourov rode separated from his teammates, bringing speculation regarding Ullrich's role in the team.Vinokourov lost time in the mountains. Revenge came when he won stage 11 in a break, outsprinting Santiago Botero.Tension between Vinokourov and his team boiled on stage 14 into the Pyrenees where Vinokourov was dropped, chased for 20km and then attacked, but Kloden and Ullrich reeled him in, bringing criticism of T-Mobile's tactics which were apparently just to support Ullrich. Vinokourov settled his differences when he won stage 21 to Paris.After 3rd place in the time trial in the penultimate stage, losing time to only Armstrong and Ullrich, Vinokourov moved to 6th, trailing Leipheimer in 5th by two seconds. The final stage, usually a formality, became a showdown between Vinokourov and Leipheimer. A sprint prime with time bonuses came at 75km in Châteny-Malabry. Leipheimer and his Gerolsteiner team came to the front. Leipheimer needed to prevent Vinokourov from getting it. Gerolsteiner set a fast tempo to discourage Vinokourov. But 1.5km from the sprint, Vinokourov attacked. Soon only Leipheimer could hold his wheel, but he was not able to pass and so Vinokourov gained six seconds, Leipheimer four. Leipheimer was ahead only by a fraction of a second. When they reached Paris officials stopped the clock due to dangerous conditions (the cobblestone road was wet and slippery from rain), and the final sprint prime was cancelled.Leipheimer said he was informed that normal bonus time for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place on the stage would also not be awarded. He and others thought Leipheimer had 5th place. In the final kilometers, several riders broke clear but were caught. Then, as the pace was increasing, Vinokourov moved to the front. With 2km remaining, Laurent Brochard attacked and Vinokourov jumped on his wheel. A few seconds later Brad McGee closed the gap. When Brochard cracked, McGee moved to the front, but Vinokourov followed. They achieved a gap that could not be closed. McGee zigged and zagged, making Vinokourov work, but Vinokourov found enough power to pull around McGee and win.That was victory made of courage and guts - I really gave it all in the last kilometres, although I didn't think it was possible until I crossed the line. I just went 'à bloc' - it's unbelievable, magnificent! I have no words for it...I did think a lot about Kivilev yesterday in St. Etienne, and I think that motivated me even more. I'm very happy to win.Tour officials awarded time bonuses after all, so Vinokourov gained 20 seconds to put him into 5th place. As his contract with T-Mobile was up in 2005, many speculated which team he would join, and whether it would give him full support in 2006. The team turned out to be Manolo Saiz's Liberty Seguros-Würth.Astana-Würth TeamLiberty Seguros withdrew sponsorship on 25 May 2006 after the arrest of Manolo Saiz relating to blood doping. A coalition of companies from Kazakhstan took over sponsorship, now called Team Astana. On June 30, 2006, Astana-Würth withdrew from the 2006 Tour de France after five riders were implicated in the Operación Puerto doping case, leaving Vinokourov, one of the favorites, with three teammates, below the required six riders. Vinokourov was never accused or implicated.In the Vuelta a España, after losing time in the first mountains, Vinokourov went into attack. He lost the 7th stage to Alejandro Valverde, took revenge by winning the 8th and 9th stages and climbed to 5th place at the end of the first week. After a good time trial, and aggressive climbing on stages 17 & 18 (stage 18 was won by Kashechkin), Vinokourov took first place and claimed the gold jersey from Valverde. After a strong time trial, his 3rd stage victory, Vinokourov won the Vuelta.2007 Tour de FranceIn the 2007, Vinokourov was aiming for victory in the Tour de France. After riding the Dauphiné Libéré, he started the the 2007 Tour on July 7 in London. Vinokourov fell in the first week, injuring both knees. He lost time in the Alps, and fell from the list of contenders.After being written off, Vinokourov won the first individual time trial by 1:14 from Cadel Evans. Vinokourov said: "I am happy with my performance, I am finding my legs again. Now I want to attack in the Pyrénées. I want to thank everyone in and around the team that encouraged me to get through the Alps."  He also secured a win in stage 15, a mountain stage finishing in Loudenvielle.The following day, on July 24, Vinokourov failed the doping control following his time trial victory. His blood had a double population of erythrocytes, which implied a homologous transfusion. He delivered a positive for blood doping on 24 July 2007.As a result, his Astana Team pulled out after being requested to withdraw by ASO president Patrice ClercVinokourov's B sample came back a few days later, and Cadel Evans was declared winner of stage 13. Vinokourov was stripped of his stage 15 victory, which was awarded to Kim Kirchen of Luxembourg. According to Phil Liggett, long-time commentator for the Tour, "It is incomprehensible that Vinokourov could do such a thing when he must have known he was under suspicion because of his dealing with disgraced doctor Michele Ferrari in Italy. He must have known he would be tested at every opportunity and the time trial was the perfect occasion."Vinokourov faced a one-year ban from the sport. The UCI was by the short ban, which let him ride the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Astana has threatened to sue Vinokourov for damages,Paul Sherwen, Versus TV network commentary (7-26-07) as has Cadel Evans and team Predictor-Lotto, due to the publicity they lost for Evans not being named the winner at the time of the stage.RetirementIn December 2007, Vinokourov announced his retirement. Potential returnAlexander Vinokourov, banned for a year after doping at the 2007 Tour de France, confirmed on September 28th 2008 that he wishes to return to the sport. The 35-year-old told Belgian TV station Sporza that he wants to race again in 2009. "I love cycling. I want to come back because I didn't want to end my career in this way. I feel as if I can win once again the big races." Before returning to the saddle, however, the controversial Vinokourov faces the angry opposition of world governing body, the UCI, which has reserved the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to increase the ban which was imposed by his national federation. Various media reports claim that UCI president Pat McQuaid wants the Kazakh to serve a two-year ban, in line with the organization’s guidelines.Major Achievements         1998 &ndash; Casino1st, Overall and Stage 2, Four Days of Dunkirk1st, Overall and 1 Stage, Tour de l'Oise1st, Overall and 1 Stage, Circuit des Mines1st, Stage, Tour de Pologne1999 &ndash; Casino1st, Overall and 1 stage, Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré1st, Overall and 1 stage, Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana1st, 2 stages, Grand Prix du Midi Libre2000 &ndash; Deutsche Telekom1st, Stage 18, Vuelta a España2nd (Silver Medal), Summer Olympics: Men's Road Race2nd, Stage 18, Tour de France2001 &ndash; Deutsche Telekom1st, Overall and 1 Stage, Deutschland Tour1st, Stage 4, Tour de Suisse2002 &ndash; Team Telekom1st, Overall and Stage 4, Paris-Nice1st, Stage 3, Tour de Suisse2003 &ndash; Team Telekom1st, Amstel Gold Race1st, Overall and Stage 5, Paris-Nice1st, Overall and Stage 1, Tour de Suisse3rd, Overall, Tour de France1st, Stage 92004 &ndash; T-Mobile Team1st, Stages 5, 7 and 8, Paris-Nice1st, Overall and Stages 2 and 3, Regio Tour International3rd (Bronze Medal), World Cycling Championships Time Trial3rd, Liège-Bastogne-Liège2005 &ndash; T-Mobile Team1st &ndash; Liège-Bastogne-Liège1st, Stage 4, Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré1st,  National Road Race Championship5th, Overall, Tour de France1st, Stage 111st, Stage 212006 &ndash; Team Astana1st, Overall (maillot oro), Vuelta a España1st, Combined Classification (maillot blanc)1st, Stage 8, 9 and 202nd, Stage 17 and 181st, Overall and Stage 5, Vuelta a Castilla y León3rd (Bronze Medal), World Cycling Championships Time Trial2007 &ndash; Team Astana1st, Points classification, Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré1st, Stage 3, Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré1st, Stage 7, Critérium du Dauphiné LibéréWithdrew along with entire Team Astana before the start of stage 16 of the Tour De France due to positive homologous blood transfusion testSee alsoList of doping cases in cyclingList of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offencesReferencesExternal linksOfficial SiteAlexander Vinokourov profile    Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Kazakhstani cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of Kazakhstan Category:Olympic silver medalists for Kazakhstan Category:Tour de France Champs Elysées stage winners Category:Kazakhstani Tour de France stage winners Category:Vuelta a España stage winners Category:Vuelta a España winners Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Born in Kazakh SSRca:Alexandre Vinokúrov cs:Alexandr Vinokurov da:Aleksandr Vinokurov de:Alexander Nikolajewitsch Winokurow es:Aleksander Vinokurov eu:Alexander Vinokurov fr:Alexandre Vinokourov gl:Alexander Vinocurov it:Aleksandr Nikolaevič Vinokurov kk:Винокуров, Александр Николаевич nl:Aleksandr Vinokoerov ja:アレクサンドル・ヴィノクロフ no:Aleksandr Vinokurov pl:Aleksander Winokurow pt:Alexandr Vinokourov ru:Винокуров, Александр Николаевич fi:Aleksandr Vinokurov sv:Aleksandr Vinokurov
