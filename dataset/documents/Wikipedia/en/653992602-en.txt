Originally a Swedish settlement known as Rågervik, it became a Russian naval base in the 18th century. The Russians renamed it Балтийский Порт ("Baltiyskiy Port", i.e. Baltic Port) in 1762, and the Estonian pronunciation, Paldiski, became the official name in 1933.Soviet eraIn 1962, Paldiski became a Soviet Navy nuclear submarine training centre. With two land-based nuclear reactors, and employing some 16,000 people, it was the largest such facility in the Soviet Union. Because of its importance, the whole city was closed off with barbed wire until the last Russian warship left in August 1994. Russia finally relinquished control of the nuclear reactor facilities in September 1995.Post-independenceAfter Estonia restored its independence, the city had not enough Estonian citizens and Paldiski was subordinated to Keila until 30 October 1996. Located some 45&nbsp;km west of Tallinn, Paldiski is a municipality within Harju County and has a regular ferry connection with Kapellskär in Sweden (operated by Tallink). Derelict Soviet-style apartment buildings make up much of the town, and the relics of military bases are widespread. For those interested in such things, it is easily accessible from Tallinn, and provides a grim and atmospheric feel, befitting its post-Soviet status.Facilities todayToday the town has only 4,000 inhabitants and amenities are limited to two supermarkets, a small modern hotel (Hotel Valge Laev, with six guest bedrooms), and a small pub. Although there are no cafes or restaurants in the town, the hotel restaurant and bar are open to non-residents&nbsp;http://www.reisid24.ee/services.php?id=163.A great deal of investment has been put into the port facilities with a number of new berths having been created. Transfennica run a number of ships into the port from Hanko (Finland) and Lübeck (Germany).Paldiski has a terminus station on the Elektriraudtee rail line, providing a convenient link to the capital city. As part of the town's redevelopment this once near-derelict station has been overhauled and painted in bright yellow and white colours.Paldiski has two schools: Paldiski Gümnaasium and Vene GümnaasiumThere is one church, dedicated to St Nicholas, and part of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. Although closed for some years, this church has now reopened, with services held every Sunday lunchtime.Service and contact details from the Estonian Lutheran Church's national website. There is also a Pentecostal church, Methodist Church and Orthodox church.TriviaThe 2002 film Lilya 4-ever, set in an unnamed "former republic of the Soviet Union", was filmed in Paldiski.ReferencesExternal linksPaldiski Town official website (in Estonian)Google map of Paldiski[http://www.inyourpocket.com/estonia/tallinn/en/feature?id=55718 In Your Pocket article about Paldiski]Photo essay of the cityPictures from Paldiski by Hans Fredriksson.
