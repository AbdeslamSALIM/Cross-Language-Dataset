Taylor "for their pioneering investigations concerning deep inelastic scattering of electrons on protons and bound neutrons, which have been of essential importance for the development of the quark model in particle physics."Kendall was not only a very accomplished physicist, but also a very skilled mountaineer and photographer. He was also one of the founding members of the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was active throughout much of his life to advance the causes of UCS.
