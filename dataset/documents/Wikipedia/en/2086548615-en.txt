Grimm's law (also known as the First Germanic Sound Shift or the Rask's-Grimm's rule) named for Jacob Grimm, is a set of statements describing the inherited Proto-Indo-European (PIE) stops as they developed in Proto-Germanic (PGmc, the common ancestor of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family) in the 1st millennium BC. It establishes a set of regular correspondences between early Germanic stops and fricatives and the stop consonants of certain other centum Indo-European languages (Grimm used mostly Latin and Greek for illustration). As it is presently formulated, Grimm's Law consists of three parts, which must be thought of as three consecutive phases in the sense of a chain shift:Proto-Indo-European voiceless stops change into voiceless fricatives.Proto-Indo-European voiced stops become voiceless stops.Proto-Indo-European voiced aspirated stops become voiced fricatives; ultimately, in most Germanic languages these voiced fricatives become voiced stops.The voiced aspirated stops may have first become voiced fricatives before hardening to the voiced unaspirated stops "b", "d", and "g" under certain conditions, however some linguists dispute this. See Proto-Germanic phonology.Grimm's law was the first non-trivial systematic sound change to be discovered in linguistics; its formulation was a turning point in the development of linguistics, enabling the introduction of a rigorous methodology to historical linguistic research. The "law" was discovered by Friedrich von Schlegel in 1806 and Rasmus Christian Rask in 1818, and later elaborated (i.e. extended to include standard German) in 1822 by Jacob Grimm, the elder of the Brothers Grimm, in his book Deutsche Grammatik.In detail Further changes following Grimm's Law, as well as sound changes in other Indo-European languages, can sometimes obscure its effects. The most illustrative examples are used here.ChangeGermanic (shifted) examplesNon-Germanic (unshifted) cognates*p→fEnglish: foot,  German: Fuß, Gothic: fōtus, Icelandic, Faroese: fótur, Danish: fod, Norwegian, Swedish: fotAncient Greek: πούς (pūs), Latin: pēs, pedis, Sanskrit: pāda, Russian: под (pod), Lithuanian: pėda, Welsh pel*t→þEnglish: third, Old High German: thritto, Gothic: þridja,  Icelandic: þriðjiAncient Greek: τρίτος (tritos), Latin: tertius, Gaelic treas, Irish: trí, Sanskrit: treta, Russian: третий (tretij), Lithuanian: trečias*k→x (x later became h)English: hound, Dutch: hond, German: Hund, Gothic: hunds, Icelandic, Faroese: hundur, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish: hund Ancient Greek: κύων (kýōn), Latin: canis, Gaelic, Irish: cú, Welsh cikʷ→hwƕa ("hwa"),'' Danish hvad, Icelandic: hvað, Faroese hvat, Norwegian: hvaLatin: quod, Gaelic: ciod, Irish: cad, Sanskrit: ka-, kiṃ, Russian: ко- (''ko-''), Lithuanian: ''ką'*b→pEnglish: warp; Swedish: värpa; Dutch: werpen; Icelandic, Faroese: varpa, Gothic wairpanLatin: verber*d→tEnglish: ten, Dutch: tien, Gothic: taíhun, Icelandic: tíu, Faroese: tíggju, Danish, Norwegian: ti, Swedish: tioLatin: decem, Greek: δέκα (déka), Gaelic, Irish: deich, Sanskrit: daśan, Russian: десять (desyat'), Lithuanian: dešimt, Welsh deg*g→kEnglish: cold, Dutch: koud, German: kalt, Icelandic, Faroese: kaldur, Danish: kold, Norwegian: kald, Swedish: kall, Latin: gelūgʷ→kwEnglish: quick, Frisian: quick, queck, Dutch: kwiek,  Gothic: qius, Old Norse: kvikr, Icelandic, Faroese: kvikur, Swedish: kvick, Norwegian kvikk Lithuanian: gyvasbʰ→bEnglish: brother, Dutch: broeder, German: Bruder, Gothic: broþar, Icelandic, Faroese: bróðir, Danish, Swedish: broder, Norwegian bror Sanskrit: (bhrātā), Russian: брат (brat), Lithuanian: brolis, Old Church Slavonic: братръ (bratru)dʰ→dEnglish: door, Frisian: doar, Dutch: deur,  Gothic: daúr, Icelandic, Faroese: dyr, Danish, Norwegian: dør, Swedish: dörr Irish: doras, Sanskrit: dwār, Russian: дверь (dver'), Lithuanian: durysgʰ→gEnglish: goose, Frisian: goes, Dutch: gans, German: Gans, Icelandic: gæs, Faroese: gás, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish: gås Russian: гусь (gus')gʷʰ→gw→wEnglish: wife, Proto-Germanic: wiban (from former gwiban), Old Saxon, Old Frisian: wif, Dutch: wijf, Old High German: wib, German: Weib, Old Norse: vif, Icelandic: víf, Faroese: vív, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian: vivTocharian]] A: kip, B: kwípe (vulva)Note: Some linguists dispute the origin of the word "wife". Calvert Watkins has assumed the root word is Proto-Indo-European . http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE175.htmlThis is strikingly regular. Each phase involves one single change which applies equally to the labials () and their equivalent dentals (), velars () and rounded velars (). The first phase left the phoneme repertoire of the language without voiceless stops, the second phase filled this gap but created a new one, and so on until the chain had run its course.Note: Icelandic hv has actually reverted Grimm's Law in the last few generations, and is now pronounced kʰv or kʰf.

The voiceless stop it was preceded by did fricativize, however. (In other words, at the time in history when voiceless stops fricativized in Proto-Germanic, that fricativization only affected leading voiceless stops '''when paired' with the voiceless stop *t.)''

For example, Germanic (word-initial) *b- corresponds regularly to Latin *f-, Greek , Sanskrit , Slavic, Baltic or Celtic ''b-'', etc., while Germanic *f- corresponds to Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Slavic and Baltic ''p-'' and to zero (no initial consonant) in Celtic. The former set goes back to PIE * (faithfully reflected in Sanskrit and modified in various ways elsewhere), and the latter set to PIE *p- (shifted in Germanic, lost in Celtic, but preserved in the other groups mentioned here).See alsoVerner's lawHigh German consonant shiftGlottalic theoryThe Tuscan gorgia, a similar evolution differentiating the Tuscan dialects from Standard Italian.The Uralic Hungarian language was also affected by a similar process, leading to a high frequency of f'' and ''h, and can be compared to Finnish, which did not change this way.ReferencesCategory:Historical linguistics Category:Sound lawsaf:Eerste Germaanse klankverskuiwing bg:Закон на Грим ca:Llei de Grimm da:Den germanske lydforskydning de:Erste Lautverschiebung es:Leyes de Grimm y Verner eo:Leĝo de Grimm fr:Loi de Grimm fy:Germaanske lûdferskowing gl:Lei de Grimm ko:그림의 법칙 it:Legge di Grimm he:חוק גרים la:Lex Grimm hu:Első germán hangeltolódás nl:Eerste Germaanse klankverschuiving ja:グリムの法則 no:Grimms lov pl:Prawo Grimma pt:Lei de Grimm ru:Первое германское передвижение согласных sl:Grimmov zakon sv:Grimms lag zh:格林定律
