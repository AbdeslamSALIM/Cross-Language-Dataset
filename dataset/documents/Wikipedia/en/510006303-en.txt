The javelin throw is a track and field athletics throwing event where the object to be thrown is the javelin, a spear-like object made of metal, fiberglass and, in some cases, carbon fiber.Competition and throwsRules are similar to other throwing events: Competitors take three throws after which the top eight take another three, their best legal throw is recorded and the winner is the individual with the longest legal throw measured to the nearest centimetre or foot and inch depending on country of competition. If the javelin's point touches the ground first, the throw is marked (measured) from this point. If the throw lands flat then the distance is measured from the back of the whipcord (grip). If the tail of the javelin lands first, then the throw is not counted and scratched. The most noticeable difference with the other events is that rather than a throwing circle as used in discus, shot put and hammer throw, the competitors have a run-up area coated with the same surface used for running tracks, and a painted line on the surface for small spikes on each shoe. Many athletic tracks have javelin run-ups at each end to take advantage of any potential wind benefit.Javelin throwers gain considerable forward velocity in their run-up to their throws, and as well as upper body strength demonstrate athleticism more similar to running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more physical characteristics with sprinters than other throwing athletes with their bulky frames. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 113 km/h (70 mph).Javelin redesignsOn April 1, 1986, the men's javelin (800g, 1.76lb) was redesigned by the governing body (the IAAF Technical Committee). They decided to change the rules for javelin construction because of the increasingly frequent flat landings and the resulting discussions and protests when these attempts were declared valid or invalid by competition judges. The javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved 4cm forward, further away from the center of pressure (the point at which the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag act), so that the javelin had an increased downward pitching moment. This brings the nose down earlier, reducing the flight distance by around 10% but also causing the javelin to stick in the ground more consistently. In 1999, the women's javelin (600g, 1.32lb) was similarly redesigned.Modifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were outlawed at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books.throwing the javelin at the 1932 Summer Olympics.]]History and the javelin at the OlympicsThe javelin throw has been part of the Summer Olympics since 1906. Although the javelin is currently used only for sport in most areas, it has a long history of use for hunting and warfare. There are, for instance, numerous references to the javelin in ancient Hellenic civilization, who practised a form of javelin throwing at the ancient Olympics. Some believe the objective was to throw at a target rather than for distance, but this can not be determined. The javelin throw has a particularly strong tradition in the Nordic nations of Europe. Of the 66 Olympic medals that have been awarded in the event, 30 have gone to competitors from Norway, Sweden, or Finland. Finland is the only nation to have ever swept the medals, and has done so twice, in 1920 and 1932.Training techniquesTraditional free-weight training is often used by javelin throwers. Metal-rod exercises and resistance band exercises can be used to train a similar action to the javelin throw to increase power and intensity. Core stability can help in the transference of physical power and force from the ground through the body to the javelin. Stretching and sprint training are used to enhance the speed of the athlete at the point of release, and subsequently, the speed of the javelin.Best year performanceMen's seasons bestYEARDISTANCEATHLETEPLACE197190.68Jānis Lūsis|URSHelsinki197293.80Jānis Lūsis|URSStockholm197394.08Klaus Wolfermann|FRGLeverkusen197489.58Hannu Siitonen|FINRome197591.38Miklós Németh|HUN|1957Budapest197694.58Miklós Németh|HUN|1957Montreal197794.10Miklós Németh|HUN|1957Stockholm197894.22Michael Wessing|FRGOslo197993.84Pentti Sinersaari|FINAuckland198096.72Ferenc Paragi|HUN|1957Tata198192.48Detlef Michel|GDRBerlin198295.80Bob Roggy|USAStuttgart198399.72Tom Petranoff|USAWestwood1984104.80Uwe Hohn|GDRBerlin198596.96Uwe Hohn|GDRCanberraA new model was introduced in 1986, and all records started fresh.YEARDISTANCEATHLETEPLACE198685.74Klaus Tafelmeier|FRGComo198787.66Jan Železný|TCHNitra198886.88Jan Železný|TCHLeverkusen198987.60Kazuhiro Mizoguchi|JPNSan José199089.58Steve Backley|GBRStockholm199189.16Tom Petranoff|USAPotchefstroom199291.46Steve Backley|GBRAuckland199395.66Jan Železný|CZESheffield199491.82Jan Železný|CZESheffield199592.60Raymond Hecht|GEROslo199698.48 (WR)Jan Železný|CZEJena199794.02Jan Železný|CZEStellenbosch199890.88Aki Parviainen|FINTartu199993.09Aki Parviainen|FINKuortane200091.69Konstadinós Gatsioúdis|GREKuortane200192.80Jan Železný|CZEEdmonton200292.61Sergey Makarov|RUSSheffield200390.11Sergey Makarov|RUSDessau200487.73Aleksandr Ivanov|RUSOstrava200591.53Tero Pitkämäki|FINKuortane200691.59Andreas Thorkildsen|NOROslo200791.29Breaux Greer|USAIndianapolis200890.57 (OR)Andreas Thorkildsen|NORBeijingWomen's seasons bestYEARDISTANCEATHLETEPLACE198070.08Tatyana Biryulina|URSPodolsk198171.88Antoaneta Todorova|BUL|1971Zagreb198274.20Sofia Sakorafa|GREHania198374.76Tiina Lillak|FINTampere198474.72Petra Felke|GDRCelje198575.40Petra Felke|GDRSchwerin198677.44Fatima Whitbread|GBRStuttgart198778.90Petra Felke|GDRLeipzig198880.00Petra Felke|GDRPotsdam198976.88Petra Felke|GDRMacerata199073.08Petra Felke|GERManaus199171.44Trine Hattestad|NORFana199270.36Natalya Shikolenko|BLRMoscow199372.12Trine Hattestad|NOROslo199471.40Natalya Shikolenko|BLRSeville199571.18Natalya Shikolenko|BLRZürich199669.42Steffi Nerius|GERMonaco199769.66Trine Hattestad|NORHelsinki199870.10Tanja Damaske|GERBerlinA new model was introduced in 1999 and all records started fresh.YEARDISTANCEATHLETEPLACE199968.19Trine Hattestad|NORFana200069.48Trine Hattestad|NOROslo200171.54Osleidys Menéndez|CUBRethymno200267.47Miréla Manjani|GREMunich200366.52Miréla Manjani|GREParis200471.53 (OR)Osleidys Menéndez|CUBAthens200571.70Osleidys Menéndez|CUBHelsinki200666.91Christina Obergföll|GERAthens200770.20Christina Obergföll|GERMunich200872.28 (WR)Barbora Špotáková|CZEStuttgartTop tenMen's best throwers of all time (current 1986 model)(Updated October 3, 2008)RANKMARKATHLETEPLACEDATE1.98.48Jan Železný|CZEJena1996-05-252.93.09Aki Parviainen|FINKuortane1999-06-263.92.61Sergey Makarov|RUSSheffield2002-06-304.92.60Raymond Hecht|GEROslo1995-07-215.91.69Konstadinós Gatsioúdis|GREKuortane2000-06-246.91.59Andreas Thorkildsen|NOROslo2006-06-027.91.53Tero Pitkämäki|FINKuortane2005-06-268.91.46Steve Backley|GBRAuckland1992-01-259.91.29Breaux Greer|USAIndianapolis2007-06-2110.90.73Vadims Vasiļevskis|LATTallinn2007-07-22Women's best throwers of all time (current 1999 model)(Updated October 3, 2008)RANKMARKATHLETEPLACEDATE1.72.28Barbora Špotáková|CZEStuttgart2008-09-132.71.70Osleidys Menéndez|CUBHelsinki2005-08-143.70.78Mariya Abakumova|RUSBeijing2008-08-214.70.20Christina Obergföll|GERMunich2007-06-235.69.48Trine Hattestad|NOROslo2000-07-286.68.34Steffi Nerius|GERElstal2008-08-317.67.67Sonia Bisset|CUBSalamanca2005-07-068.67.41Miréla Manjani|GRESydney2000-09-309.67.20Tatyana Shikolenko|RUSMonaco2000-08-1810.66.91Tanja Damaske|GERErfurt1999-07-04Notable javelin throwersWomenPetra Felke, East GermanyRuth Fuchs, East GermanyTrine Hattestad, NorwayTiina Lillak, FinlandOsleidys Menéndez, CubaTessa Sanderson, Great BritainKate Schmidt, United StatesLinda Stahl, GermanyFatima Whitbread, Great BritainDana Zátopková, CzechoslovakiaBabe Didrikson, United StatesMirela Manjani, GreeceSofia Sakorafa, GreeceMenSteve Backley, Great BritainPatrik Bodén, SwedenEgil Danielsen, NorwayKonstadinós Gatsioúdis, GreeceBreaux Greer, USAUwe Hohn, GDRArto Härkönen, FinlandMatti Järvinen, FinlandTapio Korjus, FinlandDainis Kūla, Soviet Union (Latvia)Gergely Kulcsár, HungaryEric Lemming, SwedenJānis Lūsis, Soviet Union (Latvia)Sergey Makarov, RussiaJonni Myyrä, FinlandMiklós Németh, HungaryAki Parviainen, FinlandTom Petranoff, USATero Pitkämäki, FinlandTapio Rautavaara, FinlandSeppo Räty, FinlandJanusz Sidło, PolandAndreas Thorkildsen, NorwayAndrus Värnik, EstoniaVadims Vasiļevskis, LatviaJan Železný, Czech Republic]]See alsoNational champions Javelin (men)Javelin throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins.
