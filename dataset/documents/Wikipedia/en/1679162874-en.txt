It was there that he began attending classes taught by Ruhollah Khomeini, under whom Rafsanjani studied Islamic law, ethics, and science. From this time forward, Rafsanjani became dedicated to Khomeini's cause, whose aim was to establish a constitutional theocracy, and soon became a major figure in his circle.[http://www.iranian.com/Opinion/2004/April/Bloomberg/index.html Iran's power brokers: The Rafsanjanis] by Kambiz ForooharPrior to the Iranian Revolution, Rafsanjani had been jailed five times over a period of fifteen years from 1964 to 1979 for subversive activities against the Imperial government.Islamic RevolutionTogether with Mohammad Javad Bahonar, Mohammad Beheshti, Morteza Motahhari, and Abdolkarim Mousavi Ardebili, he became a key member of Iran's Revolutionary Council at the beginning of the new Islamic Republic, and became the first speaker of the Majlis of Iran , new Parliament, serving until 1989.He was one of the main figures in the Iran contra scandal but Khomeini issued a command banning any investigation about him .Rafsanjani was a founding member of the Islamic Republic Party, established soon after the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

With the state's coffers full, Rafsanjani pursued an economic liberalisation policy.

The Council of Guardians then ruled numerous ballots void and were able to get him elected as the 30th representative.

He has been seen as flip-flopping between conservative and reformist camps since the election of Mohammad Khatami, supporting reformers in that election, but going back to the conservative camp in the 2000 parliamentary elections as a result of the reformist party severely criticizing and refusing to accept him as their candidate. Reformists including Akbar Ganji accused him of involvement in murdering dissidents and writers during his presidency. In the end the major differences between the Kargozaran and the reformists party weakened both and eventually resulted in their loss at the presidential elections in 2005.

The Zionists, who constituted a strong political party in Europe, caused much disorder there. Since they had a lot of property and controlled an empire of propaganda, they made the European governments helpless. What Hitler and the German Nazis did to the Jews of Europe at that time was partly due to these circumstances with the Jews. They wanted to expel the Zionists from Europe because they always were a pain in the neck for the governments there. This is how this calamity fell upon the Muslims, especially the Palestinians, and you all know this history, more or less....The first goal was to save Europe from the evil of Zionism, and in this, they have been relatively successful.
