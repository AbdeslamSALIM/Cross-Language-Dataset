In April 2004 his blood was found to have a high ratio of hemoglobin to reticulocytes (young red blood cells), indicative of EPO or blood doping. His score was 132.9; a clean athlete would score 90. The UCI suspends a rider if the score exceeds 133. This sample also showed someone else's blood was in his bloodstream. However, neither piece of evidence in isolation constituted a positive drug test (and the test for a mixed cell population had not yet been adopted), so no action was taken.Given the two weeks between the Olympics and the Vuelta, it is likely the positive test for blood doping in the Vuelta was for the same blood doping detected at the Olympics (because foreign blood cells used in homologous blood doping remain in the body for months), confirming the positive test at the Olympics.
