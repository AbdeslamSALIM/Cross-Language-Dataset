  The cat sharks or catsharks are a family (Scyliorhinidae) of sharks, with over 110 species recorded. Paradoxically perhaps, while the group is called the cat shark family, many species are commonly called dogfish. Recent DNA analysis have shown this group to be more closely related to batoids than to other sharks.Cat sharks may be distinguished by their elongated cat-like eyes and two small dorsal fins set far back. Most species are not particularly large, with lengths up to 60 - 70 cm or so, although the humpback cat shark, Apristurus gibbosus, from the deep waters of the South China Sea has been recorded at 4 m in length. Most of the species have a patterned appearance, ranging from stripes to patches to spots. They feed on invertebrates and smaller fish. Some species are ovoviviparous while most lay eggs in tough egg-cases with curly tendrils at each end known as mermaid's purses.The "swell sharks" of the genus Cephaloscyllium have the curious ability to fill their stomachs with water or air when threatened, increasing their girth by a factor of 2 or 3.The Australian marbled catshark, Atelomycterus macleayi, is a favored type for home aquaria, because it rarely grows to more than 60 cm (2 ft) in length.RecentGeneraApristurusAsymbolusAtelomycterusAulohalaelurusCephaloscylliumCephalurusGaleusHalaelurusHaploblepharusHolohalaelurusParmaturusPentanchusPorodermaSchroederichthysScyliorhinusCladogramSchyliorhinidaeCaninoaSchyliorhininaeGaleinaePentanchiniGaleiniGaleinaHalelaelurinaAtelomycterininaeSchroedericthyinaeSee alsoList of sharksExternal linksFishBase entry for ScyliorhinidaeAnimal Diversity Web entry for ScyliorhinidaeMikko's Phylogeny Archive - ScyliorhinidaeCategory:Scyliorhinidae Category:Carcharhiniformesar:قرش قطي de:Katzenhaie es:Scyliorhinidae fr:Scyliorhinidae it:Scyliorhinidae hu:Macskacápafélék nl:Kathaaien pl:Rekinkowate zh:猫鲨科
