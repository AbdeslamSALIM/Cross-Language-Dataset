As Crown Prince, he killed his family at a royal dinner, including the previous King, on June 1 2001. Dipendra was also mortally wounded by what the official report characterizes as a self-inflicted gunshot to the side of the head. After the murder of his father, he officially became king for three days as he lingered in a coma.EducationDipendra received his early education at Budhanilkantha School, Kathmandu.He was then educated at Eton College, England. The prince had been disciplined while at Eton for selling alcohol.After Eton, he attended Tribhuvan University in Nepal and later joined the Military Academy, Kharipati. He studied through his master's degree from Tribhuvan University and was a PhD student in the same University. He was known to have been skilled in karate.Motive for murder Official reports state that Dipendra assassinated family members because of anger over a marriage dispute. Dipendra's choice of a bride was Devyani Rana, daughter of Pashupati SJB Rana (C Class), a member of the Rana clan, against whom the Shah family of kings have a historic animosity. In recent times, though, Shah kings and princes have married almost exclusively members of the A Class Rana family. The Rana clan had served as the hereditary prime ministers of Nepal until 1951, with the title Maharaja, and the two clans have a long history of inter-marriages.According to official accounts, Dipendra was denied his choice of a wife by his mother Aiswarya, and so he massacred his family in a much-publicised incident after indulging in a drinking binge. Among the dead were his father King Birendra, mother, brother, and sister. Dipendra survived comatose for three days, and was proclaimed King in his hospital bed.
