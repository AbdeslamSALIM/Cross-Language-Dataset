She is styled HM The Queen.A commoner, the daughter of Karl August Haraldsen and his wife, née Dagny Ulrichsen, she became engaged to then Crown Prince Harald in March 1968. They had been dating for nine years, although this had been kept secret because of opposition to her non-royal status. The Crown Prince made it clear to his father, King Olav V, that he would remain unmarried for life unless he could marry her. This would in effect put an end to the rule of his family and most likely monarchy in Norway as he was the sole heir. Olav V consulted the government for advice and the result was that the couple were wed on 29 August 1968, in Oslo. She thus acquired the style Her Royal Highness and the title Crown Princess of Norway.Following the death of King Olav V on 17 January 1991, Sonja became Norway's first queen consort in 53 years. She and King Harald have two children, Princess Märtha Louise married to Ari Behn and Crown Prince Haakon Magnus married to Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby.IssueNameBirthNotesPrincess Märtha Louise]]22 September 1971married to Ari Behn since 2002, has issue (three daughters)Crown Prince Haakon Magnus]]20 July 1973Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby]] since 2001, has issue (one daughter and one son)In 2005, Queen Sonja became the first queen ever to visit Antarctica.
