In his first full season he scored 17 goals in 23 appearances including a hat-trick against Estudiantes. He left River at the beginning of the 2004/2005 season joining Spartak Moscow for a fee of £6.5 million. During his time at River he scored 55 times in 89 appearances.In the 2005 season, playing for Spartak Moscow, Cavenaghi scored 7 goals in 26 appearances (compared with 14 for Kirichenko - the season's top-scorer) and played his part in helping Spartak win a UEFA Champions League place. It was a difficult first season for Cavenaghi, however, as he struggled to cope with an unfamiliar style of play, the artificial pitches and the Russian language.Although he started the 2006 season better than the previous one, he faded in the second half and transfer rumors began to surface. On 22 January 2007, Cavenaghi was sold to French 1st division club Bordeaux for an undisclosed fee, although the Russian media speculated that the deal was worth approximately $11 million with possible future fees. He currently wears the number 9 shirt for Bordeaux.He was a part of the Argentina Under-20 squad that finished fourth in the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship.On February 3, 2007 he played his first Ligue 1 match for Bordeaux against Nice. Cavenaghi has been a hero lately because of his famous 10 goals in 9 matches.   This performance also brought him to the attention of Alfio Basile who called him up for the Argentina national team and gave him his debut against Egypt on March 26 2008.Career statistics+ All-Time Club PerformanceClubSeasonDomestic LeagueDomestic CupsSouth AmericaTotalAppsGoalsAsstsAppsGoalsAsstsAppsGoalsAsstsAppsGoalsAsstsRiver Plate2000-0151-------51-2001-022317----32-2619-2002-032320----84-3124-2003-043823----2210-4927-Total8955----3316-12271-Spartak Moscow200491-------91-2005256-11----267-2006175-------185-Total5112-11----5313-Girondins Bordeaux2006-07921------92-2007-0823151652-75-3522-2008-0932-------32-Total35191762-75-4726-Career Totals175861773-4121-223110-(Correct as of 25 Aug 2008)References and  tags and the tag below -- External linksCavenaghi's page on Spartak's official website Goal.com profile Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Buenos Aires Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentines of Italian descent Category:Argentina international footballers Category:River Plate footballers Category:FC Spartak Moscow players Category:FC Girondins de Bordeaux players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Russian Premier League playersde:Fernando Cavenaghi es:Fernando Cavenaghi fr:Fernando Cavenaghi it:Fernando Cavenaghi he:פרננדו קאבנגי nl:Fernando Cavenaghi ja:フェルナンド・カベナギ pl:Fernando Cavenaghi pt:Fernando Cavenaghi ru:Кавенаги, Фернандо Эсекиэль sv:Fernando Cavenaghi
