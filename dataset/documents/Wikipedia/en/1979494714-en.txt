He is the lead singer and one of three guitarists for the American rock band Pearl Jam. He is notable for his "golden baritone" vocal style,Fenton, David. &quot;Something In The Way&quot;. Salon.com. August 26, 1996. and is considered a cultural icon of alternative rock.White, Nicholas. &quot;Eddie Vedder: Fatherhood 'Fueled My Anger' About World&quot;. People. September 19, 2007.BiographyEarly lifeEddie Vedder was born Edward Louis Severson III in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, the son of Karen Lee (née Vedder) and Edward Louis Severson, Jr.Ancestry of Eddie Vedder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; His father was a lounge musician. His parents divorced in 1965, when Vedder was a year old. His mother soon remarried a man named Peter Mueller, an attorney, and young Vedder was raised believing that Mueller was his biological father. While living in Evanston, Vedder's family fostered seven younger children in a group home.Greene, Jo-Ann. &quot;Intrigue and Incest: Pearl Jam and the Secret History of Seattle&quot; (Part 2). Goldmine. August 20, 1993.In the mid-1970s, the family, including Vedder's three younger half-brothers, moved to San Diego County, California. It was at this point that Vedder, who had received a guitar from his mother on his 12th birthday, began turning to music as a source of comfort. He particularly found solace in The Who's Quadrophenia.Kot, Greg. &quot;Rebels With a Cause&quot;. Chicago Tribune. July 9, 1995. His mother and Mueller divorced when Vedder was in his late teens. His mother and brothers moved back to the Chicago area, but Vedder remained with his stepfather in California so he would not have to change high schools.It was not until after the divorce that Vedder learned the truth about his parentage, that Mueller was really his stepfather. Vedder had met his biological father briefly as a child, but had believed that Severson was merely an old friend of his parents. By the time Vedder learned the truth, Severson had died of multiple sclerosis. (This is expressed in the song "Alive" on the album Ten.) Vedder's already bad relationship with his stepfather became increasingly strained. He eventually dropped out of San Dieguito High School in his senior year due to the pressures of balancing school with a nightly job at a drug store in Encinitas.Hilburn, Robert. &quot;He Didn't Ask for All This&quot;. Los Angeles Times. May 1, 1994. He joined the rest of his family in Chicago, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Eddie Vedder, "Vedder" being his mother's maiden name.In 1984, Vedder returned to San Diego with his girlfriend, Beth Liebling. He kept busy recording demo tapes at his home and working various jobs, including positions as a night attendant at a local gas station and a contracted security guard at the La Valencia Hotel in La Jolla. Vedder had several stints in San Diego area bands, including Surf and Destroy and The Butts. One of those bands, called Indian Style,Cross, Alan. &quot;Alt-Rock's Greatest Rhythm Sections - Seg. 2&quot;. ongoinghistory.com. included future Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk.Patrick. &quot;Interview with Brad Wilk, Drummer for Audioslave&quot;. digital-noise.net. 2003.Musical careerBad Radio In 1988, the rather shy singer became the vocalist for the San Diego progressive funk rock band Bad Radio. The music of the original incarnation of the band was influenced by Duran Duran; however, after Vedder joined Bad Radio, the band moved on to a more alternative rock sound influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.Colapinto, John. &quot;Pearl Jam's Mystery Man&quot;. Rolling Stone. November 28, 1996. During his time with Bad Radio he premiered the song "Better Man", a song written by Vedder when he was in high school and which he based on the relationship between his mother and his stepfather. This song would later become a hit for Vedder's future band, Pearl Jam. Bad Radio was a popular live band in Southern California, but never released a record on a major label. Vedder's last show with the band was February 11, 1990.Temple of the Dog Throughout the rest of 1990 Vedder worked part-time at a gas station. Later that year, Vedder's friend and former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons gave him a demo tape from a band in Seattle, Washington that was looking for a singer. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. Vedder wrote lyrics for three of the songs as a mini-opera which he called the "Mamasan trilogy". The songs tell the story of a young man who, like Vedder, learns that he had been lied to about his paternity and that his real father is dead ("Alive"). He grows up to become a serial killer ("Once"), and is eventually imprisoned and sentenced to death ("Footsteps"). Vedder recorded vocals for the three songs, and mailed the demo tape back to Seattle. The three songs would later became Pearl Jam's "Alive", "Once", and "Footsteps".After hearing Vedder's tape, former Mother Love Bone members Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament invited Vedder to come to Seattle to audition for their new band. They were instantly impressed with his unique sound. At the time Gossard and Ament were working on the Temple of the Dog project founded by Soundgarden's Chris Cornell as a musical tribute to Mother Love Bone's frontman Andrew Wood. Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron and newcomer Mike McCready were also a part of the project. The song "Hunger Strike" became a duet between Cornell and Vedder. Cornell was having trouble with the vocals at practice, when Vedder stepped in. Cornell later said that "he sang half of that song not even knowing that I'd wanted the part to be there and he sang it exactly the way I was thinking about doing it, just instinctively."&lt;/ref&gt; Vedder would provide background vocals on several other songs as well. In April 1991, Temple of the Dog was released through A&amp;M Records.Pearl Jam [[Image:1101931025 400.jpg|left|thumb|Eddie Vedder appeared on the cover of the October 25, 1993 issue of Time, as part of the feature article discussing the rising popularity of the grunge movement. Vedder had declined to participate, and was upset with the magazine about the cover.Marks, Craig. "Let's Get Lost". Spin. December 1994.]]Pearl Jam was formed in 1990 by Ament, Gossard, and McCready, who then recruited Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band signed to Epic Records in 1991. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band a few months later following the completion of the band's debut studio album, Ten. Ten broke the band into the mainstream, and became one of the best selling alternative albums of the 1990s. The band found itself amidst the sudden popularity and attention being paid to the Seattle music scene and the genre known as grunge. Upon its release, the band's sophomore album, Vs., set at the time the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200.Feeling the pressures of success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on Vedder, the band decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos.Ashare, Matt. "The Sweet Smell of (Moderate) Success". CMJ. July 2000. In 1994, the band began a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster, which lasted for three years and limited the band's ability to tour in the United States.DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. ISBN 0-306-81271-1, pg. 58 Later that same year the band released its third studio album, Vitalogy, which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status. Many of the songs on Vitalogy appear to be based by Vedder around the pressures of fame.Weisel, Al. "Pearl Jam: Vitalogy". Rolling Stone. December 15, 1994. p. 91–92. It was at this time that Vedder began to be featured more on rhythm guitar.Following the firing of Abbruzzese in 1994, drummer Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder, joined the band. The band subsequently released No Code in 1996 and Yield in 1998. The band once again changed drummers in 1998, with Irons leaving the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Irons was replaced by former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, who has been with the band ever since. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded "Last Kiss", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was first released on the band's 1998 fan club single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the general public as a single in 1999. "Last Kiss" peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single. In 2000, the band released its sixth studio album Binaural and initiated a successful and ongoing series of official bootlegs. In 2002, the band released its seventh studio album Riot Act and in 2006 the band released its eighth studio album, the eponymous Pearl Jam. The band has begun preliminary work on its ninth studio album.On Pearl Jam records, Vedder uses the pseudonym "Jerome Turner" for his non-musical (usually design and artwork) contributions. He has also at times used the pseudonym of "Wes C. Addle" ("West Seattle").Songwriting and influencesVedder's lyrical topics range from personal ("Alive", "Better Man") to social and political concerns ("Even Flow", "World Wide Suicide"). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals.Tannenbaum, Rob. &quot;Rebels Without a Pause&quot;. George. July 2000. Other recurring themes include the use of water metaphors,Lindgren, Hugo. &quot;Music; Pearl Jam Turns Pop Fame on Its Head: Less Is More&quot;. The New York Times. November 10, 2002. as well as the idea of leaving everything behind to start again (featured in such songs as "Rearviewmirror", "MFC", "Evacuation", and "Gone").Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder's vocals as a "Jim Morrison-like vocal growl."DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. ISBN 0-306-81271-1, pg. 57 Vedder has inducted The Doors, Neil Young, the Ramones, and R.E.M. into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in his induction speeches he has cited them all as influences. Other influences that Vedder has cited include The Who, The Jackson 5, The Beatles, Talking Heads, Sonic Youth, Fugazi, Tom Waits, and the Pixies.Milner, Greg. &quot;My Life in Music: Eddie Vedder&quot;. Spin. July 15, 2003.Although best known as a vocalist, Vedder also plays guitar on many Pearl Jam songs, beginning with "Rearviewmirror" and "Elderly Woman Behind the Counter in a Small Town" from Vs. He began to change the band's dynamics as he started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. Vedder's guitar playing helped the band's sound progress toward a more stripped-down style; the songs "Rearviewmirror" and "Corduroy" feature Vedder's raw, punk-influenced guitar playing. As he had more influence on the band's sound he began to remove traces of catchiness in the band's musical output. He said, "I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes." He has also contributed performances on the ukulele, harmonica, accordion, and electric sitar to various Pearl Jam recordings.Live performancesThroughout Pearl Jam's career, Vedder has engaged in interactivity with the crowd during the band's concerts. Early on in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in stage diving as well as crowd surfing. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, "It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates."Hiatt, Brian. &quot;Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public&quot; Rolling Stone. June 20, 2006. Even though he has ceased participating in more extreme concert activties, Vedder's connection with the audience has continued to play an important part in the band's concerts. He stated, "I look around the audience, and there's so many faces, and I've looked into the eyes of at least the ones I could see -- there's at least 1,000 faces -- and I've communicated directly to them and seen where they're coming from...One thing I don't feel is separation from the crowd. I don't feel like we're speaking from a platform, I feel like we are communicating on the same level."Vedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam. He usually comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy. During Pearl Jam's 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, Vedder stood atop his stool, took out a marker pen, and wrote PRO-CHOICE down his arm in large letters when the band performed the song "Porch". During Pearl Jam's 2007 Lollapalooza headlining show, Vedder and the band played a song telling the crowd in Chicago to boycott the oil company B.P. Amoco because they had been polluting Lake Michigan and had not planned to stop after they received approval from the government when they enlarged their factories.Vedder is known for playing "presets" at Pearl Jam shows, coming onstage with just a guitar (sometimes with a harmonica) and playing one or two songs to warm up the audience for the opening band. The songs performed during this part of the set are frequently slower acoustic songs such as "Long Road" and Cat Stevens's "Trouble". Many of these songs are not frequently on the Pearl Jam set list, giving audiences a chance to hear material in a more intimate manner.Other musical projects[[Image:Eddie Vedder 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eddie Vedder performing at the premiere for Body of War at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival]]Soundtrack contributionsVedder has contributed solo material to several soundtracks and compilations, including the soundtracks for the films Dead Man Walking, I Am Sam, Into the Wild, and Body of War.
