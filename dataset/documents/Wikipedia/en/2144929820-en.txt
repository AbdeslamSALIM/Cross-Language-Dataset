Milan. The son of Cesare Maldini, and is the most-selected player in the history of the club, Serie A and the Italian national team. He has played at left back for the majority of his career, since 2002 he has been deployed in that position or as a centre back.He is the most capped player for the Italian national team, retiring from international duty in 2002 having finished second in both the 1994 World Cup and the 2000 European Football Championship.Club careerMaldini made his league debut on 20 January 1985, at the age of sixteen, against Udinese Calcio as a halftime substitution for the injured Sergio Battistini. It would be his only league appearance of the campaign, but he was in the starting eleven the following season.The 1987&amp;ndash;88 Scudetto marked Maldini's first major trophy, and the first of seven league titles, with the club. He was also part of AC Milan's undefeated "Dream Team" from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.In addition to winning his third Champions League and reaching the 1994 FIFA World Cup final, Maldini became the first defender ever to win World Soccer magazine's annual World Player of the Year Award. During his acceptance speech, Maldini called his milestone "a particular matter of pride because defenders generally receive so much less attention from fans and the media than goalscorers. We are more in the engine room rather than taking the glory." He then singled out Milan captain Franco Baresi as a player who "really deserved to receive the sort of award I have received."Maldini played his 600th Serie A match on 13 May 2007, in a 1&ndash;1 draw at Calcio Catania. On 25 September 2005, Maldini broke Dino Zoff's Serie A appearance record after playing his 571st league match against Treviso F.B.C.; seven days earlier, he had played his 800th game in all competitions for Milan. On February 16, 2008, Maldini reached 1,000 senior games with AC Milan and Italy when he entered as a substitute against Parma.Maldini has participated in eight UEFA Champions League finals during the course of his career, which is more than any other active player, and equals the record held by Francisco Gento, though Gento also appeared in a Cup Winners Cup final, bringing his total European finals to nine. Maldini has lifted the trophy five times, the latest coming in Milan's 2-1 victory over Liverpool in the 2007 CL final on 23 May 2007, in Athens. In an interview with ESPN that aired prior to the broadcast of the 2007 final, he labeled the 2005 final, which Milan lost on penalties to Liverpool in extra time after blowing a 3&ndash;0 lead, the worst moment of his career, even though he had scored the fastest-ever goal in a European Clubs' Cup final just 51 seconds into the match, in the process also becoming the oldest player ever to score in a final.Maldini announced his plans to retire at the end of the 2007-08 season, saying that he would do so with "no regrets." However, following Milan's elimination from the Champions League by Arsenal F.C. in March, Maldini stated that he would possibly delay his retirement for at least a further year. He signed an extension on June 6 that will keep him at Milan for the 2008-09 season.Milan plans to retire his number 3 shirt, but it will be bequeathed to one of his sons if one makes the club's senior side. His eldest son, Christian, is twelve years old and is currently playing for the Milan youth squad.International careerIn 1986, Maldini was called up by his father, Cesare, to the Italian U-21 side, where he earned twelve caps and scored five goals in two years. He made his Azzurri debut at the age of nineteen on March 31, 1988, in a 1-1 friendly draw against Yugoslavia, and made one appearance for Italy at the 1988 Summer Olympics. Maldini featured in all four of Italy's games at Euro 1988, and participated in his first World Cup in 1990, where Italy lost to Argentina in the semifinals on penalties.Maldini's first international goal came in his 44th career match, in a 2-0 friendly win over Mexico on January 20, 1993. He captained Italy at the start of the 1994 World Cup, losing to Brazil in the final on penalties. Euro 1996 would see Italy eliminated in the group stage, and the quarterfinals of the 1998 World Cup. Italy did reach the final of Euro 2000, but lost to France; it would be closest that Maldini would come to winning a major tournament.After Italy were eliminated in the 2002 World Cup round of sixteen, Maldini retired trophyless from international competition as Italy's most capped player. He scored seven international goals, all coming in home games. He spent over half of his sixteen years as an international as team captain, wearing the armband a record seventy-four times. He is also the only current Milan player who have earned the most caps for their national teams.Honours 'AC Milan 1984-'Serie AWinner (7): 1987-88, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 1995-96, 1998-99, 2003-04Runner-up (3): 1989-90, 1990-91, 2004-05'Coppa Italia 'Winner (1): 2002-03Runner-up (2): 1989-90, 1997-98Supercoppa ItalianaWinner (5): 1987-88, 1991-92, 1992-93, 1993-94, 2003-04Runner-up (3): 1995-96, 1998-99, 2002-03UEFA Champions League formerly European CupWinner (5): 1988-89, 1989-90, 1993-94, 2002-03, 2006-07Runner-up (3): 1992-93, 1994-95, 2004-05UEFA Super CupWinner (5): 1989, 1990, 1994, 2003, 2007Runner-up (1): 1993Intercontinental CupWinner (2): 1989-90, 1990-91Runner-up (3): 1993-94, 1994-95, 2003-04FIFA Club World CupWinner (1): 2007-08 Italy 1988-2002 FIFA World CupRunner-up: 1994Third place: 1990Appearances: 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002UEFA European ChampionshipRunner-up: 2000Semi-final: 1988Appearances: 1988, 1996, 2000Olympic GamesFourth Place: 1988Appearances: 1988PersonalFIFA 100FIFA World Cup Team of the Tournament: 1994'''UEFA European Championship Team of the Tournament: 1996, 2000Serie A Defender of the Year: 2004UEFA Champions League Best Defender: 2007'''UEFA Champions League Final Man of the Match: 2003UEFA Team of the Year: 2003, 2005Under-21 European Footballer of the Year: 1989FIFPro World XI: 2005World Soccer World Player of the Year: 1994Named 21st in World Soccers' 100 Greatest Players of the 20th CenturyFIFA World Player of the Year (runner-up): 1995Ballon d'Or (third place): 1994, 2003Onze d'Or (third place): 1995'''Italian captain: 1994-2002Holds the record for most Italy caps: 126Career statisticsClubTeamSeasonSerie ACoppa ItaliaEuropeanCompetition1OtherTournaments2TotalAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsA.C.
