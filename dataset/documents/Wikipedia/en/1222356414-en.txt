| deathplace=Rome, Italy ?|   Pope Saint Mark or Marcus was Pope from January 18, 336 to October 7, 336.He is said to have been a Roman, but little is known of his early life. He was consecrated on January 18, 336, and died October 7 that same year.The Liber Pontificalis says that he was a Roman, and that his father's name was Priscus. Some evidence suggests that the early lists of bishops and martyrs known as the Depositio episcoporum and Depositio martyrum were begun during his pontificate. Mark also issued a constitution confirming the power of the bishop of Ostia to consecrate newly elected popes. Mark is credited with the foundation of the basilica of San Marco in Rome and the Juxta Pallacinis basilica just outside the city.Mark died of natural causes and was buried in the catacomb of Balbina, where he had built the cemetery church. His feast day is on October 7.References       Mark Mark Mark Mark Marcus Mark Marcus Markaf:Pous Markus bg:Марк (папа) ca:Marc I ceb:Papa Marcos cs:Marek (papež) da:Pave Markus 1. de:Marcus (Bischof von Rom) et:Marcus es:Marcos de Ostia eo:Marko (papo) fr:Marc (pape) gl:Marcos, papa ko:교황 마르코 hr:Marko, papa id:Paus Markus it:Papa Marco jv:Paus Markus ka:მარკოზი (პაპი) sw:Papa Marko la:Marcus (Papa) hu:Márk pápa mk:Папа Марк mr:पोप मार्क nl:Paus Marcus ja:マルクス (ローマ教皇) pl:Papież Marek pt:Papa Marcos ro:Papa Marcu ru:Марк (папа римский) fi:Pyhä Markus (paavi) sv:Markus (påve) tl:Marcos th:สมเด็จพระสันตะปาปามาร์คุส uk:Марк (папа) zh:瑪谷
