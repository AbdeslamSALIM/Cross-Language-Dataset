He was a Soviet champion, a two-time world title Candidate, and a prolific chess author. Kotov served in high posts in the Soviet Chess Federation and most of his books were written during the period of Cold War between the USA and the USSR. Therefore, his works tended to be rather critical of (and occasionally somewhat dismissive toward) American players. Russian players, on the other hand, were presented and described in a particularly favorable light. Nevertheless, his books were insightful and informative and were written in a congenial style. Therefore, they have long been popular among chess players of widely varying nationalities and playing strengths.Early lifeKotov was born in Tula in Russia to a large working class family. He moved to Moscow in 1939 to study engineering, and also studied chess a great deal.GrandmasterWhile best remembered today as an author, Kotov also had a number of good results as a player. One of his best early results was his second place finish in the 1939 USSR Championship, just missing out to Mikhail Botvinnik in the final round. This result won him the Soviet Grandmaster title, the third Soviet player to hold the title after Botvinnik and Grigory Levenfish. Kotov was Moscow champion in 1941. He won the Soviet title jointly with David Bronstein in 1948, and won at Venice in 1950, ahead of Vasily Smyslov.He was granted the title of International Grandmaster in 1951 by the World Chess Federation. At this time, Kotov also held high posts in the Soviet Chess Federation.In the first ever Candidates Tournament of 1950 (the tournament to determine who challenges the World Champion, who at the time was Botvinnik) held in Budapest, he scored 8.5/18. He had qualified for the event by finishing fourth in the 1948 Interzonal Tournament in Stockholm, scoring 11.5/19.Perhaps his best result came at the 1952 Saltsjobaden Interzonal, which he won with a score of 16.5/20, three clear points ahead of Tigran Petrosian and Mark Taimanov in second place, and without losing a game. In the following Candidates Tournament in Zürich, he scored 14/28, and was the only person to win a game against the tournament's winner, Smyslov.Kotov played for the USSR at the Chess Olympiads of 1952 and 1954, contributing to team gold medal victories. He was the second reserve board both times; at Helsinki 1952 he scored 2/3, while at Amsterdam 1954, he made 4/6. After 1960, all the tournaments he took part in were outside the USSR. They included a shared first place with Svetozar Gligorić at Hastings in 1962, half a point ahead of Smyslov. He played in very few tournaments in his later years.AuthorKotov was a great admirer of World Champion Alexander Alekhine, and wrote a comprehensive four-volume biographical series of books on his life and career, which were published between 1953 and 1958. The work significantly contributed to Alekhine's rehabilitation in the Soviet Union.His trilogy of books Think Like a Grandmaster, Play Like a Grandmaster, and Train Like a Grandmaster, are his best known, with Think Like a Grandmaster, which was translated from the Russian by Bernard Cafferty, and published by Batsford in 1971 being particularly famous. The book is not concerned with advising where pieces should be placed on the board, or tactical motifs, but rather with the method of thinking that should be employed during a game. Kotov's advice to identify candidate moves and methodically examine them to build up an "analysis tree" remains well known today.Kotov contributed to the Yugoslav series Encyclopedia of Chess Openings (ECO), which began in 1974, and to the associated games book series Chess Informator as an analyst.The importance and breadth of Kotov's work as a chess author ranks him among the all-time greats in this field.== Playing style ==Kotov developed a sharp style, was definitely not afraid of complications on the chessboard, and willingly entered into them against even the greatest of opponents. He favoured the Closed Openings with White, and was a terror with the Sicilian Defence as Black.Notable chess games, Alexander Kotov vs Alexander Tolush, Leningrad Championship 1938, Neo-Grunfeld Defence (D76), 1-0 Tolush was a dangerous attacker, but he is the one subdued here., Alexander Kotov vs Tigran Petrosian, USSR Championship, Moscow 1949, Queen's Gambit, Exchange Variation (D36), 1-0 Petrosian, later World Champion, loses a game he would never forget, falling into an opening trap and resigning in only 13 moves., Alexander Kotov vs Paul Keres, Budapest Candidates Tournament 1950, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Saemisch Variation (E24), 1-0 Kotov was near the peak of his form, and dealt Keres a costly loss., Yuri Averbakh vs Alexander Kotov, Zurich Candidates Tournament 1953, Old Indian Defence (A55), 0-1 Kotov's most famous game is one of the all-time greats of sacrificial chess, as Black gives up his Queen for long-term pressure which eventually leads to a mating finish.WritingsAlexander Alekhine by Alexander Kotov, four volumes, Moscow, 1953-1958.The Art of the Middle Game, by Paul Keres and Alexander Kotov (translated from the Russian by Harry Golombek), London, Dover 1962, ISBN 0486261549Think Like a Grandmaster, by Alexander Kotov (translated from the Russian by Bernard Cafferty), London, Batsford 1971,  ISBN 0713418079World Championship Interzonals: Leningrad -- Petropolis 1973, by R.G.
