He is best known for his use of sampling jazz and blues music to produce albums in the emerging "trip hop" genre in the late 1990s. Tobin has released seven major studio albums since 1996 under the London-based Ninja Tune record label where he is considered one of their more successful artists.In 2005, he created the musical score to Ubisoft's critically successful video game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. He is also noted for his entirely field-recorded album Foley Room, released in 2007. His music has been used in numerous television commercials, promotions, and major motion pictures including The Italian Job (2003) and 21. Tobin has created songs for several independent films, including the 2008 Hungarian horror film Taxidermia.Born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Amon Tobin began his career in Brighton, England with his debut album Adventures in Foam. In 2002, Tobin moved to Montreal, Canada where he currently lives in the Old Montreal industrial district. As of 2008 he continues to produce music and collaborate with other artists.BiographyEarly career (1995—97)Amon Tobin was born on February 7th, 1972 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where he spent most of his early childhood. His Irish surname Tobin comes from his stepfather. At the age of 9 he left Brazil to live in Morocco, Netherlands, London, Portugal and Madeira Island before settling as a teenager in Brighton, England. Brighton would remain his permanent residence until 2002. There he began producing songs in his bedroom with samplers and other electronic audio equipment, although he was "not really involved in the music scene" at that time. While taking an editorial photography class at a Brighton university, he answered a promotion in a magazine for the London-based Ninebar record label asking artists to send in demos of their songs. Ninebar signed Tobin to the label in 1996 after hearing his early work, and he traveled between his home in Brighton and the studios in London to produce his first tracks.[[Image:Cujo adventures in foam cover.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The US version of the cover art to Amon Tobin's first full-length album Adventures in Foam]]Under his original moniker Cujo, taken from the Stephen King novel of the same name, he released a series of drum and bass remixes on 12 inch vinyl which were well-received locally. AllMusic.com, in a review written after Tobin had obtained more critical success, called them "head-turning", and compared him to popular electronic musicians Luke Vibert and Squarepusher. Many of those tracks were later included on his first full-length album Adventures in Foam, released in 1996 by Ninebar. His work on that album prompted the larger Ninja Tune record label to sign Tobin in late 1996, this time under his real name "Amon Tobin". Ninja Tune was gaining populartity at the time with help from a number of their successful artists in the emerging "trip-hop" genre such as DJ Food, Coldcut and The Herbaliser. Later that year, Ninja Tune says that Adventures in Foam had been re-released without permission by the American record label Shadow. They say that this unauthorized version of the album had only 7 of the original songs, different cover art, and that several of the tracks were titled incorrectly. Tobin then re-released the album under Ninja Tune in 1997 with permission from Ninebar. This new version included the original album in its entirety, and a second disc containing both tracks published under Ninebar and previously unreleased material. Only 5,000 copies of Adventures in Foam were originally produced, but over the course of its production the album has been reviewed favorably. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break-beat style "got totally out of hand", but that it "never fails to let the listener know who's in charge." Ninja Tune released the album for a second time in 2002.Defining albums (1997—2002)Over the next several years, Amon Tobin released two albums that were well-received, but that went largely unnoticed by the larger electronic music scene. Bricolage, released in 1997, was the cummulation of two projects Tobin had started after his debut album earlier that year. His third album Permutation was released in 1998. In the late 1990s, sample-based music was becoming more popular with a wide range of emerging and developing genres such as "trip-hop" and "drum and bass," but Tobin himself was still largely unknown. The "instrumental hip-hop movement," as he described it, helped Permutation gain some media attention. Despite this, the two albums went largely ignored and under-promoted by Ninja Tune because of their more popular artists. Tobin's style of music was not seen as definitively belong to one genre or another. The critics that commented on Bricolage and Permutation gave them positive reviews and they are often mentioned, by later reviewers and interviewers, as some of his best works. Pitchfork Media acclaimed the use of jazz instrument samples, comparing him to famous composers Quincy Jones and Miles Davis. In a 1999 review, they wrote of Bricolage that it was "one of the most inventive records of the decade."Tobin released his fourth album Supermodified in 2000 into the now established "trip-hop" genre made popular by himself and other artists at Mo'Wax and Ninja Tune. John Bush of Allmusic said that he had "made great strides in his production skills."  SplendidZine.com said that they were "impressed with the diffrerent musical directions it took," but wished Tobin had "pushed the genere even farther" than his previous albums.Montreal (2002—Present)In 2002, Amon Tobin relocated to Montreal, Canada where he had spent time previously at Ninja Tune's North American Headquarters. His current residence as of 2008, Tobin lives in the industrial area of Old Montreal to avoid noise complaints from neighbors after dark. There he produced his fifth album Out from Out Where which was released that same year. This was his first album created primarily in a professional studio and not in his bedroom. Otis Hart of Dusted Magazine said that while the album might have fallen short of "heightened expectations," Tobin's style of producing had come into its own. He acclaimed Tobin's "refined sense of tempo" compared to his previous albums.&lt;/ref&gt; His use of original guitar notes as samples on ''Out From Out Where'' marked Tobin's first step toward creating samples first-hand, instead of relying entirely on those taken from his record collection.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:AmonTobinSplinterCell.jpg |150px|thumb|right|The cover art of Amon Tobin's Chaos Theory - Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack]]In January 2004, not having produced a major work in two years, Tobin was contracted by video game company Ubisoft to compose the score for the third installment of their critically successful Splinter Cell series, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory. To facilitate the music's use in a video game, where the level of action or plot can change continually, each track was broken down by Tobin into 4 distinct but similar parts based on their level of intensity. The game's developers could then use each section to provide music based on the actions of the player. The album continued the trend Tobin started with Out From Out Where, as he used more original samples of traditional instruments during production. Musical elements from the countries that the game takes place in were also used to provide a theme from some tracks, like his use of Japanese flutes for the sections that occur in Japan. In addition to being included with the game, Ninja Tune released the score as an individual album in 2005, titled Chaos Theory - Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack, several months before the game's release. It was received well, benefiting from a wider audience of reviwers in both the music and gaming industries. Ben Hogwood of MusicOMH.com applauded Tobin's use of melody and texture, adding that he controlled the sounds with the "clarity of a classical orchestrator." In Los Angeles, he later recorded a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound version of the album with audio engineer Bobby Azinsky in a dedicated Solid State Logic studio.The attention that he received from Chaos Theory helped the success of Tobin's sixth studio album Foley Room, released in 2007. The title references the "foley" rooms used by recording engineers and "foley artists" to record sound effects in the movie industry. On this album, Tobin concluded his transition away from pre-recorded source material that started with Out From Out Where. All of the samples used for production were recorded by himself using an omnidirectional microphone. He reportedly recorded 500 megabytes of digital samples in Montreal, San Francisco, and Seattle from a wide range of sources including motorbikes, tigers, insects, and water falling from a tap.. Also contributing to the album were the string quartet Kronos Quartet, drummer Stefan Schneider, and harpist Sarah Page. Foley Room's use of field-recordings was used to help promote the album, including two official pre-release trailers posted to YouTube. Nate Dorr of PopMatters.com called it a "smooth, natural progression" from his work on Supermodified. The first single Bloodstone was released to the iTunes Music Store months before the rest of the album. Ninja Tune also published a DVD titled Foley Room: Found Footage which documented the recording proccess.Musical style and influencesAmon Tobin is best known for his use of sampling, where a small section of a previous recording is digitaly copied, or sampled, and then looped or manipulated to produce a new sound. His use of this teqnique has changed over the course of his career. On his original singles under Ninebar, and on his first three albums, Tobin aquired almost all of the samples to produce music from his personal collection of vinyl records. He manipulates the sounds with a combination of audio hardware and software, and the original source is often not recognizable in its new context. The majority of his music at this time focused on reordering the break beats from jazz and blues music into faster more complex patterns. Guido Farnell of InTheMix.com, writing about his use of the technique, said that he has "taken the art to new and dizzying heights." His fifth album Out From Out Where, began his gradual shift away from pre-recorded material by incorporating original guitar samples. His techniques began branching into technical sound design, taking break beats or single instruments, modifying specific frequencies, and producing sounds that are "very different" from the original. This trend continued through his video game score Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory Soundtrack, and by his sixth album Foley Room all of the source material was recorded in the field by himself. Speaking about the creativity of sample-based music compared to traditional instruments, he says that "creative input is how you edit and manipulate the sounds."Amon Tobin experimented with various instruments growing up such as the guitar and harmonica, however he neither comes from a music family, nor has any formal training in music theory. After receiving a sampler he started to produce drum and bass music in his bedroom Tobin later described in an interview with SolipsisticNation.com that drum and bass "made more sense to what I was into," comparing it to more traditional genres of music. He says that although he enjoys elements of Bossa Nova and Samba, genres that Brazilian performers are often compared to, he didn't feel at the time that he could contribute to them in a traditional way because, in his words, "I wasn't from that time and I wasn't from that culture." About his music in general, Tobins says that he sees it as a "genuine" expression of the time he lives in, just as he says blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were "genuine" expressions of the 1960s. Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo. Tobin's albums are often compared to movie soundtracks, and he says that movies by directors David Lynch and Roman Polanski also influence his music.Live performances]]Amon Tobin has toured in countries all over the world. His shows generally contain tracks that he has produced over his career mixed with modified songs from several other genres. The soft-spoken artist says that during his live performances, he wants to take the emphasis away from him and the stage and put it on the music He usually makes us of a Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound speaker system which, in his words, "make a different sonic environment for people to visit." Before the advent of advanced live production software, Tobin would create dubplates, or custom vinyl records, before each show with material to play. Now he says that a laptop and products like Final Scratch replace a lot of his preparation work. Speaking about his surprise at the number of people who attended his performances during the Foley Room tour, he said that "you don't really know how many people are into what you do," because of the popularity of internet file sharing.Tobin's 2003 live performance in Melbourne, Australia was used for the fourth album in Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series because Tobin was not available to record a studio mix at the time. Many of the tracks that he says he wanted to be included could not because of the copyright issues with the original artists, including Destiny's Child.DiscographyAmon Tobin has released seven major studio albums:1996: Adventures in Foam1997: Bricolage1998: Permutation2000: Supermodified2002: Out from Out Where2005: Chaos Theory - Splinter Cell 3 Soundtrack2007: Foley RoomIn addition, his body of work includes 21 extended play (EP) albums which contain several B-sides each, a live album for Ninja Tune's Solid Steel series, new material for various compilation albums, and original tracks available as free downloads on his website.Amon Tobin's music has been used in several major motion pictures and commercials including The Italian Job (2003) and 21.
