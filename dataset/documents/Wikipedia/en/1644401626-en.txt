It was first released in May 1999. By late 2001 the functions of the program had been integrated into the Real's core media player program, RealPlayer.CriticismPast versions of RealPlayer have been criticized for containing features similar to adware and spyware. In 2006 PC World Magazine named RealPlayer (1999 Version) as #2 in its list of the 25 worst products of all time, writing that RealPlayer "had a disturbing way of making itself a little too much at home on your PC--installing itself as the default media player, taking liberties with your Windows Registry, popping up annoying 'messages' that were really just advertisements, and so on." In 2007, it placed RealPlayer, versions 1996-2004, at #5 in its list of the 20 most annoying tech products.In 2008 StopBadware.org called RealPlayer "badware" due to failure to completely disclose software components it installs as well as those it leaves behind after being un-installed.StopBadware.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Jeff Chasen, vice president for RealPlayer, responded by stating: "I actually admire what stopbadware is trying to do to keep consumers safe. But in this case the only thing bad is the report itself. Here’s why: Not a single claim raised by stopbadware actually hurts anyone." Real’s Response to stopbadware.orgThe Message Center of RealPlayer has caused controversy due to its feature of pop-up advertisements. In previous versions of the program the Message Center had a reputation for being difficult to turn off completely, while in RealPlayer 11 it will not appear unless it is turned on by the user. Real’s Response to stopbadware.orgIn 1999 security researcher Richard M. Smith dissected some of RealJukebox's network traffic and discovered that it was sending a unique identifier with information about the music titles to which its users were listening. RealNetworks acknowledged this, and the feature was removed in version 1.02. Their download page stated RealJukebox included privacy enhancements and gave a link to the privacy policy. When RealPlayer is installed, a process called tkbell.exe will run automatically each time the computer starts up, and may appear on the list of active processes as realsched.exe. The process is linked to the Message Center and can also check for updates to the program. The process is non-essential and is not considered to be harmful, but has been seen as a nuisance by some users. [http://www.auditmypc.com/process/tkbell.asp What is tkbell.exe?] It can be disabled by altering the settings of RealPlayer's Message Center. Help2Go - Disable RealPlayer realsched.exeEarlier versions of RealPlayer have experienced an issue with the volume control, where muting the sound in the program would also mute Windows system sounds. Adjusting RealPlayer volume affects Comp volume settings This issue appears to have been resolved in RealPlayer 11.See alsoList of video players (software)Comparison of media playersRealAudioRealVideoRealMediaReal AlternativeiQfx for RealPlayerNotesExternal linksOfficial websiteReal Guide - RealNetworks Product ListRealPlayer Enterprise Download&quot;How to get spyware-free RealPlayer through the BBC&quot; - Boing BoingHow to install realPlayer on UbuntuAnnabelle the Sheep - RealPlayer's visualization reacts to musicCategory:Freeware Category:Linux media players Category:Mac OS media players Category:Mac OS X media players Category:Palm OS software Category:Windows media players Category:Malwarear:ريل بلاير cs:RealPlayer de:RealPlayer es:RealPlayer fr:RealPlayer ko:리얼플레이어 it:RealPlayer hu:RealPlayer nl:RealPlayer ja:RealPlayer pl:RealPlayer pt:RealPlayer ru:RealPlayer fi:RealPlayer sv:Real Player vi:RealPlayer tr:RealPlayer zh:RealPlayer
