           Miruts Yifter (born January 1, 1938 or May 15, 1944) is a former Ethiopian athlete, winner of two gold medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics. His name is also sometimes spelled as Muruse Yefter.Born in Adigrat, in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia, Miruts Yifter spent early parts of his youth working in different factories and as a carriage driver. His talent as a long-distance runner was noticed when he joined the Ethiopian Air Force.Yefter was called to the Ethiopian national team for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, but he made his Olympic debut four years later in Munich Olympics where he won a bronze medal in 10,000 m. However, he arrived too late for the 5000 m final.In the 1973 All-Africa Games he won one gold medal (10000 m) and one silver (5000 m). At the 1st African Championships in 1979 he won two gold medals (5000 and 10000 metres).He was unable to participate in the 1976 Summer Olympics because his nation boycotted the event. Four years later in Moscow, Yifter made up for his disappointments. In the final of the 10,000 m he sprinted into the lead 300 m from the finish and won by ten meters. Five days later, in the 5000 m final, Yifter was boxed in during the last lap. But with 300 m to go, his Ethiopian teammate, Mohamed Kedir, stepped aside and Yifter again sprinted to victory. Due to his abrupt change in speed when executing his kick to the finish, Yifter is commonly referred to as "Yifter the Shifter."At the Moscow Olympics, part of the mystery surrounding Miruts Yifter was the question of his age, which was reported to be between 33 and 42. Yifter refused to give a definitive answer, telling reporters:Men may steal my chickens; men may steal my sheep. But no man can steal my age.The most common versions about his date of birth are January 1, 1938 or May 15, 1944.External links     Juan Rafael Perez|title=Men's Half Marathon Best Year Performance|years=1977|after= Anthony Simmons  Suleiman Nyambui|title=Men's 5.000m Best Year Performance|years=1980|after= Henry Rono     Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Ethiopian athletes Category:Long-distance runners Category:Athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Ethiopia Category:Olympic gold medalists for Ethiopia Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Ethiopia Category:Former world record holders Category:Ethiopian Air Force personnelde:Miruts Yifter es:Miruts Yifter fr:Miruts Yifter gl:Miruts Yifter it:Miruts Yifter lv:Mirucs Jifters nl:Miruts Yifter ja:ミルツ・イフター no:Miruts Yifter pl:Miruts Yifter sl:Muruse Yefter fi:Miruts Yifter
