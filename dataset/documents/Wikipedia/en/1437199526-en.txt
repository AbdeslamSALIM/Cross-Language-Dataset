He currently plays for Genoa CFC, co-owned by Juventus.BiographyClub careerThe first team career of Palladino started in his native region of Campania where he played for Benevento in Serie C1. Including games played in Coppa Italia Serie C, his record at Benevento was 12 games played and 5 goals scored.It was not long before he gained the attentions of Juventus and was signed by the club in 2002, during his earlier years with Juventus he played in reserve and youth levels in competitions such as Torneo di Viareggio (which the club won in 2003 and 2004). However, during the 2003-04 season, he did make one appearance in the Coppa Italia. He scored 41 goals in 61 games in the Campionato Nazionale Primavera.Loan spellsTo gain some first team experience, Palladino was loaned out to Salernitana back in CampaniakgjThe first taste of Serie A football came in 2005-06 for the player, he was loaned out once more, this time to Livorno. Although he gained some valuable experience he did not score as many goals as he did during his spell with Salernitana the previous season.Return to JuventusJuventus had been relegated down to Serie B due to the result of the 2006 Serie A scandal. Despite the lower division, first team places were still hotly contested and the young Palladino was given a chance to prove himself in the first team by Didier Deschamps. On his league debut Palladino scored two goals, in the same season he also scored a hat-trick against Triestina. Juventus won promotion back into Serie A that season giving Palladino his first senior team honour. Arsenal have since been reported in signing him, with a swap looking likely for Gilberto Silva.Although he is mainly a striker, with the presence of Alessandro Del Piero, Vincenzo Iaquinta, and especially David Trezeguet he has had a hard time finding a spot as a striker. He mainly has been playing as a left winger during the 2007-2008 season, although he is predominately right footed.It has been noted in the press recently that Rangers manager Walter Smith is keen on bringing Palladino to Ibrox in a £5 miliion deal.On 13 June 2008 Raffaele Palladino seemed about to move to the ligurian club Genoa, but finally he has refused to sign. Behind his refusal there could be the interest of a better team . However on the 3rd of July 2008, it was revealed that he had moved to Genoa along with Domenico Criscito. http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/jul3e.htmlInternationalHe has represented his country at Under-21 level. Palladino received his first call-up to the senior team on November 17, 2007 versus Scotland under the direction of Roberto Donadoni, but did not play in the game. His debut came just a few days later, against the Faroe Islands, where he impressed as Italy went on to an easy 3–1 victory.HonoursClub2003 Torneo di Viareggio (Juventus)2004 Torneo di Viareggio (Juventus)2006-07 Serie B (Juventus)International2003 Under-19 European ChampionshipExternal linksJuventus.com Profile Category:Italian footballers Category:Benevento Calcio players Category:Salernitana Calcio 1919 players Category:A.S.
