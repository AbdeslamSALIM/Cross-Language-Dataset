 Record_year   = 2004The Bahrain International Circuit (Arabic: حلبة البحرين الدولية) is a venue used for drag racing, GP2, and an annual Formula One Grand Prix. For the first time in 2006, there was a V8 Supercar race, named the Desert 400, and also a 24 Hour Race.The construction of the Bahrain circuit was a national objective for Bahrain, initiated by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation.Race organizers were worried that the circuit would not be complete in time for the 2004 Grand Prix and attempted to cancel the event, however Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone refused this request. In the end, the circuit was not quite fully complete, but was good enough for the grand prix to go ahead.The circuit posed a unique problem. Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However, organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive on the sand around the track.The circuit was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, the same architect who designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The circuit cost approximately US $150 million to construct. It has six separate tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.In 2007 the circuit became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award, given for excellent safety, race marshal, and medical facilities; and for the high standards of technology required to maintain these.FacilitiesTrack Distance Grand Prix trackkm]]Inner track2.55 kmOuter track3.664 kmPaddock Circuit3.7 kmDrag Strip1.2 kmOval track2 kmFull Circuit6.4 kmSeries HostedThe Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of high profile series, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the Australian V8 Supercar Championship Series, the GP2 Series, GP2 Asia, Chevrolet Lumina Series, Speedcar Series, Thunder Arabia and Radical.In the past the circuit has hosted the FIA GT Championship, and a one-off Bahrain Formula 3 Superprix.
