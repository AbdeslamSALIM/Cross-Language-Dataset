Rogers turned professional in 1999 with the Italian super-team Mapei, which, following sponsorship changes, became Quick Step-Davitamon and then Quick Step-Innergetic. In 2005 Rogers joined the T-Mobile Team and was appointed as its leader for the 2007 Tour de France. He is often called Mick Rogers or Dodger.Like many other Australian professional cyclists of his generation, he was a product of the Australian Institute of Sport program for young cyclists which allowed him to live and race in Europe as an amateur. He started out as a track racer under the tutelage of coach Charlie Walsh and later switched to road cycling.Rogers is a recognised Individual time trialler and has won the World Cycling Championship ITT three times, in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Originally second in the 2003 ITT Championship, Rogers assumed the title of World Champion after the original winner, David Millar, was disqualified for doping. Following the lengthy investigation into Millar, Rogers was awarded rainbow jersey and gold medal for his 2003 win on the day of the 2004 World Cycling Championship. Therefore, he received two gold medals on the day that he became World Champion in 2004.Rogers is an improving mountain climber in the Grand Tours, and is considered to be a promising contender for stage races. In the 2003 Tour de France, Rogers was one of strongest riders in his team's quest to help Frenchman Richard Virenque win his sixth Polka dot jersey in the King of the Mountains competition. He was the last rider left to assist Virenque in his day-long escape and eventual stage win.On 15 July, Rogers withdrew on the 8th Stage of the 2007 Tour de France due to a broken collar bone he received in a crash while descending Cormet de Roselend in the leading group and as the Tour de France virtual leader. He continued briefly until the doctors car arrived, as it had been dealing with fellow Australian Stuart O'Grady who ended up stretchered to hospital.In 2008, Rogers missed the start of the season because of a mononucleosis. He made his debut in competition in the Dauphiné Libéré, where he made 11th position. He decided to skip the Tour de France and finished a surprising sixth in the road race at the Olympic Games.Rogers now lives in Varese, Italy and has no further plans to move.Major achievements1997Silver Medal, World U19 Time Trial Championship1998Gold Medal, 1998 Commonwealth Games 20 km Scratch Race2002GP Cycliste de BeauceSilver Medal, 2002 Commonwealth Games Individual time trialWinner, Tour Down Under2003Winner, Deutschland TourWinner, Route du SudTour de BelgiqueDeutschland-Tour stage 6Route du Sud stage 3Gold Medal,  UCI Road World Championships Time Trial2004Gold Medal,  UCI Road World Championships Time Trial4th, 2004 Summer Olympics Men's Individual Time Trial20052nd overall, 2005 Tour de SuisseGold Medal,  UCI Road World Championships Time Trial20069th overall, 2006 Tour de FranceRegio-Tour International stage 320072nd overall, 2007 Volta a Catalunya20086th, Olympic Road Race11th, Dauphiné Libéré  External linksOfficial website of Mick RogersMick Rogers' C-40 tale Category:Australian cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Australia Category:World cycling champions Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Australia Category:Cyclists at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Category:Cyclists at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:People from the Australian Capital Territoryca:Michael Rogers da:Michael Rogers de:Michael Rogers es:Michael Rogers fr:Michael Rogers it:Michael Rogers nl:Michael Rogers ja:マイケル・ロジャース (自転車競技選手) no:Michael Rogers pl:Michael Rogers pt:Michael Rogers fi:Michael Rogers sv:Michael Rogers
