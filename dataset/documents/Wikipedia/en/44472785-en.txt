In mathematics, an element x'' of a ring ''R is called nilpotent if there exists some positive integer n'' such that ''xn = 0.ExamplesThis definition can be applied in particular to square matrices. The matrix A = \begin0&1&0\\ 0&0&1\\ 0&0&0\end is nilpotent because A3 = 0. See nilpotent matrix for more.In the factor ring Z'/9'Z, the equivalence class of 3 is nilpotent because 32 is congruent to 0 modulo 9.Assume that two elements a'',''b in a (non-commutative) ring R'' satisfy ''ab=0. Then the element c=ba is nilpotent (if non-zero) as c2=(ba)2=b(ab)a=0. An example with matrices (for a,b):A_1 = \begin0&1\\ 0&1 \end, \;\; A_2 =\begin 0&1\\ 0&0 \end \ . Here  A_1A_2=0,\; A_2A_1=A_2 .The ring of coquaternions contains a cone of nilpotents.PropertiesNo nilpotent element can be a unit (except in the trivial ring  which has only a single element 0 = 1). All non-zero nilpotent elements are zero divisors.An n''-by-''n matrix A with entries from a field is nilpotent if and only if its characteristic polynomial is  t^n .The nilpotent elements from a commutative ring form an ideal; this is a consequence of the binomial theorem. This ideal is the nilradical of the ring. Every nilpotent element in a commutative ring is contained in every prime ideal of that ring, and in fact the intersection of all these prime ideals is equal to the nilradical.If x'' is nilpotent, then 1 &minus; ''x is a unit, because x''''n = 0 entails(1 &minus; x'') (1 + ''x + x''2 + ... + ''xn''&minus;1) = 1 &minus; ''xn = 1.Nilpotency in physicsAn operator Q that satisfies Q^2=0 is nilpotent. Grassmann numbers which allow a path integral representation for Fermionic fields are nilpotents since their squares vanish. The BRST charge is an important example in physics. As linear operators form an associative algebra and thus a ring, this is a special case of the initial definition. More generally, in view of the above definitions, an operator Q'' is nilpotent if there is ''n&isin;N such that Q''''n=o (the zero function). Thus, a linear map is nilpotent iff it has a nilpotent matrix in some basis. Another example for this is the exterior derivative (again with n=2). Both are linked, also through supersymmetry and Morse theory, as shown by Edward Witten in a celebrated article.The electromagnetic field of a plane wave without sources is nilpotent when it is expressed in terms of the algebra of physical space.Algebraic nilpotentsThe following are examples of algebras and numbers that contain nilpotents:Split-quaternion / coquaternionSplit-octonionConic sedenions from Musean hypernumbersReferencesE Witten, Supersymmetry and Morse theory.
