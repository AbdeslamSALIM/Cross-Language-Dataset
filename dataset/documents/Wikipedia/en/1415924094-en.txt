He usually plays on the right side, and is an attacking full-back.CareerThe Romanian international started his footballing career at Politehnica Timişoara where he played for three seasons before moving to arch-rivals Dinamo Bucharest. After four season with the capital-based team, he was transferred for 800.000 dollars to Deportivo Alavés, where he was a vital player in the UEFA Cup campaign which saw Alavés come second in the competition. His performances in that season earned him a place in the 2001 UEFA Team of the Year. Contra then managed yet another excellent move, as Italian giants AC Milan bought him from the Spanish team, but his spell in Italy lasted only one season. In September 2002 he changed clubs once more and went to Atlético Madrid, playing with the colchoneros two seasons.Contra moved to West Bromwich Albion on loan in August 2004, making his debut in a 2&ndash;1 League Cup defeat to Colchester United on 21 September 2004. His Premiership debut for Albion came almost two months later when Albion lost 2&ndash;1 at home to Middlesbrough. The loan was not particularly successful, with Contra playing just six times and receiving a red card in the last game of his spell in a 5&ndash;0 home defeat to Liverpool. He then returned to the Romanian first Division, at the club which brought him up as a player, Politehnica Timisoara. He managed to be recalled at the national side due to his good performances at Poli and the next season saw him move, on loan once more, at his current club, Getafe, where he managed to keep hold of a place in the first eleven.Contra is known to be a rash player, his conflict with Juventus player Edgar Davids while he was in Italy being one of the reasons for his quick departure from Milan. Since September, 2006, he is a naturalized spanish citizen.It is rumored that the Timişoara born player will return to his home city after the 2007/2008 season to join his ex-team Politehnica. Club owner Marian Iancu has made a statement in this regard in early March.Contra has played for the Romanian national team over 50 times. He played for his country in Euro 2000 and Euro 2008.ReferencesExternal links      Cristian Chivu| title=Romanian Footballer of the Year| years=2001| after= Cristian Chivu  Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Timişoara Category:Romanian footballers Category:Romanian-Spaniards Category:Romania international footballers Category:La Liga footballers Category:Deportivo Alavés footballers Category:Atlético de Madrid footballers Category:Getafe CF footballers Category:A.C.
