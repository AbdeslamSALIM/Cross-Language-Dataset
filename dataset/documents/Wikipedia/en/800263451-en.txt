 Beaujeu (Bôjor / Biôjœr in Arpitan) is a small town between Mâcon and Lyon. It lies in the French département of Rhône, in the east-central Rhône-Alpes (Rôno-Arpes) région of the country.Beaujeu gives its name to the famous wine region of Beaujolais (Biôjolês), a former province of France of which it is the historical capital. However it was overtaken in the 14th century by Villefranche-sur-Saône, which remains the main commercial centre of the region.HistoryBeaujolais was a semi-autonomous fiefdom of the Lords of Beaujeu. The barony was acquired in the 9th century by Guillaume, Comte du Lyonnais and Count of Forez; on his death, his son Bérard became the first Lord of Beaujeu.List of rulersLords:Berard of Beaujeu + c. 966Guichard I of Beaujeu c. 966-977Humbert I of Beaujeu + c. 977-1016Guichard II of Beaujeu c. 1016-1050Guichard III of Beaujeu c. 1050-1070Humbert II of Beaujeu c. 1070-1102Guichard IV of Beaujeu 1102-1137Humbert III of Beaujeu 1137-1174Humbert IV of Beaujeu 1174-1202Guichard V le Grand of Beaujeu 1202-1216Humbert V of Beaujeu 1216-1250Isabelle de Beaujeu 1250-1297 (married Renaud)Renaud I of Forez, count of Forez 1250-1297Louis de Beaujeu 1250-1295Guichard VI of Beaujeu 1295-1331Edouard I of Beaujeu 1331-1351 (Marshal of France)Antoine of Beaujeu 1351-1374Edouard II of Beaujeu 1374-1400 (+1400 without succession)After the death of Edouard II, the barony passed to his uncle Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and was used as a title first by members of the Bourbon family and then by the House of Orléans.
