It belongs to the Dodecanese, an island group of twelve major islands in the southeastern Aegean Sea. The Island is 18 Km. long, 13 Km. wide at the most, and covers an area of 99 Km. Along with numerous smaller uninhabited offshore islets (the largest of which are Sýrna and Ofidoussa), it forms the Municipality of Astypalaia. The coasts of Astypalea are rocky with many small pebble-strewn beaches. A small band of land of roughly 10 kilometres, almost separates the island in two sections. The capital and main harbour of the island is Astypalea or Hora, as it is called by the locals. Astypalea has ferry connections with Piraeus and the other islands of the Dodecanese and flight connections with Athens.
