Aloe dichotoma, also known as Quiver tree or Kokerboom, is a species of aloe indigenous to South Africa, specifically in the Northern Cape region, and Namibia. A good example of a quiver tree forest is to be seen on the road from Nieuwoudtville to Loeriesfontein. Modeling of Aloe dichotoma in South Africa and Namibia has contributed to understanding of protected area needs in response to climate change. Known as Choje to the indigenous San people, the Quiver tree gets its name from the San practice of hollowing out the tubular branches of Aloe dichotoma to form quivers for their arrows. Modelled range declines in this species due to climate change have recently been confirmed by field surveys (Wendy Foden et al, 2007).Aloe dichotoma is cultivated in the southwestern United States for use in landscaping. The slow growth rate and relative rarity of the plant make it a particularly expensive specimen.External linksDesert-tropicals.com profilePlantzafrica.com profileGallery Image:Aloe dichotoma.jpg|Quiver trees in a greenhouse Image:SAC Namibia-bushveld.jpg|A Quiver tree forest in southern Namibia Image:Köcherbaum Köcherbaumwald 01.JPG|Quiver tree in southern Namibia See alsoAloe bainesiiCategory:Aloeaf:Kokerboom de:Köcherbaum es:Aloe dichotoma eo:Saguja arbo fr:Aloe dichotoma hsb:Płonowy alowej it:Aloe dichotoma nl:Kokerboom pl:Kokerboom uk:Сагайдачне дерево
