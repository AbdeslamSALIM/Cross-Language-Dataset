The event was first run in 1934, and it is often called the sprinters' classic due to its flat finishing terrain.Gent-WevelgemIts early-season date means riders are often tested by wind and rain, while the route also takes them twice over the difficult cobbled climb of the Kemmelberg where key splits often emerge.
