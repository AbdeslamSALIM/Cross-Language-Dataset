  The languages of the Caucasus are a large and extremely varied array of languages spoken by more than ten million people in and around the Caucasus Mountains, which lie between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.Linguistic comparison allows these languages to be classified into several language families, with little or no discernible affinity to each other.Families indigenous to the CaucasusThree of these families have no current members outside the Caucasus, and are considered indigenous to the area. The term Caucasian languages is generally restricted to these families.South Caucasian, also called the Kartvelian family. Includes Georgian, the official language of Georgia, with four million speakers.Northwest Caucasian, also called the Abkhaz-Adyghe, Circassian, or Pontic family. Includes the Kabardian language, with one million speakers.Northeast Caucasian, also called the Dagestanian, Nakho-Dagestanian, or Caspian family. Includes the Chechen language, with one million speakers.It is commonly believed that all Caucasian languages have a large number of consonants. While this is certainly true for most members of the Northwest and Northeast Caucasian families (inventories range up to the 80-84 consonants of Ubykh), the consonant inventories of the South Caucasian languages are not nearly as extensive, ranging from 28 (Georgian) to 30 (Laz) — comparable to languages like Arabic (28 consonants) and Russian (35-37 consonants).The autochthonous languages of the Caucasus share some areal features, such as the presence of ejective consonants and a highly agglutinative structure, and, with the sole exception of Mingrelian, all of them exhibit a greater or lesser degree of ergativity. Many of these features are shared with other languages that have been in the Caucasus for a long time, such as Ossetian.External relationsSince the birth of comparative linguistics in the 19th century, the riddle of the apparently isolated Caucasian language families has attracted the attention of many scholars, who have endeavored to relate them to each other or to languages outside the Caucasus region. The most promising proposals are connections between the Northwest and Northeast Caucasian families and each other or with languages formerly spoken in Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia.North Caucasian languages Linguists such as Sergei Starostin see the Northwest (Abkhaz-Adyghe) and Northeast (Nahk-Dagestanian) families as related and propose uniting them in a single North Caucasian family, sometimes called Caucasic or simply Caucasian. This theory excludes the South Caucasian languages, thereby proposing two indigenous language families. While these two families share many similarities, their morphological structure, with many morphemes consisting of a single consonant, make comparison between them unusually difficult, and it has not been possible to establish a genetic relationship with any certainty.Ibero-Caucasian languages There are no known affinities between the South Caucasian and North Caucasian families. Nevertheless, some scholars have proposed the single name Ibero-Caucasian for all the Caucasian language families, North and South, in an attempt to unify the Caucasian languages under one family.HatticSome linguists have claimed affinities between the Northwest Caucasian (Circassian) family and the extinct Hattic language of central Anatolia. See the article on Northwest Caucasian languages for details.AlarodianAlarodian is a proposed connection between Northeast Caucasian and the extinct Hurro-Urartian languages of Armenia.Dené-Caucasian macrofamily Linguists such as Sergei Starostin have proposed a Dené-Caucasian macrofamily, which includes the North Caucasian languages together with Basque, Burushaski, Na-Dené, Sino-Tibetan, and Yeniseian. Most linguists consider this proposal to be beyond the range of historical linguistics.Families with wider distributionOther languages historically and presently spoken in the Caucasus area can be placed into families with a much wider geographical distribution.Indo-EuropeanThe predominant Indo-European language in the Caucasus is Armenian, spoken by the Armenians (circa 4 million speakers). The Ossetians, speaking the Ossetic language, form another group of around 700,000 speakers. Other Indo-European languages spoken in the Caucasus include Persian, Greek, Pontic, Kurdish, Talysh, Judeo-Tat, and of the Slavic languages, Russian and Ukrainian, whose speakers number over a third of the total population of the Caucasus.AltaicMost of the Altaic languages spoken in the Caucasus are Turkic: of these, Azerbaijani is predominant, with around 6 million speakers in Azerbaijan. Other Turkic languages spoken include Balkar, Karachay, Kumyk, Nogai. Kalmyk, spoken by the Oirat descendant Kalmyks in the region is a Mongolic language.SemiticThe only Semitic language spoken in the Caucasus is Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, spoken by around 25,000 speakers, largely living in cities, who fled to Russia from Turkish persecution at the close of the First World War.ReferencesEncyclopedia Britannica, 15th edition (1986): Macropedia, "Languages of the World", see section titled "Caucasian languages".NotesExternal linksTITUS: Caucasian languages map by Jost Gippert& projects Armazi& EclingCIA ethnolinguistic mapLinguistic families map by Matthew DryerEthnolinguistic map of Tajikistan by Iraj BashiriCaucausian section of the Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian EmpireThe Iberian-Caucasian Connection in a Typological Perspective — An in-depth linguistic study of Basque, Georgian, and other ergative languages, concluding that the similarities are not strong enough to prove a genetic link.The A.
