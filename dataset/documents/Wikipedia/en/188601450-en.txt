In mathematics, Bessel functions, first defined by the mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and generalized by Friedrich Bessel, are canonical solutions y''(''x) of Bessel's differential equation:x^2 \frac + x \frac + (x^2 - \alpha^2)y = 0for an arbitrary real or complex number α (the order of the Bessel function). The most common and important special case is where α is an integer n.Although α and &minus;α produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two orders (e.g., so that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of α). Bessel functions are also known as cylinder functions or cylindrical harmonics because they are found in the solution to Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates.ApplicationsBessel's equation arises when finding separable solutions to Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of wave propagation, static potentials, and so on. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order (α = n''); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders (α = ''n&nbsp;+&nbsp;½). For example:electromagnetic waves in a cylindrical waveguideheat conduction in a cylindrical object.modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) artificial membrane (such as a drum or other membranophone).diffusion problems on a lattice.Bessel functions also have useful properties for other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see FM synthesis, Kaiser window, or Bessel filter).DefinitionsSince this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two linearly independent solutions. Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient, and the different variations are described below.Bessel functions of the first kind : ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as J_\alpha(x), are solutions of Bessel's differential equation that are finite at the origin (x = 0) for non-negative integer \alpha, and diverge as x approaches zero for negative non-integer \alpha. The solution type (e.g. integer or non-integer) and normalization of J_\alpha(x) are defined by its properties below. For integer order solutions, it is possible to define the function by its Taylor series expansion around x = 0: J_\alpha(x) = \sum_^\infty \frac \right)^ where \Gamma(z) is the gamma function, a generalization of the factorial function to non-integer values. For non-integer α, a more general power series expansion is required. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/√''x'' (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large x. (The Taylor series indicates that -J_1(x) is the derivative of J_0(x), much like -\sin(x) is the derivative of \cos(x); more generally, the derivative of J_n(x) can be expressed in terms of J_(x) by the identities below.)For non-integer α, the functions J_\alpha (x) and J_ (x) are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order \alpha, the following relationship is valid:J_(x) = (-1)^n J_(x).\,This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below.Bessel's integralsAnother definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of  n , is possible using an integral representation:J_n(x) = \frac \int_^ \cos (n \tau - x \sin \tau) \,\mathrm\tau.This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function.Another integral representation is:J_n (x) = \frac \int_^ e^\,(n \tau - x \sin \tau) \,\mathrm\tau.Relation to hypergeometric seriesThe Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric series asJ_\alpha(x)=\frac \;_0F_1 (\alpha+1; -x^2/4).This expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the Bessel-Clifford function.Relation to Laguerre polynomialsIn terms of the Laguerre polynomials and arbitrarily chosen parameter t the Bessel function can be expressed as\frac\right)^\alpha= \frac \sum_ \frac\left( \frac\right) \frac.Bessel functions of the second kind : ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;The Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by Y''α''(x''), are solutions of the Bessel differential equation. They are singular (infinite) at the origin (''x = 0).[[Image:Bessel Functions (2nd Kind, n=0,1,2).svg|thumb|300px|right|Plot of Bessel function of the second kind, Y''&alpha;(''x), for integer orders &alpha; = 0, 1, 2.]]Y''α''(x'') is sometimes also called the '''Neumann function', and is occasionally denoted instead by N''α''(x''). For non-integer α, it is related to ''Jα''(''x) by:Y_\alpha(x) = \frac(x).In the case of integer order n, the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer α tends to 'n':Y_n(x) = \lim_ Y_\alpha(x),which has the result (in integral form)Y_n(x) =  \frac \int_^ \sin(x \sin\theta - n\theta)d\theta- \frac \int_^ 
         \left[ e^ + (-1)^n e^ \right] 
         e^ dt. &lt;/math&gt;For the case of non-integer α'', the definition of ''Yα''(''x) is redundant (as is clear from its definition above). On the other hand, when α is an integer, Y''α''(x) is the second linearly independent solution of Bessel's equation; moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:Y_(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x).\,Both J''α(''x) and Y''α(''x) are holomorphic functions of x'' on the complex plane cut along the negative real axis. When α is an integer, the Bessel functions ''J are entire functions of x''. If ''x is held fixed, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of α.Hankel functions: ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;Another important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel's equation are the Hankel functions H''α(1)(''x) and H''α(2)(''x), defined by:H_\alpha^(x) = J_\alpha(x) + i Y_\alpha(x)H_\alpha^(x) = J_\alpha(x) - i Y_\alpha(x)where i'' is the imaginary unit. These linear combinations are also known as '''Bessel functions of the third kind'; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel's differential equation. The Hankel functions of the first and second kind are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the sign convention for the frequency). They are named after Hermann Hankel.Using the previous relationships they can be expressed as:H_^ (x) = \frac (x) - e^ J_\alpha (x)H_^ (x) = \frac (x) - e^ J_\alpha (x)if α is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether α is an integer or not:H_^ (x)= e^ H_^ (x) H_^ (x)= e^ H_^ (x) Modified Bessel functions : ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sub&gt;The Bessel functions are valid even for complex arguments x'', and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument. In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the '''modified Bessel functions' (or occasionally the hyperbolic Bessel functions) of the first and second kind, and are defined by:I_\alpha(x) = i^ J_\alpha(ix) \!K_\alpha(x) = \frac \frac (x) - I_\alpha (x) = \frac i^ H_\alpha^(ix) \!These are chosen to be real-valued for real arguments x''. The series expansion for ''Iα(x'') is thus similar to that for ''Jα(x''), but without the alternating (&minus;1)''m factor.Iα(x'') and ''Kα(x) are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessel's equation:x^2 \frac + x \frac - (x^2 + \alpha^2)y = 0.Unlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument, I''α and ''Kα are exponentially growing and decaying functions, respectively. Like the ordinary Bessel function J''α, the function ''Iα goes to zero at x'' = 0 for α  0 and is finite at ''x = 0 for α = 0. Analogously, K''α diverges at ''x&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.none|thumb|300px|Modified Bessel functions of 1st kind, I&alpha;(x), for &alpha;=0,1,2,3]]none|thumb|300px|Modified Bessel functions of 2nd kind, K&alpha;(x), for &alpha;=0,1,2,3]]Plot of some modified Bessel functionsPlot of six modified Bessel functions.

The first few spherical Bessel functions are:j_0(x)=\frac j_1(x)=\frac - \frac j_2(x)=\left(\frac  - 1 \right)\frac - \frac andy_0(x)=-j_(x)=-\,\frac y_1(x)=j_(x)=-\,\frac - \frac y_2(x)=-j_(x)=\left(-\,\frac+1 \right)\frac- \frac .There are also spherical analogues of the Hankel functions:h_n^(x) = j_n(x) + i y_n(x)h_n^(x) = j_n(x) - i y_n(x).In fact, there are simple closed-form expressions for the Bessel functions of half-integer order in terms of the standard trigonometric functions, and therefore for the spherical Bessel functions. In particular, for non-negative integers n:h_n^(x) = (-i)^ \frac \sum_^n \frac \fracand h_n^ is the complex-conjugate of this (for real x). It follows, for example, that j_0(x) = \sin(x)/x and y_0(x) = -\cos(x)/x, and so on.Riccati-Bessel functions : &lt;math&gt;S_n, C_n, \zeta_n&lt;/math&gt;Riccati-Bessel functions only slightly differ from spherical Bessel functions:S_n(x)=x j_n(x)=\sqrtJ_(x)C_n(x)=-x y_n(x)=-\sqrtY_(x)\zeta_n(x)=x h_n^(x)=\sqrtH_^(x)=S_n(x)+iC_n(x).They satisfy the differential equation:x^2 \frac + - n (n+1) y = 0.This differential equation, and the Riccati-Bessel solutions, arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as Mie scattering after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g. Du (2004)Hong Du, "Mie-scattering calculation," Applied Optics 43 (9), 1951-1956 (2004) for recent developments and references.Following Debye (1909), the notation \psi_n,\chi_n is sometimes used instead of S_n,C_n.Asymptotic formsThe Bessel functions have the following asymptotic forms for non-negative α. For small arguments 0 , one obtains (Arfken & Weber, 2005):J_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \frac \left( \frac \right) ^\alpha Y_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \left\ \frac \left[ \ln (x/2) + \gamma \right]  &amp; \mbox \alpha=0 \\ \\
 -\frac \left( \frac \right) ^\alpha &amp; \mbox \alpha &gt; 0 \end \right.where \gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant (0.5772...) and \Gamma denotes the gamma function. For large arguments x \gg |\alpha^2 - 1/4|, they become (Arfken & Weber, 2005):J_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \sqrt       \cos \left( x-\frac - \frac \right)&lt;/math&gt; Y_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \sqrt       \sin \left( x-\frac - \frac \right).&lt;/math&gt;(For α=1/2 these formulas are exact; see the spherical Bessel functions above.) Asymptotic forms for the other types of Bessel function follow straightforwardly from the above relations. For example, for large x \gg |\alpha^2 - 1/4|, the modified Bessel functions become:I_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \frac e^x,K_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \sqrt e^.while for small arguments 0 , they become:I_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \frac \left( \frac \right) ^\alpha K_\alpha(x) \rightarrow \left\ - \ln (x/2) - \gamma   &amp; \mbox \alpha=0 \\ \\
 \frac \left( \frac \right) ^\alpha &amp; \mbox \alpha &gt; 0. \end \right.==Properties== For integer order α = n'', ''Jn is often defined via a Laurent series for a generating function:e^ = \sum_^\infty J_n(x) t^n,an approach used by P. A. Hansen in 1843. (This can be generalized to non-integer order by contour integration or other methods.) Another important relation for integer orders is the Jacobi-Anger identity:e^ = \sum_^\infty i^n J_n(z) e^,which is used to expand a plane wave as a sum of cylindrical waves, or to find the Fourier series of a tone-modulated FM signal.The functions J''α, ''Yα, H''α(1), and ''Hα(2) all satisfy the recurrence relations:\frac Z_\alpha(x) = Z_(x) + Z_(x) 2\frac = Z_(x) - Z_(x)where Z'' denotes ''J, Y'', ''H(1), or H(2). (These two identities are often combined, e.g. added or subtracted, to yield various other relations.) In this way, for example, one can compute Bessel functions of higher orders (or higher derivatives) given the values at lower orders (or lower derivatives). In particular, it follows that:\left( \frac \right)^m \left[ x^\alpha Z_ (x) \right] = x^ Z_ (x)\left( \frac \right)^m \left[ \frac \right] = (-1)^m \frac (x).Modified Bessel functions follow similar relations :e^ = \sum_^\infty I_n(x) t^n,ande^ = I_0(z) + 2\sum_^\infty I_n(z) \cos(n\theta),The recurrence relation readsC_(x) - C_(x) = \frac C_\alpha(x)C_(x) + C_(x) = 2\fracwhere C''α denotes ''Iα or e''απ''iKα. These recurrence relations are useful for discrete diffusion problems.Because Bessel's equation becomes Hermitian (self-adjoint) if it is divided by x, the solutions must satisfy an orthogonality relationship for appropriate boundary conditions. In particular, it follows that:\int_0^1 x J_\alpha(x u_) J_\alpha(x u_) dx= \frac J_(u_)^2 = \frac J_'(u_)^2,where α  -1, δm'',''n is the Kronecker delta, and u''α,m is the ''m-th zero of J''α(''x). This orthogonality relation can then be used to extract the coefficients in the Fourier–Bessel series, where a function is expanded in the basis of the functions J''α(''x u''α,m) for fixed α and varying ''m. (An analogous relationship for the spherical Bessel functions follows immediately.)Another orthogonality relation is the closure equation:\int_0^\infty x J_\alpha(ux) J_\alpha(vx) dx = \frac \delta(u - v)for α  -1/2 and where δ is the Dirac delta function. This property is used to construct an arbitrary function from a series of Bessel functions by means of the Hankel transform. For the spherical Bessel functions the orthogonality relation is:\int_0^\infty x^2 j_\alpha(ux) j_\alpha(vx) dx = \frac \delta(u - v)for α  0.Another important property of Bessel's equations, which follows from Abel's identity, involves the Wronskian of the solutions:A_\alpha(x) \frac - \frac B_\alpha(x) = \frac,where A''α and ''Bα are any two solutions of Bessel's equation, and C''α is a constant independent of ''x (which depends on α and on the particular Bessel functions considered). For example, if A''α = ''Jα and B''α = ''Yα, then C''α is 2/π. This also holds for the modified Bessel functions; for example, if ''Aα = I''α and ''Bα = K''α, then ''Cα is -1.(There are a large number of other known integrals and identities that are not reproduced here, but which can be found in the references.)Multiplication theoremThe Bessel functions obey a multiplication theorem\lambda^ J_\nu (\lambda z) =\sum_^\infty \frac \left(\frac\right)^n J_(z) where \lambda and \nu may be taken as arbitrary complex numbers. A similar form may be given for Y_\nu(z) and etc. See See alsoBessel-Clifford functionPropagatorHankel transformFourier–Bessel seriesStruve functionKelvin functionsNotesReferencesGeorge B.
