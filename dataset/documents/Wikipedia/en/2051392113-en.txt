The plural form is pronounced darahim, although in French and English "dirhams" is commonly used. Its ISO 4217 code is "MAD". It is subdivided into 100 santimat (singular: santim, Arabic singular: سنتيم, plural: سنتيما or سنتيمات). The dirham is issued by the Bank Al-Maghrib, the central bank of Morocco. It is also the ''de facto'' currency in Western Sahara. While the dirham is a fully convertible currency, export of the local currency is prohibited by law.HistoryBefore the introduction of a modern coinage in 1882, Morocco issued copper coins denominated in falus, silver coins denominated in dirham and gold coins denominated in benduqi. From 1882, the dirham became a subdivision of the Moroccan rial, with 10 dirham = 1 rial.The dirham was reintroduced in 1960. It replaced the franc as the major unit of currency but, until 1974, the franc continued to circulate, with 1 dirham = 100 francs. In 1974, the santim replaced the franc.CoinsIn 1960, silver 1 dirham coins were introduced. These were followed by nickel 1 dirham and silver 5 dirham coins in 1965. In 1974, with the introduction of the santim, a new coinage was introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 santimat and 1 dirham. The 1 santim coins were aluminium, the 5 up to 20 santimat were minted in brass, with the highest two denominations in cupro-nickel. Cupro-nickel 5 dirham coins were added in 1980 and changed to a bi-metal coin in 1987. The bi-metal coins bear two year designations for the issue date--1987 in the Gregorian calendar and the 1407 in the Islamic calendar. The 1 santim was only minted until 1987 when new designs were introduced, with a ½ dirham replacing the 50 santimat without changing the size or composition. The new 5 dirham coin was bimetallic, as was the 10 dirham coin introduced in 1995. Cupro-nickel 2 dirham coins were introduced in 2002.Dirham Coins http://www.bkam.ma/Anglais/Bilets%20Monnaies%20Circulation/CracctPiece.htmValueTechnical parametersDescriptionDiameterMassCompositionEdgeObverseReverse1 santim17 mm0.7 gAluminiumSmoothArms of the Kingdom]] and inscription "Kingdom of Morocco"Design of fishing5 santimat17.5 mm2 gAluminium bronze92% copper6% aluminium 2% nickelSmoothArms of the Kingdom and inscription "Kingdom of Morocco"Fish in a fishing net under a boat tiller10 santimat20 mm3 gReededAn ear of corn20 santimat23 mm4 gReededDesign representing a Fibule½ dirham21 mm4 gCupronickel75% copper25% nickelReededArms of the Kingdom and inscription "Kingdom of Morocco"Design representing communications and new technology1 dirham24 mm6 gReededMohammed VI]] (earlier issues show Hassan II)Arms of the Kingdom and inscription "Kingdom of Morocco"2 dirham26 mm7 gReededMohammed VI5 dirhams26.2 mm6.8 gRing: 82.5% iron&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.5% chromiumCenter: Aluminium bronze (as 20 santimat)ReededMohammed VI (earlier issues show Hassan II)10 dirhams28 mm12 gRing: Aluminium bronze (as 20 santimat)Center: Cupronickel (as 1 dirham)ReededMohammed VI (earlier issues show Hassan II)Arms of the Kingdom and inscription "Kingdom of Morocco"BanknotesThe first notes denominated in dirham were overprints on earlier franc notes, in denominations of 50 dirham (on 5000 francs) and 100 dirham (on 10,000 francs).

Those include rial //, equivalent to 5 santimat and franc //, equivalent to 1 santim. Usually, when dealing with goods with a value lower than a dirham, it is common to use the rial or santim. However, rial is used when speaking in Arabic and centime when speaking in French. Though not used by the young generation, the denomination 1000, 2000, ... to 100,000 franc will be used by people who lived during the French colonial period when referring to 10, 20 and 1000 dirham. Likewise, rial is also used for higher value than portions of the dirham, reaching 5000 dhs (100,000 rial). This denomination is used in Arabic speaking context especially in popular milieu such as old medina souks or vegetable markets.
