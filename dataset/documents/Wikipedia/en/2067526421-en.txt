Veikkausliiga is currently ranked as the 30th best league in Europe. Its main sponsor is the Finnish national betting agency Veikkaus, hence the league's name. Veikkausliiga was founded in 1990; before that the top division was called Mestaruussarja (championship series) since 1930. Between 1908 and 1930 the championship was decided in a cup competition.Ykkönen (division one) has been the second highest level of Finnish football since 1973.Like in some other cold-climate European countries (including Norway, Sweden and Russia), league matches in Finland are played in summer, with a schedule usually from April to October. In current format each team plays all other teams twice, both at home and away. At the end of the season, the lowest-placed team is relegated to Ykkönen, whose winner will be promoted to Veikkausliiga. In normal seasons, the team placed next to lowest will play a two-legged relegation/promotion match with the second-placed team in Ykkönen. In season 2006, because the Veikkausliiga was one team short, this promotion match was not played and two best clubs of Ykkönen, FC Viikingit and AC Oulu, were promoted directly. KuPS were relegated.Most of the clubs in Veikkausliiga are professional, although some of the smaller clubs are semi-professional. Average attendance has been slightly under 3000.ClubsThe Veikkausliiga clubs in the 2008 season are (with their home towns in brackets):FC Haka (Valkeakoski)FC Honka (Espoo)FC Inter (Turku)FC KooTeePee (Kotka)FC Lahti (Lahti)FF Jaro (Jakobstad)HJK (Helsinki)IFK Mariehamn (Mariehamn)KuPS (Kuopio)MyPa-47 (Anjalankoski)RoPS (Rovaniemi)Tampere United (Tampere)TPS (Turku)VPS (Vaasa)ChampionsThe following clubs have won either the Veikkausliiga (between 1990 and 2007) or the Mestaruussarja (between 1908 and 1989) championship :21 wins: HJK9 wins: FC Haka, HPS8 wins: TPS7 wins: HIFK5 wins: KuPS, Kuusysi1, Tampere United24 wins: KIF3 wins: Reipas1, VIFK, ÅIFK2 wins: FC Jazz4, KTP3, OPS, VPS1 win: HT, KPV, PUS, Turun Pyrkivä, Viipurin Sudet, Unitas, TPV, MyPaNotes: 1 Kuusysi and Lahden Reipas merged their professional teams in 1997 to form FC Lahti.

Ilves Tampere were renamed Tampere United before the 1999 season as a result of failed merger. Although Ilves continues also as its own club all predecessors' titles are included here in the figure for Tampere United. 3 FC KooTeePee was established to continue top-level football in Kotka when the former Kotka team known as KTP went bankrupt.
