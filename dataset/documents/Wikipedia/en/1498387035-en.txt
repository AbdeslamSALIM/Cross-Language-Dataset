They are therefore 3 electrons short of filling their outermost electron shell in their non-ionized state. The most important element of this group is nitrogen (N), which in its diatomic form is the principal component of air.Binary compounds of the group can be referred to collectively as pnictides. The spelling derives from the Greek πνίγειν (pnigein), to choke or stifle, which is a property of nitrogen; they are also mnemonic for the two most common members, P and N. The name pentels (from the Latin penta, five) was also used for this group at one time, stemming from the earlier group naming convention (Group VB).These elements are also noted for their stability in compounds due to their tendency for forming double and triple covalent bonds. This is the property of these elements which leads to their potential toxicity, most evident in phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. When these substances react with various chemicals of the body, they create strong free radicals not easily processed by the liver, where they accumulate. Paradoxically it is this strong bonding which causes nitrogen and bismuth's reduced toxicity (when in molecules), as these form strong bonds with other atoms which are difficult to split, creating very unreactive molecules. For example N2, the diatomic form of nitrogen, is used for inert atmosphere in situations where argon or another noble gas would be prohibitively expensive.The nitrogen group consists of two non-metals, two metalloids, and one metal. All the elements in the group are a solid at room temperature except for Nitrogen which is a gas at room temperature. Nitrogen and bismuth, despite both being part of the nitrogen group, are very different in their physical properties. For example, at STP nitrogen is a transparent nonmetallic gas, while bismuth is a brittle pinkish metallic solid.This group consists of nitrogen (N'), phosphorus ('P), arsenic (As), antimony (Sb), bismuth (Bi) and ununpentium (Uup) (unconfirmed).References+ Explanation of above periodic table slice:NonmetalsMetalloidsPoor metalsatomic number in  are gasesatomic number in  are solidssolid borders are primordial elements (older than the Earth)dotted borders are radioactive, synthetic elementsSee alsooxypnictideCategory:Chemical element groups Category:Periodic table Category:Pnictogensar:مجموعة نيتروجين ast:Elementos del grupu 15 bs:15. grupa hemijskih elemenata ca:Grup del nitrogen cs:Pentely de:Stickstoffgruppe es:Grupo del nitrógeno eo:Elemento de grupo 15 eu:15. taldeko elementu fr:Pnictogène ko:15족 원소 it:Gruppo dell'azoto lmo:Grupp de l'azòt nl:Stikstofgroep ja:第15族元素 nn:Gruppe 15 nds:Cheemsch Elementen vun de 15.
