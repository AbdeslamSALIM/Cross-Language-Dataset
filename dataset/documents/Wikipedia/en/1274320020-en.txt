It is also a member of CONMEBOL.HistoryColombia did not participate in the world cup qualifying rounds from 1930 to 1954 but were quite active. They went on to win the Central American Cup in 1946, a cup they would win again in 1970. Colombia would first enter World Cup qualifying in the 1958 qualifiers but were unsuccessful. Colombia tied with Uruguay in Bogotá 1-1 but lost in Montevideo 1-0. Later, Colombia narrowly lost against Paraguay 3-2 in Bogotá and later in Asunción 3-0 leaving Colombia at the bottom of CONMEBOL Group 3 with 1 point.1962 FIFA World CupIn the 1962 qualifiers, they faced Peru in a two-game series and qualified for their first World Cup.CONMEBOL Group 3 1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 Colombia qualified.At Chile 1962, Colombia lost 2-1 to Uruguay in their opening match. They then drew 4-4 with the Soviet Union in one of biggest shocks at Chile 1962. It should be noted that in this game, Colombia scored 4 goals against Soviet Union's goalie, Lev Yashin, considered the best goalie in soccer history. Unfortunately their campaign ended with a 5-0 defeat to Yugoslavia.Group 1 - Chile 1962 Final StandingsTeamPtsPldWDLGFGA53210854320183231024613012511Aftermath and growth of La SeleccionColombia entered the 1966 qualifiers and finished bottom of their group behind Chile and Ecuador. The 1970 qualifiers proved to be little better. In the 1974 qualifiers, Colombia finished behind Uruguay only on goal difference. In the 1975 Copa America, Colombia finished runners-up losing to Peru 2-0.For the 1990, South America was allocated three and a half berths at the 1990 finals, one of which went to Argentina as defending champions from Mexico 1986. The continent's nine remaining sides were split into three groups with the two automatic qualifying berths going to the two best group winners, in this instance Uruguay and Brazil. The group winner with the worst record would advance to the CONMEBOL / OFC Intercontinental Play-off. Thus Colombia had to take on the winners of the Oceania Zone. Curiously, this turned out to be Israel, after they finished ahead of Australia and New Zealand in the final qualifying group. Colombia qualified for their first FIFA World Cup since Chile 1962 after winning in Barranquilla 1-0, and tying in Israel 0-0.1990 FIFA World CupAt Italia '90, Colombia defeated United Arab Emirates 2-0, lost to Yugoslavia 1-0 and earned their place in the Round Of Sixteen after a dramatic 1-1 draw with West Germany, which would later win the cup.

Romania took the lead in the 16th minute with their first attack of the match when Raducioiu took on three defenders before firing home a low shot. On the half hour mark, Hagi made it 2-0 when he noticed Cordoba out of position and dipped a cross over his head into the net. Valencia pulled a goal back for the Colombians in the 43rd minute when he headed in a corner from Perez. In the second half, Raducioiu put the result beyond doubt with his second goal in the final few minutes.Group Stage: USA: 2-1 :Colombia - June 22, 1994During the team's next game against the United States on June 22, Andrés Escobar was stretching to cut out a cross but he deflected the ball into his own net.

It was organised by CONMEBOL, South America's football governing body. Prior to the tournament, three meetings were held by CONMEBOL authorities who were concerned about potential security issues in Colombia, for what Venezuela offered to host the competition . At last minute, the CONMEBOL decided to return the organization to Colombia, and the tournament was held on schedule. Complaining for the sudden decision, and claiming that Argentine players had received death threats from terrorist groups, the Argentine Football Association decided to withdraw from the competition. Because Canada and Argentina withdrew, on July 6 and July 10 respectively, Honduras and Costa Rica were invited. There were no terrorist incidents within the competition. The teams were divided into three groups of four teams each. The formation of the groups was made by CONMEBOL, in a public drawing of lots. Each team plays one match against each of the other teams within the same group. Three (3) points are awarded for a win, one (1) point for a draw and zero (0) points for a defeat. First and second placed teams, in each group, advance to the quarter-finals. The best third placed team and the second best third placed team, also advance to the quarter-finals. Colombia was placed in Group A with Venezuela, Chile, and Ecuador. Colombia finished on top of the Group A with 9 pointsGroup Stage: Colombia 2-0 :VenezuelaA goal in each half was enough to secure Copa America hosts Colombia a victory over Venezuela. Freddy Grisales scored Colombia's first in the 15th minute, and Victor Hugo Aristizabal made it 2-0 on the hour from the penalty spot.Group Stage: Colombia 1-0 :EcuadorA goal by Victor Hugo Aristizábal in the 29th minute gave Colombia a 1-0 vicoryGroup Stage: Colombia 2-0 :ChileTwo goals left Colombia as group leader with 9 points.Quarter-Finals: Colombia 3-0 :PeruThe hosts beat Peru with a double from Victor Hugo Aristazabal and one from Giovanni Hernandez.Semi-Finals: Colombia 2-0 :HondurasThe hosts took the lead after five minutes with a strike from Bedoya. The host nation eventually doubled their lead after 62 minutes, with Aristizabal scoring.Final: Colombia 1-0 :MexicoHosts Colombia won their first Copa America title by beating Mexico in Bogotá. Their captain Ivan Cordoba scored the decisive goal early in the second half with a header from a free kick. It was a fairytale success for Colombia after the decision to go ahead with the tournament after it had initially been cancelled. Even the fact that Argentina, regarded by most observers as the strongest side in the region, elected not to take part and that most countries fielded weakened teams failed to dampen the celebrations in Bogotá.Copa América Winners::2002 FIFA World CupFor Korea/Japan 2002, hopes were high for Colombia, but a weak attack and internal turnmoil crushed their hopes. Colombia only managed a 6th place in the qualification round. Uruguay and Colombia both had 27 points but due to goal differences, Uruguay advanced to the Play-Offs with Australia.Final StandingsRankTeamPtsPldWDLGFGAGD143181341421527231189452320333018936311714430189362923652718765191366271876520155718184682133-128161844101425-119161851121844-2610121833121527-12Fixtures & ResultsMarch 28, 2000, Bogotá, Colombia -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 April 26, 2000, La Paz, Bolivia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 June 4, 2000, Bogotá, Colombia -  3&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 June 29, 2000, Bogotá, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;3 July 19, 2000, Lima, Peru -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 July 25, 2000, Quito, Ecuador -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 August 15, 2000, Bogotá, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 September 2, 2000, Santiago, Chile -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 October 7, 2000, Bogotá, Colombia -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 November 15, 2000, São Paulo, Brazil -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 March 27, 2001, Bogotá, Colombia -  2&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 April 24, 2001, San Cristóbal, Venezuela -  2&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 June 3, 2001, Buenos Aires, Argentina -  3&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 August 16, 2001, Bogotá, Colombia -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 September 5, 2001, Bogotá, Colombia -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 October 7, 2001, Montevideo, Uruguay -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 November 7, 2001, Bogotá, Colombia -  3&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 November 14, 2001, Asunción, Paraguay -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;4 2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oroin New Jersey, United States (2005)]]The 2005 CONCACAF Copa de Oro, or Gold Cup, was played in July 2005 in the United States.

Head coach Francisco "Pacho" Maturana led the team through 4 FIFA qualifiers and was fired after losing to Brazil 2-1 in Barranquila, getting thrashed 4-0 by a weak Bolivia and suffering a shocking 1-0 defeat at home to Venezuela. Following a 1-1 tie with Argentina he was fired and Reinaldo Rueda was placed as the new coach. Colombia seemed to have improved and defeated Peru and Uruguay 5-0 during qualifying, managed a 3-0 victory over arch-rivals Ecuador, and tied with Brazil 0-0 in São Paulo. Towards the end Colombia (21 pts), Chile (21pts), and Uruguay (22 pts) had a chance to target the playoffs with Australia. Colombia (21 pts) traveled to Asuncion hoping for three points against Paraguay (28), who sealed their place in Germany while Chile battled against Ecuador and Uruguay against Argentina. As in the 2002 qualifiers, the last match of Argentina was against Uruguay, and in both occasions Uruguay needed a favourable result to reach 5th place in order to make the playoffs to earn a place in the World Cup. Even though Colombia won its match against Paraguay, Uruguay also won the match against Argentina, again reaching the position to play the playoff for the last ticket to Germany. Both Argentina and Paraguay had already qualified. Colombia ended with 24 pts, once again behind an Uruguay with 25 pts.Final StandingsTeamPtsPldWDLGFGAGD34189723517183418104429171228188462319428188462323025186752328-524186662416822185761822-4181853102028-818184682028-8141842122037-17Fixtures & ResultsSeptember 7, 2003, Barranquilla, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 September 10, 2003, La Paz, Bolivia -  4&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 November 15, 2003, Barranquilla, Colombia -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 November 19, 2003, Barranquilla, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 March 31, 2004, Lima, Peru -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 June 2, 2004, Quito, Ecuador -  2&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 June 6, 2004, Barranquilla, Colombia -  5&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 September 5, 2004, Santiago, Chile -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 October 9, 2004, Barranquilla, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 October 13, 2004, Maceió, Brazil -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 November 17, 2004, Barranquilla, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 March 26, 2005, Maracaibo, Venezuela -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 March 30, 2005, Buenos Aires, Argentina -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 June 4, 2005, Barranquilla, Colombia -  5&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 June 8, 2005, Barranquilla, Colombia -  3&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 September 4, 2005, Montevideo, Uruguay -  3&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 October 8, 2005, Barranquilla, Colombia -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 October 12, 2005, Asunción, Paraguay -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 [[2006 Central American and Caribbean Games]]Group StageJuly 16Colombia7-0Netherlands Antilles]]atCartagena]], ColombiaJuly 20Colombia2-3Panama]]atCartagena]], ColombiaQuarter FinalsAfter Copa America 2007After Copa America 2007, the Colombian national football team boomed with recent success in the South American 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. After embarrassing losses against Paraguay, and Argentina in the Copa America, many Colombians nonetheless anticipated a successful run for 2010 FIFA World Cup classification. In the first match of the qualifying round, Colombia, defying expectations that they would lose to Brazil, drew 0-0 with Brazil at home. Not long after that, Colombia surprisingly tied 0-0 again with Bolivia national football team, but many argue that this was largely due to the fact that the altitude of La Paz contributes to usual losses or ties for non-Bolivian teams. However, Colombia would find their very first win after defeating a weak Venezuela national football team 1-0, with a stupendous free kick courtesy of Ruben Dario Bustos. In their next game, Colombia would defy expectations again by beating Argentina, at the time ranked first in the world. On November 17, 2007, In Bogotá against Argentina, Lionel Messi beat the defense before scoring past goalkeeper Agustín Julio. Colombia turned the game around in the second half, however, when Ruben Dario Bustos got his second free kick goal of the qualifying campaign, and not long after that, Dayro Moreno scored his first international goal for Colombia. Colombia won the match 2-1, obtaining 4th place in the world cup qualifiers. On June 14, 2008 Colmbia tied Peru 1-1 moving Colombia up to 3rd place in the world cup qualifiers after a Brazilian loss to Paraguay. Another 0-0 between Ecuador and Colombia in Quito was on June 18, 2008 and Colombia remain at 3rd place and as the only undefeated country in the qualification after Bolivia won Paraguay 4-2.Current team statusColombia is currently participating in the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. 2010 FIFA World Cup &lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;Qualification Standings&lt;/small&gt;expanded = yesfixtures = yestiebreakers = yesLast and next gamesLast game:  0 - 4  - Santiago, Chile - September 10, 2008 - WCQ2010.Next game:  - Bogotá, Colombia - October 11, 2008 - WCQ2010.KEY: F = Friendly match; WCQ2010 = 2010 FIFA World Cup qualificationCurrent squadThe following players named for their WCQ against  on Oct 11th 2008 and on  Oct 14th http://golgolgol.net/Futbol_Sudamericano/Eliminatorias_al_Mundial/Noticias/_Vuelven_Yepes_y_Calero_a_la_seleccion_Colombia__125-52825.html  |caps=7|goals=0|club=Santa Fe|clubnat=Colombia |caps=50|goals=0|club=Pachuca C.F.|clubnat=Mexico |caps=56|goals=4|club=A.C.
