It is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Flagyl in the US, while Sanofi-Aventis markets metronidazole globally under the same tradename, Flagyl, and also by various generic manufacturers, who sell it at a lower price. Metronidazole is also used as a gel preparation in the treatment of the dermatological conditions such as rosacea (Rozex and MetroGel by Galderma) and fungating tumours (Anabact, Cambridge Healthcare Supplies).Metronidazole is a prodrug. It is converted in anaerobic organisms by the redox enzyme pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The nitro group of metronidazole is chemically reduced by ferredoxin (or a ferredoxin-linked metabolic process) and the products are responsible for disrupting the DNA helical structure, thus inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis.Metronidazole is selectively taken up by anaerobic bacteria and sensitive protozoal organisms because of the ability of these organisms to reduce metronidazole to its active form intracellularly.IndicationsSystemic metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of:Vaginitis due to Trichomonas vaginalis (protozoal) infection in both symptomatic patients as well as their asymptomatic sexual contactsBacterial vaginosis, commonly associated with overgrowth of Gardnerella species, in symptomatic patientsPelvic inflammatory disease in conjunction with other antibiotics such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, or ceftriaxoneProtozoal infections due to Entamoeba histolytica (Amoebic dysentery or Hepatic abscesses), and Giardia lamblia (Giardiasis) should be treated alone or in conjunction with iodoquinol or diloxanide furoateAnaerobic bacterial infections such as Bacteroides fragilis, spp, Fusobacterium spp, Clostridium spp, Peptostreptococcus spp, Prevotella spp, or any other anaerobes in intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis, empyema, pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, diabetic foot ulcer, meningitis and brain abscess, bone and joint infections, septicemia, endometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, or endocarditisPseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficileHelicobacter pylori eradication therapy, as part of a multi-drug regimen in peptic ulcer diseaseProphylaxis for those undergoing potentially contaminated colorectal surgery and may be combined with neomycinAcute gingivitis and other dental infections (TGA approved, non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved)Crohn's disease with colonic or perianal involvement (non-FDA approved)- believed to be more effective in combination with ciprofloxacinWith amphotericin B and certain other drugs, it is used as an adjunct in the attempted treatment of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri infectionTopical metronidazole is indicated for the treatment of rosacea, and in the treatment of malodorous fungating wounds.Prevention of preterm birthsMetronidazole has also been used in women to prevent preterm birth associated with bacterial vaginosis, amongst other risk factors including the presence of cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin (fFN). A randomised controlled trial demonstrated that metronidazole was ineffective in preventing preterm delivery in high-risk pregnant women and, conversely, the incidence of preterm delivery was actually higher in women treated with metronidazole.Lamont has argued that Metronidazole is not the right antibiotic to administer in these circumstances and was often administered too late to be of use. Clindamycin administered early in the second trimester to women who test positive for bacterial vaginosis seems to be more effective.Adverse effectsCommon adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with systemic metronidazole therapy include: nausea, diarrhea, and/or metallic taste in the mouth. Intravenous administration is commonly associated with thrombophlebitis. Infrequent adverse effects include: hypersensitivity reactions (rash, itch, flushing, fever), headache, dizziness, vomiting, glossitis, stomatitis, dark urine, and/or paraesthesia.High doses and/or long-term systemic treatment with metronidazole is associated with the development of black hairy tongue, leukopenia, neutropenia, increased risk of peripheral neuropathy and/or CNS toxicity.Metronidazole is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a potential human carcinogen. Although some of the testing methods have been questioned, it has been shown to cause cancer in experimental animals.National Toxicology Program. Metronidazole. In: Report on carcinogens. 11th ed. Research Triangle Park (NC): U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 2005 Aug 26; cited 2006 Jun 20. Available from: http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s112metr.pdf Nevertheless, it appears to have a fairly low potential for cancer risk and under most circumstances the benefits of treatment outweigh the risk.Common adverse drug reactions associated with topical metronidazole therapy include local redness, dryness, and/or skin irritation; and eye watering (if applied near eyes).Interaction with alcoholConsuming ethanol (alcohol) while using metronidazole causes a disulfiram-like reaction with effects that can include nausea, vomiting, flushing of the skin, tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), and shortness of breath. Consumption of alcohol should be avoided by patients during systemic metronidazole therapy and for at least 48 hours after completion of treatment. However, the mechanism of this reaction in the clinical setting has recently been questioned by some authors, and a possible central toxic serotonin reaction for the alcohol intolerance suggested.ReferencesExternal linksMetronidazole monographMerck manualshttp://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/30003224/    Category:Nitroimidazole antibiotics Category:Antiprotozoal agents Category:Dermatological preparations Category:Pfizer de:Metronidazol es:Metronidazol fr:Métronidazole hu:Metronidazol it:Metronidazolo ja:メトロニダゾール nl:Metronidazol pl:Metronidazol pt:Metronidazol ro:Metronidazol ru:Метронидазол sl:Metronidazol fi:Metronidatsoli uk:Метронідазол
