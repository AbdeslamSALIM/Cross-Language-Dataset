If You Feel Alright" (1997).She is also the singer in "Destination Calabria", a 2007 hit release by Alex Gaudino, a mashup which uses vocals from her 2004 "Destination Unknown" and instrumental from Rune RK's 2003 "Calabria".Waters lived in New Jersey, but later moved to Washington, D.C., to study computer science at Howard University. After graduation, she worked as a computer technician at the Washington, D.C., Parole Board&lt;/ref&gt;. She took her [[demo tape]] of &quot;Gypsy Woman&quot; to a Music Business Forum, and the only people to call her about it were a trio of [[club music|club]] [[disc jockeys]] who formed the [[Basement Boys]]."Gypsy Woman" became a worldwide hit, memorable for its la da dee la dee da refrain and its often sampled keyboard riff. The track reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and found even more success in Europe, reaching #2 on the UK Singles Chart. The track was also parodied in the memorable sketch "My Songs Are Mindless" (Performed by Kim Wayans) on the television series In Living Color in 1991. Wayans skewered the song's simple rhythm and melody by singing "Hey look at that its Fred and the Flintstones! That's a song now, I got a song now: Yabba Dabba Doo Yabba Dabba Da, Yabba Dabba Doo Yabba Dabba Da...." The clip from the comedy show would sometimes show up mixed into Waters' own composition at Gay clubs with video screens. Scarcely a year after its release, a new version turned up on the Red Hot + Dance AIDS fundraiser disc (1992, distributed by Sony Music), gaining its remixer (Joey Negro) his first real American exposure.Despite some additional contributions by remixer Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley, Waters' next releases were promoted only in the dance music markets, but she made an unexpected mainstream comeback in 1994 when "100% Pure Love" hit #11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the longest charting singles on the Hot 100 at 45 weeks ("Gypsy Woman" remained on the chart for an average 16 weeks).Her 1997, self-titled album included another Top 40 US hit, "Say...If You Feel Alright," but mainstream success in the US has since eluded her. However, Waters remains successful on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and the Hot Dance Airplay charts with recent hits like "Come On Down" and "My Time," both of which peaked at #1, the latter making top 40 in the UK. "Gypsy Woman"'s keyboard-chord was recently sampled on rapper T.I.'s 2006 mega-hit "Why You Wanna."In 2007 Waters embarked on a world tour; performing sold out shows in Russia, Egypt, the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico, and Dubai, among other locations. In 2007 her track "Destination Calabria" hit the Top 10 on the UK Singles Chart.In May 2008, Waters issued the single "Dancefloor." The single seems to be only promoted to the club market and dance radio.Awards &amp; nominationsYearAward1991American Music Award nomination for Favorite Artist - Dance1991American Music Award nomination for Favorite Single - Dance ("Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)")1991American Music Award nomination for Favorite New Artist - Dance1994Billboard Music Award Won for Top-Selling Hot Dance Music Club Play Single for "100% Pure Love"1994Billboard Music Award nomination for Top Hot Dance Music Maxi-Singles Sales Artist1994Billboard Music Award nomination for Top Hot Dance Music Maxi-Single Sales for "100% Pure Love"1994Billboard Music Award nomination for Top Hot Dance Music Club Play Artist1995Best Dance Video]] ("100% Pure Love")DiscographyAlbums1991 Surprise1994 Storyteller1997 Crystal Waters1998 The Best of Crystal Waters2001 Gypsy Woman - The Collection2001 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Crystal WatersSinglesYearSongU.S. Hot 100U.S. DanceUKAlbum1991"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)" (Strip To The Bone Radio Edit)812Surprise1991"Makin' Happy" (Hurley's Happy House 7")-118Surprise1992"Surprise" (UK 7" Edit)-35-Surprise1992"Megamix"--3912"/CD single, featuring songs from Surprise1993"You Turn Me On"---Encino Man Original Motion Picture Soundtrack1992"Gypsy Woman (She's Homeless)" (Joey Negro's Mindmix)--35Red Hot + Dance / Double A-side with Sabrina Johnson's "Peace"1994"100% Pure Love" (Radio Mix)11115Storyteller1994"What I Need" (LP Radio Edit) (double A-side with "Ghetto Day" in the UK)82140Storyteller1994"Ghetto Day" (Radio Mix) (double A-side with "What I Need" in the UK)--40Storyteller1995"Relax" (Vission Lorimer Radio Mix)-137Storyteller1996Bad Yard Club]] featuring Crystal Waters)''-203512"/CD single1997"Say...
