Fat Wreck Chords is a San Francisco, California based independent record label, focused on punk rock, which was started by Fat Mike (lead singer and bassist of the punk rock band NOFX) and his wife Erin, in 1990.They have released material for bands such as his own, NOFX, Descendents, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes (for which Fat Mike is also the bassist), Propagandhi, Rise Against, Lagwagon, Strung Out, No Use for a Name, Less Than Jake, Against Me!, Anti-Flag, and more.One somewhat unique and defining characteristic of Fat Wreck Chords is that they only sign one-record deals with bands. This allows the bands working with Fat Wreck Chords to have a choice as to when and if they want to put a record out on the label.BBC Jan-16-2003: Fat Mike on The Lock Up - NOFX Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In some cases, bands have released albums on Fat Wreck Chords but also on other labels. Many bands on this label participated in the campaign Punkvoter, which was started by Fat Mike and attempted to encourage the youth in the U.S. to vote against George W. Bush in the 2004 U.S. presidential election.The label has never been a member of the Recording Industry Association of America as indicated on the frequently-asked questions portion of the label's website: "Are we a member? Not only no, but FUCK NO! We spent three years having our label’s name (which was misspelled) removed from their members list. A year went by, then our name showed up again on their fucking list! Who are these sonsabitches?! Needless to say, we’re in the process of having our name removed again, but they aren’t being too cooperative."http://www.fatwreck.com/community/faq However one of the many distributors carrying releases from Fat Wreck Chords is Sony BMG subsidiary RED Distribution,RED - An Artist Development Company&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; an RIAA member.ImprintsThe label has had two subsidiaries over the years, Honest Don's and Pink &amp; Black. Honest Don's released records from Diesel Boy, Chixdiggit, and Teen Idols amongst others, while Pink & Black released albums from girl-fronted bands like Fabulous Disaster and Dance Hall Crashers.Fat Mike also advanced $50,000 to Chris Hannah and Jord Samolesky of Propagandhi which he recouped within months from sales of Propagandhi records to help them start up their own label, G7 Welcoming Committee, though G7WC is independent from Fat Wreck.Compilation albumsFat Wreck regularly releases compilation albums, often to promote bands signed to the label, but also, since 2003, to raise funds for various charities. The earliest Fat Wreck compilations all have titles with some reference to fatness:Fat Music for Fat People (1994)Fat Music Volume II: Survival of the Fattest (1996)Fat Music Volume III: Physical Fatness (1997)Fat Music Volume IV: Life in the Fat Lane (1999)Fat Music Volume V: Live Fat, Die Young (2001)Fat Music Volume VI: Uncontrollable Fatulence (2002)Shortly after Fat Music Volume IV was released, Fat Wreck released a similarly-titled album, Short Music for Short People, which features 101 songs, all averaging approximately 30 seconds. The shortest song ("Short Attention Span" by the Fizzy Bangers) is only seven seconds, and the longest ("Out of Hand" by Bad Religion) is 40 seconds. Some of the songs were commissioned and recorded specifically for the album, while others, such as "Deny Everything" by the Circle Jerks and "Spray Paint" by Black Flag, were from the bands' pre-existing repertoires.Since the last Fat Music album has been released, the Fat Wreck compilations have been explicitly for charitable causes. Liberation: Songs to Benefit PETA is a benefit album for the animal rights organization PETA, and PROTECT: A Benefit for the National Association to Protect Children is a benefit album for the children's rights group PROTECT. Between Liberation and PROTECT, two other compilation albums were released in protest of President George W. Bush and his administration: Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2.Album seriesLive in a DiveLive in a Dive is a series of live albums recorded by Fat Wreck Chords.Fat Wreck Chords: &quot;Live in a Dive&quot; In order of release:TitleBandRelease date1Live in a Dive: No Use for a NameNo Use for a NameSeptember 11, 2001]]2Live in a Dive (Bracket album)Bracket]]February 26, 2002]]3Live in a Dive (Sick of It All album)Sick of It AllAugust 13, 2002]]4Live in a Dive (Strung Out album)Strung OutJune 22, 2003]]5Live in a Dive (Subhumans album)Subhumans (UK band)February 10, 2004]]6Live in a Dive (Swingin' Utters album)Swingin' UttersJune 29, 2004]]7Live in a Dive (Lagwagon album)LagwagonFebruary 8, 2005]]Current bands American SteelAvailChixdiggit!Citizen FishDead to MeDescendentsThe DickiesDillinger FourThe FlatlinersLagwagonThe Lawrence ArmsLeftöver CrackThe Loved OnesLove Equals DeathMad CaddiesMe First and the Gimme GimmesNOFXNo Use for a NameOnly CrimePropagandhiRandyReal McKenziesThe Sainte CatherinesSmoke or FireStar Fucking HipstersStrike AnywhereStrung OutThe SubhumansSwingin' UttersWestern AddictionFormer bands 88 Fingers LouieAgainst Me!Anti-FlagThe AtarisBad AstronautBracketConsumedDiesel BoyEpoxiesFace to FaceThe Fight!Frenzal RhombGoober PatrolHi-StandardGood RiddanceGuns n' WankersLess Than JakeMxPxNerf HerderNone More BlackRise AgainstScreeching WeaselScrew 32Sick of It AllSnuffThe SoviettesTiltWIZOZero DownFootnotesSee alsoList of record labelsFat Wreck Chords artistsFat Wreck Chords compilationsExternal linksOfficial siteUnofficial Fat Wreck Wiki siteCategory:American record labels Category:Independent record labels Category:Punk record labels Category:Record labels established in 1990 Category:Fat Wreck Chordsbg:Fat Wreck Chords ca:Fat Wreck Chords de:Fat Wreck Chords es:Fat Wreck Chords eu:Fat Wreck Chords fr:Fat Wreck Chords ko:팻 렉 코드 it:Fat Wreck Chords nl:Fat Wreck Chords pl:Fat Wreck Chords pt:Fat Wreck Chords ru:Fat Wreck Chords scn:Fat Wreck Chords fi:Fat Wreck Chords sv:Fat Wreck Chords
