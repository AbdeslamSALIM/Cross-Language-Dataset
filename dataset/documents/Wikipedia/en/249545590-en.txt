He has played more than 30 matches and scored two goals for the Danish national team, and represented his country at the 2004 European Championship. He is the younger brother of fellow national team player Niclas Jensen.BiographyBorn in Copenhagen, Daniel Jensen started playing football at B.93 in the secondary Danish 1st Division. He was called up for Danish under-19 national team in September 1995, and made his senior debut for B.93 in the fall 1996. He played a total 16 matches and scored three goals for the under-19 national team, before he was sold to Dutch club SC Heerenveen in July 1998. While at Heerenveen, he played 19 games and scored two goals for the Danish under-21 national team. In February 2002, he made his Danish national team debut under national coach Morten Olsen.After more than 100 league matches for Heerenveen, his contract ran out in the summer 2003, and he left the club on a free transfer. He sought a move to a club in the Spanish La Liga championship, and signed a one-year contract with newly promoted team Real Murcia in August 2003. Murcia ended last in the 2003-04 La Liga season, and Jensen was reported on his way to a number of German clubs. He was called up to the Danish team for the 2004 European Championship (Euro 2004) in June 2004. He began the Euro 2004 tournament as a part of the Danish starting line-up, and played full time in the first two matches against Italy and Bulgaria. He was replaced by Christian Poulsen during Denmark's third match, and saw the quarter-final defeat to the Czech Republic from the bench.Back from Euro 2004, Murcia used a clause in Jensen's contract to prolong it for another two years. The extension hindered Jensen from leaving the club on a free transfer, and he was sold to German club SV Werder Bremen for €1 million in July 2004. In August 2006, he was a part of the German League Cup winning Werder Bremen team. In January 2008 Jensen signed an extension to his contract with Werder Bremen, that will keep him at the club until 2011.International goalsScores and results list Denmark's goal tally first.+#DateVenueOpponentScoreResultCompetition1.2006-10-11Rheinpark Stadion, VaduzLIE1-04-0Euro 2008 qualification]]2.2007-02-06Loftus Road, LondonAUS2-03-1Friendly match3.2008-09-10Estádio José Alvalade, LisbonPortugal3-23-2FIFA World Cup 2010 qualifyingHonoursGerman League Cup: 2006ReferencesExternal linksDanish national team profile FussballDaten career statistics National Football Teams career statistics  Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Danish expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:SC Heerenveen players Category:Werder Bremen players Category:La Liga footballers Category:Real Murcia footballers Category:First Bundesliga footballersda:Daniel Jensen de:Daniel Jensen es:Daniel Jensen fr:Daniel Jensen id:Daniel Jensen it:Daniel Jensen nl:Daniel Jensen ja:ダニエル・イェンセン nds:Daniel Jensen pl:Daniel Jensen pt:Daniel Jensen fi:Daniel Jensen sv:Daniel Jensen
