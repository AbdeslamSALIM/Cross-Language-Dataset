Both teams were already assured of qualification for the semi-finals, but both teams knew that the winners of the game would face hosts Vietnam in the semi-finals, while the losing team would face Singapore who were perceived to be easier opposition and avoid the fuss of moving training bases from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi for the semi-final. The first half saw little action, with both teams barely making an attempt to score. During the second half both teams managed to score, partly thanks to half-hearted defending, resulting in a 2-2 scoreline after 90 minutes. Then, during injury time, Indonesian defender Mursyid Effendi deliberately kicked the ball into his own goal, despite the Thai's attempts to stop him doing so, thus handing Thailand a 3-2 victory. Both teams were fined for "violating the spirit of the game" and Mursyid Effendi was banned from football for life.In the semi-finals, Thailand lost to Vietnam, and Indonesia also lost to Singapore. In the final, the title was to elude the hosts as they went down 1-0 to unfancied Singapore in one of the competition's biggest shocks to date.[[Southeast Asian Games|SEA Games]] record(Under-23 Team Since 2001)SEA GamesYearRoundGPWDLGFGA  1959 Runner Up------  1961 Third Place------  1965 Champions------  1967 Third Place------  1969 Runner Up------  1971 Third Place------  1973 Round 1------  1975 Champions------  1977 Runner Up------  1979 Third Place------  1981 Champions------  1983 Champions------  1985 Champions4310171  1987 Third Place421173  1989 Semi-Finals412153  1991 Runner Up4211102  1993 Champions6600186  1995 Champions6510192  1997 Champions6420153  1999 Champions6510241 Total Best: Champions40289311521Other HonoursKing's Cup: (1976, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1984, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 20002006, 2007)3 Nations in Taiwan: (1971)4 Nations Indo-China (Bangkok): (1989)Independence Cup (Indonesia): (1994)Brunei Games (1990)Top goalscorersAs of July 17, 2008PosPlayerGoalsTenure1Piyapong Piew-on1031981-19972Kiatisuk Senamuang651993-20073Niwat Srisawat551967-19794Jedsada Na Phatthalung421971-19815Vithoon Kijmongkolsak321985-19956Worrawoot Srimaka291996-19997Daoyod Dara281975-19868Sarayoot Chaikamdee262003-present9Suttha Sudsa-ard251978-unknown9Chalor Hongkajorn1979-19879Netipong Srithong-In1995-19979Therdsak Chaiman1997-200710Prapol Tantiyanon231971-unknown* The players in bold typeface are still active in football.Current squadLast Updated - 22nd June 2008 The following players were called up for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (against Oman on June 22 2008).NoNameDate of Birth (Age)ClubCaps (goals)Goalkeepers1Sivaruck Tedsungnoen1984|4|20Thailand BEC Tero Sasana4 (0)18Kosin Hathairattanakool1982|3|23Thailand Chonburi31 (0)Defenders2Suttinan Phuk-hom1987|11|29Thailand Chonburi1 (0)3Natthaphong Samana1984|6|29Thailand Chonburi11 (1)4Jetsada Jitsawad1980|8|5Thailand Thailand Tobacco Monopoly28 (0)5Prat Samakrat1985|10|31Thailand BEC Tero Sasana2 (1)6Nattaporn Phanrit1982|1|11Thailand Chonburi25 (2)12Niweat Siriwong1977|7|18Thailand BEC Tero Sasana84 (3)16Kiatprawut Saiwaeo1986|1|24England Manchester City9 (1)Midfielders7Arthit Sunthornpit1984|4|19Thailand Chonburi1 (0)8Chaiwut Wattana1981|7|14Thailand TOT5 (0)10c]])1971|12|13Thailand BEC Tero Sasana140 (20)14Tana Chanabut1984|6|6Thailand Coke-Bangpra8 (2)15Pichitphong Choeichiu1982|8|28Thailand Krung Thai Bank21 (2)Strikers9Sarayoot Chaikamdee1981|9|24Thailand Osotsapa35 (26)11Teerasil Dangda1988|6|6England Manchester City12 (5)13Anon Sangsanoi1984|1|3Thailand BEC Tero Sasana3 (1)17Sutee Suksomkit1978|6|5Singapore Tampines Rovers52 (12)Recent callupsNameDate of Birth (Age)ClubCaps (goals)Most recent callupGoalkeepersNarit Taweekul1983|10|30Thailand Thailand Tobacco Monopoly3 (0)Oman]], March 26, 2008DefendersSuree Sukha1982|7|27England Manchester City22 (1)Japan]], 14 June, 2008Patiparn Phetphun1980|9|25Thailand Bangkok University10 (2)Bahrain]], 2 June, 2008MidfieldersDatsakorn Thonglao1983|12|30Vietnam Hoang Anh Gia Lai47 (8)Japan]] on June 14, 2008Nirut Surasiang1979|2|20Vietnam Pisico Bình Ðịnh36 (4)Japan]] on June 14, 2008Suchao Nutnum1983|5|17Thailand TOT20 (4)Japan]] on June 14, 2008Rangsan Viwatchaichok1979|1|22Thailand Provincial Electricity Authority4 (0)Bahrain]] on June 7, 2008StrikersTeeratep Winothai1985|2|16Thailand BEC Tero Sasana  Lierse S.K.
