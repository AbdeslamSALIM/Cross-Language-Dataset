It is one of the smallest primates, and the smallest monkey, with its body length ranging from 14-16 cm (excluding the 15-20 cm tail). Males weigh around 140 g (5 ounces), and females only 120 g (4.2 ounces).Despite its name, the Pygmy Marmoset is somewhat different from the typical marmosets classified in genus Callithrix. As such, it is accorded its own subgenus, which was formerly recognized as its own genus, Cebuella.The Pygmy Marmoset has a tawny coat, and a ringed tail that can be as long as its body. Their claws are specially adapted for climbing trees, a trait unique to the species. They are omnivorous, feeding on fruit, leaves, insects, and sometimes even small reptiles. Their small weight allows them to reach the very highest leaves of a tree, and to exploit the otherwise little- used food sources there. Much of their diet, however, comes from tapping trees for sap. Up to two-thirds of their time is spent gouging tree bark to reach the gummy sap. The Pygmy Marmoset has specialized incisors for gouging holes in bark. Unfortunately, because of its small size, and its swift movements, it is very hard to observe in the wild.In captivity, the Pygmy Marmoset can live up to 11 years.There are two subspecies of the Pygmy Marmoset:Callithrix (Cebuella) pygmaea pygmaeaCallithrix (Cebuella) pygmaea niveiventrisReferencesExternal links ARKive - [http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Cebuella_pygmaea/ images and movies of the Pygmy marmoset (Cebuella pygmaea)]Video, Pictures and Information on Pygmy Marmosets[http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/pygmy_marmoset Primate Info Net Callithrix pygmaea Factsheet]Twin albino pygmy marmosets born in SwedenCallicebus molochCategory:New World monkeys Category:Mammals of South America Category:Mammals of Colombiaca:Callithrix pygmaea cs:Kosman zakrslý da:Dværgsilkeabe de:Zwergseidenäffchen es:Callithrix pygmaea fr:Ouistiti pygmée lt:Nykštukinė marmozetė hu:Törpe selyemmajom it:Callithrix pygmaea ms:Pigmi Marmoset nl:Dwergzijdeaapje ja:ピグミーマーモセット pl:Pigmejka pt:Sagüi-leãozinho ru:Карликовая игрунка fi:Kääpiömarmosetti sv:Dvärgsilkesapa tr:Cüce ipek maymunu zh:倭狨
