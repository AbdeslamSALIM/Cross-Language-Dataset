 | operating_system = Microsoft Windows | genre = Raster graphics editor / Vector graphics editor | license = Proprietary EULA | website = www.corel.com  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) is a raster graphics editor and, later in the series, a vector graphics editor for computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system that was originally published by Minneapolis-based Jasc Software. In October 2004, Corel Corporation purchased Jasc Software and the distribution rights to Paint Shop Pro. PSP functionality can be extended by Photoshop-compatible plugins. They are listed in the 'Effects' menu, below the built-in effects.HistoryOriginally called simply Paint Shop, the first version, 1.0, was released in early 1992. Paint Shop was originally distributed as shareware and is still available at many download sites (4.12 being a popular version). Newer versions are only available commercially. A key competitor is Adobe Photoshop, the commercial market leader in this category. Photoshop’s popularity is in part because Photoshop is available in an Apple Macintosh version, the platform widely used in the print publication industry, whereas Paint Shop Pro only runs on Microsoft platforms. While Photoshop is a popular piece of editing software, PSP is also widely used due to the lower price, and it was frequently called the "poor man's Photoshop." Corel announced, on November 28, 2007, that the office that created Paint Shop Pro would be shut down with development moved to offices in California and Taiwan.

Layer styles have been added, although these have been criticised by people as too basic.CriticismsPricing policyThere have been criticisms of Corel's pricing policy that pitches international versions at significantly higher prices than those charged in the US.Features - Critical Focus: Software pricing - it's an international rip-off - Digital Photography Now&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Unreliability and instabilityVersion XI, in its launch version of 11.00, was criticized for the number of bugs and also for the 'Organizer' function's high CPU usage. Some of the issues were addressed in the patch to version 11.11 but the Organizer continued to attract criticism. It remains problematic when working with large picture collections. The 'Organizer' issue has been fixed in version 11.20.Spyware allegationsVersions XI and X2 install a third party program named PSIService.exe, listed under Windows services as ProtexisLicensing. Written by Protexis, this runs in the background and collects licensing information. This program communicates with a remote host and is described in some posts as spyware. The Corel EULA does not reveal that installation of Version XI or X2 will result in the installation and continued background execution of this non-Corel program. Uninstalling XI will not uninstall PSIService.exe; and upon manually disabling the Protexis Licensing service, Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo will cease functioning, stating "This copy of Paint Shop Pro has been damaged or illegally modified. Please reinstall from your original source."Limited color depth supportThe latest version X2 has an incomplete implementation of 48-bit color. This color depth is limited to a handful of digital image correcting features, but not full-blown photo editing, where the real benefit can be realized. Updating to the latest version 12.01 will not provide full color depth support.Version 12.01 Release NotesSee alsoRaster graphics editorComparison of raster graphics editorsReferencesExternal linksOfficial siteTutorialsУроки Paint Shop ProCategory:Corel software Category:Raster graphics editors Category:Vector graphics editors Category:Technical communication tools Category:Photo softwarear:بينت شوب برو ca:Corel Paint Shop Pro de:Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo es:Paint Shop Pro fr:Corel Paint Shop Pro it:Corel Paint Shop Pro he:Paint Shop Pro hu:Corel Paint Shop Pro nl:Corel Paint Shop Pro ja:Corel Paint Shop Pro pl:Paint Shop Pro pt:Paint Shop Pro ru:Corel Paint Shop Pro fi:Paint Shop Pro sv:Paint Shop Pro tr:Paint Shop Pro zh:Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo
