, undergoing construction in 1971. Pioneer 10 and 11 are the most famous probes in the Pioneer program, the first probes to visit the outer planets, and the first to go beyond the orbit of Pluto]] ]] The US Pioneer program of unmanned space missions was designed for planetary exploration. There were a number of such missions in the program, but the most notable were Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, which explored the outer planets and left the solar system. Both carry a golden plaque, depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, should any extraterrestrials find them someday.Credit for naming the first probe has been attributed to Stephen A. Saliga, who had been assigned to the Air Force Orientation Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, as chief designer of Air Force exhibits. While he was at a briefing, the spacecraft was described to him as a "lunar-orbiting vehicle with an infrared scanning device." Saliga thought the title too long and lacked theme for an exhibit design. He suggested "Pioneer" as the name of the probe since "the Army had already launched and orbited the Explorer satellite and their Public Information Office was identifying the Army as 'Pioneers in Space,'" and by adopting the name the Air Force would "make a 'quantum jump' as to who really were the 'Pioneers in space.'" Early Pioneer missionsThe earliest missions were attempts to achieve Earth's escape velocity, simply to show it was feasible and study the Moon. This included the first launch by NASA which was formed from the old NACA. These missions were carried out by the US Air Force and Army.[[Able space probes]] (1958-1960)Most missions here are listed with their most recognised name, and alternate names after in brackets.Pioneer 0 (Thor-Able 1, Pioneer) - Lunar orbiter, destroyed (Thor failure 77 seconds after launch) August 17, 1958Pioneer 1 (Thor-Able 2, Pioneer I) - Lunar orbiter, missed Moon (third stage partial failure) October 11, 1958Pioneer 2 (Thor-Able 3, Pioneer II) - Lunar orbiter, reentry (third stage failure) November 8, 1958Pioneer P-1 (Atlas-Able 4A, Pioneer W), probe lost September 1959Pioneer P-3 (Atlas-Able 4, Atlas-Able 4B, Pioneer X) - Lunar probe, lost in launcher failure December 1959Pioneer 5 (Pioneer P-2, Thor-Able 4, Pioneer V) - interplanetary space between Earth and Venus, launched March 11, 1960Pioneer P-30 (Atlas-Able 5A, Pioneer Y) - Lunar probe, failed to achieve lunar orbit September 1960Pioneer P-31 (Atlas-Able 5B, Pioneer Z) - Lunar probe, lost in upper stage failure December 1960Juno II lunar probes (1958-1959)Pioneer 3 - Lunar flyby, missed Moon due to launcher failure December 1958Pioneer 4 - Lunar flyby, achieved Earth escape velocity, launched March 1959Later Pioneer missions (1965-1978)Five years after the early Able space probe missions ended, NASA Ames Research Center used the Pioneer name for a new series of missions, initially aimed at the inner solar system, before the bold flyby missions to Jupiter and Saturn. While successful, the missions returned much poorer images than the Voyagers five years later. In 1978, the end of the program saw a return to the inner solar system, with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe, this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.The new missions were numbered from Pioneer 6 (Alternate names in brackets).[[Pioneer 6, 7, 8 and 9]] - interplanetary space &quot;weather network&quot;Pioneer 6 (Pioneer A) - launched December 1965Pioneer 7 (Pioneer B) - launched August 1966Pioneer 8 (Pioneer C) - launched December 1967Pioneer 9 (Pioneer D) - launched November 1968 (defunct. since 1983)Pioneer E - lost in launcher failure August 1969Pioneer 6 and Pioneer 9 are in solar orbits with 0.8 AU's distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than Earth's. Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are in solar orbits with 1.1 AU's distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than Earth's. Because they orbit the Sun on either side of the Earth's orbital path, some of them are, from time to time, 180° away from Earth. They can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun's rotation reveals it to ground based/earth orbiting observatories. If a powerful solar magnetic storm is born, they can warn Earth in advance.[[Outer solar system missions]]Pioneer 10 (Pioneer F) - Jupiter, interstellar space, launched March 1972Pioneer 11 (Pioneer G) - Jupiter, Saturn, interstellar space, launched April 1973Pioneer H - identical to Pioneers 10 and 11, but never launched[[Pioneer Venus project]]Pioneer Venus Orbiter (Pioneer Venus 1, Pioneer 12) - launched December 1978Pioneer Venus Multiprobe (Pioneer Venus 2, Pioneer 13) - launched August 1978Pioneer Venus Probe Bus - transport vehicle and upper atmosphere probePioneer Venus Large Probe - 300 kg parachuted probePioneer Venus North Probe - 75 kg parachuted probePioneer Venus Night Probe - 75 kg parachuted probePioneer Venus Day Probe - 75 kg parachuted probeSee alsoPioneer anomalyTimeline of Planetary ExplorationAble space probesExternal linksPioneer Program home pagePioneer (Moon) Program Page by NASA's Solar System Exploration[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309090504/html/ Mark Wolverton's The Depths of Space online]Thor Able - Encyclopedia AstronauticaPioneer 10 &amp; 11 AbstractReferences  Category:1958 in space exploration Category:Pioneer program Category:Radio frequency propagation Category:NASA programsbg:Пионер (програма) ca:Programa Pioneer cs:Program Pioneer da:Pioneer-programmet de:Pioneer (Raumsonden-Programm) es:Programa Pioneer fr:Programme Pioneer ko:파이어니어 계획 it:Programma Pioneer hu:Pioneer-program nl:Pioneerprogramma ja:パイオニア計画 pl:Program Pioneer pt:Programa Pioneer ro:Programul Pioneer ru:Пионер (программа) sk:Program Pioneer sv:Pioneerprogrammet ta:பயனியர் திட்டம்
