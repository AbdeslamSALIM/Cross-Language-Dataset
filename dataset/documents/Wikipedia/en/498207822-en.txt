In the 12th century, Wesel came into the possession of the Duke of Cleves. The city was given extensive privileges and became a member of the Hanseatic League during the 15th century. Within the Duchy of Cleves, Wesel was second only to Cologne in the lower Rhine region as an entrepôt. It was an important commercial centre: a clearing station for the transshipment and trading of goods.Wesel was inherited by the Hohenzollerns of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1609. Friedrich Wilhelm von Dossow was the Prussian Governor of Wesel during the 18th century. The city became part of the Prussian Rhine Province after the Napoleonic Wars.During World War II, Wesel became a target of the Allies particularly in its capacity as a strategic depot. On the 16, 17 and 19 February 1945, the town was attacked with impact and air-burst weapons and almost entirely destroyed. The Rhine and Lippe bridges were blown by the Wehrmacht; among others, on 10 March, the 1,950m long railway bridge, the last Rhine bridge remaining in German hands. On 23 March, Wesel came under the fire of over 3,000 guns when it was bombarded anew, in preparation for Operation Plunder. 97% of the town was destroyed before it was finally taken by Allied troops and the population had fallen from almost 25,000 in 1939 to 1,900 in May 1945.RAF campaign diary March 1944 — see the entry for March 23 – 24 March 1945.Wesel became part of the new state North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946 after the war.PoliticsWesel's mayors:1808–1814: Johann Hermann Westermann1814–1840: Christian Adolphi1841–1862: Franz Luck1863–1870: Wilhelm Otto van Calker1870–1881: Carl Friedrich August von Albert1881–1891: Caspar Baur1891–1902: Josef Fluthgraf (1896 Oberbürgermeister)1903–1931: Ludwig Poppelbaum1931–1933: Emil Nohl1933–1945: Otto BorgersSince 1945:1945: Jean Groos1945: Wilhelm Groos1946–1947: Anton Ebert (CDU)1947–1948: Paul Körner (CDU)1948–1952: Ewald Fournell (CDU)1952–1956: Helmut Berckel (CDU)1956–1966: Kurt Kräcker (SPD)1967–1969: Willi Nakaten (SPD)1969–1979: Günther Detert (CDU)1979–1984: Wilhelm Schneider (SPD)1984–1989: Volker Haubitz (CDU)1989–1994: Wilhelm Schneider (SPD)1994–1999: Bernhard Gründken (SPD)1999–2004: Jörn Schroh (CDU)since 2004: Ulrike Westkamp (SPD)Twin towns Hagerstown, Maryland, United States Felixstowe, United Kingdom Kętrzyn, Poland Salzwedel, Saxony-Anhalt, GermanyBuildings and places of interest in WeselBerliner TorWillibrordi-Dom (Cathedral)Zitadelle Wesel (Citadel)Broadcasting Mast Wesel, one of Germany's tallest constructionsPeople born in WeselJan Joest (1455–1519), painterHans Lipperhey (1550–1619), Inventor of the telescopePeregrine Bertie, 12th Baron Willoughby de Eresby (1555–1601), English diplomat and soldierPeter Minuit (1580–1641), Founder of New Amsterdam, which later became New York CityJohann Friedrich Welsch (1796–1871), painterKonrad Duden (1829–1911), Author of the first DudenFriedrich Geselschap (1835–98), painterIda Tacke (1896–1978), Discover with her husband Walter Noddack the chemical elements rhenium and technetiumJoachim von Ribbentrop (1893–1946), Foreign minister of Nazi Germany from 1938–45Dieter Nuhr (1960– ), ComedianMartin Bambauer (1979– ), Church musicianMalek Osmane (1979– ), Tech Services ScientistMiscellaneousOne of Germany's highest radio masts is situated in the district of Büderich on the left bank of the Rhine.
