The population was 116,278 according to the 2000 census (2007 population estimates put the city at 124,818). Columbia is the county seat of Richland County, but a small portion of the city extends into Lexington County. The city is the center of a steadily growing metro area of 716,030. The city's name comes from a poetic synonym for America, derived from the name of Christopher Columbus.Located just  northwest of South Carolina's geographic center, Columbia is the primary city of the Midlands region of South Carolina, which comprises several counties in the central portion of the state. As such it is centrally located to the rest of the state. Founded in 1786 as the site of South Carolina's new capital city, it was one of the first planned cities in the United States. The area is often cited for its high quality of life offerings, with its many cultural amenities, parks, and recreational features. At the confluence of two major rivers, Columbia is one of the best destinations in the country for kayak and canoe enthusiasts. It is also known for its large number of independent theater groups. Columbia was recently one of 30 communities named "America's Most Livable Communities." The award was given by the Washington-based non-profit Partners for Livable Communities and honors communities that are developing themselves in the creative economy. Columbia has also been named a top midsized market for relocating families in the nation.http://www.primacy.com/resources/PRIM-5472.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, Columbia is becoming recognized as an ideal city for retirees.

The Congarees, a frontier fort on the west bank of the Congaree River, was the head of navigation in the Santee River system. A ferry was established by the colonial government in 1754 to connect the fort with the growing settlements on the higher ground on the east bank.Like many other significant early settlements in colonial America, Columbia is on the fall line from the Appalachian Mountains. The fall line is the spot where rivers usually become unnavigable when sailing upstream, and is also the spot farthest downstream where falling water can usefully power a mill.State Senator John Lewis Gervais of Ninety Six introduced a bill that was approved by the legislature on March 22, 1786 to create a new state capital. There was considerable argument over the name for the new city. According to published accounts, Senator Gervais said he hoped that "in this town we should find refuge under the wings of COLUMBIA," for that was the name which he wished it to be called. One legislator insisted on the name Washington, but Columbia won out by a vote of 11-7 in the state senate.The site was chosen as the new state capital in 1786, due to its central location in the state. The State Legislature first met there in 1790. After remaining under the direct government of the legislature for the first two decades of its existence, Columbia was incorporated as a village in 1805 and then as a city in 1854.  Columbia received a large stimulus to development when it was connected in a direct water route to Charleston, by the Santee Canal. This canal connected the Santee and Cooper Rivers in a  section. It was first chartered in 1786 and completed in 1800, making it one of the earliest canals in the United States. With increased railroad traffic, it ceased operation around 1850.The commissioners designed a town of 400 blocks in a two-mile (3 km) square along the river. The blocks were divided into half-acre lots and sold to speculators and prospective residents. Buyers had to build a house at least  long and  wide within three years or face an annual 5% penalty. The perimeter streets and two through streets were  wide. The remaining squares were divided by thoroughfares  wide. The width was determined by the belief that dangerous and pesky mosquitoes could not fly more than  without dying of starvation along the way. Columbians still enjoy most of the magnificent network of wide streets.The commissioners comprised the local government until 1797 when a Commission of Streets and Markets was created by the General Assembly. Three main issues occupied most of their time: public drunkenness, gambling, and poor sanitation.As one of the first planned cities in the United States, Columbia began to grow rapidly. Its population was nearing 1,000 shortly after the turn of the century.Nineteenth centuryIn 1801, South Carolina College (now known as the University of South Carolina) was founded in Columbia. The city was chosen as the site of the institution in part to unite the state's citizens in the upcountry and the lowcountry. Also, the leaders of South Carolina wished to personally monitor the progress and development of the school. For many years after its founding, commencement exercises were held in December while the state legislature was in session.Columbia received its first charter as a town in 1805. An intendant and six wardens would govern the town. John Taylor was the first elected intendant. He later served in both houses of the General Assembly, both houses of Congress and eventually as governor of the state. By 1816, there were 250 homes in the town and a population over 1,000.Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, they had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, as throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. Railroad transportation served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s were first and foremost interested in transporting cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was the lifeblood of the Columbia community, as in 1850, directly or indirectly, virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.Columbia's First Baptist Church hosted the South Carolina Secession Convention on December 17, 1860. The delegates drafted a resolution in favor of secession without dissent, 159-0. Columbia's location made it an ideal location for other conventions and meetings within the Confederacy. During the Civil War, bankers, railroad executives, teachers, and theologians from several states met in the city from time to time to discuss certain matters.On February 17, 1865, during the Civil War, much of Columbia was destroyed by fire while being occupied by Union troops under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman. Legend has it, Columbia's First Baptist Church missed by a hair from being torched by Sherman's troops. As the story goes, the soldiers marched up to the church and asked the grounds keeper if he could direct them to the location of the church where the declaration of secession was signed. The loyal grounds keeper directed the men to another church, a Methodist church, located nearby; thus, the historic landmark avoided being destroyed by Union soldiers.Controversy surrounding the burning of the city started soon after the war ended. General Sherman blamed the high winds and retreating Confederate soldiers for firing bales of cotton, which had been stacked in the streets. General Sherman denied ordering the burning, though he did order militarily significant structures, such as the Confederate Printing Plant, destroyed. Firsthand accounts by local residents, Union soldiers, and a newspaper reporter offer a tale of revenge by Union troops for Columbia's and South Carolina's pivotal role in leading Southern states to secede from the Union, whereas other accounts (as documented in, for example, James W. Loewen's Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong) portray it as mostly the fault of the Confederacy. Today, tourists can follow the path General Sherman's army took to enter the city and see structures or remnants of structures that survived the fire.During Reconstruction, Columbia became the focus of considerable attention. Reporters, journalists, travelers, and tourists flocked to South Carolina's capital city to witness a Southern state legislature whose members included ex-slaves. The city also made somewhat of a rebound following the devastating fire of 1865; a mild construction boom took place within the first few years of Reconstruction, and repair of railroad tracks in outlying areas created jobs for area citizens. Twentieth centuryThe first few years of the 20th century saw Columbia emerge as a regional textile manufacturing center. In 1907, Columbia had six mills in operation: Richland, Granby, Olympia Mills, Capital City, Columbia, and Palmetto. Combined, they employed over 3,400 workers with an annual payroll of $819,000, giving the Midlands an economic boost of over $4.8 million.Columbia had no paved streets until 1908, when 17 blocks of Main Street were surfaced. There were, however, 115 publicly maintained street crossings at intersections to keep pedestrians from having to wade through a sea of mud between wooden sidewalks. As an experiment, Washington Street was once paved with wooden blocks. This proved to be the source of much local amusement when they buckled and floated away during heavy rains. The blocks were replaced with asphalt paving in 1925.The years 1911-1912 were something of a construction boom for Columbia, with $2.5 million worth of construction occurring in the city. These projects included the Union Bank Building at Main and Gervais, the Palmetto National Bank, a shopping arcade, and large hotels at Main and Laurel (the Jefferson) and at Main and Wheat (the Gresham).In 1917, the city was selected as the site of Camp Jackson, a U.S. military installation which was officially classified as a "Field Artillery Replacement Depot." The first recruits arrived at the camp on September 1, 1917.In 1930, Columbia was the hub of a trading area with approximately 500,000 potential customers. It had 803 retail establishments, 280 of them being food stores. There were also 58 clothing and apparel outlets, 57 restaurants and lunch rooms, 55 filling stations, 38 pharmacies, 20 furniture stores, 19 auto dealers, 11 shoe stores, nine cigar stands, five department stores, and one book store. Wholesale distributors located within the city numbered 119, with one-third of them dealing in food.In 1934, the federal courthouse at the corner of Main and Laurel streets was purchased by the city for use as City Hall. Built of granite from nearby Winnsboro, Columbia City Hall is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Designed by Alfred Bult Millet, President Ulysses S. Grant's Federal architect, the building was completed in 1876. Millet, best known for his design of the Executive Office Building in Washington, D.C., had originally designed the building with a clock tower. Large cost overruns probably caused it to be left out. Copies of Mullet's original drawings can be seen on the walls of City Hall alongside historic photos of Columbia's beginnings.Reactivated Camp Jackson became Fort Jackson in 1940, giving the military installation the permanence desired by city leaders at the time. The fort was annexed into the city in the fall of 1968, with approval from the Pentagon.In the early 1940s, shortly after the attacks on Pearl Harbor which began America's involvement in World War II, Lt. Colonel Jimmy Doolittle and his group of now-famous pilots began training for the Doolittle Raid over Tokyo at what is now Columbia Metropolitan Airport.http://www.columbiasouthcarolina.com/airport.html They trained in B-25 Mitchell bombers, the same model as the plane that now rests at Columbia's Owens Field in the Curtiss-Wright hangar.South Columbia Development Corporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The 1940s saw the beginning of efforts to reverse Jim Crow laws and racial discrimination in Columbia. In 1945, a federal judge ruled that the city's black teachers were entitled to equal pay to that of their white counterparts. However, in years following, the state attempted to strip many blacks of their teaching credentials. Other issues in which the blacks of the city sought equality concerned voting rights and segregation (particularly regarding public schools). On August 21, 1962, eight downtown chain stores served blacks at their lunch counters for the first time. The University of South Carolina admitted its first black students in 1963; around the same time, many vestiges of segregation began to disappear from the city, blacks attained membership on various municipal boards and commissions, and a non-discriminatory hiring policy was adopted by the city. These and other such signs of racial progression helped earn the city the 1964 All-America City Award for the second time (the first being in 1951) and a 1965 article in Newsweek magazine lauded Columbia as a city that had "liberated itself from the plague of doctrinal apartheid."The area's population continued to grow during the 1950s, having experienced a 40% increase from 186,844 to 260,828, with 97,433 people residing within the city limits of Columbia.Historic preservation has played a significant part into shaping Columbia into the city that it is today. The historic Robert Mills House was restored in 1967, which inspired the renovation and restoration of other historic structures such as the Hampton-Preston House and homes associated with President Woodrow Wilson, Maxcy Gregg, Mary Boykin Chestnut, and noted free black Celia Mann. In the early 1970s, the University of South Carolina initiated the refurbishment of its "Horseshoe." Several area museums also benefited from the increased historical interest of that time, among them the Fort Jackson Museum, the McKissick Museum on the campus of the University of South Carolina, and most notably the South Carolina State Museum, which opened in 1988.Mayor Kirkman Finlay, Jr. was the driving force behind the refurbishment of Seaboard Park, now known as Finlay Park, in the historic Congaree Vista district, as well as the compilation of the $60 million Palmetto Center package, which gave Columbia a distinctive office tower, parking garage, and the Columbia Marriott which opened in 1983.The year 1980 saw the Columbia metropolitan population reach 410,088 and in 1990 this figure had hit approximately 470,000. The city continues to focus on improving the great quality of life of its citizens and further diversifying the local economy, which will continue to bring growth and vitality for many years to come.Recent historyThe 1990s and early 2000s also saw revitalization in the downtown area. The Congaree Vista district along Gervais Street, once known as a warehouse district, became a thriving district of art galleries, shops, and restaurants. The Colonial Life Arena (formerly known as the Carolina Center) opened in 2002, and brought several big-named concerts and shows to Columbia. The Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center opened in 2004, and a new convention center hotel opened in September 2007. Several residential developments are also in the works for the Vista.Some have suggested the redevelopment efforts by the city have not been universally well received and have not brought the numbers of people back downtown as expected; however, in recent years, thanks to aggressive renovation and construction efforts by the private sector, increasing numbers are moving downtown. Several notable historic downtown Columbia buildings have been converted into apartments and condos, while other downtown offerings are housed in entirely new buildings.Geography and Climateas seen from the junction of Interstates 77 and 26]]Columbia is located at 34°1'1" North, 81°0'38" West (34.017105, -81.010759) 1. Autumn, winter and spring are mild, with occasional winter nights below freezing but rarely extended cold. The city is at its most beautiful in the spring when masses of azaleas and other spring flowers bloom. Columbia's summers can be very hot, being primarily recognized for their extreme humidity. The city, like other cities of the southeast, is prone to Inversions, which trap ozone and other pollutants over the area. One of Columbia's most interesting geographical features is its fall line, which is a boundary between an upland region and a coastal plain across which rivers from the upland region drop to the plain as falls or rapids. Columbia grew up at the fall line of the Congaree River, which is formed by the convergence of the Broad River and the Saluda River. The Congaree was the farthest inland point of river navigation. The energy of falling water also powered Columbia's early mills. The city has capitalized on this scenic location which includes three rivers by recently christening itself "The Columbia Riverbanks Region."According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 127.7&nbsp;square miles (330.8&nbsp;km²), of which, 125.2&nbsp;square miles (324.3&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 2.5&nbsp;square miles (6.4&nbsp;km²) of it is water. The total area is 1.95% water. Metropolitan areaThe metropolitan statistical area of Columbia has a population estimate of 716,030, according to the 2007 estimates performed by the U.S. Census Bureau.In Census 2000, the population for the then two-county metropolitan area (Richland and Lexington) was 536,691, of which about 78% was within the Columbia urbanized area proper (2000 pop.: 420,537). In June 2003, the United States Census Bureau added four more counties — Fairfield, Calhoun, Kershaw, and Saluda — to Columbia's standard metropolitan statistical area, giving its total population a significant boost. It now ranks as the largest in South Carolina.Further, the Columbia metropolitan area with the Newberry micropolitan area forms the Columbia&ndash;Newberry Combined Statistical Area which has 753,663 people from 2007 census estimates.Columbia's metropolitan counties include:Richland CountyLexington CountyFairfield CountyCalhoun CountyKershaw CountySaluda CountyColumbia's largest suburbs and environs presently are: St. Andrews, Richland County: Pop. 21,814 (unincorporated)Seven Oaks, Lexington County: Pop. 15,755 (unincorporated)Lexington: Pop. 14,329Dentsville, Richland County: Pop. 13,009 (unincorporated)West Columbia: Pop. 13,064Cayce: Pop. 12,150Irmo: Pop. 11,039Forest Acres: Pop. 10,908Woodfield, Richland County: Pop. 9,238 (unincorporated)Red Bank, Lexington County: Pop. 8,811 (unincorporated)Oak Grove, Lexington County: Pop. 8,183 (unincorporated)Camden: Pop. 6,682Lugoff, Kershaw County: Pop. 6,278 (unincorporated)Military BasesFort JacksonFort Jackson is the US Army's largest training base.McEntire Joint National Guard StationUnder command of the South Carolina Air National Guard.InfrastructureMunicipal government and politicsThe city of Columbia has a council-manager form of government. The mayor and city council are elected every four years, with no term limits, elections are held in the Spring of even numbered years. Unlike other mayors in council-manager systems, Columbia mayor has the power to veto ordinances passed by the council; vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the council. The council appoints a city manager to serve as chief administrative officer. Charles P. Austin, Sr is the current city manager.The current mayor of Columbia is Bob Coble. Coble has served as mayor since his election in 1990 .Coble, was elected to his fifth term as mayor on April 4, 2006; and is the city's longest serving mayor. Columbia holds elections for mayor every four years, with the next election in 2010; there are no term limits.The city council consists of 6 members (4 from districts and 2 at-large). While the city council is responsible for making policies and enacting laws, rules and regulations in order to provide for future community and economic growth. Additionally, the council provides the necessary support for the orderly and efficient operation of city services.  At-LargeTameika Isaac DevineDaniel J. RickenmannDistricts1: Sam Davis2: E.W.

The airport itself is serviced by American Eagle, Continental, Delta, Northwest, United, Spirit Airlines, and US Airways airlines and is the fourth busiest airport in South Carolina, following Charleston, Greenville/Spartanburg and Myrtle Beach.Columbia benefits from an excellent interstate highway system, with three interstates— I-26, I-77, and I-20— forming an outer loop around the city. Other major highways include I-126, U.S. 1, U.S. 21, U.S. 76, U.S. 176, U.S. 321, U.S. 378, and S.C. Highway 277.The city also has an Amtrak station, with the Silver Star trains connecting Columbia with New York City, Washington, DC, Savannah, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa, and Miami.Regional bus transportation is provided by the Central Midlands Regional Transit Authority (CMRTA), which serves the greater Columbia area including Cayce, West Columbia, Forest Acres, Arcadia Lakes, Springdale, and the St. Andrews area. The authority was established in October 2002.Greyhound Lines operates a station on Gervais Street, in the eastern part of downtown, providing Columbia with intercity bus transportation.Downtown revitalizationThe city of Columbia has recently accomplished a number of redevelopment projects and has several more planned. The historic Congaree Vista, a  district running from downtown toward the Congaree river, features a number of historic buildings that have been rehabilitated. Of note is the adaptive reuse of the Confederate Printing Plant on Gervais and Huger, used to print Confederate bills during the American Civil War. The city cooperated with Publix grocery stores to preserve the look, and now Columbia is one of a handful of cities in the Southeast with a full-service market in its downtown. This won Columbia an award from the International Downtown Association. The Vista district is also where a new convention center Hilton and a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse recently debuted. Other notable developments planned include high-end condos and townhomes, hotels, mixed-use structures, and the establishment of a retail corridor along Lady Street.The older buildings lining the Vista's main drag, Gervais, now house art galleries, restaurants, unique shops, and professional office space. Near the end of Gervais is the South Carolina State Museum, and the Colonial Center adds to the draw as it is just a few blocks away. Private student housing and some residential projects are going up nearby; the CanalSide developmenthttp://www.CanalSideColumbia.com, at the site of the old Central Correctional Institution, is the most high profile. The development will have 750 residential units and provide access to Columbia's waterfront.The next few years should see the University of South Carolina's research campus, dubbed "Innovista"research campus, stretch from the university across the historic Congaree Vista district on over . The project demolished a piece of the city skyline: the old university visitors center Carolina Plaza, which was 14 stories. In its place the university is building a multi-use second campus which will not only provide space for university-sponsored research, but will rent some out to private residents, private research firms, and a few shops. The university touts the project of an example of its ongoing "private-public" partnership with the city. Lady Street between Huger and Assembly streets in the Vista and the Five Points neighborhood have undergone beautification projects, which mainly consisted of replacing curbs and gutters, adding brick-paved sidewalks, and angled parking. Special efforts are being aimed at Main Street, which was once the center of the city's activity but remains dormant after retailers and shoppers left for suburban malls. The goal is to re-establish Main Street as a vibrant commercial and residential corridor. The streetscapings, along Main Street and in Five Points in particular, have taken their toll among local businesses located there, some of which were forced to close during the refurbishing -- &mdash;and local favorite Sherlock Holmes Pub on Main Street&mdash;actually went out of business. In spite of this, a majority of business owners on Main Street believe that the streetscaping represents a positive aspect of the city's evolution. Notable developments under construction along Main Street include a 17-story, $60 million tower at the high-profile corner of Main and Gervais streets, the second phase of the streetscaping project between Hampton and Laurel streets, and the refurbished McCrory building, which will be a mixed-use development including condos, restaurants, and office space. Planned developments include a new sanctuary for the Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church, the relocation of the Nickelodeon theater, and the renovation of the 1441 Main Street office building into Wachovia's new Midlands headquarters.The Meridian building, a 17-story, $62 million office tower was completed in 2004 and First Citizens bank, which is the second-largest state-based bank, completed a $40 million, , 9-story headquarters tower at the corner of Main and Lady streets in 2006.

The state of South Carolina has plans to sell the site, a huge opportunity for Columbia. The city's proposal is a hallmark of new urbanism, the architectural movement that focuses on higher-density residential development interspersed with green space, offices and retail. For this future development, 1,200 residential units and over  of retail and office space are planned. The new Bull Street neighborhood also would feature a “town center” of stores and shops near its main entrance at Bull Street and Elmwood Avenue. This project is expected to have a rather significant economic impact on the city of Columbia--something unlike the city has seen within the past 50 years, according to the Central Carolina Community Foundation's Bull Street Committee. This committee was formed by request of both city and state government to create a plan for the land use. The Community Foundation held public forums to get the community's feedback as to what would best serve the community. In February 2006, the Community Foundation turned over the completed plan to the city and the State Housing Finance and Development Authority.

The park fell into disrepair after the Civil War and served as a site for commercial ventures until the late 1900s. In 1990, the park was reopened and has become a beautiful diamond in the downtown area, offering a green oasis in contrast to the glass, asphalt and concrete in the urban environment. It serves as the site for such events as Kids Day, The Summer Concert Series, plus many more activities. In 1992, the park was renamed Finlay Park, in honor of Kirkman Finlay, a past mayor of Columbia who had a vision to reenergize the historic Congaree Vista district, between Main Street and the river, and recreate the beautiful site that was formerly known as Sidney Park.  Memorial Park is a four-acre tract of land in the Congaree Vista between Main Street and the river. The property is bordered by Hampton, Gadsden, Washington, and Wayne Streets and is one block south of Finlay Park.

The park features a beautiful water sculpture and a community center. An integral element of the park is the Stone of Hope monument, unveiled in January 1996. Upon the monument is inscribed a portion of King's 1964 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech: "History is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued that self-defeating path of hate. Love is the key to the solutions of the problems of the world."One of Columbia's greatest assets is Riverbanks Zoo &amp; Garden.

Evidence of their craftsmanship is still present today.In November 1996, the River Alliance proposed that a  linear park system be created to link people to their rivers. This was named the Three Rivers Greenway, and the $18 million estimated cost was agreed to by member governments (the cities of Cayce, Columbia, and West Columbia) with the proviso that the Alliance recommend an acceptable funding strategy.While the funding process was underway, an existing city of Columbia site located on the Congaree River offered an opportunity to be a pilot project for the Three Rivers Greenway. The Alliance was asked to design and permit for construction by a general contractor this component. This approximately one-half mile segment of the system was opened in November 1998. It is complete with  wide concrete pathways, vandal-proof lighting, trash receptacles, water fountains, picnic benches, overlooks, bank fishing access, canoe/kayak access, a public restroom and parking. These set the standards for the common elements in the rest of the system. Eventually, pathways will run from Granby to the Riverbanks Zoo. Boaters, sportsmen, fishermen will have access to the area, and additional recreational uses are being planned along the miles of riverfront.Running beside the historic Columbia Canal, Riverfront Park hosts a two and a half mile trail.

The facility is known for hosting diverse events, from The State of the State Address to the South Carolina Body Building Championship and the South Carolina Science Fair.The Carolina Coliseum, which opened in 1968, used to be a 12,400-seat facility which initially served as the home of the USC Gamecocks' basketball teams. The arena could be easily adapted to serve other entertainment purposes, including concerts, car shows, circuses, ice shows, and other popular events. The versatility and quality of the Coliseum at one time allowed the University to use the facility for performing arts events such as the Boston Pops, Chicago Symphony, Feld Ballet and other performances by important artists. An acoustical shell and a state-of-the-art lighting system assisted the Coliseum in presenting such activities. The Coliseum was the home of the Columbia Inferno, an ECHL team. However, since the construction of the Colonial Life Arena in 2002, the Coliseum is no longer used for basketball and has been converted into classroom space and now serves as the home to the School of Journalism as well as the School for Hospitality, Retail and Tourism Management.The Township Auditorium seats 3,200 persons and is located in downtown Columbia.
