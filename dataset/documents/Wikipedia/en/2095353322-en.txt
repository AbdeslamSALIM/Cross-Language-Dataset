The population is (2001) 25,151(town); 30,025 (commune).HistoryVentimiglia is the ancient Albium Intemelium, the capital of the Intemelii, a Ligurian tribe which long resisted the Romans, but was forced in 115 BC to submit to Scaurus. In 69 the city was sacked by the army of Otho and Vitellius but recovered to remain prosperous into the fifth century, surrounded by walls with cylindrical towers built at each change of direction.In the Gothic Wars it was besieged by the Byzantines and the Goths, and later suffered from the raids of Rothari, King of the Lombards, but flourished again under Rodoald. In the tenth century it was attacked by the Saracens of Frassinetto.Berengar II of Italy made his son Conrad first Count of Ventimiglia. In 1139 the Genoese attacked it by land and sea and forced it to surrender; the count continued to hold the city and countship as a vassal of the victors. The city rebelled more than once against the Genoese and sided with their enemies. In 1271 in a war with Genoa its podestà Luca Grimaldi was captured. Ventimiglia was thus temporarily held by the dukes of Savoy (1389 and 1746) and King Ladislas of Naples (1410). In general it shared the fortunes of Genoa.Ecclesiastical historyThe most ancient Christian mention of Ventimiglia is the reported preaching of Saint Marcelinus (Bishop of Embrun), Saint Vincentius and Saint Dominus (fourth century).It is probable that it had a bishop from the fifth century; the first known is Joannes (680). Among his successors were: Cardinal Antonio Pallavicino (1484) and Alessandro Fregoso; Filippo de'Mari (1519), who restored ecclesiastical discipline; Carlo Visconti (1561), later a cardinal; Carlo Grimaldo (1565), who distinguished himself at the Council of Trent; Girolamo Curlo (1614), who died by poison in Corsica, whither he had been sent as Commissary Apostolic; Gianfrancesco Gandolfi (1622), who negotiated the peace between Savoy and Genoa; Antonio Maria Bacigaluppi (1773), who converted the episcopal residence into a seminary.The diocese has been suffragan to Genoa since 1775.Main sightsRemains of a Roman theatre (first half of the 2nd century) are visible, and remains of many other buildings have been discovered, among them traces of the ancient city walls, a fine mosaic, found in 1852 but at once destroyed, and a number of tombs to the west of the theatre. The ruins of the ancient Albintimilium are situated in the plain of Nervia,  to the east of the modern town.The caves of the '''Balzi Rossi '''have proved rich in palaeolithic remains of the Quaternary period. Rests of a family of Cro-Magnon men were discovered, with three skeletons belonging to a man, a woman and a child respectively. Very important architecturally and historically is the ancient medieval city centre, perched on a hill overlooking the new town.Not to be forgotten are the Giardini Botanici Hanbury (Hanbury Botanical Gardens) surrounding the splendid Villa of Sir Thomas Hanbury, La Mortola. These botanical gardens are the biggest in Italy and among the finest in Europe, boasting many varieties of tropical and sub-tropical species that thrive in this mild climate.The Church of San Michele is erected on the foundations of a pagan temple.The present Romanesque Cathedral, with a fifth-century baptistery, is built on the ruins of an earlier Lombard church, and this again on a Roman building, possibly a temple.The city is also home to a municipal Library hosting the second largest collection of manuscripts and books written during the 17th century in Italy (the biggest collection is in Venice).TourismVentimiglia is a popular destination during the summer for tourists spending their vacation along the French Riviera. Particularly popular all year with visitors from France is the Friday street market, which takes place along the seafront of the new town, and is a cause of major traffic congestion. The surprising Hanbury Botanical Gardens, established by a scion of a leading family of English industrialists in the nineteenth century, can be found some five kilometers to the west, just short of the French frontier.SourcesExternal links Official websitehttp://www.elinguaconsulting.com/ventimiglia_liguria.htm Further description and pictures of Ventimiglia and surroundings][http://icarus.umkc.edu/sandbox/perseus/pecs/page.152.a.php Richard Stillwell, ed.
