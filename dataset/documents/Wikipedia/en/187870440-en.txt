   A cohort (from the Latin cohors, plural cohortes) is a fairly large military unit, generally consisting of one type of soldier.Military cohortOriginally, the cohort was a sub-unit of a Roman legion, usually consisting of 480 legionaries including six centurions. The cohort itself was divided into six centuries of 80 men commanded each by a centurion. However, the first of ten cohorts had five double-sized centuries totaling 800 men.Various terms described precise types of military cohorts:In the Imperial Roman praetorian forces, there were individual cohorts with an establishment strength of 500 (cohors quingenaria) or of 1000 (cohors milliaria), as well as mixed infantry and cavalry units (cohors equitata) that existed in parallel.Various terms describe precise types of auxiliary cohorts:Cohors alaria: allied or auxiliary unit.Cohors classica: auxiliary unit originally formed of sailors and marines.Cohors equitata (LA): unit of auxiliary infantry with attached mounted squadrons.Cohors peditata (LA): infantry unit.Cohors speculatorum (LA): guard unit of Mark Antony composed of scouts.Cohors torquata (LA): auxiliary unit granted a torques (military decoration).Cohors tumultuaria (from tumultus, "chaos"): irregular auxiliary unit.Other Roman cohortsSome paramilitary corps in Rome consisted of one or more cohorts, though neither were part of a legion:The nine cohortes praetoriae, never grouped to a legion, the famous and infamous Praetorians.
