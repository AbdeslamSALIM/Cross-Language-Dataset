He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 30s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics.Early life and educationBorn was born in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland), which at Born's birth was in the Prussian Province of Silesia. He was one of two children borne to Gustav Born, (b. 22 April 1850, Kempen, d. 6 July 1900, Breslau), an anatomist and embryologist, and Margarethe Kauffmann (b. 22 January 1856, Tannhausen, d. 29 August 1886, Breslau), from a Silesian family of industrialists. Gustav and Margarethe married on 7 May 1881. Max Born had a sister called Käthe (b. 5 March 1884), and a half-brother called Wolfgang (b. 21 October 1892), from his father's second marriage (m. 13 September 1891) with Bertha Lipstein. His mother died when Max Born was four years old.Initially educated at the König-Wilhelm-Gymnasium, Born went on to study at the University of Breslau followed by Heidelberg University and the University of Zurich. During study for his Ph.D. His Ph.D. thesis in mathematics was defended at the University of Göttingen on 13 June 1906: Untersuchungen über die Stabilität der elastischen Linie in Ebene und Raum, unter verschiedenen Grenzbedingungen. It was awarded magna cum laude. See Greenspan, 2005, pp. 35-36 and Max Born’s Life. and Habilitation  The Habiliation was done at the University of Göttingen, on 23 October 1909: Über das Thomson'sche Atommodell Hablitations-Vortag (FAM, 1909). See Greenspan, 2005, pp. 49, 51, and 353. at the University of Göttingen, he came into contact with many prominent scientists and mathematicians including Klein, Hilbert, Minkowski, Runge, Schwarzschild, and Voigt. In 1908-1909 he studied at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.When Born arrived in Göttingen in 1904, Klein, Hilbert, and Minkowski Hilbert and Klein were colleagues at the University of Königsberg. Klein brought Hilbert to Göttingen. Then, Hilbert brought Minkowski. were the high priests of mathematics and were known as the “mandarins.” Very quickly after his arrival, Born formed close ties to the latter two men. From the first class he took with Hilbert, Hilbert identified Born as having exceptional abilities and selected him as the lecture scribe, whose function was to write up the class notes Since the lectures were the creation of the lecturer and not take from a textbook, the scribe performed a very important function. for the students’ mathematics reading room at the University of Göttingen. Being class scribe put Born into regular, invaluable contact with Hilbert, during which time Hilbert’s intellectual largesse benefited Born’s fertile mind. Hilbert became Born’s mentor and Hilbert eventually selected him to be the first to hold the unpaid, semi-official position of Hilbert’s assistant. Born’s introduction to Minkowski came through Born’s stepmother, Bertha, as she knew Minkowski from dancing classes in Königsberg. The introduction netted Born invitations to the Minkowski household for Sunday dinners. In addition, while performing his duties as scribe and assistant, Born often saw Minkowski at Hilbert’s house. Born’s outstanding work on elasticity - a subject near and dear to Klein - became the core of his magna cum laude Ph.D. thesis, in spite of some of Born’s irrationalities in dealing with Klein. Greenspan, 2005, 26-34.Born married Hedwig, née Ehrenberg, who was also of Jewish descent (although a practising Christian), on 2 August 1913, and converted to the Lutheran faith soon thereafter; the marriage produced three children including G. V. R. Born. His daughter Irene was the mother of British-born Australian singer and actress Olivia Newton-JohnCareerAfter Born’s Habilitation in 1909, he settled in as a young academic at Göttingen as a Privatdozent (associate professor). Greenspan, 2005, pp. 49, 53, and 353. In Göttingen, Born stayed at a boarding house run by Sister Annie at Dahlmannstarsse 17, known as El BoKaReBo The name was derived from the first letters of the last names of its boarders: “El” for Ella Philipson (a medical student), “Bo” for Born and Hans Bolza (a physics student), “Ka” for Theodore von Kármán (a Privatdozent), and “Re” for Albrecht Renner (a medical student). A frequent visitor to the boarding house was Paul Peter Ewald, a doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld on loan to David Hilbert at Göttingen as a special assistant for physics. It was at the boarding house that Paul Peter Ewald met Ella Philipson, who was to become his wife. They had a daughter, Rose. Hans Bethe, who got his doctorate from Sommerfeld in 1928, met Rose at Duke University in 1937, and they were married in 1938. See Greenspan, 2005, p. 53. Also see Hans Bethe – New York Times. Richard Courant, a mathematician and Privatdozent, called these people the “in group.” Greenspan, 2005, p. 53.From 1915 to 1919, except for a period in the German army, Born was extraordinarius professor of theoretical physics at the University of Berlin, where he formed a life-long friendship with Albert Einstein. In 1919, he became ordinarius professor on the science faculty at the University of Frankfurt am Main. While there, the University of Göttingen was looking for a replacement for Peter Debye, and the Philosophy Faculty had Born at the top of their list. In negotiating for the position with the education ministry, Born arranged for another chair at Göttingen and for his long-time friend and colleague James Franck to fill it. James Franck took the dual position of ordinarius professor and Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics at Göttingen. See Nobel Prize Biography. In 1921, Born became ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and Director of the new Institute of Theoretical Physics at Göttingen. Greenspan, 2005, pp. 96-97. While there, he formulated Max Born – Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1954: The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation of quantum mechanics, published in July 1926 Max Born Zur Quantenmechanik der Stoßvorgänge, Zeitschrift für Physik 37 863-867 (1926). Received 25 June 1926. Published 10 July 1926. and for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954, some three decades later.For the 12 years Born and Franck were at Göttingen, 1921 - 1933, Born had a collaborator with shared views on basic scientific concepts - a distinct advantage for teaching and his research on the developing quantum theory. The approach of close collaboration between theoretical physicists and experimental physicists was also shared by Born at Göttingen and Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich, who was ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics - also a prime mover in the development of quantum theory. Born and Sommerfeld not only shared their approach in using experimental physics to test and advance their theories, Sommerfeld, in 1922 when he was in the United States lecturing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, sent his student Werner Heisenberg to be Born’s assistant. Heisenberg again returned to Göttingen in 1923 and completed his Habilitation under Born in 1924 and became a Privatdozent at Göttingen - the year before Heisenberg and Born published their first papers on matrix mechanics.

On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper to review and submit for publication. W.

L. van der Waerden, editor, Sources of Quantum Mechanics (Dover Publications, 1968) ISBN 0-486-61881-1 (English title: “Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations”).]  In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory avoiding the concrete but unobservable representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes corresponding to the initial and final states. Emilio Segrè, From X-Rays to Quarks: Modern Physicists and their Discoveries (W. H. Freeman and Company, 1980) ISBN 0-7167-1147-8, pp 153 - 157.  When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, Abraham Pais, Niels Bohr’s Times in Physics, Philosophy, and Polity (Clarendon Press, 1991) ISBN 0-19-852049-2, pp 275 - 279.  which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes Max Born – Nobel Lecture (1954) at Breslau University. Born, with the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan, began immediately to make the transcription and extension, and they submitted their results for publication; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg’s paper. M. Born and P. Jordan, Zur Quantenmechanik, Zeitschrift für Physik, 34, 858-888, 1925 (received 27 September 1925). [English translation in: B.

Jeremy Bernstein Max Born and the Quantum Theory, Am. J. Phys. 73 (11) 999-1008 (2005)  A detailed historical and technical account can be found in Mehra and Rechenberg’s book The Historical Development of Quantum Theory. Volume 3. The Formulation of Matrix Mechanics and Its Modifications 1925&ndash;1926. Mehra, Volume 3 (Springer, 2001))Up until this time, matrices were seldom used by physicists; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics. Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921. While matrices were used in these cases, the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Jammer, 1966, pp. 206-207. Born, however, had learned matrix algebra from Rosanes, as already noted, but Born had also learned Hilbert’s theory of integral equations and quadratic forms for an infinite number of variables as was apparent from a citation by Born of Hilbert’s work Grundzüge einer allgemeinen Theorie der Linearen Integralgleichungen published in 1912. van der Waerden, 1968, p. 51.  The citation by Born was in Born and Jordan's paper, the second paper in the trilogy which launched the matrix mechanics formulation. See van der Waerden, 1968, p. 351. Jordan, too was well equipped for the task. For a number of years, he had been an assistant to Richard Courant at Göttingen in the preparation of Courant and David Hilbert’s book Methoden der mathematischen Physik I, which was published in 1924. Constance Ried Courant (Springer, 1996) p. 93.  This book, fortuitously, contained a great many of the mathematical tools necessary for the continued development of quantum mechanics. In 1926, John von Neumann became assistant to David Hilbert, and he would coin the term Hilbert space to describe the algebra and analysis which were used in the development of quantum mechanics. John von Neumann Allgemeine Eigenwerttheorie Hermitescher Funktionaloperatoren, Mathematische Annalen 102 49–131 (1929)   When von Neumann left Göttingen in 1932, his book on the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics, based on Hilbert’s mathematics, was published under the title Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik. See: Norman Macrae, John von Neumann: The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More (Reprinted by the American Mathematical Society, 1999) and Constance Reid, Hilbert (Springer-Verlag, 1996) ISBN 0-387-94674-8. In 1928, Albert Einstein nominated Heisenberg, Born, and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Bernstein, 2004, p. 1004.  but it was not to be. The announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 was delayed until November 1933. Greenspan, 2005, p. 190.  It was at that time that it was announced Heisenberg had won the Prize for 1932 “for the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen”Nobel Prize in Physics and 1933 – Nobel Prize Presentation Speech.  and Erwin Schrödinger and Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac shared the 1933 Prize "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory".Nobel Prize in Physics and 1933 – Nobel Prize Presentation Speech.  One can rightly ask why Born was not awarded the Prize in 1932 along with Heisenberg &ndash; Bernstein gives some speculations on this matter. One of them is related to Jordan joining the Nazi Party on 1 May 1933 and becoming a Storm Trooper. Bernstein, 2005, p. 1004. Hence, Jordan’s Party affiliations and Jordan’s links to Born may have affected Born’s chance at the Prize at that time. Bernstein also notes that when Born won the Prize in 1954, Jordan was still alive, and the Prize was awarded for the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, attributable alone to Born. Bernstein, 2005, p. 1006. Heisenberg’s reaction to Born for Heisenberg receiving the Prize for 1932 and to Born for Born receiving the Prize in 1954 are also instructive in evaluating whether Born should have shared the Prize with Heisenberg. On 25 November 1933 Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a “bad conscience” that he alone had received the Prize “for work done in Göttingen in collaboration &ndash; you, Jordan and I.” Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan’s contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by “a wrong decision from the outside.” Greenspan, 2005, p. 191.  In 1954, Heisenberg wrote an article honoring Max Planck for his insight in 1900. In the article, Heisenberg credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics, which were not “adequately acknowledged in the public eye.” Greenspan, 2005, pp. 285-286.Those who received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Göttingen included Max Delbrück, Walter Elsasser, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim, Robert Oppenheimer, and Victor Weisskopf.Sources for History of Quantum Physics Born’s assistants at the University of Göttingen’s Institute for Theoretical Physics included Enrico Fermi, Werner Heisenberg, Gerhard Herzberg, Friedrich Hund, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Léon Rosenfeld, Edward Teller, and Eugene Wigner.Sources for History of Quantum Physics Greenspan, 2005, pp. 178 and 262. Biography on Gerhard Herzberg - National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Walter Heitler became an assistant to Born in 1928 and under Born completed his Habilitation in 1929. Author Catalog: Heitler – American Philosophical Society Born not only recognized talent to work with him, but he let his “superstars stretch past him.” Greenspan, 2005, p. 143. His Ph.D. student Delbrück, and six of his assistants (Fermi, Heisenberg, Goeppert-Mayer, Herzberg, Pauli, Wigner) went on to win Nobel Prizes.In a letter to Born in 1926, Einstein made his famous remark regarding quantum mechanics, often paraphrased as "The Old One does not play dice." Letter from A. Einstein to M. Born dated 12 December 1926 [Max Born, Physics in my generation, Springer-Verlag, New York (1969), p. 113].

The Correspondence between Albert Einstein and Max and Hedwig Born 1916-1955 with commentaries by Max Born, ISBN 0-8027-0326-7In 1933 Born emigrated from Germany. He had strong and public pacifist opinions; moreover, though Born was a Lutheran, he was classified as a "Jew" by the Nazi racial laws due to his ancestry, and was thus stripped of his professorship. He took up a position as Stokes Lecturer at the University of Cambridge. From 1936 to 1953 he was Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He became a British subject and a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1939. Born was elected to the Royal Society in March and received his Certificate of Naturalization on 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. See Greenspan, 2005, p. 226.Born had a dislike for nuclear weapons research, but he still acknowledged “it might be the only way out.”Greenspan, 2005, p. 239. Much of the theoretical power behind the development of the first atomic bomb was due to many of those surrounding him at Göttingen and working on atomic physics and quantum mechanics: three of his Ph.D. students (Maria Goeppert-Mayer, Oppenheimer and Weisskopf), three of his assistants (Fermi, Teller, and Wigner), the Director of the Second Institute for Experimental Physics (James Franck), and David Hilbert’s assistant (John von Neumann).Students, assistants, and colleagues of Born at Göttingen who worked on the Manhattan Project:Maria Goeppert-Mayer – Worked on the Manhattan Project with Harold Urey at Columbia University on isotope separation.Robert Oppenheimer – Director of Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL) - One of the four major sites of the Manhattan Engineering District.Victor Weisskopf – Head of T-3 Group, Experiments, Efficiency Calculations, and Radiation Hydrodynamics, LASLEnrico Fermi – Director of Research, Met Lab of the University of Chicago - One of the four major sites of the Manhattan Engineering District.Edward Teller – Head of T-1 Group, Hydrodynamics of Implosion and Super, LASLEugene Wigner – Director of Theoretical Studies, Met LabJames Franck – Director of the Chemistry Division, Met Lab, and Chairman of the Committee on Political and Social ProblemsJohn von Neumann – LASL consultant on implosion mechanism for the plutonium bomb. (Neumann was assistant to David Hilbert at Göttingen and was greatly influenced by both David Hilbert’s and Max Born’s work. Neumann applied the mathematics of Hilbert space to Born’s quantum mechanics, and, in 1932, his foundational book on the mathematical underpinnings of quantum mechanics, Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik, was published.)Max and Hedwig Born retired to Bad Pyrmont (10 km south of Hamelin) in West Germany, in 1954. Biographical Sketch from the German Historical Museum Born was one of the 11 signatories to the Russell-Einstein Manifesto.Born died in Göttingen, Germany. He is buried there in the same cemetery as Walther Nernst, Wilhelm Weber, Max von Laue, Max Planck, and David Hilbert.Max-Born-PrizeIn memory of his important contributions, a Max-Born-Prize was created by the German Physical Society and the British Institute of Physics. It is awarded annually.Published worksDuring his life, Born wrote several semi-popular and technical books. His volumes on topics like atomic physics and optics were very well-received and are considered classics in their fields which are still in print. The following is a listing of his major works:Über das Thomson'sche Atommodell Hablitations-Vortag (FAM, 1909) - The Habiliation was done at the University of Göttingen, on 23 October 1909.  Greenspan, 2005, pp. 49, 51, and 353.Dynamik der Kristallgitter (Teubner, 1915) Greenspan, 2005, p. 352. - After its publication, the physicist Arnold Sommerfeld asked Born to write an article based on it for the 5th volume of the Mathematical Encyclopedia. World War I delayed the start of work on this article, but it was taken up in 1919 and finished in 1922. It was published as a revised edition under the title Atomic Theory of Solid States.

The second volume was to deal with Erwin Schrödinger’s wave mechanics. However, the second volume was not even started by Born, as he believed his friend and colleague Hermann Weyl had written it before he could do so.  Greenspan, 2005, pp. 159-160.

(Pergamon, 1959) - This book in not an English translation of Optik, but rather a substantially new book. Shortly after World War II, a number of scientists suggested that Born update and translate his work into English. Since there had been many advances in optics in the intervening years, updating was warranted. In 1951, Emil Wolf began as Born’s private assistant on the book; it was eventually published in 1959 by Robert Maxwell's Pergamon Press Paul Rosbaud, a former editor at Springer who remained in Germany during World War II and spied for the allies, was initially involved with Born and the endeavor to publish Optik in English, as Rosbaud was organizing a publishing company in England after the war. The publishing company did not materialize, and Rosbaud eventually joined Pergamon Press. (Greenspan, 2005, pp. 292-294.) - the delay being due to the lengthy time needed “to resolve all the financial and publishing tricks created by Maxwell.”  Greenspan, 2005, pp. 174, 292-294.Moderne Physik (1933) -- Based on seven lectures given at the Technischen Hochschule Berlin.
