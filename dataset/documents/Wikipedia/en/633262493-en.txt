Instructions per second (IPS) is a measure of a computer's processor speed. Many reported IPS values have represented "peak" execution rates on artificial instruction sequences with few branches, whereas realistic workloads consist of a mix of instructions and applications, some of which take longer to execute than others. The performance of the memory hierarchy also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in MIPS calculations. Because of these problems, researchers created standardized tests such as SPECint to (maybe) measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications, and raw IPS has fallen into disuse.The term is commonly used in association with a numeric value such as thousand instructions per second (kIPS), million instructions per second (MIPS), or Million Operations per Second (MOPS).Thousand instructions per secondBefore standard benchmarks were available, average speed rating of computers was based on calculations for a mix of instructions with the results given in kilo Instructions Per Second (kIPS). The most famous was the Gibson Mix, produced by J Gibson of IBM for scientific applications. Other ratings were also produced for commercial applications. Computer Speeds From Instruction Mixes pre-1960 to 1971 has results for around 175 computers, providing scientific and commercial ratings. For IBM, the earliest Gibson Mix calculations shown are the 1954 IBM 650 at 0.06 kIPS and 1956 IBM 705 at 0.5 kIPS. The results are mainly for IBM and others known as the BUNCH - Burroughs, Univac, NCR, CDC and Honeywell.A thousand instructions per second (kIPS) is rarely used, as most current microprocessors can execute several million instructions per second. The thousand means 1000 not 1024.kIPS is also a common joke name for 16 bit microprocessor designs developed in undergraduate computer engineering courses that use the text Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy (ISBN 1-55860-428-6), which explains computer architecture concepts in terms of the MIPS architecture. Such architectures tend to be scaled down versions of the MIPS R2000 architecture.Million instructions per secondMIPS are not comparable between CPU architectures. This and other limitations of the unit lead many computer engineers to define MIPS as "Meaningless Indicator of Processor Speed."The floating-point arithmetic equivalent of MIPS is FLOPS, to which the same cautions apply.In the late 1970s, minicomputer performance was compared using VAX MIPS, where computers were measured on a task and their performance rated against the VAX 11/780 that was marketed as a "1 MIPS" machine. (The measure was also known as the "VAX Unit of Performance" or VUP. Though orthographically incorrect, the "S" in "VUPs" is sometimes written in upper case.) This was chosen because the 11/780 was roughly equivalent in performance to an IBM System/370 model 158-3, which was commonly accepted in the computing industry as running at 1 MIPS.Many of the minicomputer performance claims were based on the Fortran version of the Whetstone benchmark. This produces an artificial speed rating in Millions of Whetstone Instructions Per Second (MWIPS). Whetstone Benchmark History and Results provides some 700 results for minicomputers, mainframes, supercomputers and PCs. The VAX 11/780 with FPA (1977) is shown as having a rating of 1.02 MWIPS.Effective MIPS speeds are highly dependent on the programming language used. The Whetstone Report has a table showing MWIPS speeds of PCs via early interpreters and compilers up to modern languages. The first compiler was for BASIC (1982) when a 4.8 MHz 8088/87 CPU obtained 0.01 MWIPS. Results on a 2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo (1 CPU 2007) vary from 9.7 MWIPS using BASIC Interpreter, 59 MWIPS via BASIC Compiler, 347 MWIPS using 1987 Fortran, 1534 MWIPS through HTML/Java to 2403 MWIPS using a modern C/C++ compiler. Source code, pre-compiled versions and results on PCs, for these and other benchmarks that measure MIPS, are available from Roy Longbottom’s PC Benchmark Collection (Free).Most 8-bit and early 16-bit microprocessors have a performance measured in kIPS (thousand instructions per second), which equals 0.001 MIPS. The first general purpose microprocessor, the Intel i8080, ran at 640 kIPS. The Intel i8086 microprocessor, the first 16-bit microprocessor in the line of processors made by Intel and used in IBM PCs, ran at 800 kIPS. Early 32-bit PCs (386) ran at about 3 MIPS.zMIPS refers to the MIPS measure used internally by IBM to rate its mainframe servers (zSeries, IBM System z9, and IBM System z10).Timeline of instructions per secondProcessorIPSIPS/MHzYearSourcePencil and paper (for comparison)0000000|0.0119 IPS00000|n/a1892http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/appendix.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Intel 40040000010|92 kIPS at 740 kHzMCS4 &gt; IntelP4004&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;00001|0.1241971IBM System/370 model 158-30000010|1 MIPS00001|?1972Intel 80800000006|640 kIPS at 2&nbsp;MHz00320|0.32 MIPS/MHz1974VAX 11/7800000005|500 kIPS00002|?1977Motorola 680000000010|1 MIPS at 8&nbsp;MHz00125|0.125 MIPS/MHz1979Intel 286]]0000026|2.66 MIPS at 12&nbsp;MHz00220|0.22 MIPS/MHz1982Intel 80286 Microprocessor Chip (c1982)Motorola 680200000040|4 MIPS at 20&nbsp;MHz00200|0.2 MIPS/MHz1984ARM20000040|4 MIPS at 8&nbsp;MHz00500|0.5 MIPS/MHz1986Motorola 680300000110|11 MIPS at 33&nbsp;MHz00330|0.33 MIPS/MHz1987Intel 386DX]]0000085|8.5 MIPS at 25&nbsp;MHz00340|0.34 MIPS/MHz1988Motorola 680400000440|44 MIPS at 40&nbsp;MHz01100|1.1 MIPS/MHz1990Intel 486DX]]0000540|54 MIPS at 66&nbsp;MHz00818|0.818 MIPS/MHz1992PowerPC 600s (G2)]]0000350|35 MIPS at 33&nbsp;MHz01060|1.06 MIPS/MHz1994Motorola 680600000880|88 MIPS at 66&nbsp;MHz01330|1.33 MIPS/MHz1994Intel Pentium Pro0005410|541 MIPS at 200&nbsp;MHz02705|2.705 MIPS/MHz1996SiSoftware Zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;ARM 7500FE]]0000359|35.9 MIPS at 40&nbsp;MHz00897|0.897 MIPS/MHz1996PowerPC G30005250|525 MIPS at 233&nbsp;MHz02253|2.253 MIPS/MHz1997Zilog eZ800000800|80 MIPS at 50&nbsp;MHz01600|1.6 MIPS/MHz1999Computergram International | Find Articles at BNET.com]Intel Pentium III0013540|1,354 MIPS at 500&nbsp;MHz02708|2.708 MIPS/MHz1999Freescale MPC8272]]0007600|760 MIPS at 400&nbsp;MHz01900|1.9 MIPS/MHz2000Freescale Semiconductor - MPC8272 PowerQUICC™ II Processor Family Integrated Communications ProcessorsAMD Athlon]]0035610|3,561 MIPS at 1.2&nbsp;GHz02967|2.967 MIPS/MHz2000AMD Athlon XP 2400+]]0059350|5,935 MIPS at 2.0&nbsp;GHz02967|2.967 MIPS/MHz2002Pentium 4 Extreme Edition]]0097260|9,726 MIPS at 3.2&nbsp;GHz03039|3.039 MIPS/MHz2003ARM Cortex A8]]0020000|2,000 MIPS at 1.0&nbsp;GHz02000|2.0 MIPS/MHz2005ARM Cortex-A8&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;AMD Athlon FX-57]]0120000|12,000 MIPS at 2.8&nbsp;GHz04285|4.285 MIPS/MHz2005AMD Athlon 64 3800+ X2 (Dual Core)]]0145640|14,564 MIPS at 2.0&nbsp;GHz07282|7.282 MIPS/MHz2005CPU Charts 2007 - Tom's Hardware&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Xbox360 IBM "Xenon" Triple Core]]0096000|19,200 MIPS at 3.2&nbsp;GHz02001|2.0 MIPS/MHz2005PS3 Cell BE]] (PPE only)021800|10,240 MIPS at 3.2&nbsp;GHz021800|3.2 MIPS/MHz2006AMD Athlon FX-60 (Dual Core)]]0189380|18,938 MIPS at 2.6&nbsp;GHz07283|7.283 MIPS/MHz2006Intel Core 2 X6800]]0270790|27,079 MIPS at 2.93&nbsp;GHz09242|9.242 MIPS/MHz2006Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6700]]0491610|49,161 MIPS at 2.66&nbsp;GHz18481|18.481 MIPS/MHz2006Synthetics, Continued - Tom's Hardware : Intel's Core 2 Quadro Kentsfield: Four Cores on a Rampage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;P.A.
