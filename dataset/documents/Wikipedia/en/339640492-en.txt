It is not yet a member of FIFA or UEFA and is therefore not eligible to enter the World Cup or the European Championship. Gibraltar applied for UEFA membership, but this was rejected by the UEFA Board in 2007. The issue has been referred to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for a ruling.HistoryThe history of the Gibraltarian national football side can be traced back to April 1923, when it traveled to Spain to play club side Sevilla in a friendly; two games were played and Gibraltar lost both.The first competition the team entered was the 1993 Island Games. Gibraltar lost all of its matches, scoring only one goal and finishing in last place.They had much more success in the 1995 Island Games, which they hosted. Despite losing their opening game against Greenland, Gibraltar bounced back to record their first competitive win, against the Isle of Man. Another victory over Anglesey saw Gibraltar finish second in the group, ahead of Anglesey only on goal difference, and qualify for the semi finals. There, they beat Jersey 1-0, before losing the final to the Isle of Wight by the same scoreline.In the 1997 edition, two wins and two losses in the group stage, followed by a defeat to Shetland in a playoff, saw Gibraltar finish 6th out of 9 teams. Another poor performance in 1999 saw them finish 11th.Results improved slightly in 2001, as they came 5th, and in 2003 Gibraltar recorded their biggest win ever, defeating Sark 19-0. Other good results against Greenland and Orkney saw them finish 6th out of 12. Despite these minor successes, Gibraltar did not even enter the 2005 tournament.In 2007, Gibraltar won the Island Games for the 1st time, beating Rhodes by 4-0.FIFI Wild CupIn 2006 Gibraltar participated in the 2006 FIFI Wild Cup where it was ranked 3rd. In Gibraltar's opening match, they drew 1-1 with the hosts, the 'Republic of St. Pauli', before beating Tibet 5-0 in their second group game to qualify for the semi-finals. There they lost 2-0 to eventual champions Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. In the third place playoff, Gibraltar had a rematch against St. Pauli. This time Gibraltar were able to defeat the hosts, to finish in third place out of the six teams.Application for membership of [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]]On August 25, 2006, it was proposed that Gibraltar will become a provisional member of UEFA. However, a decision on granting this was postponed in October 2006 UEFA - No decision yet on Gibraltar.. The decision was made on December 8 2006 that Gibraltar will be made provisional members of UEFA: FIFA had announced two days earlier that their executive committee had "ruled that Gibraltar does not meet the statutory requirements to become a FIFA member", despite the fact that the Court of Arbitration in Sport had already ruled to the contraryFIFA - Clear declaration to defend the autonomy of sport..On January 26, 2007 Gibraltar membership had been rejected by the UEFA Board with only 3 out of 52 votes supporting Gibraltar's claim. Spain was the strongest opponent to Gibraltar joining UEFA, even threatening to boycott any competition where the Gibraltar national team would competed in.The issue has again been referred back to the Court of Arbitration for Sport for a ruling.Tournament recordsIsland Games recordYearRoundPositionGPWDLGSGAIsle of Wight 19937th Place Match8400419 1995Runners-Up2540153Jersey 19975th Place Match65203138Gotland 199911th Place Match114103911Isle of Man 20015th Place Match5430172Guernsey 20035th Place Match65302295Rhodes 2007Champions1431092Total7/101 Title31161147340*Gold background colour indicates that the tournament was won.
