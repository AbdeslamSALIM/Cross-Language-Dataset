It is 480&nbsp;km (298&nbsp;mi) long and 19 to 109&nbsp;km (12 to 68&nbsp;mi) wide. It covers an area of 28,400 km² (11,000&nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) in the southern part of the territory. Its volume is 2,090&nbsp;km³&nbsp;(501.7&nbsp;cu&nbsp;mi,1.694&nbsp;billion&nbsp;acre&amp;nbsp;feet). The lake was named for the Slavey North American Indians and has nothing to do with slavery.The Hay and Slave Rivers are its chief tributaries. It is drained by the Mackenzie River. Though the western shore is forested, the east shore and northern arm are tundra-like. The southern and eastern shores reach the edge of the Canadian Shield. Along with other lakes such as the Great Bear and Athabasca, it is a remnant of a vast post-glacial lake.The East Arm of Great Slave Lake is filled with islands, and the area is within Thaydene Nene National Park. The Pethei Peninsula separates the East Arm into McLeod Bay in the north and Christie Bay in the south. The only community in the East Arm is Lutselk'e, a hamlet of about 350 people, largely Chipewyan aboriginals of the Dene Nation.HistoryFirst Nations were the first settlers around the lake, building communities including Dettah, which still exists today.British fur trader Samuel Hearne explored the area in 1771 and crossed the frozen lake, which he initially named Lake Athapuscow (after an erroneous French speaker's pronunciation of Athabaska).In the 1930s, gold was discovered there, which led to the establishment of Yellowknife, the territory's capital.In 1967, an all-season highway was built around the lake, originally an extension of the Mackenzie Highway but now known as Highway 3.On January 24, 1978, a Soviet Radar Ocean Reconnaissance Satellite, named Cosmos 954, built with an on board nuclear reactor fell from orbit and landed in the lake. With all the ice and snow on the lake the satellite exploded on impact causing its nuclear fuel to fall over the area. The nuclear fuel was picked up by a group called Operation Morning Light formed with both American and Canadian members.General InformationOther towns around the lake include: Yellowknife, Fort Providence, Hay River and Fort Resolution.The lake is at least partially frozen during an average of eight months of the year. During winter, the ice is thick enough for semi-trailer trucks to pass over. Until 1967, when an all-season highway was built around the lake, goods were shipped across the ice to Yellowknife, located on the north shore. Goods and fuel are still shipped across frozen lakes up the winter road to the diamond mines located near the headwaters of the Coppermine River, Northwest Territories. A ferry is required to access Yellowknife during spring when the ice is not present in a solid sheet along Highway 3 where it crosses the Mackenzie River.The main western portion of the lake forms a moderately deep bowl with a surface area of 18,500 km² and a volume of 596 km³. This main portion has a maximum depth of 187.7 m and a mean depth of 32.2 m. To the east, McLeod Bay and Christie Bay are much deeper, with a maximum recorded depth in Christie Bay of 614 m.South of Great Slave Lake, in a remote corner of Wood Buffalo National Park, is the nesting site of a remnant flock of whooping cranes, discovered in 1954.See alsoList of lakes by area (9)List of lakes by depth (6)List of lakes by volume (10)ReferencesFurther readingCanada.
