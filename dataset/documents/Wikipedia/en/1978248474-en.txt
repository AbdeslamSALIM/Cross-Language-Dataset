The high point of his career to date was his stirring overall win in the 2000 Giro d'Italia, after a close three-way competition with Gilberto Simoni and Francesco Casagrande.CareerHe started out as being a domestique for Marco Pantani but proved in 2000 that he deserved much more. When "The Pirate" lacked form in the beginning of the 2000 Giro, Garzelli was left free of all team duties for Mercatone Uno, and was able to fight and win his own battle in the Giro. In the final time-trial stage Garzelli took the race leadership away from Casagrande, who was suffering an inflamed sciatic nerve. Casagrande was devastated, and Garzelli dedicated his win to Pantani.He is a versatile rider with qualities that include decent sprinting, decent time trials and some good skills in the mountains. Without being a great attacker, Garzelli is very constant and, on a good day, he can go with the best climbers.After his win of the 2000 Giro d'Italia he was recruited by the Italian super-team Mapei in 2002, aiming to repeat his 2000 Giro success. The start of the season showed promise, with Garzelli being a key player in teammate Paolo Bettini's win in Liège-Bastogne-Liège, with Garzelli himself finishing second. The finale of the race saw Bettini and Garzelli make tactical moves to benefit from each others' aggressions and saw them finish the race with a comfortable margin to decide the win amongst themselves.However, Garzelli was caught in the 2002 doping scandal in the Giro d'Italia, and was forced out of the race. Many believe that the circumstances of his suspension prompted the Mapei boss Giorgio Squinzi to terminate his sponsorship of the team at the end of the year. "The exclusion of Garzelli, who tested positive for a masking agent, wasn't a normal thing. At the start nothing was found. Later, as soon as he won a stage, a forbidden substance came out all of a sudden. That's bizarre," said Squinzi in an interview.Garzelli was able to mount a come-back for the 2003 Giro d'Italia and was able to challenge eventual winner Gilberto Simoni in the race. He currently rides for Acqua &amp; Sapone-Caffè Mokambo.Palmares19981st, Overall, Tour de Suisse1st, Stage 51st, Stage 61st, Points competition and Combination competition19991st, GP Miguel Indurain1st, Stage 3, Vuelta al País Vasco20001st, Overall, Giro d'Italia1st, Stage 181st, Stage 8, Tour de Suisse1st, Mountains Competition, Tour de Suisse1st, Stage 4, Settimana LombardaGran Premio Nobili Rubinetterie20011st, Stage 5a, Vuelta al País Vasco2002GP Industria &amp; Artigianato di Larciano2003Giro del Trentino stage 12nd, Overall, Giro d'Italia1st, Stage 31st, Stage 72004Vuelta a AragónTour de Romandie stage 26th overall, Giro d'Italia (and stage 19 win)2005Tre Valli Varesine2006Rund um den Henninger Turm FrankfurtTour de Luxembourg stage 4Tre Valli Varesine2007Giro del Trentino stage 3Giro d'Italia stage 14, 16See alsoList of doping cases in cyclingList of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offencesReferencesCyclingnews.com 2002 Mapei feature Giorgio Squinzi: Mapei's anti-doping crusader     Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Italian cyclists Category:People from Varese Category:Giro d'Italia winners Category:Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:Doping cases in cyclingda:Stefano Garzelli de:Stefano Garzelli es:Stefano Garzelli fr:Stefano Garzelli it:Stefano Garzelli nl:Stefano Garzelli no:Stefano Garzelli pl:Stefano Garzelli fi:Stefano Garzelli sv:Stefano Garzelli
