It was founded in 1973 in Rimini, Italy by Bianchi, Morri and Tamburini. The company name is a portmanteau derived from the first two letters of each of the three founders' surnames, i.e. '''BI'anchi 'MO'rri 'TA'mburini''.Because the state of frame design and overall packaging was poor,"The Ultimate History of Fast Motorcycles", By: Brown, Ronald. Pages 148-149, 174-175, 210-211, 230, 248-249, 286-287 Published by Parragon Publishing 2002. ISBN 1-40545-466-0. Bimota concentrated initially on building high-quality motorcycles around existing engines. From the beginning they customised the top models of Suzuki, Honda and Kawasaki. During the late 1970s, Bimota also helped develop and build motorcycles branded as Lamborghinis. In the 1980s they also customised Yamaha and Ducati motorcycles.Bimota's co-founder and long-time chief designer Tamburini has been an influential player in the development of other Italian brands, most significantly his work on the popular Ducati 916, the Ducati Paso, and MV Agusta F4; other designers such as current Bimota chief Sergio Robbiano have also been involved with larger-volume manufacturers.ProductsBimota model names reflect the origin of the engines they begin with: Yamaha engined models being with a "Y", Honda models with a "H", Suzuki versions with a "S", Kawasaki versions with a "K", and Ducati versions with a "D". For example, the DB5 and SB8K are the 5th Ducati-engined and 8th Suzuki-engined models.1970sHB1 First Bimota, made in 1972 by Tamburini from the wreck of a Honda CB750. 10 examples were ultimately made.SB2 Introduced in 1977.

Bimota was forced to ditch the novel fuel injection system and re-engineer the entire engine. Bimota ultimately recalled the entire run of the motorcycle. While this was occurring, during the 2000 World Superbike season, one of Bimota's main sponsors disappeared, owing the company a great deal of money. The combination of events forced Bimota to file for bankruptcy and close their doors.In 2003, a new group of investors purchased the rights to the Bimota name and designs and re-started the company.RacingTheir bikes have been raced over the years, winning several early Superbike World Championship races. Virginio Ferrari won the 1987 TTF1 title aboard a YB4 EI, partnering with Davide Tardozzi. Davide Tardozzi took five in ), and also the 1980 350cc constructor's title.
