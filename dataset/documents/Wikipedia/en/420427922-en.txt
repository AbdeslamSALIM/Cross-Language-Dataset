 Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is a Link layer networking protocol used by a host computer to obtain its IPv4 address given only its link-layer address (such as an Ethernet address). RARP is described in IETF publication RFC 903. It has been rendered obsolete by Bootstrap Protocol and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, which both support a much greater feature set than RARP.RARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of mappings from Link Layer address to protocol address. MAC addresses needed to be individually configured on the servers by an administrator. RARP was limited, with respect to newer configuration protocols, to serving IP addresses only.Reverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP), which is designed to locate the IP address associated with another station's MAC address. InARP is the complement of the Address Resolution Protocol used for the reverse lookup. RARP was only used for lookup of a host's own IP address.See alsoDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)Bootstrap protocol (BOOTP)Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP)External linksRFC 903ftp://alycia.dementia.org/pub/net-tools/Category:Internet protocols Category:Internet standards Category:Link protocolsbs:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol ca:Protocol invers de resolució d'adreces cs:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol da:Reverse address resolution protocol de:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol es:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol eu:RARP fr:Reverse address resolution protocol it:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol he:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol nl:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol ja:Reverse address resolution protocol pl:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol pt:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol ru:RARP fi:RARP sv:Reverse Address Resolution Protocol tr:RARP zh:反向地址转换协议
