 In Greek mythology, Cepheus was ruler of the Phoenician nation of Aethiopia, Ethiopia.Cepheus' parentage is usually given as Belus and Achiroe, making him the brother of Danaus, King of Libya, and Aegyptus, King of Egypt. However, it is not clear if this Cepheus is the same as the more well-known Cepheus, who features in the Perseus legend as the husband of Cassiopeia and father of Andromeda, and whose brother Phineus expected to marry Andromeda. This other Cepheus is given as a son of Agenor (not the father of Cadmus and Europa). The two Aethiopian kings named Cepheus are separated by several generations, and it is not clear if the mythographers intended them to be one and the same person.The first Cepheus (son of Belus) has a wife named Iope. The name Iope looks like a truncated version of Cassiopeia, but it is probably eponymous with the 'Aethiopian' city of Ioppa (=Joppa, later Jaffa). This Cepheus was possibly the grandfather of the second Cepheus, if Agenor was his son.The second Cepheus (son of Agenor), was the husband of Cassiopeia and father of Andromeda.Category:Greek mythology Category:Mythological kingsbr:Kefeüs cs:Kéfeus cy:Cepheus (mytholeg) de:Kepheus (Äthiopien) es:Cefeo eu:Zefeo fr:Céphée (mythologie) gl:Cefeo ko:케페우스 it:Cefeo (mitologia) nl:Cepheus (mythologie) ja:ケーペウス pl:Cefeusz (mitologia) pt:Cefeu ru:Кефей (царь Эфиопии) fi:Kefeus (Etiopia) uk:Кефей
