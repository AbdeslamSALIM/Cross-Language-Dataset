The Adoxaceae is a small family of flowering plants in the order Dipsacales, as now constituted comprising four genera and about 150-200 species. It is characterised by opposite toothed leaves, small five- or, more rarely, four-petalled flowers in cymose inflorescences, and the fruit being a drupe. They are thus similar to many Cornaceae.In older classifications this family was entirely comprised into Caprifoliaceae (the honeysuckle family), Adoxa moschatellina (Moschatel) being the first plant to be put into this new group. Much later, the genera Sambucus (elders) and Viburnum were added after careful morphological analysis of biochemical tests by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. An additional monotypic genus Sinadoxa has been added based on molecular comparison with Adoxa.Adoxa is a small perennial herbaceous plant, flowering early in the spring and dying down to ground level in summer immediately after the berries are mature; the leaves are compound.The elders are mostly shrubs, but two species are large herbaceous plants; all have compound leaves. The viburnums are all shrubs, with simple leaves.Media Image:Viburnum davidii.jpg|Viburnum davidii foliage and fruit Image:Sambucus racemosa2.jpg|Sambucus racemosa flowers  Image:Sambucus nigra0.jpg|Sambucus nigra flowers Image:Elderberryfruit5081.JPG|Sambucus canadensis foliage and fruit Category:Dipsacalesda:Desmerurt-familien de:Moschuskrautgewächse es:Adoxaceae fr:Adoxaceae hsb:Pižmonkowe rostliny lt:Ūksmininiai nl:Muskuskruidfamilie ja:レンプクソウ科 no:Moskusurtfamilien pl:Piżmaczkowate pt:Adoxaceae sv:Desmeknoppsväxter vi:Họ Ngũ phúc hoa zh:五福花科
