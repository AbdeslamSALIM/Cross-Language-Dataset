 The Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH), a fictional character created by Simon Travaglia, is a rogue system administrator who takes out his anger on users (often referred to as lusers) -- his colleagues, his bosses, and anyone who gets in his way.The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to Usenet by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in Datamation. They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in Network Week and since 2000 they have been published most weeks in The Register. They were also published in PC Plus magazine for a short time, and several books of the stories have also been released.By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays (or wishes he could get away with) the qualities of the original. The term has become common Internet slang. In the stories the BOFH also spent a brief amount of time as a Bastard System Manager From Hell (BSMFH) — however, this has failed to pass into common online parlance.In the stories, the PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) is the BOFH's assistant; this too has become a general term for a junior or trainee system administrator.StorylinesThe stories take place in three locations; early BOFH editions took place in a university, moving on to an office workplace over time (an exact transition is not given). BOFH 2k began with the BOFH and PFY moving to a new company.Whilst the BOFH gets irritated at the incompetence of users, he does use this to his advantage to further his devious means, mainly using the following tricks:Deleting users' filesDeleting users (by arranging "accidents")Lifting raised floor tiles so users (or engineers, or the Boss) fall downElectrocuting users (from an over-voltage cattle prod, using nails as fuses, or by other means)Locking the machine room and triggering the Halon releaseTrapping them in the elevatorSlamming their testicles in desk drawersPushing users off the comms riserBlackmailPutting users on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives listDestroying systems with etherkillers (power cables spliced onto a piece of coax cable), or talking users into destroying their own systems.Locking them in the airtight tape safePutting laxatives in their food or coffeeEarly BOFH editions focused mainly on the above tricks, although over time many other schemes and plots have been used, with many now aimed at management as well as the users. Early BOFH editions simply featured the BOFH, the systems manager and the lusers — as time developed, the Boss, PFY and other characters (see below) appeared.CharactersThe following characters appear regularly :The BOFH, actual name of SimonThe PFY (Pimply-Faced Youth) (BOFH's assistant, 1996—), actual name of Steven (Stephen in Episode 22, 2007 and Episode 18, 2008)The Boss (changes throughout the stories as successive bosses are sacked, leave, are committed, or have nasty "accidents")Beancounters from Accounting (disposable, interchangeable, faceless, used on occasion as balls in a game of "blackout fire-alarm beancounter pinball")The CEO - The PFY's uncle Brian from 1996 until 2000, when the BOFH and PFY moved on to a new companyThe Head of ITHelldesk Operators (disposable, interchangeable, faceless)The Boss's Secretary, SharonSecurity (tape Emmerdale over CCTV video tapes, useless with computers)George, the cleaner (invaluable source of information)Sam, the janitor (scapegoat)Ron, the electrician (Mad Ron the Sparky)BooksThe Bastard Operator From Hell (Plan Nine, ISBN 1-929462-17-4)Bastard Operator From Hell II: Son of the Bastard (Plan Nine, ISBN 1-929462-40-9)Bride of the Bastard Operator From Hell (Plan Nine, ISBN 1-929462-48-4)Dummy Mode Is Forever (Plan Nine, ISBN 1-929462-63-8)Dial "B" For Bastard (Plan Nine, ISBN 1-929462-94-8)Bastardopolis (Not yet published)SongsIn 2006 the UKUUG commissioned a songThe Mandelboozer VirusThe Mandelboozer Virus (also known as Mandelbrot virus, MandelBank virus and Mandelboat virus), is a fictional computer virus conspired on-the-fly by the BOFH in order to cover up a mistake that the PFY made in Episode 32 of the 2008 BOFH series storiesBOFH:The Mandelboat virus. Its symptoms allegedly included sudden restoration of documents with older versions, infection of routers, core network services and automated building controls, and the constant changing of its own name, and is said to be prevented by the installation of a fictional Service Pack 3a. The names are apparently a play on the Mandelbrot set.While the excuse of non-existent computer viruses isn't new in BOFH stories, the one thing that made this fictional computer virus outstanding is that the protagonists of the story vandalized Wikipedia by creating a hoax Wikipedia page to give credibility to the virus. This caused an attempt to create an Internet meme to surface at the comments section of the story, which lead to real life mimicry of the events in the story- A hoax page about the Mandelboozer virus surfaced on the real Wikipedia within 13 minutes of the story being published on The RegisterBOFH: The Mandelboat Virus comments. However, the hoax was quickly spotted and within a day the page was changed to redirect to the BOFH page. A small change war then erupted, with ended with the Mandelboozer virus page being put into protected mode to prevent further undoing of the redirection.ReferencesExternal linksBOFH, The Complete WWW EditionBOFH stories, 1988-1999BOFH stories, 2000-present from The RegisterBOFH Excuse ServerThe BOFH Text Adventure GameCategory:Computer humor Category:Internet culture Category:Internet slang Category:System administration Category:Unseen charactersca:Bastard Operator from Hell cs:BOFH da:Bastard Operator From Hell de:Bastard Operator From Hell es:Bastard Operator from Hell fr:BOFH it:BOFH nl:Bastard Operator From Hell pl:BOFH pt:Bastard Operator From Hell ru:BOFH
