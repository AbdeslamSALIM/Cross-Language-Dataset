The small town of Berg, Upper Bavaria near Starnberg is famous as the site where King Ludwig II of Bavaria was found dead in the lake in 1886.The lake, which was created by ice age glaciers from the Alps, extends 21 km (14 miles) from north to south and has a width of 3-5 km (2-3.5 miles) from east to west. It has a single, small island, the Roseninsel, and a single outlet, the Würm river (because of this river the lake was called the Würmsee until 1962). Its major inflow comes from a chain of small lakes in the south, Osterseen. This small river is called Ach or Ostersee-Ach. It is possible to circumnavigate the lake by cycle.Rose Island (Lake Starnberg) is the only island in it and site of a royal villa of Ludwig II.External linksStarnbergbar:Starnberga See cs:Starnbergské jezero da:Starnberger See de:Starnberger See es:Lago Starnberg eo:Starnberger See fr:Lac de Starnberg id:Danau Starnberg it:Lago di Starnberg lv:Štarnbergas ezers nl:Starnberger See no:Starnberger See nn:Starnberger See pl:Jezioro Starnberg pt:Lago Starnberger ru:Штарнбергское озеро sk:Starnberské jazero sv:Starnbergsjön zh:施坦贝尔格湖
