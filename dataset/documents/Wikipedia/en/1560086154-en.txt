 www.enkhuizen.nl Enkhuizen (West Frisian: Ingh√∫ze) is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland and the region of West-Frisia.Enkhuizen was one of the harbour-towns of the VOC, just like Hoorn and Amsterdam, from where overseas trade with the East Indies was conducted. It received city rights in 1355. In the mid-17th century, Enkhuizen was at the peak of its power and was one of the most important harbour cities in the Netherlands. However, due to a variety of reasons, including the silting up of the harbours, Enkhuizen lost its position to Amsterdam.Nowadays, Enkhuizen continues the maritime tradition and has one of the largest marinas of the Netherlands. It is also the location of the Zuiderzeemuseum, an open-air museum reflecting life in the villages around the Zuiderzee throughout history. Most of the buildings in the museum come from other locations in the Netherlands, such as Purmerend and Amsterdam.Industrially, Enkhuizen is home to a number of seed production companies, as well as a plastic factory. Tourism, however, is one of the most important businesses as large parts of the inner city are still intact. This includes two magnificent 15th century churches, the largely intact 17th century city walls, gates and tower (the Drommedaris, see picture) and the 17th century city hall.Population centresThe municipality of Enkhuizen consists of the following cities, towns, villages and/or districts: Enkhuizen, Oosterdijk, Westeinde.Local governmentThe municipal council of Enkhuizen consists of 17 seats, which are divided as follows:Nieuw Enkhuizen - 4 seatsPvdA - 4 seatsVVD/D66- 2 seatsSP - 1 seats (after august 19th 2007)Fractie Quasten - 1 seat (after august 19th 2007)CDA - 2 seatsChristenUnie - 2 seatsGroenLinks - 1 seatsPublic transportationEnkhuizen has a railway station - Enkhuizen - which offers a direct service to Hoorn and Amsterdam, with the journey to Amsterdam Centraal of around an hour.Furthermore, during summer ferries for pedestrians and cyclists operate between Enkhuizen and Stavoren; between Enkhuizen and Medemblik; and between Enkhuizen and Urk.Born in EnkhuizenLucas Janszoon Waghenaer (1533), Chief Officer / CartographerPaulus Potter (1625), PainterGerrit Zalm (1952), former Minister of Finances.Wijda Mazereeuw (1953), Dutch swimmerRaph Levien (1970), American geniusReferencesStatistics are taken from the SDU StaatscourantExternal links Zuiderzeemuseum Official Website Digital City Enkhuizen Jazzfestival Enkhuizen Images from Enkhuizen Old Pictures from Enkhuizen Enkhuizen City Guide Classic Boat Show  Category:Municipalities of North Holland Category:Cities, towns and villages in North Hollandde:Enkhuizen es:Enkhuizen fr:Enkhuizen fy:Inkhuzen id:Enkhuizen it:Enkhuizen jv:Enkhuizen li:Enkhuizen nl:Enkhuizen pl:Enkhuizen ro:Enkhuizen fi:Enkhuizen sv:Enkhuizen vo:Enkhuizen zea:Enkhuizen
