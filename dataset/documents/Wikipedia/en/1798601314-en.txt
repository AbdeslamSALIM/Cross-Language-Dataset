With these results she was chosen as the East German sportswoman of the year. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul she won the silver medal as a member of the East German 4x100 meter relay team (she had at that time taken the name Möller).In 1992 she was implicated with Katrin Krabbe and Grit Breuer in a doping scandal, but would later be cleared by the International Athletic Federation (IAAF). Shortly before the 92 Olympics she quit her athletic career and began to study history in Rostock. She worked as a history and sports teacher.
