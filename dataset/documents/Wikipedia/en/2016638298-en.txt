It was founded in Boise, Idaho. Varney's chief pilot, Leon D. "Lee" Cuddeback, flew the first Contract Air Mail flight in a Swallow biplane from Varney's headquarters in Boise, Idaho to the railroad mail hub of Pasco, Washington on April 6, 1926 and returned the following day with 200 pounds of mailHistory of Flight in the US Seventy-Five Years United. April 6 is regarded in the United Airlines company history as both its own birthdayUnited Airlines Website, United HistoryEra 1: 1910-1925 and the date on which "true" airline service&mdash;operating on fixed routes and fixed schedules&mdash;began in the United States. Varney Airlines' original 1925 hangar served as a portion of the terminal building for the Boise Airport until 2003, when the structure was replaced.]]In 1927, airplane pioneer William Boeing founded his own airline, Boeing Air Transport, and began buying other airmail carriers, including Varney's. Within four years, Boeing's holdings grew to include airlines, airplane and parts manufacturing companies, and several airports. In 1929, the company changed its name to United Aircraft – Transport Corp. In 1930, as the capacity of airplanes proved sufficient to carry not only mail but also passengers, Boeing Air Transport hired a registered nurse, Ellen Church, to assist passengers. United claims Church as the first airline stewardessThe Original Eight: Genesis of the Modern Day Flight Attendant.Following the Air Mail Scandal of 1930, the Air Mail Act of 1934 banned the common ownership of manufacturers and airlines. United Aircraft-Transport's President Philip G. Johnson was forced to resign and moved to Trans-Canada Airlines, the future Air Canada. William Boeing's company was broken into three: a parts supplier (the future United Technologies), an aircraft manufacturer (the Boeing Airplane Company), and an airline group&mdash;United Air Lines. The airline company's new president, hired to make a fresh start as airmail contracts were re-awarded in 1934, was William A. Patterson, who remained as president of United Airlines until 1963.Expansion into a national carrier, on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.]] United's early route system, formed by connecting air mail routes, operated north-and-south along the West Coast, and east-to-west along a transcontinental route from San Francisco via Denver, Colorado to Chicago in the Midwest and on to Washington, DC. The early interconnections during this era became the basis of major United hubs in these cities, and still exist today.On the night of October 11, 1933, a United Boeing 247 exploded in mid-air and crashed near Chesterton, Indiana, killing all seven aboard. Investigation revealed that the explosion was caused by a nitroglycerin bomb placed in the baggage hold. The United Airlines Chesterton Crash is believed to be the first proven case of air sabotage in commercial aviation history. No suspects or motives were ever found.During World War II United-trained ground crews modified airplanes for use as bombers, and transported mail, material, and passengers in the war effort. Post-war United benefited from both the wartime development of new airplane technologies (like the pressurized cabin which permitted planes to fly above the weather) and a boom in customer demand for air travel. This was also the period in which Pan American Airways established a Tokyo hub and revived its Pacific route system that would later be acquired by United.On November 1, 1955, United Airlines Flight 629, which was flying from Stapleton Airport in Denver to Portland, Oregon, was bombed, killing everyone on board the Douglas DC-6B aircraft. The bomb was planted by a man named Jack Graham who placed the bomb in his mother's luggage with the intent of collecting on her life insurance policy. Graham was executed a year after the explosion.

On December 23, 1973, then President Richard Nixon flew as a passenger aboard a United DC-10 flight from Washington Dulles to Los Angeles.

This however turned out not to be the case as 'Air Force One' flew behind in case of an emergency.DeregulationUnited had begun to seek overseas routes in the 1960s, but the Transpacific Route Case (1969) denied them this expansion. It did not gain an overseas route until 1983, when they began flights to Tokyo from Portland and Seattle. In 1985, United agreed to purchase Pan American World Airways' entire Pacific Division, Boeing 747SPs, and L-1011-500s for $750 million. By the end of 1986, United operated flights to 13 Pacific destinations, most of which were purchased from the ailing Pan American World Airways.Economic turmoil, labor unrest, and the pressures of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act greatly affected the company, which incurred losses and saw a greatly increased turnover in its senior management through the 1970s and early 1980s.In May 1981, one week after rival American Airlines launched AAdvantage, the first frequent flyer program, United launched its Mileage Plus. The Wall Street Journal mistakenly reported United's program to be the first.In 1982, United became the launch customer for the Boeing 767, taking its first delivery of 767-200s on August 19.Strike of 1985.]] On May 17, 1985 United's pilots went on a 29-day strike claiming the CEO, Richard Ferris, was trying to "break the unions." They used management's proposed "B-scale" pilot pay rates as proof."Pilot Labor History-1985" ALPA. http://cf.alpa.org/internet/safetytimeline/Labor1980s.htm American Airlines already had a non-merging B-scale for its pilots."ALPA-MEC letter 6-7-85" Letter to all UAL pilots, explaining details of the last minute negotiations Ferris insisted United had to have pilot costs no higher than American's, so he offered United pilots a "word-for-word" contract to match American's, or the same bottom line numbers. The United ALPA-MEC rejected that offer. The only choice left, to achieve parity with American's pilot costs, was to begin a B-scale for United's new-hire pilots."Hard Landing" 1995, by Thomas Petzinger, Chapter 10Ferris wanted that B-scale to merge in the captain's ranks, which was more generous than American's B-scale, that never merged at all. But, the ALPA MEC insisted they merge in the new pilot's sixth-year with the airline. In the final hours before the strike, nearly all issues had been resolved, except for the time length of the B-scale."ALPA-MEC letter 5-17-85" Letter to all UAL pilots, explaining the remaining issues when the strike was called It appeared that would be resolved too as negotiations continued. ALPA negotiators delivered a new counter-proposal at 12:20 A.M. in an effort to avoid the strike. However, MEC Chairman Roger Hall, who was hosting a national teleconference from the Odeum (a convention center in the Chicago suburbs) with F. Lee Bailey, declared the strike was on at 12:01 A.M., on May 17, without further consulting the negotiators, some of whom believed they could find agreement on all contract terms, if the negotiations were allowed to continue. Moments before the ALPA announced strike deadline, they began a "countdown of the final 30 seconds from Chicago" (the Odeum teleconference). Doing that made it impossible to extend the strike deadline, so that the final issues could be resolved without a strike. "UAL letter, 5-21-85" Letter to all UAL pilots, explaining the remaining issues when the strike was called"Airline Pilot Magazine, July 1985" Standing United, pages 8-15This struggle cost the airline USD $1 billion, and provoked a long period of labor unrest and financial deterioration that culminated in bankruptcy nearly 20 years later.Mr. Ferris changed United's parent company's name from UAL Corporation to Allegis in February, 1987 but the name change was short lived.  "United's Parent Is Again UAL." The New York Times. "United Once More." TIME. 2 Following Ferris' termination by the board, Allegis divested its non-airline properties in 1987 and reverted to the name UAL Corp. in May, 1988  That helped clear the path for the United Pilots to do an ESOP takeover of United, which eventually did happen in 1994.Record-setting flightIn 1988, using a 747SP-21 purchased from Pan American World Airways, United flew a 2-stop around-the-world flight to raise money for the Friendship Foundation, to which the plane was 'loaned'. The flight made a very short-lived record for fastest flight around the globe; within a month, a Gulfstream IV business jet had broken Friendship One's record United Airlines Friendship One Sets Short-Lived World Record-Setting FlightEmployee Stock Ownership PlanThe decline of Pan American World Airways continued to offer new opportunities for United. In 1991 the company expanded dramatically, purchasing Pan Am's routes to London Heathrow Airport. In direct negotiations with the UK government, United also obtained rights to fly to Heathrow from Chicago--the only Heathrow rights provided to a US carrier subsequent to the Bermuda II Treaty. However, the aftermath of the Gulf War and increased competition from low-cost carriers led to losses of USD $332M in 1991 and USD$ 957M in 1992. In 1992, United purchased now-defunct Pan Am's Latin American and Caribbean routes and Miami gates, but United allowed months to elapse between Pan Am's demise and its launch of service. During this time, American Airlines nearly doubled in size in Miami and Latin America, and as a result, United never saw much success in the region.aircraft at the gate at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport.]]In 1994, United's pilots, machinists, bag handlers and non-contract employees agreed to acquire 55% of company stock in exchange for 15% to 25% salary concessions. The flight attendants voted to not participate in the deal, and at the beginning some wore buttons saying "we just work here." The Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) made United the largest employee-owned corporation in the world. United used the opportunity to create a low-cost subsidiary, Shuttle by United, in an attempt to compete with low-cost carriers.United made substantial use of its employee-ownership in its marketing communications, with slogans such as "the employee-owners of United invite you to come fly the friendly skies," "we don't just work here," and "thank you for calling United Airlines; please hold and one of our owner-representatives will be with you shortly."The financial outcomes of the ESOP were decidedly uneven for different players. As part of ESOP agreement, United CEO Wolf resigned and took a consulting job with Lazard Freres, the very investment company he had hired to advise United's board during the ESOP buyout process. Stewart Oran, the key legal advisor to the pilots' union, received a $5.5 million package to join the management of the new employee-owned company as legal counsel after the ESOP was formed. USA Today, "Workers took pay cut while others got rich," July 12, 1995 United's unions, having larger voice in running the company, later successfully bargained for significant pay increases, but the effect was only short-term. The rank and file employees were locked in to their stock, which got wiped out in the eventual bankruptcy.It was around this period (in 1993) that United introduced its grey and blue color scheme.

That same year, United opened a major hub at Los Angeles International Airport.United was a launch customer of the Boeing 777 and had significant input on its design. It was also the first airline to introduce the twin-jet in commercial service.In 1998, Delta Air Lines and United introduced a marketing partnership that included a reciprocal redemption agreement between SkyMiles and Mileage Plus programs and shared lounges.Delta Air Lines and United Airlines to end marketing relationship | Airline Industry Information | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; This scheme allowed members of either frequent flier program to earn miles on both carriers and utilize both carriers' lounges.

The offer drew immediate scorn from consumer groups and employees of both airlines. By the following year, regulatory sentiment was against the deal, and United withdrew the offer just before the Department of Justice barred the merger on antitrust grounds in July. The two airlines subsequently formed an amicable partnership that led to US Airways' entrance into the Star Alliance.landing]]May 2000 also saw a bitter contract dispute between United and its pilots' union. Planning for the busy summer season, United had counted on its pilots flying overtime. However, the pilots could not be forced to work overtime, and most pilots refused to fly the extra hours. Although United knew they would have to cancel numerous flights if this were to happen, they did not hire new pilots to make up for the potential shortage. Over the summer, United had to cancel a large portion of its schedule at its major hubs. Eventually, CEO Jim Goodwin and the rest of the management had to get the pilots back in the cockpits and quickly offered the pilots a 48% increase over four years with up to 28% upfront.September 11As part of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, two United Airlines planes were hijacked by terrorists affiliated with al-Qaeda. One aircraft was a Boeing 767-222 (Flight 175) that crashed into the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City, and the other was a Boeing 757-222 (Flight 93) that crashed in rural Pennsylvania. The latter was suspected to have been directed towards the United States Capitol building according to the United States Department of Homeland Security. Only United and American Airlines were significantly affected on September 11, 2001.===Bankruptcy and reorganization=== ]]United, with a strong presence on the West coast, benefited from the dot-com boom, which boosted traffic (especially premium traffic) to its San Francisco hub. This increase was only temporary and when the 'bubble' finally burst United was in a worse position than before because it had failed to keep costs under control. Coupled with a battered network (after the dot-com bust), the September 11 attacks, and skyrocketing oil prices, the company lost $2.14 billion in 2001 on revenues of $16.14 billion. In the same year United applied for a $1.5 billion loan guarantee from the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board established in the wake of the September 11 attacks. When the IAM (a union comprised of ground service workers and mechanics) failed to approve the loan guarantee (while all other unions approved the loan guarantee), the application was rejected in late 2002 and the company was forced to seek debtor-in-possession financing from commercial sources to cover the expected future losses. United tried several times to obtain the government loans, even enlisting several congressmen and senators for help. The Government rejected the application due to poor money management by its corporate officers.Unable to secure additional capital, UAL Corporation filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December. The ESOP was terminated, although by then its shares had become virtually worthless. Blame for the bankruptcy has fallen on the events of September 11, which triggered financial crisis in all the major North American airlines. However, the rise of low-cost carriers, labor disputes, and problems within the management structure of the company also contributed significantly.United continued operations during its bankruptcy, but was forced to cut its costs drastically. Tens of thousands of workers were furloughed, and all city ticket offices in the US closed. The airline canceled several existing and planned routes, and eliminated its entire Latin American gateway and flight crew base at Miami International Airport after March 1, 2004. In 2003, United abandoned its maintenance hubs in Oakland and Indianapolis, even though maintenance was less expensive in Indianapolis, and transferred work to its San Francisco Maintenance Operations Center. Furthermore, they reduced their mainline fleet from 557 (before 9/11) to 460 aircraft.At the same time, the airline continued to invest in new projects. On November 12, 2003, it launched a new low-cost carrier, Ted, to compete with other low-cost airlines. In 2004 it launched its luxury &quot;p.s.&quot; (for "premium service") service on re-configured 757s from JFK Airport in New York City to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service was targeted to business customers and high-end leisure customers in the coast-to-coast market.Financial pressure on the airline was heavy. The SARS epidemic in 2003 depressed traffic on United's extensive Pacific network. The soaring cost of jet fuel ate away remaining profits United made. United implemented several fare hikes on overseas routes, citing rising fuel costs, in 2004 and 2005. Two days after its triumphant first flight to Vietnam, United announced that it would cut U.S. flight capacity by 14% after the holidays and add more international flights, which were more profitable.United took advantage of its Chapter 11 status to negotiate hard-to-cut costs with employees, suppliers, and contractors, including cancellation of feeder contracts with United Express Atlantic Coast Airlines (which became Independence Air) and Air Wisconsin (which became a US Airways Express carrier).Most controversial of all, however, was the 2005 cancellation of its pension plan, the largest such default in U.S. corporate history. It renegotiated its contracts with the pilots' and mechanics' unions for lower pay; however, the Association of Flight Attendants resisted until the bankruptcy court ruled in United's favor. Criticism was also leveled at the CEO, Glenn Tilton, for demanding pay cuts from employees while receiving the highest salary of any major U.S. airline CEO.CEO Compensation Forbes.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Originally slated to exit bankruptcy protection after 2½ years in the third quarter of 2005, United requested yet another extension in light of record-high fuel prices. On August 26, 2005, the bankruptcy court extended the airline's exclusive right to file a reorganization plan to November 1, although it also stated firmly this extension would be the last. United announced at the same time it had raised $3 billion in exit financing and filed its Plan of Reorganization, as announced, on September 7, 2005.The bankruptcy court approved the restructuring plan on January 20, 2006, clearing the way for United to exit bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, and finally return to normal operations.Beyond Chapter 11at San Francisco.]] On December 9, 2004, the airline made history when UA869 (747-400) landed at Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam. The scheduled flight from San Francisco via Hong Kong (SFO-HKG-SGN) was the first by a U.S. airline since the end of the Vietnam War, when Pan Am halted service shortly before the fall of Saigon in 1975.On July 16, 2006, United Airlines announced that it would be moving its headquarters from suburban Elk Grove Village to the Chicago Loop. The Top 350 Executives were moved in the first half of 2007 to 77 West Wacker Drive. The Elk Grove Village campus was renamed an Operations Center.On August 4, 2006, United Airlines formally ended free meals served in the economy cabin on domestic flights. The change came after scaling back the amenity over several years since 2001, until it was finally eliminated when the airline cut it from United's &quot;p.s.&quot; flights.United's current management have called for consolidation in the industry.

The alliance is an agreement to link international networks and share technology and passenger perks. This agreement is basically a "virtual merger" that will include many of the benefits of a merger without the actual costs and restructuring involved. The alliance will take effect in about a year after Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines complete their merger, as that will release Continental from the SkyTeam contract and allow for the required nine-month notice. Additionally, Continental has declared that they will join the Star Alliance, once Delta and Northwest merge.DestinationsUnited Airlines operates 3,300 flights a day to 210 destinations in 30 countries. Route network.]] United operates an extensive domestic route network concentrated in the Midwestern and Western United States. United is also prominent in transcontinental, transatlantic, and transpacific service. It is by far the leading US carrier to Hawaii and largest to Asia and Australia, flying 26,152,441,000 transpacific revenue passenger miles in 2006 or 306 weekly departures; from September 2006-August 2007, United carried 3.3 million passengers to/from the Hawaiian Islands.United is the only US carrier which operates its own aircraft from the US mainland to Australia. (Hawaiian Airlines flies from Honolulu to Sydney and Continental Micronesia, a wholly owned subsidiary of Continental Airlines, maintains a route from Guam to Cairns). United Airlines is the only US carrier to serve Vietnam (via Hong Kong) and Kuwait (until November 7, 2008, when Delta will also start service.).In 1988, the bilateral (though not reciprocal) treaty with Japan was amended to allow additional routes between the two countries. United's application to fly from Chicago to Tokyo, a significant gap in its routes previously, was approved.  United operates a low-cost leisure brand called Ted, which is based out of Denver, Colorado. The name is taken from the last three letters of its parent Uni''ted''. Ted serves leisure destinations within the United States and Mexico with 240+ daily flights utilizing 55 aircraft.
