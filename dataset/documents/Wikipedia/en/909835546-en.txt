 Sodipodi is a computer vector graphics editor. The main author is Lauris Kaplinski, and several other people have contributed to the project. The project is no longer under active developmenthttp://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=loom.20050120T134439-394%40post.gmane.org, but development continues on Inkscape, a 2003 fork of Sodipodi. Sodipodi itself started as a fork of Gill, a vector-graphics program written by Raph Levien.The primary design goal of Sodipodi is to produce a usable editor for vector graphics, and a drawing tool for artists. Although it uses SVG as its native file format (including some extensions to hold metadata), it is not intended to be a full implementation of the SVG standard. Sodipodi imports and exports plain SVG data, and can also export raster graphics in PNG format. The user interface of Sodipodi is a Controlled Single Document Interface (CSDI) similar to The GIMP.Sodipodi is available for Linux and Microsoft Windows. The latest version is 0.34, released on 11 February 2004. Released under the GNU General Public License, Sodipodi is free software.DerivativesSodipodi started a collection of SVG clip art containing symbols and flags from around the world. This work helped inspire the Open Clip Art Library.Inkscape is a fork of Sodipodi founded in 2003 by some Sodipodi developers with different goals, including redesigning the interface and closer compliance with the SVG standard.See alsoList of vector graphics editorsComparison of vector graphics editorsExternal linksInterview with Lauris KaplinskiCategory:Free vector graphics editors Category:Linux vector graphics software Category:Scalable Vector Graphicsde:Sodipodi es:Sodipodi fr:Sodipodi gl:Sodipodi id:Sodipodi hu:Sodipodi nl:Sodipodi pl:Sodipodi pt:Sodipodi tr:Sodipodi
