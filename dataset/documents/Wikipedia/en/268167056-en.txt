[[Image:Blochsphere.svg|thumb|A qubit representation by a Bloch sphere.]]A qubit is not to be confused with a cubit, which is an ancient measure of length.A quantum bit or qubit  (sometimes also qbit) is a unit of quantum information. That information is described by a state vector in a two-level quantum-mechanical system, which is formally equivalent to a two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers.Bit versus qubitA bit is the basic unit of computer information. Regardless of its physical realization, a bit is always understood to be either a 0 or a 1. An analogy to this is a light switch&mdash;the down position can represent 0 (normally equated to off) and the up position can represent 1 (normally equated to on).A qubit has some similarities to a classical bit, but is overall very different. Like a bit, a qubit can have two possible values&mdash;normally a 0 or a 1. The difference is that whereas a bit must be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be 0, 1, or a superposition of both.RepresentationThe states a qubit may be measured in are known as basis states (or vectors). As is the tradition with any sort of quantum states, Dirac, or bra-ket notation is used to represent them. This means that the two computational basis states are conventionally written as |0 \rangle  and |1 \rangle  (pronounced "ket 0" and "ket 1").Qubit statesA pure qubit state is a linear superposition of those two states. This means that the qubit can be represented as a linear combination of |0 \rangle  and |1 \rangle:| \psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle,\,where α'' and ''β are probability amplitudes and can in general both be complex numbers.When we measure this qubit in the standard basis, the probability of outcome |0 \rangle  is | \alpha |^2 and the probability of outcome |1 \rangle  is | \beta |^2. Because the absolute squares of the amplitudes equate to probabilities, it follows that α'' and ''β must be constrained by the equation| \alpha |^2 + | \beta |^2 = 1 \,simply because this ensures you must measure either one state or the other.The state space of a single qubit register can be represented geometrically by the Bloch sphere. This is a two-dimensional space which has an underlying geometry of the surface of a sphere. This essentially means that the single qubit register space has two local degrees of freedom. Represented on such a sphere, a classical bit could lie on only one of the poles.EntanglementAn important distinguishing feature between a qubit and a classical bit is that multiple qubits can exhibit quantum entanglement. Entanglement is a nonlocal property that allows a set of qubits to express higher correlation than is possible in classical systems. Take, for example, two entangled qubits in the Bell state\frac (|00\rangle + |11\rangle).In this state, called an equal superposition, there are equal probabilities of measuring either |00\rangle or |11\rangle, as |1/\sqrt|^2 = 1/2.Imagine that these two entangled qubits are separated, with one each given to Alice and Bob. Alice makes a measurement of her qubit, obtaining&mdash;with equal probabilities&mdash;either |0\rangle or |1\rangle. Because of the qubits' entanglement, Bob must now get the exact same measurement as Alice; i.e., if she measures a |0\rangle, Bob must measure the same, as |00\rangle is the only state where Alice's qubit is a |0\rangle.Entanglement also allows multiple states (such as the Bell state mentioned above) to be acted on simultaneously, unlike classical bits that can only have one value at a time. Entanglement is a necessary ingredient of any quantum computation that cannot be done efficiently on a classical computer.Many of the successes of quantum computation and communication, such as quantum teleportation and superdense coding, make use of entanglement, suggesting that entanglement is a resource that is unique to quantum computation.Quantum registerA number of entangled qubits taken together is a qubit register. Quantum computers perform calculations by manipulating qubits within a register.Variations of the qubitSimilar to the qubit, a qutrit is a unit of quantum information in a 3-level quantum system. This is analogous to the unit of classical information trit. The term "qudit" is used to denote a unit of quantum information in a d-level quantum system.Physical representationAny two-level system can be used as a qubit. Multilevel systems can be used as well, if they possess two states that can be effectively decoupled from the rest (e.g., ground state and first excited state of a nonlinear oscillator). There are various proposals. Several physical implementations which approximate two-level systems to various degrees were successfully realized. Similarly to a classical bit where the state of a transistor in a processor, the magnetization of a surface in a hard disk and the presence of current in a cable can all be used to represent bits in the same computer, an eventual quantum computer is likely to use various combinations of qubits in its design.The following is an incomplete list of physical implementations of qubits, and the choices of basis are by convention only.

In the acknowledgments of his paper, Schumacher states that the term qubit was invented in jest, during a conversation with Bill Wootters. The paper describes a way of compressing states emitted by a quantum source of information so that they require fewer physical resources to store. This procedure is now known as Schumacher compression.ReferencesExternal linksAn update on qubits in the Oct 2005 issue of Scientific AmericanQubit.org cofounded by one of the pioneers in quantum computation, David DeutschCategory:Units of information Category:Quantum information sciencebg:Кюбит ca:Qubit cs:Qubit de:Qubit el:Qubit es:Qubit eo:Kvantumbito fr:Qubit ko:큐비트 it:Qubit he:קיוביט hu:Kvantumbit nl:Qubit ja:量子ビット no:Qubit pl:Kubit pt:Bit quântico ru:Кубит sq:Kjubit sl:Kubit fi:Kubitti sv:Kvantbit vi:Qubit uk:Кюбіт zh:量子位元
