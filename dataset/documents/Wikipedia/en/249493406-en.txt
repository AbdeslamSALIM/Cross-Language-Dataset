Ranunculus acris (Meadow buttercup, Tall buttercup) is one of the more common buttercups across Europe and temperate Eurasia. It is a somewhat hairy plant that has ascending flowing stems bearing glossy yellow flowers about 25&nbsp;mm across. There are five overlapping petals borne above 5 green sepals that soon turn yellow as the flower matures.It has numerous stamens inserted below the ovary and blooms from May to July. As for other members of the genus, the numerous seeds are borne as achenes.When Buttercup plants are handled, naturally occurring ranunculin is broken down to form protoanemonin which is known to cause contact dermatitis in humans and care should therefore be exercised in excessive handling of the plants. The toxins are degraded by drying, so hay containing dried buttercups is safe.Commonly known as 'Meadow Buttercup', 'Tall Buttercup', or 'Tall Field Buttercup'.ReferencesCategory:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Estonia Category:Flora of the United Kingdom Category:Medicinal plants Category:Ranunculaceaede:Scharfer Hahnenfuß es:Ranunculus acris fr:Renoncule âcre is:Brennisóley it:Ranunculus acer lv:Kodīgā gundega nl:Scherpe boterbloem ja:ミヤマキンポウゲ no:Engsoleie pl:Jaskier ostry se:Fiskesrássi fi:Niittyleinikki sv:Smörblomma
