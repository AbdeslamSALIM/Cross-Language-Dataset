It is intended especially for use with old computer games. Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, DOSBox is free software.PortsDOSBox has been ported for many operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The source code has also been forked to provide compatibility on a number of non-x86 PC computer platforms, including the Palm OS, PlayStation Portable, Internet Tablet OS 2008, and the GP2X, on various computing architectures including PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS and ARM.gp2x.deHistoryid Software has used DOSBox to re-release vintage games such as Wolfenstein 3D and Commander Keen on Valve's Steam.steampowered.com In the process, it was reported they violated DOSBox's GPL code , a matter that they later resolved . Activision Blizzard has used DOSBox too to re-release Sierra Entertainment's DOS games. As of August 17 2008, DOSBox has been downloaded 10 million times and is now one of the 50 most downloaded FOSS projectsSourceForge.net: All-Time Top Downloads on SourceForge.net. http://kingofgng.com/eng/2008/08/19/dosbox-downloaded-10-millions-of-times/&lt;/ref&gt;FeaturesDOSBox is a command-line program, configured either by a set of command-line arguments or by editing a plain text configuration file. For ease of use, several graphical front-ends have been developed by the user community.DOSBox wikiDOSBox is a full CPU emulator, capable of running DOS programs that require the CPU to be in either real mode or protected mode. Other similar programs, such as dosemu or VDMs for Windows and OS/2, provide compatibility layers and rely on virtualization capabilities of the 386 family processors. Since DOSBox can emulate its CPU by interpretation, it is independent of its host CPU. However, on systems which provide the i386 instruction set, the option to use dynamic instruction translation is available in DOSBox. Though this setting is less accurate and reliable, it is faster than interpretive CPU emulation.DOSBox is capable of emulating types of graphics and sound hardware. Graphics emulation includes text mode, Hercules, CGA (including composite and 160x100x16 tweaked modes), Tandy, EGA, VGA (including Mode X and other tweaks), VESA, and full S3 Trio 64 emulation. Sound cards available include the AdLib, Gravis Ultrasound, PC speaker, Tandy, Creative Music System/GameBlaster, Sound Blaster 1.x/2.0/Pro/16, MPU-401, and Disney Sound Source. (MT-32/CM-32L emulation is included in unofficial buildsDOSBox Daum Cafe, but not in the official source code repository due to need for copyrighted ROM images.)A popular feature of DOSBox is its ability to capture screenshots and record gameplay footage. The video is compressed using the Zip Motion Block Video codecZMBV (Zip Motion Block Video) codec. In its uncompressed state the footage is almost an exact replica of the actual program. The video recording feature was added in version 0.65. In earlier versions, one had to rely on custom modifications and FrapsRecording video from DosBox ( ~7th March 2006) (Accessed on 2008/07/02) to record video, but the quality and emulator performance was generally very poor. To capture a screenshot, the default key combination is CTRL+F5, and video is CTRL+ALT+F5. Under Linux however, CTRL+ALT+F5 is usually a shortcut for the console terminal screen which means you'll most likely need to change the combination by accessing DOSBox build-in keymapper via CTRL+F1. To stop a video recording, you press the same key combination again. More about captures in DOSBox, can be found here http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Recording_VideoA component that differentiates DOSBox from other emulators is its ability to simulate peer-to-peer or Internet/Intranet networking. This includes modem simulation over TCP/IP, allowing for DOS modem games to be played over modern LANs or the Internet, and IPX network tunneling, which allows for old IPX DOS multiplayer games to be played as UDP/IP over modern LANs or the Internet. Win32 and Linux specific builds support direct serial port access.DOSBox contains its own internal DOS-like shell, rather than being a fully virtual PC emulator like Bochs. Most commands that are typically used in installer batch files are supported, but many of the more advanced commands of later MS-DOS versions (e.g. post-Windows 98 DOS shells) are not. In addition to its internal shell, DOSBox also supports running image files of games and software originally intended to start without any operating system.DOSBox is capable of timing-compatible implementation of the serial ports, and can run older hardware and software dependent on such; however, some USB devices that are supported by the host OS can act as a replacement for older serial port devices when using the emulator.While there is nothing in principle that prevents the running of non-game DOS programs in DOSBox, the DOSBox project has a policy of not adding features that are of no use for DOS games. Also, there is no support for the emulation of post-80486 CPU features. Some unofficial CVS versions contain experimental patches that add support for these elements.See alsoComparison of virtual machinesList of MS-DOS gamesLegacy modeReferences External linksOfficial websiteDOSBox page at GP2X WikiCategory:DOS on IBM PC compatibles Category:DOS emulators Category:Free emulation software Category:GP2X emulation software Category:Linux emulation software Category:Windows emulation software Category:SourceForge projects Category:X86 emulators Category:SDL programs Category:Cross-platform softwareca:DOSBox cs:DOSBox de:DOSBox et:DOSBox es:DOSBox eo:DOSbox fr:DOSBox ko:도스박스 it:DOSBox he:DOSBox nl:DOSBox pl:DOSBox pt:DosBox ru:DOSBox fi:DOSBox sv:DOSBox zh:DOSBox
