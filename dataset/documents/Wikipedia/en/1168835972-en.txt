The group had an impact on the development of hip hop through the 1980s and is credited with breaking hip hop into mainstream music.[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1821231,00.html (nr.40) The Guardian]The Immortals - The Greatest Artists of All Time: 48) Run-DMC.

After completing high school in 1982, Simmons and McDaniels recruited Mizell to play on the turntables. A year later, they released their first single "Sucker MC's", which was well received, peaking at #15 on the R&B charts.Run-D.M.C.: Biography : Rolling Stone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; This was followed by other singles such as "Jam Master Jay" and "Hard Times".Late 1980sThe group achieved commercial success in 1986 with the album Raising Hell. It boasts four tracks that reached the top five on the Billboard Hot 100, including Run-D.M.C.'s rendition of "Walk This Way" with Aerosmith. The song and accompanying video, which received heavy airplay on MTV, are credited with both resurrecting Aerosmith's career and helping break rap into the mainstream.The 1988 album Tougher Than Leather lent its name to the band's film that year, which was directed by Rick Rubin and contained special guest performances by the Beastie Boys and Slick Rick. Run-D.M.C.'s executives at Profile Records were unimpressed by the excessive number of times the Def Jam Records logo popped up in the film, which was mostly because of Russell Simmons' involvement with the project.The group re-invented itself as "gangstas" and released Back from Hell in 1990. The album suffered poor sales. It had two singles, the clean, anti-drug song "Pause", and "The Avenue".In the music video for the song "King of Rock" there is an extended video of Buddy Holly performing on The Ed Sullivan Show.1990sThe group enjoyed mainstream success again in 1993 with Down With the King, which cracked Billboard magazine's Top 10. Pete Rock and CL Smooth contributed verses on the first single, "Down With the King". The album's second single, "Ooh, Watch'cha Gonna Do?", failed to match its predecessor's chart success. Other guests featured on the album were Mad Lion, Q-Tip and Tom Morello.In 1998, Jason Nevins remixed "It's Like That" and "It's Tricky". The remix of "It's Like That" hit number 1 in the United Kingdom, Germany, and many other European countries. A video was made for "It's Like That", although no new footage of Run-D.M.C. appeared in the clip.In 1999, Run-D.M.C. recorded the theme song for WWE wrestling stable D-Generation X entitled "The Kings".Although Run-D.M.C. enjoyed plenty of commercial success, the effects of this were not solely positive. In Arts and Letters: An A-to-Z Reference of Writers, Musicians, and Artists of the African American Experience, the article on Run-D.M.C. notes that when their second album, King of Rock was released in 1985, there were also a number of violent incidents at rap concerts. While the media lauded Run-D.M.C. for their music, it also began to focus on "rap as a reflection of violence and drug abuse among young black males." Thus, the group felt torn between their mainstream appeal during the time of negativity in other manifestations of rap music.Run-D.M.C. also made an appearance in a rare version of the music video "Bodyrock" by Moby.2000s&amp;ndash;presentIn 2000, the group contributed to the album WWF Aggression with their version of the D-Generation X theme song "The Kings".In 2004, Run-DMC were honored on the first annual VH1 Hip Hop HonorsDMC has recently been featured in the new video game, Guitar Hero: Aerosmith making a cameo in the song "Walk this Way" and "King of Rock".RetirementAfter group member Jam-Master Jay was shot and killed on October 30, 2002, Run-D.M.C. announced their retirement.CNN.com - Surviving Run-DMC members retire group - Nov. 6, 2002&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Rev Run joined Kid Rock's 2008 "Rock N Roll Revival Tour" performing "It's Like That", "It's Tricky", "You Be Illin'", "Run's House", "Here We Go", "King of Rock" and "Walk This Way" with Kid Rock.
