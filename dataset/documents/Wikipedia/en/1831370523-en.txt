  Crude birth rate is the natality or childbirths per 1,000 people per year.See "Fertility rates"; Economic Geography Glossary at University of WashingtonIt can be represented by CBR = \frac where n is the number of childbirths in that year, and p is the current population. This figure is combined with the crude death rate to produce the rate of natural population growth (natural in that it does not take into account net migration).As of 2007, the average birth rate for the whole world is 20.3 per year per 1000 total population, which for a world population of 6.6 billion comes to 134 million babies per year.Another indicator of fertility is frequently used: the total fertility rate — average number of children born to each woman over the course of her life. In general, the total fertility rate is a better indicator of (current) fertility rates because unlike the crude birth rate it is not affected by the age distribution of the population.Fertility rates tend to be higher in less economically developed countries and lower in more economically developed countries.The birth rate is an item of concern and policy for a number of national governments. Some, including those of Italy and Malaysia, seek to increase the national birth rate using measures such as financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, others aim to reduce the birth rate. For example, the government of China has adopted a mandatory One child policy, while non-coercive measures such as improved information about and availability of birth control have achieved similar results in countries such as IranOther methods of measuring birth rate[[Image:Birthratechart.png|thumb|321 px|right|'Total number of births in the United States, 1934 to present']]Total number of birthsGeneral fertility rate (GFR) – This measures the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 or 15 to 49.Standardised birth rate (SBR) – This compares the age-sex structure to a hypothetical standard population.Total fertility rate (TFR) – The mean number of children a woman is expected to bear during her child-bearing years. It is also independent of the age-sex structure of the population.Factors affecting birth ratePro-natalist policies and Antinatalist policies from governmentExisting age-sex structureAvailability of family planning servicesSocial and religious beliefs - especially in relation to contraception and abortionFemale literacy levelsEconomic prosperity (although in theory when the economy is doing well families can afford to have more children in practice the higher the economic prosperity the lower the birth rate).Poverty levels – children can be seen as an economic resource in developing countries as they can earn money.Infant Mortality Rate – a family may have more children if a country's IMR is high as it is likely some of those children will die.UrbanizationTypical age of marriagePension availabilityConflictSee alsoDeath rateList of countries by birth rateList of countries by fertility rateOptimum Population TrustPopulation ageingTotal fertility rateReferencesExternal linksCIA World Factbook Birth Rate List by RankCategory:Population Category:Population ecology Category:Demographyast:Natalidá bg:Раждаемост ca:Taxa de natalitat cs:Porodnost da:Fødselsrate de:Geburtenziffer es:Tasa bruta de natalidad fr:Taux de natalité hr:Natalitet id:Tingkat kelahiran it:Tasso di natalità nl:Geboortecijfer ja:出生率 no:Fødselsrate pl:Współczynnik urodzeń pt:Taxa de natalidade ro:Natalitate ru:Рождаемость sq:Nataliteti sk:Pôrodnosť sr:Наталитет sh:Natalitet fi:Syntyvyys sv:Nativitet zh:出生率
