  North West England is one of the nine official regions of England. It has a population of 6,853,200 and comprises five counties of England – Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire.North West England is bounded on the west by the Irish Sea and on the east by The Pennines mountain range. The region extends from the Scottish Borders in the north to the Welsh Mountains in the south. The highest point in North West England (and the highest peak in England) is Scafell Pike, Cumbria, at a height of .Two large conurbations, centred on the cities of Liverpool and Manchester, occupy the south of the region and are its largest centres of population. The north of the region, including northern Lancashire and Cumbria, is largely rural.Local governmentThe official region consists of the following subdivisions:Ceremonial county]]County/UnitaryDistrictsCheshireCheshire †Chester]], Crewe and Nantwich, Congleton, Macclesfield, Vale RoyalWarrington U.A.Halton U.A.Cumbria †Barrow-in-Furness]], South Lakeland, Copeland, Allerdale, Eden, CarlisleGreater Manchester *Bolton]], Bury, Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, WiganLancashireLancashire †Fylde]], Preston, Wyre, Lancaster, Ribble Valley, Pendle, Burnley, Rossendale, HyndburnBlackpool U.A.Blackburn with Darwen U.A.Merseyside *Knowsley]], Liverpool, St. Helens, Sefton, WirralKey: shire county = † | metropolitan county = *After abolition of the Greater Manchester and Merseyside County Councils in 1986, power was transferred to the Metropolitan Boroughs, effectively making them Unitary Authorities.DemographicsPopulation, Density and SettlementsRegion/CountyPopulationPopulation DensityLargest town/cityLargest metropolitan areaNorth West England6,853,200475/km²Manchester (458,100)Greater Manchester Urban Area (2,240,230)Greater Manchester2,553,8001,997/km²Manchester (458,100)Greater Manchester Urban Area (2,240,230)Lancashire1,449,600468/km²Preston (184,836 )Preston/Chorley/Leyland urban Area]] (335,000)Merseyside1,353,6002,118/km²Liverpool (436,100)Liverpool Urban Area (816,000)Cheshire999,800424/km²Chester (77,040)Warrington (194,700)Cumbria496,20073/km²Barrow-in-Furness (59, 789)City of Carlisle (105,200)North West England's population accounts for just over 13% of England's overall population. 37.86% of the North West's population resides in Greater Manchester, 21.39% in Lancashire, 20.30% in Merseyside, 14.76% in Cheshire and 7.41% live in the largest county geographically, Cumbria.EthnicityThis data is based on 2007 estimateshttp://www.statistics.gov.uk/.92.2% (6,318,650) of people in the region classified themselves as 'White' in the 2001 UK Census. 89.5% (6,113,614) of the overall regional population is White British, 1.0% (68,532) White Irish and 1.7% (116,504) White Other.The Mixed Race population makes up 1.2% (82,238) of the region's population. There are 315,247 South Asians in the region, making up 4.6% of the population, and 1.2% Blacks (82,238). 0.7% of the population (47,972) is Chinese and 0.4% (27,413) of people classified themselves as 'Other' in the census http://www.cre.gov.uk/diversity/map/northwest/index.html.North West England is a very diverse region, and cities such as Manchester and Liverpool are amongst the most diverse in Europe. 19.4% of Blackburn with Darwen's population are Muslim, the third highest among all local authorities in the United Kingdom and the highest outside London and a significant South Asian population of over 20%. Areas such as Moss Side in Greater Manchester are home to over a 30% Black British population. Even isolated towns such as Barrow-in-Furness (considered to be at the end of England's largest cul-de-sac) have significant and ever increasing ethnic minority populations, the town now has higher proportions of people belonging to the 'Other' ethnic group than the UK average which can only be said for a few North West towns. The town of St. Helens within Merseyside unusually for a city-area has the lowest percentage of ethnic minorities in the whole of England. The City of Liverpool is now over 800 years old, and is one of the few places in Britain where ethnic minority populations can be traced back over dozens of decades, being one of the closest English cities to Ireland it is home to a significant Irish population, and links to the British Slave Trade resulted in the city being home to one of the first ever Afro-Caribbean communities in the UK.SummarisedThere are around 400,000 people living in the North West of any Asian ethnicity (5.8% of regions population), England average is around 9%Around 125,000 people from the North West are of full or partial Sub-African and/ or Caribbean descent (1.8% of regions population), England average is around 4%The single largest non-white ethnic group in the North West are Pakistanis, numbering 133,900Place of birthPlease note that the list below is not how many people belong to each ethnic group (i.e. there are over 25,000 ethnic Italians in Manchester aloneBBC NEWS | England | Manchester | Italians revolt over church closure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;, whilst only 6,000 Italian born people live in the North West), please note also that due to recent immigration to the UK, the numbers below are likely to be substantially lower than the current populations, and countries such as Poland would most certainly make the top 5. The fifteen most common countries of birth in 2001 for North West citizens were as follows http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=3&amp;b=276778&amp;c=Manchester&amp;d=13&amp;e=13&amp;g=351271&amp;i=1001x1003x1004&amp;o=198&amp;m=0&amp;r=1&amp;s=1198759152617&amp;enc=1&amp;dsFamilyId=85:England - 6,169,753Scotland - 109,163Wales - 73,850Ireland - 56,887Pakistan - 46,529Northern Ireland - 34,879India - 34,600Germany - 19,931China and Hong Kong - 15,491Bangladesh - 13,746South Africa - 7,740United States - 7,037Jamaica - 6,661Italy - 6,325Australia - 5,880ReligionThe table below is based in the 2001 UK Census.RegionChristianMuslimHinduSikhJewishBuddhistOtherNo Religion/ Not StatedNorth West England78.0%3.0%0.4%0.1%0.4%0.2%0.2%17.7%United Kingdom71.6%2.7%1.0%0.6%0.5%0.3%0.3%23.2%Language and dialectUp until the 12th Century, Cumbric (a Celtic language), was spoken throughout Northwest England. This language was gradually replaced by Old/Middle English, but the language still survives in various placenames throughout the North West, and reconstructions of the language are being attempted. In modern times, English is the most spoken language in the North West, with a large percentage of the population being fluent in it, and close to 100% being conversational in it. To the north-east of the region, within the historic boundaries of Cumberland, the Cumbrian dialect is dominant. The historical county of Lancashire covered a vast amount of land, and the Lancashire dialect and accent is still predominant throughout the county, and stretches as far north as Furness in South Cumbria to Manchester to the very south of the region. One of the regions most distinctive accents in the Scouse accent which originates from the Merseyside area. The region's English accents are among those referred to as 'Northern English'.Large immigrant populations in the North West result in the presence of significant immigrant languages. South Asian languages such as Urdu, Hindi and Punjabi are considerably widespread, with the largest amount of speakers resideing in Preston, Blackburn and Manchester. The Chinese once made up the largest minority in the region, and still do to the far north where Chinese is spoken by small but significant communities. Since the expansion of the EU over 1 million Poles have immigrated to the UK, with a large amount settling in the North West, places such as Crewe alongside the larger cities make Polish written information available for the public, to much controversy. Other immigrant languages with a presence in the North West are Spanish, mainly amongst the Latin American communities in Barrow-in-Furness, Lancaster, Liverpool and Manchester, as well as various other Eastern European and Asian languages.The most taught languages in schools across the North West are English, French and German. Spanish and Italian are available at older levels, and in cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, even Urdu and Mandarin are being taught to help maintain links between the local minority populations.Important cities and townsGM = Greater Manchester, ME = Merseyside, CU = Cumbria, LA = Lancashire, CH = Cheshire]]  skyline across the River Mersey]]  Skyline]]  seen along the Irish Sea Coast]]town centre]]  city centre across the River Lune and Millennium Bridge]]  city centre with medieval buildings]]  townscape]]  skyline viewed from the east]]    Population  400,000Manchester, GMLiverpool, ME'''Population  100,000Warrington, CHBlackpool, LABolton, GMStockport, GMPreston, LABlackburn, LAOldham, GMSt Helens, ME'''Population  70,000Southport, MERochdale, GMBirkenhead, MEWigan, GMChester, CHBurnley, LASalford, GMCarlisle, CU'''Population  50,000Barrow-in-Furness, CUCrewe, CHWythenshawe, GMEllesmere Port, CHRuncorn, CHBury, GMBootle, MEWallasey, MEHuyton, MEWidnes, CHSale, GMMacclesfield, CH Population  30,000Lancaster, LAMiddleton, GMMorecambe, LAStretford, GMAshton-under-Lyne, GMLeigh, GMSwinton, GMLytham St Annes, LAUrmston, GMWalkden, GMAltrincham, GMLeyland, LASkelmersdale, LAEccles, GMAccrington, LADarwen, LADenton, GMRadcliffe, GMTyldesley, GMChorley, LAChadderton, GMPrestwich, GMHyde, GMThornton-Cleveleys, LAWilmslow, CHReddish, GM Population  20,000Northwich,CWWinsford, CHHaslingden, LANelson, LAMaghull, MEAshton-in-Makerfield, GMHeywood, GMFleetwood, LAKendal, CUWhitehaven, CUFarnworth, GMSouth Turton, GMWorkington, CUFormby, MESaddleworth, GMMarple, GMHindley, GMOrmskirk, LAWhitefield, GMDroylsden, GMGolborne, GMWesthoughton, GMCongleton, CHStalybridge, GMKirkham, LAClitheroe, LARawtenstall, LAShaw and Crompton, GMPenwortham, LARoyton, GMFailsworth, GMColne, LAMetropolitan areasSee also List of North West England cities and metropolitan areas by populationThe five largest metropolitan areas in the North West are as follows:Greater Manchester - population 2,240,230Greater Liverpool Urban Area - 1,365,900Greater Preston - 335,000Wigan Urban Area - 166,840Macclesfield Urban Area - 150,500The Manchester - Liverpool Megapolis which is a more or less constant corridor of population is home to 4,209,132 peopleElected regional assembly.]] It is one of the two regions (along with Yorkshire and the Humber) that were expected to hold a referendum on the establishment of an elected regional assembly. However, when the North East region of England rejected having an elected regional assembly in a referendum, further referendums where cancelled and the proposals for elected regional assemblies in England put on hold. The regional leaders forum, 4NW, an unelected quango, is based on Waterside Drive in Wigan.European ParliamentThe North West England European Parliament constituency has the same boundaries as the Region.HistoryTen English regions were established by the government in 1994. At that time, Merseyside, which already had its own Government Office, formerly the Merseyside Task Force, was regarded as a separate region. In 1998, Merseyside was merged into the North West region. This action was controversial in some quarters.TransportRoadis one of the North West's primary roads]]RegionwideRegionwide the principal road link is the M6, this runs all the way from Carlisle and Scotland in the north to Warrington in the south, connecting such towns and cities as Penrith, Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Liverpool and Manchester. The M6 intersects many of the North West's motorways and A-roads, and carries almost 120,000 vehicles per day (41,975,000 per year)..]]Greater Manchester and MerseysideThe Greater Manchester and Merseyside areas are home to almost 4 million people, and over half the region's population. The road networks intertwining these metropolitan areas are extremely important to the economy and are largely motorway, including the M62 which crosses the entire country (east to west – Hull to Liverpool), this motorway directly connects the cities of Manchester and Liverpool. The M62 sees 78,000 vehicles using the motorway in the North West per day. The Merseyside-Manchester region has many motorways, that serve many millions on a daily basis, other include the M61 which connects Manchester to Preston, the M56 which runs south of Manchester to Cheshire and Wales, The M57 and M58 motorways run north of Liverpool, and connect towns such as St Helens and Wigan. The M60 is Manchester's ring road, the M67 and M66 motorways run east and north respectively, both of these motorways are under  and link Manchester to smaller outlying settlements. On top of this there are countless numbers of A-roads, B-roads and minor roads which circle, entwine and serve these two major metropolises. For more information, see: Transport in Manchester., a major road crossing the border.]]CumbriaIn Cumbria the M6 runs all the way down the east of the county connecting the very north of England to the Lancashire border. The A590 links Barrow-in-Furness to Kendal with around 14,000 vehicles per day. The A595 runs all the way along the West Cumbrian coast beginning near Barrow and ending in Carlisle, linking towns such as Whitehaven and Workington. The A591 road runs from Kendal to the centre of the county connecting Lake District settlements like Windermere, Ambleside and Keswick. Other important A-roads include the A5092, A66, A596 and A74 (connecting Carlisle and the M6 to Scotland and the major A74 road).LancashireThe Lancashire economy relies strongly on the M6 which also runs from north to south (Lancaster to Chorley). Other motorways in the region include the fairly short M55 which connects the cities of Preston and Blackpool at 11.5 miles (18.3 km) in length. The M65 motorway runs from east to west starting in the town of Colne, running through Burnley, Accrington, Blackburn, Preston and entering Merseyside linking the M6 to the M58. Lancashire is home to many A-roads. The Lancaster-Morecambe area is served by the A683 and A589 roads, the Blackpool-Fylde-Fleetwood area is home to the A587, A584, A583 and A585 roads. The city of Preston and its surroundings are served by the A6, A59, A583, A582 and to the very south-east, the M61 motorway. To the east of the county are the A59, A6119, A677, A679, A666, A680, A56, A646 and A682.CheshireIn Cheshire there are three motorways the M6, the M56 (linking Chester to the east), the M53 (linking Chester to Birkenhead) and the M62, which runs just along the county's northern border with Merseyside and Greater Manchester. The Cheshire road system is made up of 3417 miles (5500 km) of highway, and the principal one (M6) carries 140,000 vehicles in the county daily, linking the North West to the West Midlands. The county town of Chester is served by the A55, A483 and A494 roads which lead to all directions of the UK including Wales, which part of the city lies in. To the west of the M6, Crewe, Northwich and Sandbach are served by the A54, A51, A49, A533 and A530 roads, these all eventually link up connecting the towns to the larger cities, including Stoke-on-Trent to the south. To the east of the M6 in Cheshire lies the Peak District, and towns such as Macclesfield and Congleton which are served by the A6, A537, A536, A34, A523 and A566 roads.AirThe primary international airport in the region is Manchester Airport, which served 22.1 million passengers in 2007 (18.7 million of which were international) CAA 2007 Annual Airport Statistics, more than some of the world's major aviation hubs, including Los Angeles International Airport. The airport is home to three terminals (plus the World Freight Terminal), which serve destinations worldwide.
