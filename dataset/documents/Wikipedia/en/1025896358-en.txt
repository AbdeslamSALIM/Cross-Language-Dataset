During his career, that lasted until 1989, he won 193 races. In Italy he gave birth to a famous rivalry with Francesco Moser, like those of Alfredo Binda with Learco Guerra, and Fausto Coppi with Gino Bartali.In 1978 Saronni won three stages in the Giro d'Italia. In total he would win 24 stages in this race, winning the overall twice (1979 and 1983).In 1982 he won the World Cycling Championship at Goodwood House, England, beating American Greg LeMond. His final sprint was so impressive that it gained him the nickname of "Goodwood rifle-shot". The previous year he had won a silver medal, as he had been overcome in the final by Freddy Maertens of Belgium. In 1982 Saronni also won the Giro di Lombardia.At the beginning of 1983 another striking sprint gave him the Milan-Sanremo classic, after three consecutive second places in that race. This was Saronni's last great victory.Today Saronni works as team manager of Damiano Cunego's Lampre-Fondital formation of Italy and lives in Parabiago, Lombardy.== Major victories == 1977Giro del VenetoTre Valli Varesine1978Tirreno-Adriatico3 stages in the Giro d'ItaliaCoppa AgostoniGiro di Puglia1979Giro d'Italia:1st overallMaglia ciclamino (points classification)Winner 3 stagesZüri-MetzgeteTour de RomandieGrand Prix du Midi LibreTre Valli VaresineTrofeo Baracchi1980La Flèche WallonneGiro d'Italia:Winner 7 stagesMaglia ciclamino (points classification) Italian National Road Race ChampionshipTre Valli VaresineCoppa BernocchiTrittico LombardoGiro di Puglia1981Giro d'Italia:Winner 3 stagesMaglia ciclamino (points classification)Giro di RomagnaTrofeo LaiguegliaCoppa Bernocchi1982 World Road Cycling ChampionshipsGiro di Lombardia3 stages in the Giro d'ItaliaTour de SuisseTirreno-AdriaticoGiro del TrentinoMilano-TorinoCoppa Agostoni1983Giro d'Italia:1st overallMaglia ciclamino (points classification)Winner 3 stagesMilan-Sanremo2 stages in the Vuelta a España19852 stages in the Giro d'Italia1986Trofeo Baracchi1988Tre Valli VaresineGiro di PugliaTeams1977-1979 : SCIC1980-1981 : Gis1982-1988 : Del Tongo1989 : Malvor1990 : Diana-ColnagoExternal linksArticle about the controversial 1982 Cycling World Championship    Category:Italian cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia winners Category:Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:World cycling champions Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:People from the Province of Milanda:Giuseppe Saronni de:Giuseppe Saronni es:Giuseppe Saronni fr:Giuseppe Saronni it:Giuseppe Saronni nl:Giuseppe Saronni ja:ジュゼッペ・サローニ no:Giuseppe Saronni pl:Giuseppe Saronni fi:Giuseppe Saronni
