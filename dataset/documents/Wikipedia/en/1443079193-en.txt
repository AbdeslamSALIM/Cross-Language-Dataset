 A talk show (American) or chat show (Global) is a television or radio program where one person or group of people come together to discuss various topics put forth by a talk show host. Sometimes, talk shows feature a panel of guests, usually consisting of a group of people who are learned or who have great experience in relation to whatever issue is being discussed on the show for that episode. Other times, a single guest discusses their work or area of expertise with a host or co-hosts. A call-in show takes live phonecalls from callers listening at home, in their cars, etc.Genres Television talk shows often feature celebrity guests who talk about their work and personal lives as well as the their latest films, TV shows, music recordings or other projects they'd like to promote to the public. The hosts are often comedians who open the shows with comedy monologues.Talk-radio host Howard Stern also hosted a talk show that was syndicated nationally, then moved to satellite radio's Sirius. The tabloid talk show genre, pioneered by Phil Donahue but popularized by Oprah Winfrey was extremely popular during the last two decades of the 20th century.Politics are hardly the only subject of American talk shows, however. Other radio talk show subjects include Car Talk hosted by NPR and Coast to Coast AM hosted by Art Bell and George Noory which discusses topics of the paranormal, conspiracy theories, fringe science and the just plain weird. Sports talk shows are also very popular ranging from high-budget shows like The Best Damn Sports Show Period to Max Kellerman's original public access show Max on Boxing.HistoryTalk shows have been broadcast on television since the earliest days of the medium. Late night talk shows are among the oldest, the oldest of which is RTÉ's The Late Late Show. Current late night talk shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Show with David Letterman have aired for years, featuring celebrity guests and comedy sketches. TV news pioneer Edward R. Murrow hosted a talk show entitled Small World in the late 1950s and since then, political TV talk shows have predominantly aired on Sunday mornings.Syndicated daily talk shows range from tabloid talk shows, such as The Jerry Springer Show to celebrity interview shows like Ellen to industry leader The Oprah Winfrey Show which popularized the former genre and has been evolving towards the latter.Syndicated daily talk shows began to gain more popularity during the mid-1970's and reached their height of with the rise of the tabloid talk show. Morning talk shows gradually replaced earlier forms of programming - there were a plethora of morning game shows during the 1960's and early to mid-1970's, and some stations formerly showed a morning movie in the time slot that many talk shows now occupy.Talk shows have more recently started to appear on Internet Radio. Also, several internet blogs are in talk show format including the Baugh Experience.The Guinness world record of 33 hours for longest talk show was broken in 28 August 2007 by Davor Dretar Drele and Kristijan Petrović - Kiky in Varaždin, Croatia during the Špancir festival. The show lasted for 35 hours.VTV televizija - Vijesti - Usprkos kiÅ¡i Kiky i Drele i dalje u talk-showu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Varaždinska televizija: 35 sati talk showa za Guinnessa - Sarajevo-x.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;List of examplesNote: Some of the talk shows listed below are temporarily or permanently off the air or have not premiered yet.Hungarian languageNap-Kelte (Early Political Show - present)Reggeli (Early Show -present)Esti Showder Fábry Sándorral (Late Show - present)Mónika Show (Afternoon Show - present)Mokka (Morning Show - present)Szulák és Más (Evening Talk Show - present)Jam (Morning Show - present)Havas (Evening Talk Show - present)Joshi Bharat (Afternoon Talk Show - present)Esti Frizbi Hajdú Péterrel (Evening Talk Show - present)Barbara Show (Afternoon Talk Show)Szulák Andrea Show (Late Talk Show)Liptai Claudia Show (Late Talk Show)Claudia Show (Afternoon Show)Balázs Show (temporarily not in the screen of RTL Klub)Portuguese languagePortugalSexta á Noite - Friday at Night (January, 2008 - May, 2008)As Tardes da Júlia - Júlia's Afternoons (April, 2007 - present)Contacto - Contact - (January, 2006 - present)Dr. Preciso de Ajuda - Dr I Need Help (2006 - temporarly not in screen)AB...Sexo - AB...Sex (2006-2007)Clube Morangos - Strawberries Club (2006)Câmara Clara - Clear Chamber - (September, 2005 - present)Fátima - Fátima - (December, 2005 - present)Bon Chic - Bon Chic (2005)Você na TV! - You in TV - (September, 2004 - present)Portugal no Coração - Portugal in the Heart - (February, 2003 - present)Vidas Reais - Real Lifes (2003)Domingo é Domingo - Sunday is Sunday (2003)A vida é bela - Live is Good (2002, 2004)Olá Portugal - Hi Portugal (September, 2002 - September, 2004)As Manhãs de Sofia - Sofia's Moornings'' (February, 2002 - September, 2002)Domingo Fantástico - Fantastic Sunady (2002)Noites Marcianas - Martian Nights (February, 2001 - 2002)Às duas por três - By two to thee (2001-2004)Herman SIC - Herman SIC (2000-2006)SIC 10 Horas - SIC 10 Hours (1999-2005)Fátima Lopes - Fátima Lopes (1998)Mundo VIP - VIP World (1997-2001)Praça da Alegria - Square of the Joy (September, 1995 - present)Big Show SIC - Big Show SIC (1995-2001)Perdoa-me - Forgive Me (1995)Ponto de Encontro - Meeting Point (1994-1996)All You Need Is Love (1994)A Noite da Má Língua - The night of the bad language (1991-1995 - 2004-2005)BrazilPrograma do JôCanal LivreEntrevista RecordFrench languageFranceOn a tout essayéOn n'a pas tout ditLe Grand JournalTout le monde en parleOn n'est pas couchéOn ne peut pas plaire à tout le mondeT'empêches tout le monde de dormirLa méthode CauetToute une histoireEnglish languageAfter DarkAmerican MorningAround the HornThe Arsenio Hall ShowAttitudesJerome T.
