The family Cyperaceae, or the sedges, is a taxon of monocot flowering plants that superficially resemble grasses or rushes. The family is large, with some 4,000 species described in about 70 genera. These species are widely distributed, with the centers of diversity for the group occurring in tropical Asia and tropical South America. While sedges may be found growing in all kinds of situations, many are associated with wetlands, or with poor soils.Some well-known sedges include the water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) and the papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus), from which the Ancient Egyptian writing material was made. This family also includes cotton-grass (Eriophorum), spike-rush (Eleocharis), sawgrass (Cladium), nutsedge or nutgrass (Cyperus rotundus, a common lawn weed), the large genus of Carex, and white star sedge (Rhynchospora colorata).Features distinguishing members of the sedge family from grasses or rushes is that members of the sedge family have triangular stems (with occasional exceptions), and their leaves are spirally arranged in three ranks (grasses have alternate leaves forming two ranks).Selected genera[[Image:Eriophorum latifolium1.jpg|thumb|Broad-leaved Cotton-grass (Eriophorum latifolium)]]References== External links ==Interactive Key to CarexFamily Cyperaceae Flowers in Israel* Category:Poales Category:Plant familiesca:Ciperàcia cs:Šáchorovité da:Halvgræs-familien de:Sauergrasgewächse et:Lõikheinalised es:Cyperaceae eo:Ciperacoj fa:جگنیان fr:Cyperaceae hsb:Cachorowe rostliny is:Stararætt it:Cyperaceae ka:ისლისებრნი la:Cyperaceae lt:Viksvuoliniai hu:Palkafélék nl:Cypergrassenfamilie ja:カヤツリグサ科 no:Halvgrasfamilien nn:Halvgras pl:Ciborowate pt:Cyperaceae ro:Cyperaceae qu:Runtuma yura rikch'aq ayllu ru:Осоковые sr:Cyperaceae fi:Sarakasvit sv:Halvgräs th:กก vi:Họ Cói to:Pako tr:Papirüsgiller zh:莎草科
