It is the capital of the department of Oruro.  2007]]  The city was first founded in 1606 as a silver-mining-center in the Urus region. At the time, it was named Real Villa de Don Felipe de Austria after the Spanish monarch Philip III. It was eventually abandoned as the mines became exhausted, but was reestablished in the late nineteenth century, this time as a tin-mining-center. For a time, the La Salvadora tin-mine was the most important source of tin in the world. Gradually, this resource was also exhausted, and Oruro again went into a decline. The city does manage, however, to attract tourists to its carnival, the Carnaval de Oruro, considered one of the great folkloric events in South America for its masked "devil-dances".Oruro was named after the native tribe "Uru-Uru".The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oruro.The Oruro Symphony Orchestra is based in Oruro.External links[http://www.orurocarnaval.com A detailed description of the Carnival by photos and external linksInformation and photos on the Diablada, the Anata Andina and the indigenous cultureBOLIVIAN DANCES!Category:Cities, towns and villages in Bolivia Category:Palindromic place names Category:Settlements established in 1606ar:أورورو ay:Ururu be-x-old:Арура de:Oruro es:Oruro eu:Oruro fr:Oruro id:Oruro it:Oruro lt:Oruras nl:Oruro (stad) pl:Oruro (miasto) pt:Oruro ro:Oruro qu:Uru-Uru uk:Оруро zh:奥鲁罗
