On a sub-orbital spaceflight, a spacecraft enters outer space but then returns to the planetary surface (such as Earth) without making a complete orbit. For an orbital spaceflight, a spacecraft enters a closed orbit around the planetary body. Spacecraft used for human spaceflights carry people on board as crew or passengers. Spacecraft used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spacecraft that leave the vicinity of the planetary body are space probes. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around the planetary body are artificial satellites. Starships, which are built for interstellar travel, are so far a theoretical concept only.Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, planetary exploration and space tourism. Spacecraft and space travel are common themes in works of science fiction.Spacecraft subsystemsA spacecraft system comprises various subsystems, dependent upon mission profile. Spacecraft subsystems may include: attitude determination and control (variously called ADAC, ADC or ACS), guidance, navigation and control (GNC or GN&C), communications (COMS), command and data handling (CDH or C&DH), power (EPS), thermal control (TCS), propulsion, structures, and payload.Life supportSpacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a life support system for the crew.Attitude controlSpacecraft need an attitude control subsystem to be correctly oriented in space and respond to external torques and forces properly. The attitude control subsystem consists of sensors and actuators, together with controlling algorithms. The attitude control subsystem permits proper pointing for the science objective, sun pointing for power to the solar arrays and earth-pointing for communications.GNCGuidance refers to the calculation of the commands (usually done by the CDH subsystem) needed to steer the spacecraft where it is desired to be. Navigation means determining a spacecraft's orbital elements or position. Control means adjusting the path of the spacecraft to meet mission requirements. On some missions, GNC and Attitude Control are combined into one subsystem of the spacecraft.Command and data handlingThe CDH subsystem receives commands from the communications subsystem, performs validation and decoding of the commands, and distributes the commands to the appropriate spacecraft subsystems and components. The CDH also receives housekeeping data and science data from the other spacecraft subsystems and components, and packages the data for storage on a solid state recorder or transmission to the ground via the communications subsystem. Other functions of the CDH include maintaining the spacecraft clock and state-of-health monitoring.PowerSpacecraft need an electrical power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems. For spacecraft near the Sun, solar panels are frequently used to generate electrical power. Spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations, for example Jupiter, might employ a Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (RTG) to generate electrical power. Electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a power distribution unit over an electrical bus to other spacecraft components. Batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator, and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available, for example when a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) spacecraft is eclipsed by the Earth.Thermal controlSpacecraft must be engineered to withstand transit through the Earth's atmosphere and the space environment. They must operate in a vacuum with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds of degrees Celsius as well as (if subject to reentry) in the presence of plasmas. Material requirements are such that either high melting temperature, low density materials such as Be and C-C or (possibly due to the lower thickness requirements despite its high density) W or ablative C-C composites are used. Depending on mission profile, spacecraft may also need to operate on the surface of another planetary body. The thermal control subsystem can be passive, dependent on the selection of materials with specific radiative properties. Active thermal control makes use of electrical heaters and certain actuators such as louvers to control temperature ranges of equipments within specific ranges., like this Proton rocket, is typically used to bring a spacecraft to orbit.]]PropulsionSpacecraft may or may not have a propulsion subsystem, depending upon whether or not the mission profile calls for propulsion. The ''Swift'' spacecraft is an example of a spacecraft that does not have a propulsion subsystem. Typically though, LEO spacecraft (for example ''Terra (EOS AM-1)'' include a propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments (called drag make-up maneuvers) and inclination adjustment maneuvers. A propulsion system is also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers. Components of a conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel, tankage, valves, pipes, and thrusters. The TCS interfaces with the propulsion subsystem by monitoring the temperature of those components, and by preheating tanks and thrusters in preparation for a spacecraft maneuver.StructuresSpacecraft must be engineered to withstand launch loads imparted by the launch vehicle, and must have a point of attachment for all the other subsystems. Depending upon mission profile, the structural subsystem might need to withstand loads imparted by entry into the atmosphere of another planetary body, and landing on the surface of another planetary body.PayloadThe payload is dependent upon the mission of the spacecraft, and is typically regarded as the part of the spacecraft "that pays the bills". Typical payloads could include scientific instruments (cameras, telescopes, or particle detectors, for example), cargo, or a human crew.Ground segmentThe ground segment, though not technically part of the spacecraft, is vital to the operation of the spacecraft. Typical components of a ground segment in use during normal operations include a mission operations facility where the flight operations team conducts the operations of the spacecraft, a data processing and storage facility, ground stations to radiate signals to and receive signals from the spacecraft, and a voice and data communications network to connect all mission elements.Launch vehicleThe launch vehicle is used to propel the spacecraft from the Earth's surface, through the atmosphere, and into an orbit, the exact orbit being dependent upon mission configuration. The launch vehicle may be expendable or reusable.seconds after engine ignition]]Reusable spacecraftThe first reusable spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963. The first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. The Enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was the Columbia, followed by the Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. The Endeavour was built to replace the Challenger when it was lost in January 1986. The Columbia broke up during reentry in February 2003.The first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the Buran (Snowstorm), launched by the USSR on November 15, 1988, although it made only one flight. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the U.S. Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran. The Space Shuttle has since been modified to allow for autonomous re-entry via the addition of a control cable running from the control cabin to the mid-deck which would allow for the automated deployment of the landing gear in the event a un-crewed re-entry was required following abandonment due to damage at the ISS.Per the Vision for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle is due to be retired in 2010 due mainly to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle's human transport role is to be replaced by the partially reusable Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) no later than 2014. The Shuttle's heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) or a Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle.Scaled Composites' SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company will build its successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic should begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2009''.Fictional spacecraftThe term spacecraft is mainly used to refer to spacecraft that are real or conceived using present technology. The terms spaceship and starship are generally applied only to fictional spacecraft, usually those capable of transporting people. The spaceship is one of the prime elements in science fiction. Numerous short stories and novels are built up around various ideas for spacecraft, and spacecraft have often been featured in movies. Some hard science fiction books focus on the technical details of the craft, while others treat the spacecraft as a given and delve little into its actual implementation.Notable fictional spacecraft:USCSS Nostromo and USS Sulaco from the Alien science-fiction universe.The Millennium Falcon, Star Destroyer, X-Wing and TIE Fighter from the Star Wars science-fiction universe.USS Enterprise and Klingon Bird of Prey from the Star Trek franchise.The Liberator and Scorpio from the British science fiction television series Blake's 7.The TARDIS from the British science fiction television series Doctor Who.Discovery One from 2001: A Space OdysseyThe Battlestar Galactica from the original and re-imagined series of the same name.''Daedalus'' class battlecruiser from the television series Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis.USS Saratoga (SCVN-2812) from the television series Space: Above and Beyond.Serenity from the television series Firefly''Starbug, Blue Midget, and Red Dwarf from the BBC comedy science fiction series: Red Dwarf.The UNSC In Amber Clad, Forward Unto Dawn and Pillar of Autumn from the Halo video game series.The SSV Normandy, from the Mass Effect video game.Unidentified flying objects:Some people believe that Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) may be alien spacecraft (that is, not of human construction and not originating from Earth), sometimes referred to as flying saucers. But the term UFO used here in this context refers to observed flying objects for which no identification has been made, though other meanings for the word UFO exist. To date, no known, independently verifiable examples of alien spacecraft are known to exist.Spacecraft in artThe Mare Nostrum Spaceship is the central element of the Space art group El Club de los Astronautas. The group has worked out a utopian plan for the spacecraft and they are going to adopt and actualize the plan over time as technologies will develop to turn the plan into reality. Mare Nostrum represents a series of projects in the scientific, social and economic world that are building the foundation to its construction.Examples of spacecraftManned spacecraftOrbital:  Command/Service Module as viewed from the Lunar Module on August 2, 1971.]]  bringing a crew to the ISS]]Apollo Spacecraft Gemini Spacecraft International Space Station      Mercury Spacecraft Manned Maneuvering Unit  - world's smallest manned spacecraftMir  Salyut Shuttle Buran Shenzhou Spacecraft Skylab Soyuz Spacecraft  Space Shuttle Voskhod Spacecraft Vostok Spacecraft Suborbital:SpaceShipOne  (commercial) suborbitalX-15  suborbitalUnmanned spacecraft Earth Orbit]]approaches the International Space Station on Monday, March 31, 2008]]Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) - unmanned European cargo spacecraftBuran Soviet shuttle (one mission only)Explorer 1 - first US satelliteProgress - unmanned USSR/Russia cargo spacecraftProject SCORE - first communications satelliteSOHOSputnik 1 - world's first artificial satelliteSputnik 2 - first animal in orbit (Laika)Sputnik 5 - first capsule recovered from orbit (Vostok precursor) - animals survivedSTEREO - Earth environment observationSyncom - first geosynchronous communications satelliteLunarsoft landing capsule (NASA)]]Clementine - US Navy mission, orbited Moon, detected hydrogen at the polesLuna 1 - first lunar flybyLuna 2 - first lunar impactLuna 3 - first images of lunar far sideLuna 9 - first soft landing on the MoonLuna 10 - first lunar orbiterLuna 16 - first unmanned lunar sample retrievalLunar Orbiter - very successful series of lunar mapping spacecraftLunar Prospector - confirmed detection of hydrogen at the lunar polesSMART-1 ESA - Lunar ImpactSurveyor - first USA soft landerPlanetaryentering Saturn's orbit]]Cassini-Huygens - first Saturn orbiter + Titan landerGalileo - first Jupiter orbiter+descent probeMariner 4 - first Mars flyby, first close and high resulution images of MarsMariner 9 - first Mars orbiterMariner 10 - first Mercury flyby, first close up imagesMars Exploration Rover - a Mars roverMars Global Surveyor - a Mars orbiterMESSENGER - first Mercury orbiter (arrival 2011)Mars Pathfinder - a Mars lander + roverNew Horizons - first Pluto flyby (arrival 2015)Pioneer 10 - first Jupiter flyby, first close up imagesPioneer 11 - second Jupiter flyby + first Saturn flyby (first close up images of Saturn)Pioneer Venus - first Venus orbiter+landersVenera 4 - first soft landing on another planet (Venus)Viking 1 - first soft landing on MarsVoyager 2 - Jupiter flyby + Saturn flyby + first flybys/images of Neptune and UranusOther - deep spaceClusterDeep Space 1Deep Impact (space mission)GenesisNear Earth Asteroid RendezvousStardustWMAPFastest spacecraft:Helios I & II Solar Probes ()Furthest spacecraft from Earth:Voyager 1 at 9.5824234 billion miles.Pioneer 10 at 8.3445237 billion miles.Voyager 2 at 7.4351695 billion miles.Heaviest spacecraftNASA STS Space Shuttle/Orbiter ()Spacecraft under developmentapproaching the Moon]]Orion spacecraftKliper - Russian ' Clipper 'H-II Transfer VehicleIndia Chandrayan-1 lunar probeCNES Mars NetlanderJames Webb Space Telescope (delayed)Kepler Mission Planet SearcherESA Darwin probeHerschel Space ObservatoryMars Science Laboratory roverShenzhou spacecraft CargoTerrestrial Planet Finder probeX-37SpaceX Dragon manned spacecraftSystem F6 - a DARPA Fractionated Spacecraft demonstratorUnfunded/Cancelled spacecraft programsMulti-stageChinese Project 921-3 ShuttleESA Hermes ShuttleSoviet Buran ShuttleSoyuz KontaktTeledesicManned Orbiting LaboratoryX-20SSTO)]]Skylon and the earlier RR/British Aerospace HOTOLESA Hopper OrbiterMcDonnell Douglas DC-X (Delta Clipper)Roton Rotored-HybridLockheed-Martin VentureStarNX-Alpha (Planning Stage)See also AstrionicsList of spaceflightsSpacecraft designSpacecraft propulsionSpace explorationSpaceflight recordsStarshipAnsari X PrizeAtmospheric reentryEarth to orbitReferences External linksNASA: Space Science Spacecraft MissionsNSSDC Master Catalog Spacecraft Query FormEarly History of SpacecraftBasics of Spaceflight tutorial from JPL/CaltechInternational Spaceflight Museum* Category:Spaceflight Category:Pressure vesselsaf:Ruimtetuig ar:مركبة فضائية bg:Космически апарат ca:Nau espacial cs:Kosmická loď da:Rumfartøj de:Raumschiff es:Nave espacial eo:Kosmoveturilo et:Kosmoselaev fa:فضاپیما fr:Véhicule spatial fy:Romtefartúch ko:우주선 hi:अंतरिक्ष यान hr:Svemirske letjelice id:Wahana antariksa it:Veicolo spaziale he:חללית ka:კოსმოსური ხომალდი lo:ຍານອາວະກາດ lv:Kosmosa kuģis hu:Űreszköz ms:Kapal angkasa lepas nl:Ruimtevaartuig ja:宇宙船 no:Romskip nn:Romskip pl:Statek kosmiczny pt:Nave espacial ru:Космический аппарат simple:Spacecraft sd:خِلائِي رَٿَ sk:Umelé kozmické teleso sl:Vesoljsko plovilo sr:Свемирске летелице fi:Avaruusalus sv:Rymdfarkost th:ยานอวกาศ vi:Tàu vũ trụ tr:Uzay gemisi bat-smg:Pluotmielaivis zh:航天器
