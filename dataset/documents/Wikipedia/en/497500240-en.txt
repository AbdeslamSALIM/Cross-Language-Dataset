Received his M.D. in 1965 and his Ph. D in 1969 from the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel. He is currently a Distinguished Professor at the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine at the Technion in Haifa.In 2000 he received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research. Along with Aaron Ciechanover and Irwin Rose, he was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of cells and is believed to be involved in the development and progression of diseases such as: cancer, muscular and neurological diseases, immune and inflammatory responses.Honours and awards1987 - Weizmann Prize for Sciences (Israel)1994 - Israel Prize in Biochemistry1999 - Gairdner International Award Canada (with A.
