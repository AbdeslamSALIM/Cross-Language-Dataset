He was also the lead singer of Iron Maiden from 1994 to 1999.CareerBlaze Bayley was originally lead vocalist of Tamworth rock band, Wolfsbane. When Bruce Dickinson departed Iron Maiden in 1993, Bayley was chosen as his replacement in 1994. After a bad motorcycle accident, caused by losing control and clipping his knee on a catseye in the road, which put him out of action for a year, his first album with Maiden was The X Factor, released in 1995. Bayley went on to tour with the band in support of the album. In 1998 – still with Iron Maiden – he recorded the album Virtual XI.The two Iron Maiden albums released during Bayley's time in the band did not chart as well as that to which the band were accustomed. The X Factor achieved 8th in the UK Albums Chart, and Virtual XI hit only 16th putting it as the lowest Iron Maiden studio album since Killers, which achieved 12th place. Some of this comparative commercial failure could be attributed to the tours being cut short due to Bayley's frequent sickness, and the more progressive, dark tone of the albums produced during his tenure.In February 1999, when Iron Maiden announced that vocalist Bruce Dickinson was returning to the band, Bayley departed. The following year, Bayley released his first album with his new band, called Blaze Bayley. With this band he has so far created four studio albums, Silicon Messiah (2000), Tenth Dimension (2002), Blood &amp; Belief (2004), The Man Who Would Not Die (2008), and one live album, As Live as It Gets (2003). During this time, and to fund his ongoing musical endeavours, Blaze held down a 'proper' job working at a well-known UK car accessories retailer.Despite his absence from the band, Iron Maiden occasionally performed songs from Bayley's two Maiden albums until 2003, including Man on the Edge and Futureal, both of which he co-wrote. Likewise, Bayley has performed Iron Maiden songs originally recorded by the Dickinson and Di'Anno led line-ups at some concerts.In 2007, Wolfsbane reformed, with Bayley again taking up vocal and frontman duties. They supported The Wildhearts on a short UK tour in December 2007.Singing styleIt has been claimed that one of the reasons for Bayley's lukewarm reception from Iron Maiden fans was that he possessed a vocal range lower than either of his predecessors. This made it difficult for him to perform certain songs in the key in which they were originally written and Iron Maiden were used to playing them. "Run to the Hills," one of Iron Maiden's more popular tracks was omitted from live shows as a result of this.On his albums with Blaze, Bayley's voice was noted for its improvement which could be due, in part, to having musicians who more closely fit his singing style, and the absence of Bayley's former respiratory allergy that caused him trouble during live performances.Personal lifeOn February 14, 2007, Bayley married Debbie, his long-time girlfriend, on the island of Gran Canaria.Planetblaze.com On July 6, 2008, Debbie suffered a cerebral hemorrhage.Blabbermouth.net - BLAZE BAYLEY Says His Wife Is 'In A Coma That Could Last Days, Weeks Or Even Months' - July 24, 2008 She died on September 27, 2008 after having suffered a stroke two days before.Planet Blaze - NewsDiscographyWolfsbane1985 &ndash; Wolfsbane (demo)1987 &ndash; Dancin' Dirty (demo)1989 &ndash; Live Fast, Die Fast1990 &ndash; All Hell's Breaking Loose Down at Little Kathy Wilson's Place1991 &ndash; Down Fall The Good Guys1993 &ndash; Massive Noise Injection1994 &ndash; Wolfsbane2001 &ndash; Lifestyles of the Broke and ObscureIron Maiden1995 &ndash; The X Factor1998 &ndash; Virtual XIBlaze Bayley2000 &ndash; Silicon Messiah2002 &ndash; Tenth Dimension2003 &ndash; As Live As It Gets2004 &ndash; Blood and Belief2007 &ndash; Alive in Poland2008 &ndash; The Man Who Would Not DieReferencesExternal linksOfficial Blaze Bayley websiteBlaze Bayley official MySpaceAudio"Sign of the Cross"  &ndash; Blaze Bayley singing on the opening track from Iron Maiden's The X Factor album.VideoBayley singing &quot;Man On The Edge&quot; live on [[Youtube]]   Category:Iron Maiden members Category:English heavy metal singers Category:English rock singers Category:English male singers Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from Birmingham, Englandcs:Blaze Bayley de:Blaze Bayley es:Blaze Bayley fr:Blaze Bayley hr:Blaze Bayley it:Blaze Bayley lv:Bleizs Beilijs hu:Blaze Bayley nl:Blaze Bayley no:Blaze Bayley pl:Blaze Bayley pt:Blaze Bayley sr:Блејз Бејли fi:Blaze Bayley sv:Blaze Bayley tr:Blaze Bayley
