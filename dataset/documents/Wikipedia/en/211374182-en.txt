Eric Moussambani (born May 31 1978) is a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea. Nicknamed "Eric The Eel" by the media after the name first appeared in an article by Craig Lord in The Times newspaper in London, Moussambani won brief international fame at the 2000 Summer Olympics when he swam his heat of the 100m freestyle in 1:52.72 and won, because the two other competitors Karim Bare and Farkhod Oripov were disqualified for taking a false start. His time was more than twice that of his faster competitors, and outside even the 200m world record. However he had set a new personal best and national record.CareerMoussambani gained entry to the Olympics without meeting the minimum qualification requirements via a wildcard draw designed to encourage developing countries without expensive training facilities to participate. While Pieter van den Hoogenband set a world record of 47.84 seconds to win the gold medal, Moussambani splashed his way to the finish to the cheers of the crowd in slightly more than twice that time. "The last 15 meters were very difficult," Moussambani said.Before coming to the Olympics, Moussambani had never seen a  long Olympic-size swimming pool. He took up swimming only 8 months before the Olympics and had practiced in a  pool at a hotel in Malabo.His performance generated spectator and media interest in the only other Equatorial Guinean swimmer at the Sydney Olympics, Paula Barila Bolopa, who competed in the women's 50 metres freestyle event. Barila struggled to finish the race with a time of 01:03.97, setting a record for the slowest time in Olympic history for that event, and in turn achieved minor celebrity status.&quot;Barila Bolopa paddles her way to Olympic stardom&quot;, Agence France-Presse, September 21, 2000 &quot;'Paula the Crawler' sets record&quot;, BBC, September 22, 2000Moussambani was denied entry into the 2004 Olympic Games due to a visa bungle,   despite the vast improvement in his swimming over the previous four years, with his personal best down to under 57 seconds.  He did not take part in the 2008 Summer Olympics.&quot;The A-Z of watching Olympics&quot;, Courier Mail, July 25, 2008Similarly-acclaimed athletesIn subsequent Olympic Games, international media occasionally referred to Moussambani's potential "successors" - athletes who might record spectacularly poor times. Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics, media in several countries -including Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom- suggested that Stany Kempompo Ngangola, a swimmer from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, would be the Olympic's next "Eric the Eel".&quot;Mød Stany the Stingray&quot;, Ekstra Bladet, August 15, 2008 &quot;En Sydney fue Mussambani; en Pekín, el congoleño Ngangola&quot;, La Nacion, August 15, 2008 &quot;Move over Eddie the Eagle and éric the Eel&quot;, The Gazette, August 15, 2008 &quot;Stany the stingray&quot;, Sydney Morning Herald, August 14, 2008 &quot;'The Snail' takes up where 'The Eel' left off&quot;, The Independent, August 15, 2008 Also prior to the Beijing Games, some media described ni-Vanuatu sprinter Elis Lapenmal and Palestinian swimmer Hamza Abdu as "potential successors to Moussambani".&quot;Lovable losers - the Olympic ideal or waste of space&quot;, AFP, July 6, 2008 During the Games, Cook Islands swimmer Petero Okotai compared himself to "Eric the Eel" upon recording a disappointing time in his event.&quot;Games also mean coming in last&quot;, International Herald Tribune, August 23, 2008See alsoEddie 'the Eagle' EdwardsPhilip BoitPaula Barila BolopaReferencesExternal linksArchive of a fansiteVideo of Moussambani's 2000 Olympic heat featuring commentary by Roy and HG on their program The Dream Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Equatoguinean swimmers Category:Swimmers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic swimmers of Equatorial Guineaca:Éric Moussambani de:Éric Moussambani es:Éric Moussambani eo:Éric Moussambani fr:Éric Moussambani it:Eric Moussambani he:אריק מוסמבאני nl:Eric Moussambani ja:エリック・ムサンバニ no:Éric Moussambani pl:Éric Moussambani fi:Eric Moussambani sv:Eric Moussambani zh:艾瑞克·姆薩巴尼
