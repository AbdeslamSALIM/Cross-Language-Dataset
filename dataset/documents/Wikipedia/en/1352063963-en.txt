His highest rating ever was 2743 on the April 2002 FIDE list.Early careerPonomariov was born in Horlivka in Ukraine to parents of Russian ethnicity. In 1994 he placed third in the World Under-12 Championship at the age of ten. In 1996 he won the European Under-18 Championship at the age of just twelve, and the following year won the World Under-18 Championship. In 1998, at the age of fourteen, he was awarded the Grandmaster title, making him the youngest ever player at that time to hold the title.Among Ponomariov's notable later results are first at the Donetsk Zonal in 1998, 5/7 in the European Club Cup 2000 (including a victory over then-FIDE World Champion Alexander Khalifman), joint first with 7.5/9 at Torshavn 2000, 8.5/11 for Ukraine in the 2001 Chess Olympiad in Istanbul, winning gold medal on board 2, and first place with 7/10 in the 2001 Governor's Cup in Kramatorsk.World ChampionIn 2002 he beat his fellow countryman Vassily Ivanchuk in the final of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2002 by a score of 4.5-2.5 to become FIDE world champion at the age of eighteen, the first teenager to ever become world champion.In the same year he finished second in the very strong Linares tournament behind Garry Kasparov. His result in the strong 2003 Corus tournament at Wijk aan Zee was less good - despite having the third highest Elo rating, he finished only join eleventh out of fourteen players with 6/13, and at Linares the same year he finished only fifth out of seven with 5.5/12.There were plans for him to play a fourteen game match against Kasparov in Yalta in September 2003, the winner of which would go on to play the winner of a match between Vladimir Kramnik and Péter Lékó as part of the so-called "Prague Agreement" to reunify the World Chess Championship (from 1993 until 2006 there were two world chess championships). However, this was called off after Ponomariov refused to sign his contract without reservation.Ponomariov remained FIDE champion until Rustam Kasimdzhanov won the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.Post-championship careerOn Ponomariov's 20th birthday, October 11 2003, he became the first high-profile player to default a game because of his mobile phone ringing during play. This happened in round one of the European Team Championship in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, when Ponomariov was playing black against Swedish GM Evgenij Agrest.He finished in the top 10 in the 2005 FIDE World Cup, which qualified him for the Candidates for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007, being played in May-June 2007. He was eliminated in the first round, losing 3.5-2.5 to Sergei Rublevsky.Playing styleIn his games with white, Ponomariov has almost always played 1. e4 (see chess opening), entering the main lines of the Ruy Lopez and Sicilian Defence. With black, he has played the Sicilian against 1. e4 and also replied 1... e5, going into the Ruy Lopez. Against 1. d4 he has adopted a variety of defences, including the Queen's Gambit Accepted, the Queen's Indian Defence and the King's Indian Defence. Earlier in his career he experimented with the Benko Gambit and Pirc Defence, but as of 2003 these have fallen out of his repertoire.External linksOlimpBaseLinks to many articles about PonomariovRating data   Category:World chess champions Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Ukrainian chess players Category:1983 births Category:People from Gorlovka Category:Living peoplebs:Ruslan Ponomarjov br:Rouslan Ponomariov bg:Руслан Пономарьов cs:Ruslan Ponomarjov da:Ruslan Ponomariov de:Ruslan Ponomarjow et:Ruslan Ponomarjov es:Ruslán Ponomariov fr:Ruslan Ponomariov hr:Ruslan Ponomarjov it:Ruslan Ponomariov he:רוסלן פונומריוב hu:Ruszlan Olehovics Ponomarjov nl:Roeslan Ponomarjov no:Ruslan Ponomarjov pl:Rusłan Ponomariow pt:Ruslan Ponomariov ro:Ruslan Ponomariov ru:Пономарёв, Руслан Олегович sl:Ruslan Ponomarjov fi:Ruslan Ponomarov sv:Ruslan Ponomarjov tr:Ruslan Ponomariov uk:Пономарьов Руслан Олегович
