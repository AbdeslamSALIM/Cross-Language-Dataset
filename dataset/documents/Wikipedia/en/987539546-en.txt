The club's first regular season match was April 7, 2007 at Home Depot Center in Los Angeles, a 0–2 loss to Chivas USA. Although they did not make the playoffs, Toronto FC was a financial success in its inaugural season, selling out every home game in the 20,522-seat BMO Field and capturing media attention. Toronto FC sold all of its 14,000 season tickets in the first year and all 16,500 of its second year season tickets. The team's second season saw them host the 2008 MLS All-Star Game at BMO Field and be named a finalist for the 2008 Sports Business Journal Pro Sports Franchise of the Year award.HistoryClub IdentityAfter Toronto's expansion was announced in 2005,Name Toronto's MLS team? the name of the club was officially announced on May 11, 2006 by the team's owner, Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE). The "FC" in the team's name is the conventional initialism for Football Club, but in official media and documents the team has only been referred to as Toronto FC. Larry Tannenbaum, chairman of MLSE, stated at the team name's unveiling that "I think the way we spell it is 'futbol'."The announcement followed an online consultation in which the public was invited to vote on the name during a limited period. The voting options were "Toronto Northmen," "Inter Toronto FC," "Toronto Reds," and "Toronto FC." MLSE's strategy in choosing "Toronto FC" following this process was based on two reasons. Firstly, over 40&nbsp;percent of the online vote supported the simplified Toronto FC name during the consultation; secondly, MLSE hoped that the fairly generic name would help the new club earn a more organic nickname from the Toronto fans rather than having one imposed upon the club. The team has been called "TFC"Toronto FC acquires Ruiz from GalaxyTFC's Danny Dichio shelved weeks with concussionMLS Preview: Toronto FC - New England Revolution and "the Reds"Reds acquire forward Johann Smith by the media and the club.

Like its American counterparts, the squad consists of both domestic and foreign players (though these domestic players are Canadian rather than American).In 2007, the club was allowed thirteen international players, of which no more than eight could be non-Americans (8+5). Following former coach Mo Johnston's complaints that the player constraints set by the league are too strict, MLS relaxed these regulations for the 2008 season, allowing Toronto FC 16 international players, of which no more than eleven can be non-Americans (11+5). This new measure is to compensate for the smaller talent pool in Canada, thus keeping the league appropriately competitive (American teams are permitted up to eight international players, including Canadian players). Thus, Toronto FC is required to field fewer domestic players than its American counterparts, and at one point in 2008 had traded for more spots to bring their total number of international spots to 18,Huckerby Trade Details potentially allowing the club to not field a single Canadian player.Current squadAs of October 5, 2008                            Notable former players Jeff Cunningham Maurice Edu Ronnie O'Brien Laurent Robert Andy WelshTFC Academy The TFC Academy was established in 2008, with Nick Dasovic named as head coach.Toronto FC Finalizes Technical Staff For TFC AcademyTFC Academy The squad plays in the National Division of the Canadian Soccer League, the highest professional soccer league within Canada.
