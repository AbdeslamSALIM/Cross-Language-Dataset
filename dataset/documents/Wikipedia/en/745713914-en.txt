He is the current President of Romania, inaugurated on December 20 2004. He won the office in the 2004 presidential election. Prior to becoming President, he was the Mayor of Bucharest from June 2000 until December 2004.On April 19, 2007 the Romanian Parliament suspended Băsescu. &quot;Romania's MPs suspend president&quot; "BBC News, April 19, 2007 As the Constitutional Court of Romania acknowledged the Parliament's vote on 20 April 2007,&quot;Romanian Constitutional Court confirms suspension of president from post&quot;, ''Xinhua, April 20, 2007 Băsescu remained suspended as president until a referendum which took place on May 19, 2007 confirmed that the impeachment should not stand. Băsescu is the first president in the history of Romania who has been officially suspended.Family backgroundBăsescu was born in Murfatlar, a village (later a small town) near Constanţa, the largest Romanian port on the Black Sea. Băsescu's father was an army officer named Dumitru (d. 2002); his mother is Elena (b. 1928). He has a brother, Mircea (b. 1953). He and his wife Maria have two daughters, Ioana and Elena. Ioana has a son named Andrei.CareerCommercial ship captainBăsescu graduated from the Naval Institute of Constanţa in 1976 and became a Merchant Marine Officer at Navrom, the Romanian state-owned shipping company. Between 1981 and 1987 he worked as Captain on Romanian commercial ships, and in 1984 he was promoted to Captain of the oil tanker Biruinţa, the largest ship of the Romanian fleet. In 1989, he moved to Belgium to head the Navrom Agency in Antwerp.Political careerBăsescu was a member of the pre-1989 Communist Party (PCR). After the downfall of Communism, he claimed that he joined the PCR in order to promote his career in the merchant marine.Traian Băsescu entered politics after the 1989 Romanian Revolution, as a member of the large National Salvation Front (FSN) party. In April 1991, he became Minister of Transport in Petre Roman's Cabinet, and continued to hold this position during Theodor Stolojan's "Cabinet of technocrats" in September 1991 - November 1992. In 1992, after the FSN split in two factions&mdash;the Social Democratic Party of Romania (PDSR, later PSD), led by Ion Iliescu, and the Democratic Party (PD), led by Petre Roman, Băsescu joined the PD faction. In 1992, he was elected to the lower house of the Romanian Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, and re-elected for the 1996-2000 term.Concurrently with his second term in Parliament, from November 1996 to June 2000, Băsescu also served as Minister of Transport in the center-right governments of Victor Ciorbea, Radu Vasile, and Mugur Isărescu.In December 1997, he gave an interview to Claudiu Săftoiu (who was later to be appointed director of the Romanian Foreign Intelligence Service by Băsescu)Cotidianul:FSN preia Serviciile Secrete of the newspaper Evenimentul Zilei, in which he accused Victor Ciorbea (prime minister at that time) of not implementing enough reforms, although Ciorbea was accused by the opposition of being excessively reformist. It would be the first episode in an open dispute within the ruling coalition, a dispute that eventually led to Democratic Party ministers, including Băsescu, resigning from the cabinet, which, in turn, led to Ciorbea's resignation. Subsequently (1998), Băsescu resumed his previous ministerial position in the new cabinet headed by Radu Vasile.In 2001, he was elected president of the PD, defeating Petre Roman, who had previously led the party for nine years. In 2003, Băsescu negotiated an electoral alliance for the PD with the National Liberal Party (PNL) in order to create a cohesive mainstream center-right political opposition against the then-ruling PSD. The new pact, called the Justice and Truth Alliance (Alianţa DA), ran common candidates in local and national elections, and agreed to vote as a bloc in Parliament. As president of PD, he became co-chairman of the DA alliance alongside the then PNL president Theodor Stolojan. In 2003 Stolojan, who was the Justice and Truth candidate for president in 2004, stepped down as PNL president and DA co-chairman, being replaced by Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu. Although Stolojan announced to have withdrawn because of health concerns, Băsescu claimed to the press that the reason behind this decision was blackmail from political opponents (Stolojan did not confirm this and it was never proven).BBC interview During these events, Traian Băsescu appeared to stand as a firm supporter of Stolojan, and replaced him as Justice and Truth's presidential candidate.Mayor of BucharestIn 2000, Băsescu was elected Mayor of Bucharest, winning the run-off against PDSR candidate Sorin Oprescu by a very slim margin (50.69% to 49.31%), despite trailing 24% behind him in the first round. As Mayor, he was credited with a reduction in the number of stray dogs (although he sometimes used very drastic measures such as large-scale euthanasia) roaming freely through the streets of the city from approximately 200,000&ndash;300,000 in 2000 to 25,000 in 2004, and thus in the number of dog bite injuries from 1500/month to under 200/month.source : The Administration for Animal Control (ASA) of the Mayor's Office of Bucharest, 2003Despite the fact that some Romanian and foreign animal protection activists protested large-scale euthanasia, the inhabitants of the city generally welcomed the measure, since the atmosphere in the city became more secure, and cases of child attacks by stray dogs dwindled. This campaign was at any rate controversial, as many animal lovers opposed dog euthanasia,Formula-As,[http://www.formula-as.ro/reviste_451__122__.html Scrisori adresate primarului general al Capitalei ("Letters Addressed to the General Mayor of Bucharest")] to which at one time Băsescu answered: "We will not take any dog's life!"Formula-As, [http://www.formula-as.ro/reviste_424__122__-traianbasescuprimarul-general-al-capitalei...-.html Traian Băsescu: De la nivelul Primăriei nu se va da niciodata dispoziţie să se omoare cainii ("The City Hall Will Never Have the Stray Dogs Killed")] Băsescu was also accused of sometimes just moving the dogs from the center to the periphery. On the other hand, there were also numerous cases of people asking the authorities to take the stray dogs away, but after this was done, their neighbors, who had been feeding the dogs, would show up at the shelter to take them back to their neighborhoods.Observator, http://www.observator.info/arhiva/2004/ianuarie/14%20ianuarie/obs.html, January 20, 2004 In 2004, Băsescu presented the situation as a success. On January 29, 2006, a Japanese tourist was killed by a stray dog.Gardianul, [http://www.gardianul.ro/2006/01/30/linia_fierbinte-c5/un_japonez_a_murit_in_capitala_muscat_de_un_caine_vagabond-s73350.html Un japonez a murit în capitală muşcat de un câine vagabond ("A Japanese Died in Bucharest after Being Bitten by a Stray Dog")], January 30, 2006 The campaign was highly ineffective, only 47.000 dogs being put down.

His tenure was however marked by constant conflicts with the governing PSD-controlled institutions. Citing the need for decentralisation, the central government led by Adrian Năstase passed several ordinances transferring powers from the city Mayor to city sectors and to the city council. Băsescu accused council members of corruption and obstruction; he also successfully challenged several council resolutions in Administrative Courts. As a consequence, on 10 January 2002, the central government decided to dissolve the council, yet it annulled that decision later on. These conflicts led to the blocking or delay of several infrastructure loans, financed by BEI, for municipal heating and road networks, and generally for blocking city's ability to borrow and finance reconstruction.In 2004, Băsescu was elected for a second term in office, winning 54.9% of the votes directly in the first round; the runner-up, Mircea Geoană of the PSD, at that time the Foreign Minister of Romania, received 29.7%. Băsescu resigned as Mayor later that year, after winning the presidency of Romania.President of RomaniaBăsescu won the Presidential election by using anti-communist and anti-corruption rhetoric. In the live TV debate with Adrian Năstase before the 2004 run-off presidential election, Băsescu caught his opponent off-guard with a rhetorical remark:Following Theodor Stolojan's surprise withdrawal from the 2004 presidential elections, Băsescu entered the presidential race on behalf of the Justice and Truth Alliance. His main opponent was then Prime Minister and PSD president Adrian Năstase. Like Băsescu, Năstase was a former Communist Party member. Although Năstase came out ahead in the first round by 7%, Băsescu achieved a surprise comeback and won the December 12 run-off election by a 2.46% margin, receiving 51.23% of the vote.Running on a strong reform and anti-corruption platform, Băsescu's victory was characterized in the media as Romania's "Orange Revolution", in reference to the reformists' perceived victory in neighboring Ukraine during the same period. It was also a reference to the orange color used by the winning Justice and Truth Alliance.Vivid Election 2004 February 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In line with an agreement between the PD and PNL, he appointed PNL leader Popescu-Tăriceanu as Prime Minister. In order to form a majority, PNL and PD formed a coalition with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania and the Humanist Party, which later changed its name to the Conservative Party (PC). While the platform of the former has been generally in line with that of the Justice and Truth Alliance, the latter (PC) was needed in the coalition in order to obtain more than 50% of the seats in Parliament, due to the fact that apart from the opposition Social-Democrat Party, many seats were held also by the ultra-nationalist Greater Romania Party.In late 2006, the PC withdrew from the cabinet, a move at least partially related to conflicts between Băsescu and PC leader Dan Voiculescu. The withdrawal of the PC left the coalition without a majority in Parliament.Conflict with the Prime MinisterBăsescu has remained very popular, due to his open style and hands-on approach. In his electoral campaign, Băsescu promised to be a "player-president" (in Romanian, preşedinte jucător), in contrast to a more withdrawn president who would be just a mediator among political forces (thus somethimes creating a juridical conflict of a constitutional nature). After he became president, as legally required, he resigned from the Democratic Party. However, he remained very involved in day-to-day politics, often being accused by other political leaders of overstepping constitutional boundaries on the role of the President. During the course of his presidency, his relations with Popescu-Tăriceanu gradually soured, particularly following the Prime Minister's reversal of course in July 2005 after announcing he would resign and prompt early parliamentary elections,Romania's Tariceanu Reverses Decision on Resignation (SETimes.com)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; which due to its increased popularity rate could have allowed the Justice and Truth Alliance to govern alone. The ensuing poor relations between the President and the Prime Minister have become one of the primary themes of Băsescu's presidency and of Romanian post-2004 politics,http://english.hotnews.ro/Romanian-President-in-open-conflict-with-prime-minister-articol_44137.htm&lt;/ref&gt; with many unrelated disputes converging to this dichotomy, somewhat similar to the Iraq War debate in USA. Under the Romanian Constitution, the president appoints the prime minister, but does not have the authority to dismiss him.Foreign policy2005)]] Băsescu repeatedly stated that Romania's accession to the European Union remained a top priority, and he was president when the country acceded on January 1, 2007. Both the president and the government of Prime Minister Popescu-Tăriceanu focused on Romania's planned accession to the EU, which remained a central component in Romania's foreign policy.In addition, Băsescu has focused on a strong strategic partnership with the United States, a relationship which during the 2004 presidential campaign he called the "Bucharest-London-Washington axis". In real terms, this meant a continued commitment to maintain Romanian troops in Afghanistan and a smaller contingent in Iraq; and an agreement signed in December 2005 between Romania and the U.S. to allow U.S. troops to use a Romanian military facility (Mihail Kogălniceanu military airport). Băsescu made strong ties with the President of the United States, who in return called him a friend: "The President and I are friends. Romania and the United States are friends, and we're allies".In June 2006, Băsescu came into open conflict with Popescu-Tăriceanu after the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister announced that they and the PNL sought to withdraw Romania's troops from Iraq. However, the troops stayed in Iraq, after Băsescu called a meeting of the Supreme Defense Council, which voted that the troops should stay.DefenseNews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Băsescu has been vocal in calling for a regional approach to security in the Black Sea basin, which he noted remained susceptible to transborder security threats such as drug and human trafficking. Băsescu alleged "that Russia might have been involved in his suspension", citing his pro-Western foreign policy as a reason.Băsescu has tried to improve Romania's relations with Moldova, with which Romania shares a common language and culture. Furthermore, he has expressed several times his belief in the future unification of the two countries, either politically or in the framework of the European Union. His player attitude has brought both practical success, as well as an increase in anti-Romanian rhetoric from the Communist government of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin. A divisive issue remains the opening of two Romanian consulates outside the capital of Moldova, as well as 900,000 Moldovans applying for Romanian citizenship. In both cases, Băsescu strongly supported moves at strengthening relations with Moldova, while the Moldovan leadership sought to cool down Băsescu's energy.Băsescu stated that Romania favors Kosovo to be an integral part of Serbia as an outcome of Kosovo status process and that Romania will not recognize any unilateral declaration of independence by Kosovo.Bucharest favors Kosovo within Serbia B92Romania opposes Kosovo independence Armenian NewsDomestic policyIn domestic politics, Băsescu has claimed he was fighting against high-level corruption. In spring 2005, Romania successfully resolved a hostage crisis in Iraq involving three Romanian journalists and their guide. In 2005, he also focused on pressing the government to provide relief to thousands of Romanians left homeless by widespread flooding throughout the spring and summer.On 18 December 2006, Băsescu delivered a speech to Parliament in which he condemned Romania's pre-1989 communist regime. Members of the opposition Social Democratic Party and Greater Romania Party tried to disturb the speech. Particularly vocal was the ultra-nationalist PRM leader Corneliu Vadim TudorImpeachment vote by the ParliamentIn early 2007, Băsescu was proposed for impeachment by the members of the opposition parties for allegedly unconstitutional conduct.http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3542.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major issues in the confrontation was the activity of Justice Minister Monica Macovei, who forced prosecutors to follow up on cases of corruption, especially those involving politically connected individuals. Among the main reasons given in the proposal to suspend Băsescu were: Infringing upon and "substituting the authority" of the Government, the judicial system and the Parliament. Committing acts of "political partisanship" with direct reference to the Democratic Party, abuse of power and acting more like a "judge of the other public authorities" than a "collaborator", thus "abandoning his role of impartial mediator required by the Romanian Constitution." Manipulating and "instigating public opinion against other state institutions" such as the Parliament and the Government. Băsescu and his supporters denied the accusations, stating that his actions and statements were ways of fighting against corruption in the political and judicial systems and against "circles of business interests" with unlawful purposes.The Constitutional Court of Romania found no clear evidence of his breach of the Constitution in the sense required by the fundamental law.http://www.hotnews.ro/arhiva_avt/3796.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the court ruling was only consultative and the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament voted in favor of Băsescu's impeachment on April 19, 2007, with 322 votes for the impeachment proposal, 108 against and 8 abstentions (the minimum number of votes needed was 233).&quot;Romanian Parliament Suspends President&quot;, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, April 19, 2007. Băsescu contested the decision but the Constitutional Court rejected his appeal as inadmissible and upheld the vote.In the meantime, Macovei and several other reformist ministers were dismissed by Prime Minister Popescu-Tăriceanu, while the European election has been postponed until at least the fall of 2007. Some in the media have characterized the anti-Băsescu coalition as the "black alliance".Cotidianul - Comentarii - Care „popor“?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Impeachment referendumAs a result of the impeachment vote by the Parliament, Băsescu was suspended from his function as president, and a national referendum was held on May 19, 2007http://www.hotnews.ro/articol_70361-UPDATE-Nicolae-Vacaroiu-este-presedintele-interimar-al-Romaniei-Referendumul-pentru-demiterea-presedintelui-va-avea-loc-pe-20-mai.htm (Hotnews.ro article)HotNews.ro - Referendumul pentru demiterea lui Băsescu poate avea loc pe 19 mai - Arhiva noiembrie 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; to decide whether to dismiss the President by popular vote.
