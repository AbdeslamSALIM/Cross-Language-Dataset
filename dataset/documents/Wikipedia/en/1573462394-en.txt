He has also worked as a director and producer, through his production company Saturn Films.Saturn Films, Cage's production company Cage has been nominated twice for an Academy Award as Best Actor in a Leading Role, winning the award for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.Early lifeCage was born in Long Beach, California. His father, August Coppola, is a professor of literature, while Cage's mother, Joy Vogelsang, is a dancer and choreographer; the two divorced in 1976. His mother suffered from chronic depression.USA WEEKEND MagazineNicolas Cage - Family and Companions - Yahoo!7 Movies Cage's mother is of German descent and his father is Italian American, with his paternal grandparents being Carmine Coppola, a composer, and Italia Pennino, an actress. Through his father, Cage is the nephew of director Francis Ford Coppola and actress Talia Shire, as well as the cousin of directors Roman Coppola, and Sofia Coppola and actors Robert Carmine and Jason Schwartzman. Cage's two brothers are Christopher Coppola, a director, and Marc &quot;The Cope&quot; Coppola, a New York radio personality.AOL Interview with Nicolas Cage Cage was born into a Roman Catholic household and remains Catholic to this day.Cage, who attended and dropped out of Beverly Hills High School (the same high school as fellow entertainers Albert Brooks, Angelina Jolie, Lenny Kravitz, Slash, Rob Reiner, Bonnie Franklin and David Schwimmer), aspired to act from an early age. His first non-cinematic acting experience was in a school production of Golden Boy. He is also good friends with fellow actor Johnny Depp, whom he advised to get into acting.CareerIn order to avoid the appearance of nepotism as the nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, he changed his name from Nicholas Coppola to Nicolas Cage early in his career.Nicolas Cage Interview: A Fork in the Road The assumed surname is inspired by Marvel Comics character Luke Cage, a streetwise superhero. Since his cameo feature film debut in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, with Sean Penn, Cage has appeared in a wide range of films, both mainstream and offbeat. He even wished for the role of Dallas Winston in his uncle's film The Outsiders, based on S.E. Hinton's novel, but lost to Matt Dillon. He was also in Coppola's film Rumble Fish.Cage has been nominated twice for an Academy Award, and won once, for his performance as a suicidal alcoholic in Leaving Las Vegas. His other nomination was for his portrayal of real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and Kaufman's fictional twin Donald in Adaptation. Despite these successes, most of his lower-profile films have performed poorly at the box office compared to his mainstream action/adventure roles. The suspense thriller 8mm (1999) was not a box office success, but is now considered a cult film and is one of Cage's most underrated roles. In 2005, two offbeat films he headlined, Lord of War and The Weather Man, failed to find a significant audience despite nationwide releases and good reviews for his acting in those roles. Poor reviews for The Wicker Man resulted in low box office sales. The much criticized Ghost Rider (2007), based on the Marvel Comics chararacter, was a significant hit, earning more than $45 million (the top earner) during its opening weekend and over $208 million worldwide through the weekend ending on 25 March 2007. Also in 2007, he starred in Next, which shares the concept of a glimpse into an alternate time track with The Family Man (2000).Most of Cage's movies that have achieved financial success were in the action/adventure genre. In his second-highest grossing film to date, National Treasure, he plays an eccentric historian who goes on a dangerous adventure to find treasure hidden by the Founding Fathers of the United States. Other action hits include The Rock, in which Cage plays a young FBI chemical weapons expert who infiltrates Alcatraz Island in hopes of neutralizing a terrorist threat, Face/Off, a John Woo film where he plays both a hero and a villain, and World Trade Center, director Oliver Stone's film regarding the September 11, 2001 attacks. He had a small but notable role as the Chinese criminal mastermind Dr. Fu Manchu in Rob Zombie's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the S.S. from the B-movie double feature Grindhouse. Nicholas Cage is popular both domestically and overseas, but nowhere more so than in Littleton, Colorado, where his movies gross more per capita than in any other geographical location.In recent years, Cage made his directorial debut with Sonny, a low-budget drama starring James Franco as a male prostitute whose mother (Brenda Blethyn) serves as his pimp. Cage had a small role in the grim film, which received poor reviews and a short run in a limited number of theatres. Cage's producing career includes Shadow of the Vampire, the first film from Saturn Films, a company he founded with partner Jeff Levine. It was nominated for an Academy Award. He also produced The Life of David Gale, a death penalty-themed thriller with Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet.In early December 2006, Cage announced at the Bahamas International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors in order to pursue other interests. Cage said, "I feel I've made a lot of movies already and I want to start exploring other opportunities that I can apply myself to, whether it's writing or other interests that I may develop".http://news.yahoo.com/s/eonline/20061211/en_movies_eo/538e2299-5566-4447-a0a5-0bcc3bc26e0a 5 Cage is listed as the executive producer of the The Dresden Files on the Sci-Fi Channel.In November 2007, Cage was spotted backstage at a Ring of Honor wrestling show in New York City researching his role for the upcoming movie "The Wrestler".http://www.sescoops.com/wwe/Hollywood_Heavyweight_Backstage_More_On_Suspensions.shtml SEScoops.comCage will star in a sci-fi thriller titled Knowing directed by Alex Proyas, scheduled to begin production on 17 March 2008, in Melbourne, Australia.

In 1988, Cage began dating Christina Fulton, mother of their son, Weston Coppola Cage (b. 26 December, 1990); Weston appeared in Cage's film Lord of War as Vladimir, a young Ukrainian mechanic who quickly disarms a Mil Mi-24 helicopter. Weston is also a devoted fan of heavy metal and on April 16, 2008, he introduced the symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir before they played a show at The Grove in Anaheim, California.Cage has been married multiple times. His first wife was Patricia Arquette (married on April 8, 1995 &ndash; divorce finalized May 18, 2001). Cage proposed to her on the day he met her in the early 80s. Arquette thought he was strange, but played along with his antics by creating a list of things Cage would have to do to "win her hand", including obtaining the autograph of reclusive author J.D. Salinger. However, when he seriously started working through the list of demands, Arquette became scared and avoided him. They met again many years later and went on to marry.Cage's second wife was Lisa Marie Presley (married on August 10, 2002 and separated after four months in December 2002; their divorce was finalized on May 16, 2004) &mdash; the daughter of Elvis Presley, of whom Cage is a fan and based his performance in Wild at Heart on.

Alice had a minor role in the 2007 movie Next which he produced. They were married at a private ranch in Northern California on July 30 2004.Cage had a Malibu home where he and Alice lived, but in 2004 he bought a property on Paradise Island, Bahamas. In 2005, he sold his Malibu home for $10 million. In May 2006, he bought a 40-acre island in the Exuma archipelago, some 85 miles southeast of Nassau and close to a similar island owned by Faith Hill and Tim McGraw.http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1195930,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;On July 19, 2006, Cage bought the medieval castle of Schloss Neidstein (see de:Schloss Neidstein) in the Oberpfalz region in Germany.

The estate is called the "Grey Craig."
