There are plans to extend the 3,000 m runway to 3,600 m, but the city of Ratingen, which lies in the approach path of the runway, is blocking them.107 airplane parking positions are available. The current terminal building is capable of handling up to 22 million passengers per year. However, due to an agreement with residents in nearby Ratingen (the so called Angerlandvergleich), this capacity may not be reached within the next few years, as aircraft movements are restricted. Düsseldorf International Airport is able to handle the new superjumbo Airbus A380 aircraft. On November 12, 2006 the first A380 landed in Düsseldorf as part of a Lufthansa promotion flight. Lufthansa is planning to use Düsseldorf International as the diversion airport for A380 in case of bad weather in Frankfurt.Owners of the airport are:50% Landeshauptstadt (state capital) Düsseldorf50% Airport Partners GmbH (Ownership of Airport Partners GmbH: 40% Hochtief AirPort GmbH, 20% Hochtief AirPort Capital KGaA, 40% Dublin Airport Authority plc (through its wholly owned subsidiary Aer Rianta International cpt))Passengers:2002 14.75 million2003 14.30 million2004 15.20 million2005 15.51 million2006 16.60 million2007 17.83 millionHistory- Train station]]The airport was opened on 19 April 1927, after two years of construction.
