The concept of a linear subspace (or vector subspace) is important in linear algebra and related fields of mathematics. A linear subspace is usually called simply a subspace when the context serves to distinguish it from other kinds of subspaces.Definition and useful characterizationLet K'' be a field (such as the field of real numbers), and let ''V be a vector space over K. As usual, we call elements of V'' ''vectors and call elements of K'' ''scalars. Suppose that W'' is a subset of ''V. If W'' is a vector space itself, with the same vector space operations as ''V has, then it is a subspace of&nbsp;V.To use this definition, we don't have to prove that all the properties of a vector space hold for W. Instead, we can prove a theorem that gives us an easier way to show that a subset of a vector space is a subspace.Theorem: Let V'' be a vector space over the field ''K, and let W'' be a subset of ''V. Then W is a subspace if and only if it satisfies the following 3 conditions:The zero vector, 0, is in W.If u''' and '''v are elements of W'', then the sum '''u'&nbsp;+&nbsp;v is an element of W;If u''' is an element of W'' and ''c is a scalar from K, then the scalar product ''cu' is an element of W;Proof: Firstly, property 1 ensures W'' is nonempty. Looking at the definition of a vector space, we see that properties 2 and 3 above assure closure of ''W under addition and scalar multiplication, so the vector space operations are well defined. Since elements of W'' are necessarily elements of ''V, axioms 1, 2 and 5-8 of a vector space are satisfied a fortiori. By the closure of W under scalar multiplication (specifically by 0 and -1), axioms 3 and 4 of a vector space are satisfied.Conversely, if W'' is subspace of ''V, then W is itself a vector space under the operations induced by V'', so properties 2 and 3 are satisfied. By property 3, ''-w is in W'' whenever ''w is, and it follows that W is closed under subtraction as well. Since W'' is nonempty, there is an element ''x in W, and  x - x =   is in W'', so property 1 is satisfied. One can also argue that since ''W is nonempty, there is an element x'' in ''W, and 0 is in the field K so  0 x =   and therefore property 1 is satisfied.ExamplesExamples related to analytic geometryExample I: Let the field K'' be the set '''R' of real numbers, and let the vector space V'' be the Euclidean space '''R'3. Take W'' to be the set of all vectors in ''V whose last component is 0. Then W'' is a subspace of ''V. Proof:Given u''' and '''v in W'', then they can be expressed as '''u'&nbsp;= (u''1,''u2,0) and v'&nbsp;= (''v1,v2,0). Then '''u&nbsp;+&nbsp;v'&nbsp;= (''u1+''v''1,u''2+''v2,0+0)&nbsp;= (u''1+''v1,u''2+''v2,0). Thus, '''u&nbsp;+&nbsp;v is an element of&nbsp;W, too.Given u''' in W'' and a scalar ''c in '''R, if u'&nbsp;= (''u1,u2,0) again, then ''cu'&nbsp;= (cu1, cu2, c''0)&nbsp;= (''cu1,cu2,0). Thus, c'u' is an element of W too.Example II: Let the field be R''' again, but now let the vector space be the Euclidean geometry '''R2. Take W'' to be the set of points (''x,y'') of '''R'2 such that x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y. Then W'' is a subspace of '''R'2.Proof:Let p'&nbsp;= (''p1,p2) and '''q&nbsp;= (q''1,''q2) be elements of W'', that is, points in the plane such that ''p1&nbsp;=&nbsp;p''2 and ''q1&nbsp;=&nbsp;q''2. Then '''p'&nbsp;+&nbsp;q'&nbsp;= (''p1+''q''1,p''2+''q2); since p''1&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p2 and q''1&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q2, then p''1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''q1&nbsp;= p''2&nbsp;+&nbsp;''q2, so '''p&nbsp;+&nbsp;q is an element of W.Let p'&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''p1,p''2) be an element of ''W, that is, a point in the plane such that p''1&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p2, and let c be a scalar in '''R. Then c'p'&nbsp;= (cp1,cp2); since p''1&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p2, then cp1&nbsp;=&nbsp;cp2, so c'p' is an element of W.In general, any subset of an Euclidean space Rn that is defined by a system of homogeneous linear equations will yield a subspace. (The equation in example I was z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and the equation in example II was ''x&nbsp;=&nbsp;y.) Geometrically, these subspaces are points, lines, planes, and so on, that pass through the point 0.Examples related to calculusExample III: Again take the field to be R', but now let the vector space ''V be the set '''RR''' of all functions from '''R to R. Let C(R) be the subset consisting of continuous functions. Then C(R''') is a subspace of '''RR.Proof:We know from calculus the sum of continuous functions is continuous.Again, we know from calculus that the product of a continuous function and a number is continuous.Example IV: Keep the same field and vector space as before, but now consider the set Diff(R) of all differentiable functions. The same sort of argument as before shows that this is a subspace too.Examples that extend these themes are common in functional analysis.Properties of subspacesA way to characterise subspaces is that they are closed under linear combinations. That is, W'' is a subspace if and only if every linear combination of (finitely many) elements of ''W also belongs to W. Conditions 1 and 2 for a subspace are simply the most basic kinds of linear combinations.Operations on subspacesGiven subspaces U'' and ''W of a vector space V'', then their intersection ''U&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;W''&nbsp;:=  is also a subspace of V.Proof:Let v''' and '''w be elements of U''&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;''W. Then v''' and '''w belong to both U'' and ''W. Because U'' is a subspace, then '''v'&nbsp;+&nbsp;w''' belongs to U''. Similarly, since ''W is a subspace, then '''v&nbsp;+&nbsp;w''' belongs to W. Thus, '''v&nbsp;+&nbsp;w belongs to U''&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;''W.Let v''' belong to U''&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;''W, and let c be a scalar. Then '''v belongs to both U'' and ''W. Since U'' and ''W are subspaces, c'v' belongs to both U'' and&nbsp;''W.Since U'' and ''V are vector spaces, then 0''' belongs to both sets. Thus, '''0 belongs to U''&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;''W.Furthermore, the sum U+W = \ + \mathbf : \mathbf \in U \mbox \mathbf \in W \ is also a subspace of V''. The dimensions of ''U &cap; W'' and ''U + W satisfy \dim (U+W) = \dim U + \dim W - \dim (U \cap W). For every vector space V'', the set  and ''V itself are subspaces of V.If V'' is an inner product space, then the orthogonal complement of any subspace of ''V is again a subspace.External linksMIT Linear Algebra Lecture on the Four Fundamental Subspaces at Google Video, from MIT OpenCourseWare.Category:Linear algebra Category:Articles containing proofscs:Podprostor de:Unterraum es:Subespacio vectorial eu:Azpiespazio bektorial fr:Sous-espace vectoriel it:Sottospazio vettoriale nl:Lineaire deelruimte ja:線型部分空間 pl:Podprzestrzeń liniowa pt:Subespaço vetorial fi:Lineaarinen aliavaruus sv:Delrum ta:உள்வெளி uk:Лінійний підпростір ur:لکیری ذیلی فضا zh:线性子空间
