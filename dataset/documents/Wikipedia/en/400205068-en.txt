The people of this commune are referred to as Abondanciers.Abondance has given its name to a variety of cheese made in the region, as well as the breed of cattle from which the milk comes from to make the cheese. Abondance is home to the international boarding school Sainte Croix des Neiges. The town used to be a ski resort with 11 pistes.Abondance was the first ski resort in the Alps to shut down permanently due to lack of snow, due to alleged global warming. In the 2006-2007 ski season, the town lost money due to lifts being shutdown. The town's plea for government aid to support the resort was denied due to its unlikeliness to return to profit due to lack of snow.See alsoCommunes of the Haute-Savoie departmentAbondance (cattle)Abondance (cheese)External links Official website of the commune Category:Communes of Haute-Savoieceb:Abondance de:Abondance (Haute-Savoie) es:Abondance fr:Abondance (Haute-Savoie) it:Abondance nl:Abondance pl:Abondance sr:Абонданс vo:Abondance (Haute-Savoie)
