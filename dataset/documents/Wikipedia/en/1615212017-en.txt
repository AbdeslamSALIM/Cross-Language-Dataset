It was previously known as the Yugoslavia national football team until February 2003 and the Serbia and Montenegro national football team until June 2006 when Serbia declared independence as the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. It was renamed the Serbia national football team on 28 June 2006, with the Montenegro national football team created to represent the new state of Montenegro.FIFA and UEFA considers the Serbia national team the direct descendant of the Serbia and Montenegro national team.History  at Marakana, October 7, 2006]] Although the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed on April 28, 1992, because of the international sanctions due to the Yugoslav wars banning the country from international sporting events, the football team didn't play its first match until 23 December, 1994, when they lost to Brazil 2-0 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Since then the team has qualified for the World Cup twice, in 1998 and 2006, and for the European Championship once, in 2000. In 2003, with the reconstitution of the country as Serbia and Montenegro, the team changed its name accordingly. The first international match as Serbia and Montenegro was against Azerbaijan in Podgorica on 12 February, 2003, and ended as a 2-2 draw.On May 21, 2006 Montenegro voted to dissolve its political union with Serbia. On June 3, Montenegro became a sovereign state meaning there will be separate Montenegrin national teams competing in future tournaments. This did not affect the finals of the 2006 World Cup, in which the newly independent states of Serbia and Montenegro competed under the same flag for the last time but did not progress past the group stage.On August 16, 2006 the new team representing Serbia played its first international match, with a 3-1 away win against the Czech Republic.World Cup record1930 to 1990 - See Yugoslavia1994 – Banned because of international sanctions due to Yugoslav wars (as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)1998 – Round 2 (as FR Yugoslavia)2002 – Did not qualify (as FR Yugoslavia)2006 – Round 1 (as Serbia and Montenegro)European Championship record1960 to 1992 - See Yugoslavia1996 – Banned because of international sanctions due to Yugoslav wars (as Federal Republic of Yugoslavia)2000 – Quarterfinals (as FR Yugoslavia)2004 – Did not qualify (started qualification as FR Yugoslavia, finished as Serbia and Montenegro)2008 – ''Did not qualify (applied as Serbia and Montenegro; competed in qualification as Serbia)2010 FIFA World Cup Qualification Current squadThe following players were called up for the first two 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification matches against Faroe Islands and France in September 2008. |caps=19|goals=0|club=Sporting CP|clubnat=Portugal |caps=3|goals=0|club=FC Metalurh Donetsk|clubnat=Ukraine |----- ! colspan="9" bgcolor="#B0D3FB" align="left" | |----- bgcolor="#DFEDFD" |caps=13|goals=0|club=Borussia Dortmund|clubnat=Germany |caps=42|goals=0|club=Sevilla|clubnat=Spain |caps=59|goals=2|club=Schalke 04|clubnat=Germany |caps=34|goals=2|club=Manchester United|clubnat=England |caps=15|goals=3|club=Chelsea|clubnat=England |caps=2|goals=0|club=FK Partizan|clubnat=Serbia |----- ! colspan="9" bgcolor="#B0D3FB" align="left" | |----- bgcolor="#DFEDFD" |caps=18|goals=4|club=Genoa|clubnat=Italy |caps=76|goals=13|club=Internazionale|clubnat=Italy |caps=10|goals=0|club=Partizan Belgrade|clubnat=Serbia |caps=14|goals=2|club=Fiorentina|clubnat=Italy |caps=10|goals=0|club=Basel|clubnat=Switzerland |caps=14|goals=1|club=CSKA Moscow|clubnat=Russia |caps=2|goals=0|club=Red Star Belgrade|clubnat=Serbia |caps=41|goals=6|club=Red Bull Salzburg|clubnat=Austria |caps=4|goals=0|club=FC Nantes|clubnat=France |----- ! colspan="9" bgcolor="#B0D3FB" align="left" | |----- bgcolor="#DFEDFD" |caps=23|goals=6|club=PSV Eindhoven|clubnat=Netherlands |caps=21|goals=3|club=Hertha Berlin|clubnat=Germany |caps=32|goals=13|club=Valencia|clubnat=Spain |caps=9|goals=1|club=Standard Liège|clubnat=Belgium Recent Call UpsThe following players have also been called up to the Serbia squad in 2008.GoalkeepersNameDate of birthClubCaps (goals)Most Recent Call upVlada Avramov05 April 1979Italy Fiorentina2 (0)v. , , Damir Kahriman19 November 1984Serbia FK Rad1 (0)Macedonia]], 6 February, 2008Radiša IlićSeptember 20 1977Serbia OFK Beograd1 (0)Macedonia]], 6 February, 2008DefendersNameDate of birthClubCaps (goals)Most Recent Call upAleksandar Kolarov10 November 1985Italy Lazio1 (0)Russia]], 28 May, 2008Pavle Ninkov20 April 1985Serbia Red Star Belgrade2 (0)Russia]], 28 May, 2008Slobodan Rajković3 February 1989Netherlands Twente2 (0)Russia]], 28 May, 2008Nemanja RnićSeptember 30, 1984Belgium Anderlecht3 (0)Ukraine]], 26 March, 2008Marjan Marković28 September 1981Serbia Red Star Belgrade16 (0)Republic of Ireland]], 24 May, 2008Aleksandar LukovićOctober 23, 1982Italy Udinese8 (0)Ukraine]], 26 March, 2008MidfieldersNameDate of birthClubCaps (goals)Most Recent Call upMilan Smiljanić19 November 1986Spain Espanyol6 (1)Germany]], 31 May, 2008Dejan Milovanović21 January 1984France Lens2 (0)Germany]], 31 May, 2008Nenad Kovačević11 October 1980France Lens25 (0)Russia]], 28 May, 2008StrikersNameDate of birthClubCaps (goals)Most Recent Call upRanko Despotović21 January 1983Spain Real Murcia2 (0)Russia]], 28 May, 2008World Cup 2006 squad''Main Article: 2006 World Cup squads (Serbia and Montenegro)Competitions2006 World Cup''See also: 2006 World Cup qualification (UEFA)Serbia and Montenegro began their 2006 World Cup campaign by finishing first with an undefeated record in their qualification group ahead of favorites Spain and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Serbia and Montenegro team also allowed only one goal in the 10 matches, the best defensive record out all 51 teams participating in qualification.In the group stage, Serbia and Montenegro lost their opening game to joint group favourite, the Netherlands. The final score was 1-0 after Arjen Robben scored the only goal of the game. They also lost their second game to Argentina 6-0, the country's worst ever international result. With the team's two losses and with Netherlands and Argentina winning both their games, Serbia and Montenegro could no longer qualify for the knockout matches, and was playing for pride alone in their final group game against Côte d'Ivoire. Despite having a 2-0 lead for much of the first half, the Elephants managed to come back and win 3-2, leaving Serbia and Montenegro with a disappointing 0-0-3 World Cup run.Notable matchesDecember 23, 1994.
