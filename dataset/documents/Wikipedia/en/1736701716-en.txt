He is also a male model, and was the model for Calvin Klein underwearcelebrity men: freddie ljungberg until 2007.Ljungberg to hang up his boxersLjungberg normally plays as a winger, either on his preferred right side or occasionally on the left. He was the captain of the Swedish national team until he announced his retirement after Euro 2008.Club career===Early career=== Ljungberg joined Halmstad in Sweden as a youth player at the age of five. He played several other sports including ice hockey and handball for which he was called up to the national squad. He made his senior debut for Halmstad on 23 October 1994 in the Swedish First Division against AIK. He went on to make 139 appearances and score 16 goals for the club. He won both the Swedish Cup and League title with the club.ArsenalLjungberg was signed by Arsenal in 1998 for £3 million. Arsenal's manager, Arsène Wenger, took the unusual step of authorising the signing of Ljungberg after watching him play for Sweden in their defeat of England on television, without seeing him play live. The match confirmed to Wenger that Ljungberg would cope against English opponents. Ljungberg passed the test without difficulty and made a sensational debut after coming on as a substitute scoring against rival club Manchester United, the match ended 3-0.Some of Ljungberg's best form came in the second half of the 2001-02 season, when Arsenal won their second Premiership and FA Cup double. Following a knee injury to Robert Pirès, Ljungberg came in and scored in most of Arsenal's remaining games, including a stunning finish in the FA Cup final against Chelsea. He endeared himself to Arsenal supporters by having a bright red stripe in his hair. (A popular chant spawned from this to the tune of "I Love You Baby" by Andy Williams: "We love you Freddie, because you've got red hair, we love you Freddie because you're everywhere, we love you Freddie, you're Arsenal through and through" Later when he shaved his head this was updated to "We love you Freddie, because you've got no hair").Ljungberg was the first player to score a goal at an FA Cup final outside England, when Arsenal lost against Liverpool in 2001 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. A year later, against Chelsea, he became the first player to score in consecutive FA Cup finals  and Middlesbrough, September 2006.]]He is most comfortable on either wing in midfield, though he can also play centrally in a 4-5-1 formation or as a second striker. Ljungberg became a regular in Arsenal's starting lineup following the departure of Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars in the summer of 2000. For several seasons he played a major role for the club including being a member of the unbeaten 49 game run for Arsenal. He had to fight with constant injury problems and occasionally severe bouts with migraines; in 2005 a mysterious persistent hip injury led to fears he may have contracted cancer, which were unfounded. It transpired that he was suffering from blood poisoning caused by his large tattoos.Despite a persistent ankle injury Ljungberg played for Arsenal in the 2-1 defeat by Barcelona in the Champions League Final in Paris on May 17, 2006.It was speculated in January 2007 that Ljungberg was being forced to leave Arsenal, after bosses became tired of a run of injuries restricting his play. Though it was suggested he could make a move to West Ham, later these speculations proved to be premature. "Ljungberg still has a lot to offer to Arsenal," Arsene Wenger said, on January 13 2007, at a Blackburn Rovers pre-match press-conference, stressing the fact that Ljungberg will stay at Arsenal until the end of his contract in 2009.&quot;Wenger expects Ljungberg to stay&quot; - BBC Sport website However, Ljungberg did indeed leave Arsenal before the end of his contract, making the move to West Ham in mid-2007.Ljungberg came back after a long injury in an FA Cup match against Bolton Wanderers, scoring a goal thirteen minutes before the end of extra time, earning Arsenal a place in the fifth-round tie of the FA Cup against Blackburn Rovers.In 2008 Freddie placed 11th in Arsenal.com's Gunners' Greatest 50 Players.West Ham UnitedOn July 23, 2007, Ljungberg joined West Ham United on a four-year contract. West Ham United were only the second English professional club of Ljungberg's career. Ljungberg made his West Ham United debut in the 2-0 home defeat by Manchester City on August 11, 2007 a game in which he was also captain. He scored his first league goal for West Ham against Birmingham City on February 9, 2008.West Ham 1-1 Birmingham His first season with West Ham was ended on 26 April 2008 when Newcastle United defender, Steven Taylor, landed on him breaking one of his ribs.Ljungberg out for the season In August 2008, West Ham released Ljungberg after an agreement was reached to terminate his contract.International careerLjungberg represented Sweden at U21 level. He received his first full cap for Sweden on January 24, 1998 against the USA. He has represented his country at Euro 2000, World Cup 2002, Euro 2004 and World Cup 2006, where his 13th goal for Sweden came in the 89th minute of the match against Paraguay, and Euro 2008. After the World Cup 2006 finals, Ljungberg became captain of Sweden and lead them in Euro 2008.On June 27, 2008 Ljungberg announced that he was ending his 10-year career for the national team. The decision was expected, following Sweden's poor performances, early exit from Euro 2008 and Ljungberg's increasing injury problems. Ljungberg played his last match for Sweden on June 18, 2008 in the 2-0 defeat to Russia in the last group stage match in Euro 2008.Career statisticsAs of May 1, 2008   |- |1994||rowspan="5"|Halmstad||rowspan="5"|Allsvenskan||1||0|||||||||||| |- |1995||16||1|||||||||||| |- |1996||20||2|||||||||||| |- |1997||24||5|||||||||||| |- |1998||18||2||||||||||||  |- |1998-99||rowspan="9"|Arsenal||rowspan="9"|Premier League||16||1||5||0||colspan="2"|-||21||1 |- |1999-00||26||6||3||0||14||2||43||8 |- |2000-01||30||6||5||1||13||2||48||9 |- |2001-02||25||12||5||2||9||3||39||17 |- |2002-03||20||6||4||1||8||2||32||9 |- |2003-04||30||4||5||4||9||2||44||10 |- |2004-05||26||10||6||2||6||2||38||14 |- |2005-06||25||1||3||0||9||1||37||2 |- |2006-07||18||0||3||1||5||1||26||2 |- |2007-08||rowspan="2"|West Ham United||rowspan="2"|Premier League||25||2||3||0||colspan="2"|-||28||2 |- |2008-09|||||||||||||||| 79||10|||||||||||| 241||48||42||11||73||15||356||74 320||58|||||||| |Awardsaward, 2006.]]1998 Swedish FA prizes for "Best Midfielder of the year"1998 Swedish FA prizes for "People's player of the year"1998 Nominated for the Sexiest Men in the World1998 6th in the Swedish handsome men contest2000 Arsenal FC Player of the Month (January and February)2000 Arsenal FC Dreamcast Player of the Season competition came 2nd2000 AFCi Awards "Most Improved Arsenal Player" for the 1999–2000 season2000 2nd in AFCi Awards "Arsenal Player of the Season"2002 Winner of Guldbollen, the award for the best Swedish footballer of the year2006 Winner of Guldbollen, the award for the best Swedish footballer of the yearHonoursWith HalmstadSwedish Cup Winner: 1995Swedish League Winner: 1997With Arsenal:Community Shield: 1999FA Premier League Winner: 2001-02, 2003-04FA Cup: 2002, 2003, 2005ReferencesExternal linksFootballDatabase Fredrik Ljungberg's profile and statsGoal.com profileThe Wonderful World of West Ham United statistics         Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:UEFA Euro 2000 players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Football (soccer) wingers Category:Halmstads BK players Category:Premier League players Category:Swedish expatriate footballers Category:Swedish expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Swedish models Category:Swedish footballers Category:Swedish male models Category:Sweden international footballers Category:West Ham United F.C. playersar:فريدرك ليونبرغ bn:ফ্রেড্রিক লুক্সুমবার্গ bg:Фредрик Юнгбери ca:Fredrik Ljungberg cs:Fredrik Ljungberg da:Fredrik Ljungberg de:Fredrik Ljungberg et:Fredrik Ljungberg es:Fredrik Ljungberg fr:Fredrik Ljungberg ko:프레드릭 융베리 id:Fredrik Ljungberg it:Fredrik Ljungberg he:פרדי ליונגברג lt:Fredrik Ljungberg hu:Fredrik Ljungberg nl:Fredrik Ljungberg ja:フレドリック・ユングベリ no:Fredrik Ljungberg pl:Fredrik Ljungberg pt:Fredrik Ljungberg ru:Юнгберг, Фредрик sk:Fredrik Ljungberg sr:Фредрик Љунгберг fi:Fredrik Ljungberg sv:Fredrik Ljungberg tr:Fredrik Ljungberg bat-smg:Fredrik Ljungberg zh:弗雷德里克·永贝里
