It has two divisions, OMX Exchanges, which operates eight stock exchanges in the Nordic and Baltic countries, and OMX Technology, which develops and markets systems for financial transactions used by OMX Exchanges, as well as by other stock exchanges. The company is a world leader in financial instruments trading systems.HistoryOriginsOM AB (Optionsmäklarna) was a futures exchange founded by Olof Stenhammar in the 1980s to introduce trading in standardized option contracts in Sweden. OM acquired the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and unsuccessfully attempted acquisition of the [[London Stock Exchange]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[dot-com bubble]] in the early 21st century OM, together with investment bank [[Morgan Stanley|Morgan Stanley Dean Witter]], launched a virtual European stock exchange called Jiway. The project was not successful&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was cancelled on the 14th October 2002.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Acquisition of other exchangesOn 3 September 2003 the Helsinki Stock Exchange (HEX) merged with OM, and the joint company became OM HEX.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[August 31]], [[2004]], the brand name of the company was changed to OMX.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; OMX then acquired the [[Copenhagen Stock Exchange]] in January 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; for €164 million.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On [[September 19]], [[2006]] the [[Iceland Stock Exchange]] owner [[Eignarhaldsfelagid Verdbrefathing]] (EV) announced it would be acquired by OMX in a deal valuing the company at 250 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was completed by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt; The company also took a 10% stake in Oslo Bors Holding ASA, the owner of the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] in October 2006.Expansion of offeringsIn December 2005 OMX started First North, an alternative exchange for smaller companies, in Denmark. The First North exchange expanded to Stockholm in June 2006, Iceland in January 2007 and Helsinki in April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Markets Technology division of [[Computershare]] was acquired in 2006. The acquisition greatly expanded its product offerings and made its client list the largest of all trading system technology providers. The group launched a virtual Nordic Stock Exchange on October 2, 2006, after merging the individual lists of shares traded at its three wholly-owned Scandinavian exchanges into a combined Nordic List.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies listed on the Iceland Stock Exchange have also since been merged into the list. OMX also launched a pan-regional benchmark index, the [[OMX Nordic 40]], on the same date, however the individual exchanges have also retained their own national benchmark indices.NASDAQ takeoverOn May 25 2007, NASDAQ agreed to buy OMX for US$3.7 billion. In August 2007, however, Borse Dubai offered US$4 billion, prompting speculation of a bidding war. On September 20 2007, Borse Dubai agreed to stop competing to buy OMX in return for a 20% stake and 5 percent of votes in NASDAQ as well as NASDAQ's then 28% stake in the London Stock Exchange. In a complex transaction, Borse Dubai acquired 97.2% of OMX's outstanding shares before selling them onto NASDAQ. The newly merged company was renamed the NASDAQ OMX Group upon completion of the deal on February 27, 2008.==OMX exchanges==Copenhagen Stock ExchangeStockholm Stock ExchangeHelsinki Stock ExchangeTallinn Stock ExchangeRiga Stock ExchangeVilnius Stock ExchangeIceland Stock ExchangeArmenian Stock Exchange (completed November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;Oslo Stock Exchange (10% stake)DivisionsThe company's stock market activities are categorized into three divisions:Nordic Market (Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, Iceland)Baltic Market (Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius)First North (alternative exchange)TechnologyIn North America OMX supports its most high profile customers such as FINRA, ICAP, ISE, and BIDS Trading which are powered by OMX trading systems such as X-stream, CLICK and SAXESS.OMX's technology customers include:Abu Dhabi Stock MarketAgora-XAthens ExchangeAustralian Securities ExchangeBahamas International Securities ExchangeBahrain Stock ExchangeBarbados Stock ExchangeBolsa de Valores de ColombiaBombay Stock ExchangeBorsa ItalianaBoston Stock ExchangeCanadian Trading and Quotation SystemCairo and Alexandria Stock ExchangeDoha Securities MarketDubai Financial MarketDubai International Financial ExchangeegX CanadaEuropean Derivatives ExchangeFinancial Industry Regulatory AuthorityHong Kong Exchanges and ClearingICAPIcelandic Securities DepositoryInternational Securities ExchangeIraq Stock ExchangeIstanbul Stock ExchangeJakarta Stock ExchangeJamaica Stock ExchangeMalta Stock ExchangeMoscow Interbank Currency ExchangeNigerian Stock ExchangeNewcastle Stock ExchangeNSX Corporate Stock ExchangePalestine Securities ExchangePhilippine Dealing and Exchange CorporationPlus Markets GroupPort Moresby Stock ExchangeSaudi Arabia Stock Exchange (Tadawul)Singapore ExchangeShanghai Stock ExchangeSurabaya Stock ExchangeSWX Swiss ExchangeThailand Futures ExchangeTLXTokyo Commodities ExchangeTrinidad and Tobago Stock ExchangeTurkish Derivatives ExchangeWiener Börse AGZagreb Stock ExchangeSee alsoList of stock exchangesList of European stock exchangesList of Swedish companiesReferencesExternal linksOMX - Official siteCategory:Companies of Sweden Category:Companies established in 2003 Category:OMX Category:Financial services companies of Finlandda:OMX de:OMX es:OMX fr:OMX hy:OMX it:OMX AB nl:OMX ja:OMX no:OMX pl:OMX ro:OMX ru:OMX Group fi:OMX sv:OMX
