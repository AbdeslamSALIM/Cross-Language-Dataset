  | place of birth = Antium | date of death =  | place of death = Palatine, Rome | place of burial = Rome |Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (August 31, AD 12 &ndash; January 24, AD 41), more commonly known by his nickname Caligula (), was a Roman Emperor who reigned from 16 March 37 until his assassination on 24 January 41. Caligula was the third emperor of the Roman Empire, and a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty which descended from Augustus.Caligula's father, Germanicus, was the adopted son of emperor Tiberius and one of Rome's most beloved generals. The young Gaius earned his nickname, meaning "little soldier's boots", while travelling with his father on military campaigns in Germania. When Germanicus died in Antioch in 19, his mother Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children, where she became entangled in an increasingly bitter feud with Tiberius. During the course of the 20s and 30s, many of Caligula's relatives, including Agrippina and two elder brothers, died in mysterious circumstances. Caligula withdrew to the island of Capri in 31, where Tiberius himself had retired since 26, and eventually succeeded his adoptive grandfather upon his death on 16 March 37.There are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign, and although he is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule, after this the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources has been difficult to assess, what is known is that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the authority of the Principate, but struggled to maintain his position in the face of several conspiracies to overthrow him. He focused much of his attention on ambitious construction projects, annexed Mauretania, and campaigned against Britain, but was unable to conquer it.On 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy involving members of his own bodyguard and the Roman Senate. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, as the same day the Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle Claudius emperor in his place.Early lifeFamilySee Julio-Claudian Family Tree.Born as Gaius Julius Caesar on August 31, 12 AD, at the resort of Antium.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 8 He was the third of six surviving children born to Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 7 Gaius' brothers were Nero and Drusus. His sisters were Julia Livilla, Drusilla and Agrippina the Younger. Gaius was also nephew to Claudius (the future emperor).Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.6Gaius' father, Germanicus, was a prominent member of the Julio-Claudian family and was revered as one of the most beloved generals of the Roman Empire.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 4 He was the son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor. Germanicus was grandson to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia, as well as the great-nephew and adoptive grandson of Augustus.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 1Agrippina the Elder was the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder. She was also a granddaughter of Augustus and Scribonia.===Youth and early career=== [[Image:Caligae from side.jpg|thumb|left|A caliga.]] As a boy of just two or three, Gaius accompanied his father, Germanicus, on campaigns in the north of Germania.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula'' 9 The soldiers were amused that Gaius was dressed in a miniature soldier's uniform, including boots and armor. He was soon given his nickname Caligula, meaning "little (soldier's) boots" in Latin, after the small boots he wore as part of his uniform."Caligula" is formed from the Latin word caliga, meaning soldier's boot, and the diminutive infix ''-ul''. Gaius, though, reportedly grew to dislike this nickname.Seneca the Younger, On the Firmness of a Wise Person XVIII 2-5At the age of seven, Caligula also accompanied Germanicus on his expedition to Syria.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 10 Upon return, Caligula's father died on October 10, 19. Suetonius reports that Germanicus was poisoned in Syria by an agent of Tiberius who viewed Germanicus as a political rival.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 2After the death of his father, Caligula lived with his mother until relations between her and Tiberius deteriorated. Tiberius would not allow Agrippina to remarry for fear her husband would be a rival.Tacitus, Annals IV.52 Agrippina and Caligula's brother, Nero Caesar, were banished in 29 on charges of treason.Tacitus, Annals V.3 Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 54The adolescent Caligula was then sent to live first with his great-grandmother, and Tiberius' mother, Livia. Following Livia's death, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia. In 30, his brother, Drusus Caesar, was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide.Tacitus, Annals V.10 Suetonius writes that after the banishment of his mother and brothers, Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under close watch of soldiers.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 64In 31, Caligula was remanded to the personal care of Tiberius on Capri, where he lived for six years. To the surprise of many, Caligula was spared by Tiberius.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 62 According to historians, Caligula was an excellent natural actor and, recognizing danger, hid all his resentment towards Tiberius.Tacitus, Annals VI.20 An observer said of Caligula, "Never was there a better servant or a worse master!"In 33, Tiberius gave Caligula an honorary quaestorship, a position he held until his reign.Cassius Dio, Roman History LVII.23 Meanwhile, both Caligula's mother and brother, Drusus, died in prison.Tacitus, Annals VI.23Tacitus, Annals VI.25 Caligula was briefly married to Junia Claudilla in 33, though she died in childbirth the following year.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 12 Caligula spent time befriending the Praetorian Prefect, Naevius Sutorius Macro, an important ally. Macro spoke well of Caligula to Tiberius, attempting to quell any ill will or suspicion the Emperor felt towards Caligula.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius VI.35In 35, Caligula was named joint heir to the throne along with Tiberius Gemellus.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 76EmperorEarly reign, 1647]] When Tiberius died on March 16, 37, his estate and the titles of the Principate were left to Caligula and Tiberius' own grandson, Gemellus, who were to serve as joint heirs. Despite Tiberius being 77 and on his death bed, some ancient historians still suppose he was murdered.Tacitus, Annals VI.50Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 12 Tacitus writes that the Praetorian Prefect, Macro, smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession, much to the joy of the Roman people, and Suetonius writes that Caligula may have carried out the killing. Philo and Josephus, though, record Tiberius dying a natural death.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius IV.25; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIII.6.9 Backed by Macro, Caligula had Tiberius’ will nullified with regards to Gemellus on grounds of insanity, but otherwise carried out Tiberius' wishes.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.1Caligula accepted the powers of the Principate as conferred by the Senate and entered Rome on March 28 amid a crowd that hailed him as "our baby" and "our star," among other nicknames.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 13 Caligula is described as the first emperor who was admired by everyone in "all the world, from the rising to the setting sun."Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.10 Caligula was loved by many for being the beloved son of the popular Germanicus, but also because he was not Tiberius.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Tiberius 75 It was also said by Suetonius that over one-hundred and sixty thousand animals were sacrificed during three months of public rejoicing to usher in his reign.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 14Philo mentions widespread sacrifice, but no estimation on the degree, Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.12 Philo describes the first seven months of Caligula's reign as completely blissful.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.13Caligula's first acts were said to be generous in spirit, though many were political in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to those in the military including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside of Italy. He destroyed Tiberius' treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past and recalled exiles.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 15 He helped those who had been harmed by the Imperial tax system, banished sex offenders from the empire and put on lavish spectacles for the public, such as gladiator battles.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 16Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 18 Caligula also collected and brought back the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.3Illness, conspiracies and a change in attitudeFollowing an auspicious start to his reign, Caligula fell seriously ill in October of 37. Philo is the main historian to describe this illness,Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II–III though Cassius Dio mentions it in passing.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.10 Philo states that Caligula's increased bath-taking, drinking, and sex after becoming emperor caused him to become ill.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius II.14 It was said that the entire empire was paralyzed with sadness and sympathy over Caligula’s affliction.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius III.16 Caligula completely recovered from this illness, but Philo highlights Caligula's near-death experience as a turning point in his reign.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius IV.22 Josephus characterizes Caligula as a noble and moderate ruler for the first two years of his rule before a turn for the worse occurred.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XVIII.7.2Shortly after recovering from his illness, Caligula had several loyal individuals killed who had promised their lives for his in the event of a recovery.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.8 Caligula had his wife banished and his father-in-law, Marcus Silanus, and his cousin, Tiberius Gemellus, were forced to commit suicide.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius V.29Philo states Gemellus, in line to become emperor, plotted against Caligula while he was ill.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius V.28 Silanus, prior to killing himself, was formally put on trial by Caligula.Tacitus, Agricola 4 Julius Graecinus was ordered to prosecute Silanus, but refused and was executed as well. It is unknown if the plans of Gemellus and Silanus were related or separate. Suetonius considers these plots nothing more than Caligula's imagination.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 23Public reformcelebrating the abolition of a tax in 38 AD by Caligula. The obverse of the coin contains a picture of the liberty cap which symbolizes the liberation of the people from the tax burden.]]In 38, Caligula focused his attention on political and public reform. He published the accounts of public funds, which had not been made public during the reign of Tiberius. He aided those who lost property in fires, abolished certain taxes and gave out prizes to the public and gymnastic events. He also allowed new members into the equestrian and senatorial orders.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.9&amp;ndash;10Perhaps most significantly, he restored the practice of democratic elections.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 16.2 Cassius Dio said that this act "though delighting the rabble, grieved the sensible, who stopped to reflect, that if the offices should fall once more into the hands of the many ... many disasters would result".Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.9.7During the same year, though, Caligula also was criticized for executing people without full trials. The most significant execution was that of Macro, to whom, in many ways, Caligula owed his status as emperor.Financial crisis and famineAccording to Cassius Dio, a financial crisis emerged in 39. Suetonius places the beginning of this crisis in 38.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 37 Caligula’s political payments for support, generosity and extravagance had exhausted the state’s treasury. Ancient historians state that Caligula began falsely accusing, fining and even killing individuals for the purpose of seizing their estates.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 38 A number of other desperate measures by Caligula are described by historians. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 41 Caligula levied taxes on lawsuits, marriage and prostitution.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 40 Caligula began auctioning the lives of the gladiators at shows.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.14  Wills that left items to Tiberius were interpreted now to leave the items to Caligula.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.15 Centurions who had acquired property during plundering were forced to turn over spoils to the state. The current and past highway commissioners were accused of incompetence and embezzlement and forced to repay money.A brief famine of an unknown size occurred, perhaps caused by this financial crisis, according to Suetonius due to public carriages being seized by Caligula., according to Seneca because grain imports were disturbed by Caligula using boats for a pontoon bridge.Seneca the Younger, On the Shortness of Life XVIII.5ConstructionDespite financial difficulties, Caligula embarked on a number of construction projects during his reign. Some were for the public good, while others were for himself.Josephus describes as Caligula's greatest contribution to have improved the harbours at Rhegium and Sicily, thereby allowing grain imports from Egypt to increase.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.2.5 These improvements may have been made in response to the famine.Caligula completed the temple of Augustus and the theatre of Pompey and began an amphitheatre beside the Saepta.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 21 He also had the imperial palace expanded.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 22 He began the aqueducts Aqua Claudia and Anio Novus, which Pliny the Elder considered engineering marvels.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 21, Life of Claudius 20; Pliny the Elder, Natural History XXXVI.122 He built a large racetrack known as the circus of Gaius and Nero and had an Egyptian obelisk (now known as the Vatican Obelisk) transported to Rome by sea and erected in the middle of it.Pliny the Elder, Natural History XVI.76 At Syracuse, he repaired the city walls and the temples of the gods. He had new roads built and pushed to keep roads in good condition.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.15; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 37 He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city high up in the Alps. He also planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.  during the 1930s. This massive vessel served as an elaborate floating palace to the emperor.]] In 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons, stretching for over two miles from the resort of Baiae to the neighboring port of Puteoli.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 19 It was said that the bridge was to rival that of Persian King Xerxes' crossing of the Hellespont. Caligula, a man who could not swim,Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 54 then proceeded to ride his favorite horse, Incitatus, across, wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great. This act was in defiance of Tiberius' soothsayer Thrasyllus of Mendes prediction that he had "no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae".Caligula also had two large ships constructed for himself. These two sunken ships were found at the bottom of Lake Nemi. The ships are among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller of the ships was designed as a temple dedicated to Diana. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace that counted marble floors and plumbing among its amenities. Fifteen years after being raised, the ships were burned and almost nothing remains of the hulls, though many archeological treasures remain intact in the museum at lake NemiFeud with the SenateIn 39, relations between Caligula and the Roman Senate deteriorated.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.16; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 30 On what they disagreed is unknown. A number of factors, though, aggravated this feud. Prior to Caligula's appointment, the Roman Senate was accustomed to ruling without an emperor in Rome since Tiberius' departure for Capri in 26.Tacitus, Annals IV.41 Additionally, Tiberius' treason trials had eliminated a number of pro-Julian senators such as Gallus Asinius.Tacitus, ''Annals' IV.41Caligula reviewed Tiberius' records of treason trials and decided that numerous senators, based on their actions during these trials, were not trustworthy. He ordered a new set of investigations and trials. He replaced the consul and had several senators put to death.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 26 Suetonius reports that other senators were degraded by being forced to wait on him and run beside his chariot.Soon after his break with the Senate, Caligula was met with a number of additional conspiracies against him.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.22 A conspiracy involving his brother-in-law, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, was foiled in late 39. Soon after, the governor of Germany, Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Gaetulicus, was executed for connections to a conspiracy.Western expansionIn 40, Caligula expanded the Roman Empire into Mauretania and made a significant attempt at expanding into Britannia. The later action was fully realized by his successors.Mauretania was a client kingdom of Rome ruled by Ptolemy of Mauretania. Caligula invited Ptolemy to Rome and then had him suddenly executed.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 35 Mauretania was annexed by Caligula and divided into two provinces.Pliny the Elder, Natural History V.2 This annexation of Mauretania led to a rebellion of some magnitude that was put down under Claudius.Cassius Dio, Roman History LX.8, LX.24; Pliny the Elder, Natural History V.11 Details on these events are unclear. Cassius Dio had written an entire chapter on the annexation of Mauretania by Caligula, but it is now lost.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.25There also seemed to be a northern campaign to Britannia that was aborted. This campaign is derided by ancient historians with accounts of Gauls dressed up as Germanic tribesmen at his triumph and Roman troops ordered to collect seashells as "spoils of the sea".Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 45-47 Due to the lack of sources, what precisely occurred and why is a matter of debate even among the primary sources for Caligula's reign. Modern historians have put forward numerous theories in an attempt to explain these actions. This trip to the English Channel could have merely been a training and scouting mission.P. Bicknell, "The Emperor Gaius' Military Activities in A.D. 40", Historia 17 (1968), 496-505 The mission may have been to accept the surrender of the British chieftain Adminius.R.W. Davies, "The Abortive Invasion of Britain by Gaius", Historia 15 (1966), 124-128; See Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 44 "Seashells", or conchae in Latin, may be a metaphor for something else such as female genitalia (perhaps the troops visited brothels) or boats (perhaps they captured several small British boats).D. Wardle, Suetonius' Life of Caligula: a Commentary (Brussels, 1994), 313; David Woods "Caligula's Seashells", Greece and Rome (2000), 80-87Godlike Behavior. Ancient resources as well as recent archeological evidence suggest that, at one point, Caligula had the palace extended to annex this structure.]] In 40, Caligula began implementing very controversial policies that introduced religion into his political role. Caligula began appearing in public dressed as various gods and demigods such as Hercules, Mercury, Venus and Apollo.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XI-XV Reportedly, he began referring to himself as a god when meeting with politicians and he was referred to as Jupiter on occasion in public documents.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.26Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.28 A sacred precinct was set apart for his worship at Miletus in the province of Asia and two temples were erected for worship of him in Rome. The Temple of Castor and Pollux on the Forum was linked directly to the Imperial residence on the Palatine and dedicated to Caligula.Sanford, J.: "Did Caligula have a God complex?, Stanford Report, September 10, 2003 He would appear here on occasion and present himself as a god to the public.Caligula's religious policy was a departure from the policy of his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living Emperors could be worshipped as divine in the east and dead Emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome.Cassius Dio, Roman History LI.20 Augustus also had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including Senators, worship him as a physical living god.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.26-28Eastern policyCaligula needed to quell several riots and conspiracies in the eastern territories during his reign. Aiding him in his actions was his good friend, Herod Agrippa, who became governor of the territories of Batanaea and Trachonitis after Caligula became emperor in 37.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XVIII.6.10; Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.25The cause of tensions in the east was complicated, involving the spread of Greek culture, Roman law and the rights of Jews.Caligula did not trust the prefect of Egypt, Aulus Avilius Flaccus. Flaccus had been loyal to Tiberius, had conspired against Caligula's mother and had connections with Egyptian separatists.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus III.8, IV.21 In 38, Caligula sent Agrippa to Alexandria unannounced to check on Flaccus.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.26-28 According to Philo, the visit was met with jeers from the Greek population who saw Agrippa as the king of the Jews.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus V.29 Flaccus tried to placate both the Greek population and Caligula by having statues of the emperor placed in Jewish synagogues.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus VI.43 As a result, riots broke out in the city.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus VII.45 Caligula responded by removing Flaccus from his position and executing him.Philo of Alexandria, Flaccus XXI.185In 39, Agrippa accused Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, of planning a rebellion against Roman rule with the help of Parthia. Herod Antipas confessed and Caligula exiled him. Agrippa was awarded with his territories.Riots again erupted in Alexandria in 40 between Jews and Greeks.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XVIII.8.1 Jews were accused of not honoring the emperor. Also, disputes occurred in the city of Jamnia.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.201 Jews were angered by the erection of a clay altar and destroyed it. In response, Caligula ordered the erection of a statue of himself in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem.,Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.203 a demand in conflict with Jewish monotheism.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XVI.115 In this context, Philo wrote that Caligula "regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his."Fearing civil war if the order were carried out, it was delayed for nearly a year by the governor of Syria, Publius Petronius.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXXI.213 Agrippa finally convinced Caligula to reverse the order.Scandalsdepicting Caligula, c. 38. The reverse shows Caligula's three sisters, Agrippina, Drusilla and Iulia Livilla, with whom Caligula was rumoured to have carried on incestuous relationships.]] Surviving sources present a number of stories about Caligula that illustrate cruelty and insanity.The contemporaneous sources, Philo of Alexandria and Seneca the Younger, describe an insane Emperor who was self-absorbed, angry, killed on a whim, and who indulged in too much spending and sex.Seneca the Younger, On Anger xviii.1, On Anger III.xviii.1; On the Shortness of Life xviii.5; Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXIX He is accused of sleeping with other men's wives and bragging about it,Seneca the Younger, On Firmness xviii.1 killing for mere amusement,Seneca the Younger, On Anger III.xviii.1 purposely wasting money on his bridge, causing starvation,Seneca the Younger, On the Shortness of Life xviii.5 and wanting a statue of himself erected in the Temple of Jerusalem for his worship.While repeating the earlier stories, the later sources of Suetonius and Cassius Dio add additional tales of insanity. They accuse Caligula of incest with his sisters, Agrippina, Drusilla and Julia Livilla, and say he prostituted them to other men.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.11, LIX.22; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 24 They state he sent troops on illogical military exercises.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 46-47 They also allege he made the palace into a literal brothel. Perhaps most famously, they say that Caligula tried to make his horse, Incitatus, a consul and a priest.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 55; Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.14, LIX.28The validity of these accounts is debatable. In Roman political culture, insanity and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.Assassination and aftermathCaligula's actions as Emperor were described as being especially harsh to the Senate, the nobility and the equestrian order.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.1 According to Josephus, these actions led to several failed conspiracies against Caligula.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 56; Tacitus, Annals 16.17; Josephus, Antiquities of Jews XIX.1.2 Eventually, a successful murder was planned by officers within the Praetorian Guard led by Cassius Chaerea.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.3 The plot is described as having been planned by three men, but many in the Senate, army and equestrian order were said to have been informed of it and involved in it.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.10, XIX.1.14According to Josephus, Chaerea had political motivations for the assassination.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.6 Suetonius sees the motive in Caligula calling Chaerea derogatory names.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 56 Caligula considered Chaerea effeminate because of a weak voice and for not being firm with tax collection.Seneca the Younger, On Firmness xviii.2; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.5 Caligula would mock Chaerea with watchwords like "Priapus" and "Venus".Seneca the Younger, On Firmness xviii.2; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 56On January 24, 41, Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula while he was addressing an acting troupe of young men during a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 58 Details on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea was first to stab Caligula followed by a number of conspirators.Seneca the Younger, On Firmness xviii.2; Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 58; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.14 Suetonius records that Caligula's death was similar to that of Julius Caesar. He states that both the elder Gaius Julius Caesar (Julius Caesar) and the younger Gaius Julius Caesar (Caligula) were stabbed 30 times by conspirators led by a man named Cassius (Cassius Longinus and Cassius Chaerea).Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 57, 58 By the time Caligula's loyal Germanic guard responded, the emperor was already dead. The Germanic guard, stricken with grief and rage, responded with a rampaging attack on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators and bystanders alike.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.15; Suetonius, Life of Caligula 58The Senate attempted to use Caligula's death as an opportunity to restore the Republic.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.2 Chaerea attempted to convince the military to support the Senate.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.4.4 The military, though, remained loyal to the office of the emperor. The grieving Roman people assembled and demanded that Caligula's murderers be brought to justice.Tacitus, Annals XI.1; Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.20 Uncomfortable with lingering imperial support, the assassins sought out and stabbed Caligula's wife, Caesonia, and killed their infant daughter, Julia Drusilla, by smashing her head against a wall.Suetonius, The Lives of Twelve Caesars, Life of Caligula 59 They were unable to reach Caligula's uncle, Claudius, who was spirited out of the city to a nearby Praetorian camp.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.2.1 Claudius became emperor after procuring the support of the Praetorian guard and ordered the execution of Chaerea and any other known conspirators involved in the death of Caligula.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.3.1 According to Suetonius, Caligula's body was placed under turf until it was burned and entombed by his sisters. He was buried within the Mausoleum of Augustus; in AD 410 during the sack of Rome, the tomb's ashes were scattered.LegacyHistoriographyThe history of Caligula’s reign is extremely problematic. Only two sources have survived that were contemporary with Caligula— the works of Philo and Seneca. Philo’s works, On the Embassy to Gaius and Flaccus, give some details on Caligula’s early reign, but mostly focus on events surrounding the Jewish population in Judea and Egypt with whom he sympathizes. Seneca’s various works give mostly scattered anecdotes on Caligula’s personality. Seneca was almost put to death by Caligula in 39 likely due to his associations with conspirators.Cassius Dio, Roman History LIX.19At one time, there were detailed contemporaneous histories on Caligula, but they are now lost. Additionally, the historians who wrote them are described as biased, either overly critical or praising of Caligula.Tacitus, Annals I.1 Nonetheless, these lost primary sources, along with the works of Seneca and Philo, were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on Caligula written by the next generations of historians. A few of the contemporaneous historians are known by name. Fabius Rusticus and Cluvius Rufus both wrote condemning histories on Caligula that are now lost. Fabius Rusticus was a friend of Seneca who was known for historical embellishment and misrepresentation. Tacitus, Life of Gnaeus Julius Agricola X, Annals XIII.20 Cluvius Rufus was a senator involved in the assassination of Caligula.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews XIX.1.13 Caligula’s sister, Agrippina the Younger, wrote an autobiography that certainly included a detailed explanation of Caligula’s reign, but it too is lost. Agrippina was banished by Caligula for her connection to Marcus Lepidus, who conspired against Caligula. The inheritance of Nero, Agrippina's son and the future emperor, was seized by Caligula. Gaetulicus, a poet, produced a number of flattering writings about Caligula, but they too are lost.The bulk of what is known of Caligula comes from Suetonius and Cassius Dio, who were both of the Patrician class. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula eighty years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula’s death. Though Cassius Dio’s work is invaluable because it alone gives a loose chronology of Caligula’s reign, his surviving work is only a summary written by John Xiphilinus, an 11th century monk.A handful of other sources also add a limited perspective on Caligula. Josephus gives a detailed description of Caligula’s assassination. Tacitus provides some information on Caligula’s life under Tiberius. Tacitus, the most objective of ancient historians, did write a detailed history of Caligula, but this portion of his Annals is lost. Pliny the Elder’s Natural History also has a few brief references to Caligula.There are few surviving sources on Caligula and no surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light. The paucity and bias of sources has resulted in significant gaps in the reign of Caligula. Little is written on the first two years of Caligula’s reign. Additionally, there are only limited details on later significant events, such as the annexation of Mauretania, Caligula’s military actions in Britannia, and his feud with the Roman Senate.HealthInsanityAll surviving sources, except Pliny the Elder, characterize Caligula as insane. It is not known whether they are speaking figuratively or literally, though. Additionally, given Caligula's unpopularity among the surviving sources, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Recent sources are divided in attempting to ascribe a medical reason for Caligula's behavior, citing as possibilities encephalitis, epilepsy or meningitis. The question of whether or not Caligula was insane remains unanswered. , currently housed at the Getty Villa]]Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca also state Caligula was insane, but describe this madness as a personality trait that came through experience.Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XIIISeneca the Younger, On the Firmness of the Wise Person XVIII.1; Seneca the Younger, On Anger I.xx.8 Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from.Seneca the Younger, On the Firmness of the Wise Person XVII-XVIII; Seneca the Younger, On Anger I.xx.8 According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him to think he was a god.

Temkin, The Falling Sickness (2nd ed., Baltimore 1971) 3-4, 7, 13, 16, 26, 86, 92-96, 179HyperthyroidismSome modern historians think that Caligula suffered from hyperthyroidism.R.S. Katz, "The Illness of Caligula" CW 65(1972),223-25, refuted by M.G. Morgan, "Caligula’s Illness Again", CW 66(1973),327-29.
