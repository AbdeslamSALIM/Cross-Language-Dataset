After World War I, Merano became part of Italy with the rest of the province of Bolzano-Bozen.LanguagesAccording to the 2001 census, 51.50 % of the resident population speaks German as mother language, 48.01% Italian, and 0.49% Ladin.SportsIn 1981, the World Chess Championship match between Anatoly Karpov and Victor Korchnoi was held in Merano.
