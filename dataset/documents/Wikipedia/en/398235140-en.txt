Pietrasanta straddles the last foothills of the Apuan Alps. It is about 32&nbsp;km north of Pisa, 1 hour from Florence and 1.5 hour from Genoa. The town is located 3&nbsp;km (1.8 miles) off the coast (Marina di Pietrasanta).HistoryThe town has Roman origins and part of the Roman wall still exists.The medieval town was founded in 1255 upon the preexisting "Rocca di Sala" fortress of the Lombards by Luca Guiscardo da Pietrasanta, from whom it got its name. Pietrasanta was at its height a part of the Genova city-state (1316 - 1328). The town is first mentioned in 1331 in records of Genova, when it became a part of the Luccan state along with the river port of Motrone, and was held until 1430. At that time it passed back to Genova until 1484, when the Medicis took control of Florence.In 1494, Charles VIII of France took control of the town. It remained a Luccan town again until Pope Leo X gave Pietrasanta back to the Medici family.The town suffered a long period of a decadence during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, partially due to malaria. In 1841, the Granduke of Tuscany, Leopold II di Lorena promoted several reconstruction projects (including the building of schools specially created to teach carving skills, and the reopening of the once famous quarries), which brought back much of the town's former glory.The town then became the 'capoluogo' (capital) of the 'Vicariato di Pietrasanta', which included the towns of Forte dei Marmi, Seravezza and Stazzema (this region became the historical heart of Versilia). Finally, with the Plebiscite, the town joined the Italian Kingdom (Regno d'Italia).Main sightsCathedral of St. Martin (Duomo, 13th-14th centuries).Church of Saint Augustine (15th century), in Romanesque style, now seat of art exhibitions.The Gothic Civic Tower.Column and Fountain of the Marzocco (16th century).Palazzo Panichi Carli (16th century).Palazzo Moroni (16ht century), home to the local Archaeological Museum.The patronage of artistsThe area, like most of Tuscany in general, has long enjoyed the patronage of artists. Pietrasanta grew to importance during the 15th century, mainly due to its connection with marble. Michelangelo was the first sculptor to recognize the beauty of the local stone.Today, the Columbian painter and sculptor Fernando Botero as well as the Polish sculptor Igor Mitoraj, and Polish F1 driver Robert Kubica have residences in the comune.External links[http://www.comune.pietrasanta.lu.it/ official site of Comune di Pietrasanta] (Italian)Pietrasanta Portal (Italian)Pietrasanta tourist siteVideo Introduction to Pietrasanta (English)Downtown accommodationsask for our Pietrasanta newsletter (English issue) about Marble, Art and Tourism at info@pietrasantaresort.com Category:Cities and towns in Tuscany Category:Cathedrals in Italyca:Pietrasanta de:Pietrasanta es:Pietrasanta eo:Pietrasanta fr:Pietrasanta it:Pietrasanta nl:Pietrasanta ja:ピエトラサンタ nap:Pietrasanta no:Pietrasanta pms:Pietrasanta pl:Pietrasanta pt:Pietrasanta vo:Pietrasanta
