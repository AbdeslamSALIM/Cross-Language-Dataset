 Sofia Asgatovna Gubaidulina, (, ) (born October 24, 1931) is a Russian composer of half Russian half Tatar ethnicity.CareerGubaidulina was born in Chistopol, in the Tatar ASSR. In her youth she would spend much time praying in the fields near her home that she might one day become a composer. She studied composition and piano at the Kazan Conservatory, graduating in 1954. In Moscow she undertook further studies at the Conservatory with Nikolay Peyko until 1959, and then with Shebalin until 1963. Her music was deemed "irresponsible" during her studies in Soviet Russia, due to its exploration of alternative tunings. She was supported, however, by Dmitri Shostakovich, who in evaluating her final examination encouraged her to continue down her "mistaken path"."Sofia Gubaidulina: Johnnespassion". theomniscientmussel.com. Retrieved on 06 September, 2008. However, she was allowed to express her modernism in various scores she composed for documentary films, including the 1968 production, On Submarine Scooters, a 70mm film shot in the unique Kinopanorama widescreen format.In the mid-1970s Gubaidulina founded Astreja, a folk-instrument improvisation group with fellow composers Viktor Suslin and Vyacheslav Artyomov. In 1979, she was blacklisted as one of the "Khrennikov's Seven" at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers for unapproved participation in some festivals of Soviet music in the West.Gubaidulina became better known abroad during the early 1980s through Gidon Kremer's championing of her violin concerto Offertorium. She later composed a homage to T. S. Eliot, using the text from the poet's spiritual masterpiece Four Quartets. In 2000, Gubaidulina, along with Tan Dun, Osvaldo Golijov, and Wolfgang Rihm, was commissioned by the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart project to write a piece for the Passion 2000 project in commemoration of Johann Sebastian Bach. Her contribution was the Johannes-Passion. In 2002 she followed this by the Johannes-Ostern ("Easter according to John"), commissioned by Hannover Rundfunk. The two works together form a "diptych" on the death and resurrection of Christ, her largest work to date. Her work The Light at the End preceded Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 in the 2005 proms. In 2007 her second violin concerto In Tempus Praesens was performed at the Lucerne Festival by Anne-Sophie Mutter. Its creation has been depicted in Jan Schmidt-Garre's film Sophia - Biography of a Violin Concerto.Since 1992 she has lived in Hamburg, Germany. She is a member of the musical academies in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Stockholm.MusicGubaidulina's music is marked by the use of unusual instrumental combinations. In In Erwartung, she combines percussion and saxophone quartet. She has written pieces for Japanese koto and Western orchestra.Numerical mysticismIn the early 1980s, she began to use the Fibonacci sequence as a way of structuring the form of the work. The sequence was especially appealing because it provides a basis for composition while still allowing the form to "breathe". It plays a prominent role in such pieces as Perception, Im Anfang war der Rhythmus, Quasi hoketus and the symphony Stimmen... Verstummen...).Later the Lucas and Evangelist series, sequences derived from that of Fibonacci, were added to her repertoire.Awards and recognitionGubaidulina has received the Prix de Monaco (1987), the Premio Franco Abbiati (1991), the Heidelberger Künstlerinnenpreis (1991), the Russian State Prize (1992), the SpohrPreis (1995), the Praemium Imperiale in Japan (1998), the Sonning Award in Denmark (1999), the Polar Music Prize in Sweden (2002), the Great Distinguished Service Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2002) and the Living Composer Prize of the Cannes Classical Awards in 2003.In 2004, she was elected as a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.Quotations"I am a religious person...and by 'religion' I mean re-ligio, the re-tying of a bond...restoring the legato of life. Life divides man into many pieces...There is no weightier occupation than the recomposition of spiritual integrity through the composition of music."WorksQuintet for piano, two violins, viola, and violoncello (1957)Piano Sonata (1965)Night in Memphis cantata (1968)Musical Toys fourteen piano pieces for children (1969)Vivente - Non Vivente for electronics (1970)Concordanza for chamber ensemble (1971)String Quartet No. 1 (1971)Ten Preludes for solo cello (1974)Rumore e silenzio for percussion and harpsichord (1974)Hour of the Soul poem by Marina Tsvetaeva for large wind orchestra and mezzo-soprano/contralto (1974), for percussion, mezzo-soprano, and large orchestra (1976)Sonata for double bass and piano (1975)Concerto for bassoon and low strings (1975)Hell und Dunkel for organ (1976)Two Ballads for two trumpets and piano (1976)Trio for three trumpets (1976)Lied ohne Worte for trumpet and piano (1977)Duo sonata for two bassoons (1977)Lamento for tuba and piano (1977)Misterioso for 7 percussionists (1977)Introitus concerto for piano and chamber orchestra (1978)In Croce for cello and organ (1979), for bayan and cello (1991)Jubilatio for 4 percussionists (1979)Offertorium (Жертвоприношение) concerto for violin and orchestra (1980, rev. 1982, 1986)Garten von Freuden und Traurigkeiten for flute, viola, harp and narrator (1980)Perception for soprano, baritone (speaking voices) and 7 string instruments (1981, rev. 1983, 1986)Descensio for 3 trombones, 3 percussionists, harp, harpsichord and piano (1981)Sieben Worte for cello, bayan, and strings (1982)Quasi hoquetus for viola, bassoon, and piano (1984)Hommage à T.S.
