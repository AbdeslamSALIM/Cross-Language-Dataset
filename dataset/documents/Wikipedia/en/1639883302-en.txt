Thalberg Memorial Award2001 Lifetime Achievement Agostino De Laurentiis, usually credited as Dino De Laurentiis (born August 8 1919), is an Academy Award-winning Italian movie producer.BiographyHe was born at Torre Annunziata in the province of Naples, and grew up selling spaghetti produced by his father. A study at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome was interrupted by the Second World War.Since his first movie, L'ultimo Combattimento, (1940) he has produced nearly 150 movies to date. In 1946 his company, the Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica moved into production. In the early years De Laurentiis produced neoclassical art films as Bitter Rice (1946) and the Fellini classics La Strada (1954) Nights of Cabiria (1956), often in collaboration with producer Carlo Ponti. In the 1960s, Dino De Laurentiis built his own studio facilities, although these financially collapsed during the 1970s. During this time though, De Laurentiis produced such films as Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die, an imitation James Bond film, Navajo Joe (1966), a spaghetti western, Anzio (1968), a World War II film, Barbarella (1968) and Danger: Diabolik (1968), both successful comic book adaptations, and The Valachi Papers made to coincide with the popularity of The Godfather.In the 1970s, De Laurentiis relocated to the USA where he set up studios, eventually creating his own studio De Laurentiis Entertainment Group (DEG) based in Wilmington, North Carolina; the building of the studio quickly made Wilmington one of the busiest centers of American film and television production. During this period De Laurentiis made a number of successful and acclaimed films, including The Scientific Cardplayer (1972), Serpico (1973), Death Wish (1974), Mandingo (1975), Three Days of the Condor (1975), Ingmar Bergman's The Serpent's Egg (1977), Ragtime (1981), and Conan the Barbarian (1982). It is for his more infamous productions that De Laurentiis's name has become known - the legendary King Kong (1976) remake, which was a commercial hit, Lipstick (film), the killer whale film Orca (1977); The White Buffalo (1977); the disaster movie Hurricane (1979); the remake of Flash Gordon (1980); Halloween II (the 1981 sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 classic horror film); David Lynch's Dune (1984) and Blue Velvet (1986); and King Kong Lives (1986). De Laurentiis also made several adaptations of Stephen King's works during this time, including The Dead Zone (1983), Cat's Eye (1985), Silver Bullet (1985) and Maximum Overdrive (1986); Army of Darkness (1992) was produced jointly by De Laurentiis, Robert Tapert and the movie's star Bruce Campbell.During this time De Laurentiis also produced the original Hannibal Lecter film Manhunter (1986). He passed on adapting Thomas Harris's sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, but produced the two follow-ups, Hannibal (2001) and Red Dragon (2002), a remake of Manhunter. He also produced Hannibal Rising (2007), which tells the story of how Hannibal becomes a serial killer.In his later choice of stories he displayed a strong preference for adaptations of successful books, especially sweeping classics like The Bible: In the Beginning (1966), Barabbas (1961), or Dune (1984).In 2001 he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.FamilyHe has four children with his first wife, actress Silvana Mangano, who died in 1989. Today he is married to the movie producer Martha Schumacher and they have two daughters. One of the children from his first marriage, Raffaella De Laurentiis, is also a producer, the other Fredrico De Laurentiis (28 February 1955 - 15 July 1981) died at 26, in an airplane crash. His granddaughter is Giada De Laurentiis, host of Everyday Italian, Behind the Bash, and Giada's Weekend Getaways on Food Network. His nephew is Aurelio De Laurentiis, a film producer in his own right and the chairman of SSC Napoli football club.FilmographyFilmography from 1980 to present.YearTitleDirector2006Hannibal RisingPeter Webber2006The Last LegionDoug Lefler2006Virgin TerritoryDavid Leland2002Red DragonBrett Ratner2001HannibalRidley Scott2000U-571]]Jonathan Mostow1997BreakdownJonathan Mostow1996Unforgettable ]]John Dahl1996BoundLarry and Andy Wachowski1995Solomon &amp; ShebaRobert Young1995Slave Of DreamsRobert Young1995RumpelstiltskinMark Jones (I)1995Assassins ]]Richard Donner1994TemptationStrathford Hamilton1993Body Of EvidenceUli Edel1993Army of DarknessSam Raimi1992Once Upon A CrimeEugene Levy1992KuffsBruce A.
