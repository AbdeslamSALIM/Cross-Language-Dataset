Porto scouts. He was signed in 1998 but never really made a breakthrough in the team, and being relatively young he was loaned to gain experience, to another two northern sides, SC Salgueiros and Sporting Clube de Braga.At Braga, Fehér had his best professional season, netting 14 goals in 26 2000-01 matches. After Porto chairman Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa quarreled with agent José Veiga (Fehér's agent), Fehér refused to let go off his agent and left. He joined Lisbon side S.L. Benfica, going on to score 7 goals in 28 matches, during two seasons.DeathOn 25 January 2004, Benfica travelled to Guimarães to play Vitória S.C.. The game was being broadcast live on television and Benfica were leading 1-0. Fehér, who had just come on as a substitute and assisted another player brought from the bench, Fernando Aguiar, for the match's only goal, received a yellow card in injury time and suddenly bent forward seemingly in pain and then fell backwards to the ground.Teammates rushed immediately to aid Fehér before medical personnel arrived on the pitch. CPR was performed as players looked on in visible distress. An ambulance arrived on the pitch and Fehér was rushed to the hospital. His condition was covered by the Portuguese media throughout the day, but before midnight Fehér's death was confirmed. The Public Prosecutor (the Portuguese agency responsible for the release of autopsy details) announced that Fehér died of a heart attack. He was only 24 years old.In memory of him, Benfica retired the number 29 shirt which he wore during his time at the club, as it would never be worn again by any club player. He was remembered by many and his death caused a profound shock in Portuguese sport. Among others, Reinaldo Teles - director of football of FC Porto - and José Mourinho - Porto's manager at the time - paid their respect at the Estádio da Luz where the player's body remained before his burial in native Hungary.International careerFehér made his first international appearance for Hungary on October 1998 against Azerbaijan, and went on to score seven goals in 25 international matches.On October 11, 2000, he netted a hat-trick in a 6-1 away thrashing of Lithuania, in a 2002 World Cup qualifier.International goals#DateVenueOpponentScoreResultCompetition110 October, 1998BakuAzerbaijan4-0WinUEFA Euro 2000 Qual.]]211 October, 2000KaunasLithuania6-1WinFIFA World Cup 2002 Qual.]]311 October, 2000KaunasLithuania6-1WinFIFA World Cup 2002 Qual.]]411 October, 2000KaunasLithuania6-1WinFIFA World Cup 2002 Qual.]]515 November, 2000SkopjeFYR Macedonia 1-0WinFIFA World Cup 2002 Qual.]]617 April, 2002DebrecenBelarus 2-5LostFriendly720 August, 2003Murska SobotaSlovenia1-2LostFriendlyCareer statistics  |- |1995-96||rowspan="3"|Győri ETO||rowspan="3"|Hungarian League||8||2|||||||| |- |1996-97||29||8|||||||| |- |1997-98||25||13||||||||  |- |1998-99||rowspan="2"|FC Porto||rowspan="2"|Portuguese Liga||5||0|||||||| |- |1999-00||5||1|||||||| |- |1999-00||Salgueiros||Portuguese Liga||14||5|||||||| |- |2000-01||Sporting Braga||Portuguese Liga||26||14|||||||| |- |2001-02||Porto B||||3||1|||||||| |- |2002-03||rowspan="2"|Benfica||rowspan="2"|Portuguese Liga||16||4|||||||| |- |2003-04||13||3|||||||| 62||23|||||||| 82||28|||||||| 144||51|||||||| |See alsoList of footballers who died while playingReferencesExternal linksStats and profile at zerozero.ptVideo tribute, at YouTubeCategory:1979 births Category:2004 deaths Category:Hungarian footballers Category:Sporting Braga players Category:FC Porto players Category:S.L.
