It was released in 1997 by Spinefarm Records. The limited edition (of which only 500 copies were released), features only seven tracks, two of which are not on the regular edition.Even though the only single, "The Carpenter" reached number three on the Finnish singles chart, Nightwish failed to gain national fame until the release of their second studio album, Oceanborn.The male vocals heard on "Beauty and the Beast", "The Carpenter", "Astral Romance" and "Once Upon a Troubadour" are sung by Tuomas Holopainen. "Elvenpath" features audio clips from the prologue of The Lord of the Rings, directed by Ralph Bakshi. The track on the limited edition is the same track that was on their second demo, which was also titled "Angels Fall First".The songs from this album are rarely played at concerts. In 2005 (before being fired from Nightwish) vocalist Tarja Turunen expressed that she would like to sing some tracks from Angels Fall First again.The Angels First TourThey played only 8 gigs since Jukka Nevalainen and Emppu Vuorinen were waylaid by their obligitary military draft and Tarja Turunen hadn't finished her studies.
