With the release of The Beatles' Revolver, The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde as well as their own Aftermath and the accompanying singles during 1966, the parameters of rock music had been expanded considerably. Conscious that they had to progress beyond Aftermath, the Stones follow-up - betraying influences drawn from British pop contemporaries like The Kinks - was Between the Buttons.Much like Aftermath, Between the Buttons saw some differences in its UK and US versions. The UK edition (how producer Andrew Loog Oldham and The Rolling Stones intended it) was issued in January 1967 on Decca Records, concurrently with a separate single, "Let's Spend the Night Together" b/w "Ruby Tuesday". Because of common practice in the British record industry at the time, the single did not appear on the album. Generally well-received (although the critics took note of their influences), Between the Buttons reached #3 in the UK.In the US, "Let's Spend the Night Together" and "Ruby Tuesday" were slotted onto the album, with "Back Street Girl" and "Please Go Home" getting the boot (these would be included on the following US release, Flowers). With "Ruby Tuesday" reaching #1, Between the Buttons shot to #2 in the US, going gold.Additionally, Between the Buttons would prove to be the last album produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, with whom The Rolling Stones would have a creative falling-out in mid-1967. Indeed, Oldham's influence is more evident here than on earlier albums, as he employs Phil Spector-like layering on "Yesterday's Papers", "My Obsession", and "Complicated" and uncredited background vocalists (including, possibly, Graham Nash) throughout. Brian Jones continues his experiments in exotic instruments on this album, playing harmonica, recorder, piano, organ and electric dulcimer]. Keith Richards busies himself with distinctive guitar work on "My Obsession", "Connection", "All Sold Out", "Please Go Home" and "Miss Amanda Jones".In the years following its release, Between the Buttons somehow became overlooked. Today, however, many critics and fans have come to appreciate the album's eclectic qualities and a wealth of obscure gems, making it a unique album in The Rolling Stones' released catalogue, one that more or less abandoned the Stones' blues based style and featured more consistent songwriting than their previous efforts.In August 2002 both editions of Between the Buttons were reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.Track listingsAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith RichardsUK track listing"Yesterday's Papers" – 2:04"My Obsession" – 3:17"Back Street Girl" – 3:27"Connection" – 2:08"She Smiled Sweetly" – 2:44"Cool, Calm and Collected" – 4:17"All Sold Out" – 2:17"Please Go Home" – 3:17"Who's Been Sleeping Here?" – 3:55"Complicated" – 3:15"Miss Amanda Jones" – 2:47"Something Happened to Me Yesterday" – 4:55US track listing"Let's Spend the Night Together" – 3:36"Yesterday's Papers" – 2:04"Ruby Tuesday" – 3:17"Connection" – 2:08"She Smiled Sweetly" – 2:44"Cool, Calm and Collected" – 4:17"All Sold Out" – 2:17"My Obsession" – 3:17"Who's Been Sleeping Here?" – 3:55"Complicated" – 3:15"Miss Amanda Jones" – 2:47"Something Happened to Me Yesterday" – 4:55PersonnelMick Jagger - Vocals, Percussion, HarmonicaKeith Richards - Guitar, Vocals, Bass, Piano, Organ, Double BassBrian Jones - Piano, Organ, Vocals, Accordion, Vibraphone, Harmonica, Recorder, Percussion, Kazoo, Saxophone, dulcimer, GuitarCharlie Watts - DrumsBill Wyman - Bass, Percussion, Double BassNicky Hopkins - PianoJack Nitzsche - Piano, Harpsichord, Percussion, horn arrangementsIan Stewart - Piano, OrganChartsAlbumYearChartPosition1967UK Albums Chart31967Billboard Pop Albums2SinglesYearSingleChartPosition1967"Let's Spend The Night Together"UK Top 50 Singles31967"Let's Spend The Night Together"The Billboard Hot 100551967"Ruby Tuesday"The Billboard Hot 1001Notes External linksBetween the ButtonsReview of Between the Buttons at CriticalMess.netCategory:The Rolling Stones albums Category:1967 albums Category:Decca Records albums Category:ABKCO Records albums Category:Albums produced by Andrew Loog Oldham Category:Albums with alternate track listings Category:London Records albumscs:Between the Buttons da:Between the Buttons de:Between the Buttons es:Between the Buttons fr:Between the Buttons it:Between the Buttons he:Between the Buttons hu:Between the Buttons nl:Between the Buttons ja:ビトウィーン・ザ・バトンズ pl:Between the Buttons fi:Between the Buttons sv:Between the Buttons
