It was thought for several decades to be the largest crocodilian that ever lived. Deinosuchus is known mainly from skull material, and recent studies have reduced its estimated length. Some other giant crocodilians, including Sarcosuchus (the "SuperCroc"), Purussaurus and Rhamphosuchus, were as big or bigger, but accurate comparisons are difficult as Sarcosuchus is the only species known from a largely-complete skeleton.Size[[Image:Crocodilians scale.png|thumb|left|Size comparison of Deinosuchus hatcheri (orange) with a human, giant pholidosaurid Sarcosuchus imperator, and largest records of type species of modern crocodilians.]] The skull of Deinosuchus measures more than  from front to back and has a broad rather than narrow snout. Recent studies have reduced the estimate of the animal's total length from more than  to between 10 and 12&nbsp;m (33 and 40&nbsp;ft respectively). Even at this reduced estimate, Deinosuchus was still considerably larger than the saltwater crocodile of Australia, Southern and Southeast Asia, which is the largest living reptile. Deinosuchus bite force estimates match those of Sarcosuchus, over 18000&nbsp;lbf (82&nbsp;kN).Diet and habitatThe proportions of Deinosuchus are similar to the skull of today's Nile crocodile , which is a generalist carnivore that hunts fish, crustaceans, and large mammals, such as wildebeest and zebra.Deinosuchus probably lurked in rivers and swamps waiting for prey to come and drink from the waters edge (much like modern species). It would then have grabbed its prey in its massive jaws, containing large but somewhat blunt teeth, and then drag it into the water to drown. Perhaps it would have spun lengthways to tear off chunks of flesh (the "death roll" behaviour in modern species). It most likely preyed on fish, dinosaurs (especially the abundant hadrosaurs of the time), and anything else that strayed too close to the water.Deinosuchus specimens have been discovered in freshwater and marine deposits.Discovery and classification[[Image:Deinosuchus.jpg|thumb|left|Section of a Deinosuchus jaw, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]] The type species, Deinosuchus hatcheri was found by Holland at Willow Creek, Montana, in the Judith River Formation. Specimens from Big Bend National Park in Texas were originally assigned to the genus Phobosuchus in 1954 by Colbert and Bird, but are now assigned to Deinosuchus as the species D. riograndensis. Specimens have also been found in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, New Jersey, North Carolina, Wyoming, New Mexico and recently also in Mexico.Originally classified in the family Crocodylidae, a better skull specimen shows it is most likely a basal alligator in the superfamily Alligatoroidea.==In popular culture ==Deinosuchus made a brief appearance in the last episode of the TV series Walking with Dinosaurs but played a larger role in the companion book.Deinosuchus was the chief creature in the finale for the ITV series Prehistoric Park.An almost blind Deinosuchus named Dil was the principal villain in the movie The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists, along with Ichy, an Ichthyornis with whom she had a symbiotic relationship.A grossly over-sized Deinosuchus (around  long, with a  head) appears in an episode of SeaQuest DSV.Deinosuchus makes several appearances in the popular ''Zoo Tycoon'' franchise of video games. Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs includes the crocodillian either by unlocking it with a cheat, or as a scenario reward. Later, Deinosuchus appears in the sequel's expansion pack, Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals.A Deinosuchus served as the second boss of the The Lost World: Jurassic Park arcade game.A Deinosuchus model was introduced into the Carnegie Collection in 1996.ReferencesSchwimmer, David R. 2002.
