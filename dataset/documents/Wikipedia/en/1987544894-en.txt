A member of CAF, it is one of its weakest teams.HistoryAlthough one of the weaker sides in the strong West Africa region, Niger has produced a couple of noteworthy runs in qualifying tournaments.One of their best performances was in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers, in which Niger eliminated Somalia and Togo on away goals, but were beaten by Algeria in the third round where only 8 teams were left. Notable players in this run included Jacques Komlan, Hassane Adamou and Moussa Kanfideni.In the 2004 African Nations Cup qualifiers, Niger won all their home games (including a win over Guinea) to finish on 9 points, just 3 short of qualification.The Niger squad is also plagued by financial concerns, which have caused them to withdraw from international tournaments on more than one occasion. The Niger FA has turned to supporter's fundraising to pay for their trip to the 2010 African Cup of Nations in Angola, if they qualify.In June 2008, the Romanian coach Dan Anghelescu (French) took over the as team manager from Hamey Amadou, who was dismissed from the coaching position.
