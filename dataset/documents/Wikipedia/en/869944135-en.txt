Important conflicts in which the British took part later on in history include the Seven Years' War and the Napoleonic Wars of the 18th century/early 19th century, the Crimean War of the mid 19th Century, and the First and Second World Wars of the 20th century. The British Empire, which reached its apogee in the 1920s, was the largest empire in history; almost a third of the World's population were subjects of the British Crown and it controlled a quarter of the World's total land area (and arguably its seas).The current structure of defence management in the United Kingdom was set in place in 1964 when the modern day Ministry of Defence (MoD) was created (an earlier form had existed since 1940). The MoD assumed the roles of the Admiralty, the War Office and the Air Ministry.Cold Warbomber was a strategic bomber of the RAF's V Bomber force used to carry both conventional and nuclear bombs.]]Post-World War II economic and political decline, as well as changing attitudes in British society and government, was reflected by the Armed Forces' contracting global role.

Johnson, and Anglo-American Relations' at the Summit’, 1964-68, p77 Focus on Europe, raf.mod.uk Britain's protracted decline was dramatically epitomised by its political defeat during the Suez War of 1956.Johnman & Gorst (1997), The Suez Crisis, p166 The 1957 Defence White Paper decided to abolish conscription and reduce the size of the Armed Forces from 690,000 to 375,000 by 1962.Lider (1985), British Military Thought After World War II, p525 Seeking an inexpensive alternative to maintaining a large conventional military, the government pursued a doctrine of nuclear deterrence.Lee (1996), Aspects of British Political History 1914-1995, 273Pierre (1972), Nuclear Politics: the British experience with an independent strategic force: 1939-1970, p100 This initially consisted of free-fall bombs operated by the RAF, but these were eventually superseded by the submarine-launched Polaris ballistic missile. While assurances had been made to the United States that Britain would maintain a presence "East of Suez", a process of gradual withdrawal from its eastern commitments was undertaken in the 1960s, primarily for economic reasons.Hack (2000), Defence and Decolonisation in South-East Asia: Britain, Malaya, Singapore, 1941-1968, p285Chandler & Beckett (2003), p345 By the mid-1970s, Britain had withdrawn permanently deployed forces from Aden, Bahrain, Malaysia, Mauritius, Oman, Sharjah, and Singapore. Agreements with Malta (expired 1979) and South Africa (terminated 1975) also ended.With a permanent presence east of Suez effectively reduced to Hong Kong (up to 1997) and Brunei, the Armed Forces reconfigured to focus on the responsibilities allocated to the services during the Cold War.Vanguard to Trident 1945-2000, royal-navy.mod.ukKennedy (2004), British Naval Strategy East of Suez, 1900-2000: Influence and Actions, p193 Substantial forces were thus committed to NATO in Europe and elsewhere; by 1985, 72,929 personnel were stationed in Continental Europe. Focus on Europe, raf.mod.uk, p15-161998 Publication, dasa.mod.uk The British Army of the Rhine and RAF Germany consequently represented the largest and most important overseas commitments that the British Armed Forces had during this period.Chandler & Beckett (2003), p421 The Royal Navy's fleet developed an anti-submarine warfare specialisation, with a particular focus on countering Soviet submarines in the Eastern Atlantic and North Sea. In the process of this transition and due to economic constraints, four conventional aircraft carriers and two "commando" carriers decommissioned between 1967 and 1984.

An undeclared war with Indonesia had also occurred in Borneo during the 1960s, and recurring civil unrest in the declining number of British colonies often required military assistance.Recent historyThree major reviews of the British Armed Forces have been conducted since the end of the Cold War. The Conservative government produced the Options for Change review in the 1990s, seeking to benefit from a perceived post-Cold War "peace dividend".Hollowell (2003), Britain Since 1945, p16 All three services experienced considerable reductions in manpower, equipment, and infrastructure.Chandler & Beckett (2003), p358 Though the Soviet Union had disintegrated, a presence in Germany was retained, albeit in the reduced form of British Forces Germany. Experiences during the First Gulf War prompted renewed efforts to enhance joint operational cohesion and efficiency among the services by establishing a Permanent Joint Headquarters in 1996.Strachan (2006), ''Big Wars And Small Wars: The British Army And the Lessons of War in the Twentieth Centur, p158Frantzen (2005), Nato And Peace Support Operations, 1991-1999: Policies And Doctrines, p104An increasingly international role for the British Armed Forces has been pursued since the Cold War's end.Frantzen (2005), NATO and Peace Support Operations, 1991-1999: policies and doctrines, p95 This has entailed the Armed Forces often constituting a major component in peacekeeping missions under the auspices of the United Nations or NATO, and other multinational operations. Consistent undermanning and the reduced size of the Armed Forces has, however, highlighted the problem of "overstretch" in recent years.Dorman (2005), Overstretch: Modern Army's weakness, news.bbc.co.uk This has reportedly contributed to personnel retention difficulties and challenged the military's ability to sustain its overseas commitments.Chandler & Beckett (2003), p434BBC (2007), Military 'faces retention crisis', news.bbc.co.ukThe Strategic Defence Review – described as "foreign-policy-led" – was published in 1998.Chandler & Beckett (2003), P418Kennedy, British Naval Strategy East of Suez, 1900-2000: Influence and Actions, p261 Expeditionary warfare and tri-service integration were central to the review, which sought to improve efficiency and reduce expenditure by consolidating resources. Hansard (1998), House of Commons, publications.parliament.uk Chandler & Beckett (2003), p418 Most of the Armed Forces' helicopters were collected under a single command and a Joint Force Harrier was established in 2000, containing the Navy and RAF's fleet of Harrier Jump Jets.

Reductions in manpower, equipment, and infrastructure were also announced. The decision to reduce the Army's regular infantry to 36 battalions (from 40) and amalgamate the remaining single-battalion regiments was controversial, especially in Scotland and among former soldiers.BBC News (2004), Hoon confirms super-regiment plan, news.bbc.co.uk Envisaging a rebalanced composition of more rapidly deployable light and medium forces, the review announced that a regiment of Challenger 2 main battle tanks and a regiment of AS-90 self-propelled artillery would be converted to lighter roles.Future Army Structure, armedforces.co.ukCurrent strengthSLBM being launched from a ''Vanguard'' class ballistic missile submarine.

It is also the second largest spender on military science, engineering and technology.Tim Radford Military dominates UK science, says report The Guardian 20-1-2005 Despite Britain's wide ranging capabilities, recent defence policy has a stated assumption that any large operation would be undertaken as part of a coalition. Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan (''Herrick''), Iraq (''Granby'', ''Desert Fox'' and ''Telic'') may all be taken as precedent – indeed the last large scale military action in which the British armed forces fought alone was the Falklands War of 1982.The Royal Navy is the second largest navy in the world in terms of gross tonnage, with 90 commissioned ships.

According to the same source, the British Army had a strength of 100,010, while the Royal Air Force had a strength of 45,210. This puts the total number of regular Armed Forces personnel at 180,690 (not including civilians), nine percent of whom were women. This number is supported by reserve forces, including over 35,000 from the Territorial Army.
