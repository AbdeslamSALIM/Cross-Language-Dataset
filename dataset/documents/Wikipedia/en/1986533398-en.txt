He first went to Paris with the family of his then-girlfriend, Serena, whom he married in 1939, and then to the United States. From 1942 to 1944, he taught at Columbia University and Bard College as an instructor in economics and statistics. In 1944, he obtained his D. Soc. Sci. from the New School for Social Research working under Jacob Marschak. In 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and in 1948, he joined the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign faculty.When he was a professor at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration of Carnegie Mellon University in the 1950s and early 1960s, Modigliani made two path-breaking contributions to economic science:Along with Merton Miller, he formulated the important Modigliani-Miller theorem in corporate finance. This demonstrated that under certain assumptions, the value of a firm is not affected by whether it is financed by equity (selling shares) or debt (borrowing money).He was also the originator of the life-cycle hypothesis, which attempts to explain the level of saving in the economy. Modigliani proposed that consumers would aim for a stable level of consumption throughout their lifetime, for example by saving during their working years and spending during their retirement.In 1962, he joined the faculty at MIT, achieving distinction as an Institute Professor, where he stayed until his death.Modigliani also co-authored the textbooks, "Foundations of Financial Markets and Institutions" and "Capital Markets: Institutions and Instruments" with Frank J. Fabozzi of Yale School of Management.Active until the end, Modigliani enlisted fellow Nobel laureates Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow in 2003 to write a letter published in The New York Times chiding the Anti-Defamation League for honoring Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi. Berlusconi had recently defended Mussolini's conduct toward Jews during World War II.Modigliani was a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security.For many years, he lived in Belmont, Massachusetts, where his wife was active Belmont Garden Club. He died in Cambridge, Massachusetts.BibliographyExternal linksFranco Modigliani autobiographyAbout Franco Modigliani from nobel-winners.comMemorial for Franco Modigliani - MIT Sloanhis pioneering analyses of saving and of financial markets.School performance in the early years was good though not outstandingIDEAS/RePEc  Category:American economists Category:American business theorists Category:Italian-Americans Category:Italian economists Category:Italian Jews Category:Jewish scientists Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:Nobel laureates in Economics Category:Italian Nobel laureates Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty Category:The New School alumni Category:University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign faculty Category:Italian refugees Category:Jewish refugees Category:People from Rome (city)ar:فرانكو موديلياني ca:Franco Modigliani de:Franco Modigliani es:Franco Modigliani fr:Franco Modigliani gl:Franco Modigliani hr:Franco Modigliani io:Franco Modigliani id:Franco Modigliani it:Franco Modigliani he:פרנקו מודיליאני la:Francus Modigliani nl:Franco Modigliani ja:フランコ・モディリアーニ oc:Franco Modigliani pl:Franco Modigliani pt:Franco Modigliani ro:Franco Modigliani rm:Franco Modigliani ru:Модильяни, Франко fi:Franco Modigliani sv:Franco Modigliani tr:Franco Modigliani
