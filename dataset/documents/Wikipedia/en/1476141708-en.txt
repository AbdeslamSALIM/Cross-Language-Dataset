However, there was a tiger that devoured the animals. The dance presents the story of a married couple that left to hunt the tiger; however, he was attacked by the animal and he had to request aid to some timber men that were close and to beg to the Señor de la Caridad, protector of the municipality, to save them of the danger. The hunters killed the tiger. The dance is carried out in the party of May 2nd. It consists of four characters: “the old ones” that represent the couple that go with the shotgun and the bow; the tiger and the Lord of the drum that mark the steps of the dance. The spectators watch when the tiger attacks the old ones, but these behead it. The most amusing part is the “repartition” of the portions of the animal, which is called “behead the priest”, “the forehead for Vicente”, “the head for Teresa”... until all the residents are beheaded.“The ascension bulls” tradition belongs to San Juan Nonualco. It speaks of a character called Isidro Labrador. They tell that on Thursday of ascension, day that celebrates Christ's ascent to the sky, Isidro began to work the field and when he arrived to the oxen, he heard one of them say: “Isidro, today we won't work”. He fell on his knees begging forgiveness to God for not having remembered the date. Based on this event, the celebration is kept on Thursday of Ascension like the day dedicated to the bulls. In the six neighborhoods of San Juan Nonualco, the inhabitants manufacture a bull that they walk through the streets. The hermitages are adorned with altars and the Rosario is prayed. When concluding the prayer, the competition or fights of the bulls begin.Typical FoodAmong the typical food that you can find there is the atol of cashew seed. This atol has been done in the same manner, transmitting from generation to generation, for about 20 years.Category:Departments of El Salvadorbg:Ла Пас (департамент Салвадор) de:La Paz (El Salvador) es:Departamento de La Paz (El Salvador) fr:Département de La Paz (Salvador) it:Dipartimento di La Paz (El Salvador) lt:La Paso departamentas (Salvadoras) nl:La Paz (departement van El Salvador) pl:La Paz (departament Salwadoru) pt:La Paz (El Salvador)
