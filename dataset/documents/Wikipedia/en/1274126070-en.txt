 Sinergy is a Finnish power metal cover supergroup, formed in an effort to present a "balls-out female-fronted metal band" to the world, by American vocalist Kimberly Goss, who was keyboarding for Dimmu Borgir at the time, and In Flames lead guitarist Jesper Strömblad in 1998.They took their idea to Sweden, and after enlisting the services of guitarist Alexi Laiho (from Children of Bodom), bassist Sharlee D'Angelo (from Arch Enemy) and drummer Ronny Milianowicz (from Dionysus), they recorded their first album, Beware the Heavens, in 1999.Shortly after this, Goss relocated to Finland, making recording with her Swedish band mates somewhat difficult. All-new Finnish band members Roope Latvala (who had recently left Waltari), bassist Marco Hietala (from Tarot and Nightwish), along with To/Die/For drummer Tonmi Lillman came on board, recording the album To Hell and Back in 2000. Sinergy also toured with the famous Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish, on their European Wishmaster tour.The band recorded their third album, Suicide By My Side, in 2002, shortly after which Lillman left the band. He was soon replaced by Barathrum drummer Janne Parviainen. Hietala also left about this time, presumably due to his Nightwish commitments, and was replaced by American bassist Melanie Sisneros (from New Eden and The Iron Maidens). However, Sisneros lasted all but one show and was released from the band. Lauri Porra (from Stratovarius) became the band's bassist and has performed with them ever since.Sinergy is currently recording their latest album, entitled Sins of the Past, for a release planned for late 2005, but which has gone into 2008, due to Children of Bodom's busy schedule.Line-upCurrent membersKimberly &quot;Kim&quot; Goss - VocalsAlexi Laiho - Guitars, Additional VocalsRoope Latvala - GuitarsLauri Porra - BassJanne Parviainen - DrumsFormer MembersJesper Strömblad (In Flames, HammerFall, others) - 1997-1999 (Rhythm guitar)Sharlee D'Angelo (Witchery, Arch Enemy, Mercyful Fate) - 1997-1999 (Bass)Marco Hietala (Tarot, Nightwish) - 1999-2002 (Bass, Additional Vocals)Melanie Sisneros (New Eden, The Iron Maidens, Crescent Shield) - 2002 (Bass)Ronny Milianowicz (Dionysus) - 1997-1999 (Drums)Tonmi Lillman (Vanguard, ex-To/Die/For) - 1999-2001 (Drums)Erna Siikavirta - 1999 (Keyboards)DiscographyAlbumsBeware the Heavens (1999)To Hell and Back (2000)Suicide By My Side (2002)Sins of the Past (2008)External linksSinergy's MySpaceSinergy Fan PageSinergy at Nuclear Blasthttp://www.nuclearblastusa.com/nb/v2/news/news.php?bandID=176 http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=32599 - 2005 interviews about Sins of the Past2001 Interview with KimberlyCategory:Finnish musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups Category:Finnish heavy metal musical groups Category:Power metal musical groups Category:Supergroupsda:Sinergy de:Sinergy es:Sinergy fr:Sinergy it:Sinergy nl:Sinergy ja:シナジー no:Sinergy pl:Sinergy pt:Sinergy ru:Sinergy fi:Sinergy sv:Sinergy
