In 1909, french troops invaded the Kingdom and took garrison in Abéché. France took power, the sultan had to renounce his throne. At that time, Abéché was the largest city in Chad with 28,000 people, however major epidemics reduced the population to 6000 in 1919. In 1935, the sultanate was restaurated by orders of the French government, Muhammed Ouarada, heir to the throne after his father became king. Once one of the strongholds of the Arabic slave trade route, the city is known today for its markets, mosques, church, square (the Place de l'Indépendance) and for its sultan's palace. Abéché has several schools, a hospital, a university and is one of the major garrisons of the Armee Nationale du Tchad ANT . There is a small airport , Airport ID: AE, operated sunrise to sunset (SR-SS) with flights to N'Djaména.On 25 November 2006, the city was taken by the Union of Forces for Democracy, a rebel group that seeks to depose president Idriss Déby. Extensive looting took place during the night. On the same day, nearby Biltine was captured by the Rally of Democratic Forces, another rebel group. A day later, both cities were retaken by the Chadian army.On October 30 2007, the city came to international attention when 17 French volunteers working for the charity Zoé's Ark were arrested there for alleged child abduction.Abeche is the centrum for the delivery of humanitarian assistance for approx. 240,000 Darfurian refugees living in 12 camps east of the town, in the border region to Sudan. A number of organizations opened office 2003 and 2004, e.g. UNHCR, the Red Cross, the German GTZ and UNICEF. ClimateAbeche has perhaps the hottest climate of any major city. It gets 336 days a year above 90F(32C) and has a year round average daily high temperature of 102F.http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=065746&amp;refer=&lt;/ref&gt;   DemographicsYearPopulationWorld Gazetteer: Chad198840 000199354 628200878 191References Category:Cities, towns and villages in Chadbg:Абеше da:Abéché de:Abéché et:Abéché es:Abéché fr:Abéché ko:아베셰 id:Abéché it:Abéché lt:Abešė nl:Abéché pl:Abéché pt:Abéché ro:Abéché ru:Абеше simple:Abéché fi:Abéché sv:Abéché tr:Abéché uk:Абеше zh:阿贝歇
