It was founded in 1983 to make microcars in the old Arola factory after that company failed.In 1992 they started making a range of standard sized cars under the Mega brand, but by 2002 this brand was just being applied to a diesel and electric range Voiturette sans permis â€“ Aixam le premier constructeur de voitures sans permis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; of microvans and light utility vehicles.The company currently produces the Aixam A.7XX series (powered by Kubota diesel engines), a microcar comparable with the Smart. A notable difference is that some of the smaller models are restricted to 45&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) and can be driven without a driver's licence in some European countries (including France, Italy and Portugal, but not the UK).In Britain they are classified as a quadricycle (quad bike) because of their weight and power output. This requires either a full car licence or a full unlimited capacity motorcycle licence to legally drive them.They can be thought of as a sort of modern "2CV", not fast (about 100&nbsp;km/h or 60 mph ), but economical (often over 90 mpg or under 2.6 L/100km ), and with a roomy body made from a strong alloy frame covered with plastic panels (no rust). The low-emissions Kubota engines plus the automatic CVT transmission make them exceptionally "green" vehicles; and it is now possible to get various electric car versions.Aixam-Mega is currently (2006) Europe's largest producer of microcars and its products are available in the following countries:Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Aixam-Mega vehiclesAixam Crossline/A-series (berlina quadricycle): crossline (diesel or gasoline, top speed 45 or 93&nbsp;km/h), A-721 (diesel, 45&nbsp;km/h), A-741 (diesel 95&nbsp;km/h), A-751 (diesel , 78&nbsp;km/h).Aixam Scouty/Scouty-R (convertible) (diesel or gasoline, 45 or 93&nbsp;km/h).Aixam Crossline (SUV-style) (diesel or gasoline): top speed 45 or 93&nbsp;km/h.Mega City (electric), top speed 64&nbsp;km/h, in collaboration with NICE http://www.nicecarcompany.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;Mega Moskito Micro Pick-upMega MultiTruck (diesel or electric)Former vehiclesAixam MACAixam BerlinesAixam MinivanAixam Pick-upAixam MicrocarMega ConceptMega Monte Carlo (sports car)Mega Track (sports car)Other microcar producers:Chatenet http://www.automobiles-chatenet.comGrecav http://www.grecav.it/index.en.phpLigierMicrocar make.PeelPiaggioSimpa-JDM http://www.simpa-jdm.comReferencesExternal linksAIXAM WebsiteCategory:Car manufacturers Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers of France Category:Companies of France Category:Microcars Category:Production electric vehicles Category:French brands Category:Quadricyclesde:Aixam es:Aixam fr:Aixam it:Aixam lb:Aixam nl:Aixam no:Aixam pl:Aixam pt:Aixam fi:Aixam sv:Aixam tr:Aixam
