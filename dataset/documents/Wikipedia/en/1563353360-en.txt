 ]] The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) () in Strasbourg was established under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) of 1950 to monitor compliance by Contracting Parties. The European Convention on Human Rights, or formally named Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, is one of the most important conventions adopted by the Council of Europe. All 47 member states of the Council of Europe are contracting parties of the Convention. Applications against Contracting Parties for human rights violations can be brought before the Court either by other States Parties or by individuals.History and structureThe Court was instituted as a permanent court with full-time judges on 1 November 1998, replacing the then existing enforcement mechanisms, which included the European Commission of Human Rights (created in 1954) and the European Court of Human Rights, which had been created in 1950.The Court delivered its first judgment in 1960, Lawless v. Ireland.The new format of the Court was the result of the ratification of Protocol 11, an amendment to the Convention that was ratified in November 1998. The new full-time Judges were subsequently elected by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.By the time Protocol No. 11 entered into force on 1 November 1998 establishing a full-time Court and opening up direct access to the Court for 800 million Europeans, the Court had delivered 837 judgments. Seven years on at the end of 2005 the Court had delivered 5,968 judgments.All member states of the Council of Europe have to sign and ratify the Convention. The court consists of a number of judges equal to the number of Contracting Parties, which currently stand at 47. Each judge is elected in respect of a Contracting Party by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Despite this correspondence, however, there are no nationality requirements for judges (e.g. a Swiss national is elected in respect of Liechtenstein). Judges are assumed to be impartial arbiters, rather than representatives of any country. Judges are elected to six-year terms. They can be re-elected.The court is divided into five "Sections", each of which consists of a geographic and gender-balanced selection of justices. The entire court elects a President and five Section Presidents, two of whom also serve as Vice-Presidents of the court. All terms last for three years. Each section selects a Chamber, which consists of the Section President and a rotating selection of six other justices. The court also maintains a 17-member Grand Chamber, which consists of the President, Vice-Presidents, and Section Presidents, in addition to a rotating selection of justices from one of two balanced groups. The selection of judges alternates between the groups every nine months.On 18 September 2008, the Court has delivered its 10 000th judgment, Takhayeva and Others v. Russia (no. 23286/04). The Strasbourg Court found violations of Articles 2 (right to life), 3 (prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment), 5 (right to liberty and security) and 13 (right to an effective remedy) of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the applicants’ complaint that their relative disappeared after being abducted from their village in Chechnya by Russian servicemen.ProcedureComplaints of violations by member states are filed in Strasbourg, and are assigned to a Section. Each complaint is first heard by a committee of three judges, which may unanimously vote to strike any complaint without further examination. Once past committee, the complaint is heard and decided by a full Chamber. Decisions of great importance may be appealed to the Grand Chamber. Any decision of the court is binding on the member states and must be complied withArt. 46, European Convention of Human Rights, except if it consists of an advisory opinionArt. 47, European Convention of Human RightsIt is the role of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to supervise the execution of court judgments, though it has no formal means of using force against member countries in order to comply. However, the ultimate sanction of non-compliance is expulsion from the Council of Europe and thus becoming a 'pariah' state within Europe. Furthermore, the European Union takes a keen interest in the Convention and Court (and its jurisprudence) so would not look kindly upon any EU member state that did not fulfill its Convention obligations.JudgesAs of 16 May 2007 (in order of precedence):ECHR website - Composition of the Plenary.NameCountryPositionElectedTerm EndsJean-Paul CostaFrance FrancePresident19982010Christos RozakisGreece GreeceVice-President19982010Sir Nicolas BratzaUnited Kingdom United KingdomVice-President19982010Boštjan ZupančičSlovenia SloveniaSection President19982010Peer LorenzenDenmark DenmarkSection President19982010Françoise TulkensBelgium BelgiumSection President19982010Giovanni BonelloMalta MaltaJudge19982010Loukis LoucaidesCyprus CyprusJudge19982010Ireneu Cabral BarretoPortugal PortugalJudge19982010Riza TürmenTurkey TurkeyJudge19982010Corneliu BîrsanRomania RomaniaJudge19982010Karel JungwiertCzech Republic Czech RepublicJudge19982010Volodymyr ButkevychUkraine UkraineJudge19982010Josep CasadevallAndorra AndorraJudge19982010Nina VajićCroatia CroatiaJudge19982010Margarita Tsatsa-NikolovskaFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Former Yugoslav Republic of MacedoniaJudge19982010András BakaHungary HungaryAd Litem Judge19982010Rait MarusteEstonia EstoniaAd Litem Judge19982010Kristaq TrajaAlbania AlbaniaAd Litem Judge19982010Snejana BotoucharovaBulgaria BulgariaAd Litem Judge19982010Mindia UgrekhelidzeGeorgia GeorgiaAd Litem Judge19992011Anatoly KovlerRussia RussiaAd Litem Judge19992011Vladimiro ZagrebelskyItaly ItalyAd Litem Judge20012007Antonella MularoniSan Marino San MarinoAd Litem Judge20012007Elisabeth SteinerAustria AustriaAd Litem Judge20012007Stanislav PavlovschiMoldova MoldovaAd Litem Judge20012007Lech GarlickiPoland PolandAd Litem Judge20022008Javier Borrego BorregoSpain SpainAd Litem Judge20032009Elisabet Fura-SandströmSweden SwedenAd Litem Judge20032009Alvina GyulumyanArmenia ArmeniaAd Litem Judge20032009Khanlar HajiyevAzerbaijan AzerbaijanAd Litem Judge20042010Ljiljana MijovićBosnia and Herzegovina Bosnia and HerzegovinaAd Litem Judge20042010Renate JaegerGermany GermanyAd Litem Judge20042010Egbert MyjerNetherlands NetherlandsAd Litem Judge20042010Sverre Erik JebensNorway NorwayAd Litem Judge20042010Davið Þór BjörgvinssonIceland IcelandAd Litem Judge20042010Danutė JočienėLithuania LithuaniaAd Litem Judge20042010Ján ŠikutaSlovakia SlovakiaAd Litem Judge20042010Dragoljub PopovićSerbia SerbiaAd Litem Judge20052011Ineta ZiemeleLatvia LatviaAd Litem Judge20052011Mark VilligerLiechtenstein LiechtensteinAd Litem Judge20062012Isabelle Berro-LefevreMonaco MonacoAd Litem Judge20062012Päivi HirveläFinland FinlandAd Litem Judge20072013Giorgio MalinverniSwitzerland SwitzerlandAd Litem Judge20072013The Plenary Court elects the Registrar and one or more Deputy Registrars.

PhillipsReformDue to the increase in awareness of European citizens of their rights under the Convention, the Court was becoming a victim of its own success. Some cases were taking up to five years before being decided and there is a significant backlog. For example, according to the Human Rights Information Bulletin (issued by the Council of Europe), between 1 November 2003 and 29 February 2004 the Court dealt with 7315 cases, of which 6255 were declared inadmissible.Working on the principle that 'justice delayed is justice denied', the Council of Europe set up a working party to consider ways of improving the efficiency of the Court. This resulted in an amendment to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Protocol 14. This new protocol, which requires universal ratification by all Council of Europe member states to come into force, makes a number of changes:A single judge can decide on a case's admissibility. Currently, three judges decide.Where cases are broadly similar to ones brought previously before the Court, and are essentially due to a member state failing to change their domestic law to correct a failing highlighted by that previous judgement, the case can be decided by three judges rather than the seven-judge Chamber.A case may not be admissible if it is considered that the applicant has not suffered 'significant disadvantage'. However, this is not a 'hard and fast' rule.A member state can be brought before the court by the Committee of Ministers if that state refuses to enforce a judgment against it.The Committee of Ministers can ask the Court for an 'interpretation' of a judgement to help determine the best way for a member state to comply with it.Amnesty International has expressed concern that these changes to the admissibility criteria will mean individuals may lose the ability to 'gain redress for human rights violations'.European Court on Human Rights: Imminent reforms must not obstruct individuals' redress for human rights violations by Amnesty International News Service No: 120 11 May 2004Notable casesIn December 1977, the court ruled that the government of the United Kingdom was guilty of "inhuman and degrading treatment", of men interned without trial, by the court, following a case brought by the Republic of Ireland (Case No. 5310/71). The court found that while their internment was a violation of the convention rights, it was justifiable in the circumstances; it however ruled that the practice of the five techniques and the practice of beating prisoners constituted inhumane and degrading punishment in violation of the convention, although not torture.Search ECHR data base "In the case of Ireland v. the United Kingdom" (No. 5310/71)In 1980, the court ruled out the foetal right to sue the mother carrying the foetus. In Paton v. United Kingdom, it was discovered that the life of foetus is "intimately connected with, and cannot be regarded in isolation from, the life of the pregnant woman".In 2003 and 2004, the court ruled that "that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy" (13/02/2003),http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2003/feb/RefahPartisiGCjudgmenteng.htm Refah Partisi (The Welfare Party) and Others v Turkey because the sharia rules on inheritance, women's rights and religious freedom violate human rights as established in the European Convention on Human Rights.In 2006, the court denied admissibility of the applications of former Soviet secret services operatives convicted in Estonia for Stalinist crimes against humanity after Estonia became independent in 1991. See also European Court of Human Rights cases on Occupation of Baltic States.Since the Russian military invaded Chechnya for the second time in 1999, the court has agreed to hear cases of human rights abuse brought forward by Chechen civilians against Russia in the course of the Second Chechen War, with 31 rulings to date as of June 2008 (including regarding the cases of torture and extrajudicial executions). In 2007, for example, the Court ruled that Russia was responsible for the killings of a human rights activist Zura Bitiyeva and her family.&quot;Russia Ruled Responsible For Killings Of Four Chechens&quot; 21 June 2007, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, June 21, 2007 Bitiyeva herself had filed a complaint against Moscow with the ECHR in 2000 for abuse while in detention, in then-second case from Chechnya, but she was murdered in 2003 before the ruling was issued.Russia Convicted in Chechnya Killings, IslamOnline, Jun. 22, 2007 Other cases ruled against Russia included the deaths (or presumed deaths after years of forced disappearance) of Ruslan Alikhadzhyev, Shakhid Baysayev, Nura Luluyeva and Khadzhi-Murat Yandiyev, the case of the indiscriminate bombing of Katyr-Yurt, and some of the deaths during the Novye Aldi massacre. As of 2008, ECHR has been flooded by a complaints from Chechnya, what the Human Rights Watch called "the last hope for the victims".Chechnya: European Court Last Hope for Victims; France, EU, Should Use Rulings to End Abuses, Human Rights Watch, June 9, 2008Other casesDudgeon v.

The design is meant to reflect, amongst other things, the two distinct components of the Commission and Court (as it then was). Wide scale use of glass emphasises the 'openness' of the court to European citizens.See alsoAfrican Court on Human and Peoples' Rights - regional court established in 2006European Court of Human Rights casesHuman rights in EuropeInter-American Court of Human Rights - regional court established in 1979NotesExternal linksOfficial websiteinformation for applicantsCourt judgements, decisions and case law websiteRules of the Court (PDF)Case-processing flowchart (PDF)(before Protocol 14)Text of Protocol 14&quot;Chechens taking Russia to court&quot; - BBC NewsEuropean Court of Human Rights condemns Russia in media case - IFEXHow Russia hijacks the European Court of Human Rights (with references at Ilaşcu case)  Category:1995 architecture Category:International courts Category:Intergovernmental human rights organizations Category:European politics Court of Human Rights Category:Richard Rogers buildings Category:Strasbourgbs:Evropski sud za ljudska prava br:Lez europat gwirioù mab-den ca:Tribunal Europeu de Drets Humans cs:Evropský soud pro lidská práva da:Den Europæiske Menneskerettighedsdomstol de:Europäischer Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte el:Ευρωπαϊκό Δικαστήριο Ανθρωπίνων Δικαιωμάτων es:Tribunal Europeo de Derechos Humanos eo:Eŭropa Kortumo pri Homaj Rajtoj fr:Cour européenne des droits de l'homme hr:Europski sud za ljudska prava ia:Corte Europee it:Corte Europea dei diritti dell'uomo ku:Dadgeha Mafên Mirovan ya Ewrûpayê lt:Europos Žmogaus Teisių Teismas hu:Emberi Jogok Európai Bírósága nl:Europees Hof voor de Rechten van de Mens ja:欧州人権裁判所 no:Den europeiske menneskerettsdomstol nn:Den europeiske menneskerettsdomstolen pl:Europejski Trybunał Praw Człowieka pt:Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos Humanos ro:Curtea Europeană a Drepturilor Omului ru:Европейский Суд по правам человека simple:European Court of Human Rights sk:Európsky súd pre ľudské práva sr:Европски суд за људска права fi:Euroopan ihmisoikeustuomioistuin sv:Europadomstolen tr:Avrupa İnsan Hakları Mahkemesi uk:Європейський суд з прав людини
