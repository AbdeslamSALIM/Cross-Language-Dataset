| footnotes         =  Gabriel Jonas Lippmann (August 16 1845 &ndash; July 13 1921) was a Franco-Luxembourgish physicist and inventor, and Nobel laureate in physics for his method of reproducing colours photographically based on the phenomenon of interference, later known as the Lippmann plate.He was born to Franco-Jewish parents in Hollerich, Luxemburg. When Gabriel was three, his family moved back to France, to live in Paris, where he was homeschooled.He is remembered for the innovations that resulted from his search for a direct color-sensitive medium in photography. He was one of the founders of the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée in France. He also invented an electrometer that was used in the first ECG machine.Lippmann was a member of the Academy of Sciences from 8 February 1886 until his death, including serving as its President in 1912. In addition, he was a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London, a member of the Bureau des Longitudes, and a member of the Grand Ducal Institute.Lippmann married the daughter of novelist Victor Cherbuliez in 1888. He died on 13 July 1921 aboard the steamer France while en route from Canada.ReferencesExternal links Nobel FoundationGabriel Lippmann in Jewish EncyclopediaCentre de Recherche Public - Gabriel Lippmann[[Category:Alumni of the École Normale Supérieure  Category:1845 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Color scientists Category:Experimental physicists Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:French Jews Category:French physicists Category:French Nobel laureates Lippmann Category:Jewish scientists Category:Luxembourgers of French descent Category:Luxembourgian inventors Category:Luxembourgian Jews Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:People from Luxembourg Cityar:غبريال ليبمان bn:গাব্রিয়েল লিপমান bs:Gabriel Lippmann bg:Габриел Липман ca:Gabriel Lippmann cs:Gabriel Lippmann da:Gabriel Lippmann de:Gabriel Lippmann es:Gabriel Lippmann eo:Gabriel Lippmann fa:گابریل لیپمن fr:Gabriel Lippmann gl:Gabriel Lippmann ko:가브리엘 리프만 hi:गाब्रियल लिपमन hr:Gabriel Lippmann io:Gabriel Lippmann id:Gabriel Lippmann it:Gabriel Lippmann he:גבריאל ליפמן sw:Gabriel Lippmann ht:Gabriel Jonas Lippmann ku:Gabriel Lippmann lb:Gabriel Lippmann nl:Gabriel Jonas Lippmann ja:ガブリエル・リップマン no:Gabriel Lippmann oc:Gabriel Lippmann pl:Gabriel Lippmann pt:Gabriel Lippmann ro:Gabriel Lippmann ru:Липпман, Габриэль sl:Gabriel Lippmann fi:Gabriel Lippmann sv:Gabriel Lippmann vi:Gabriel Lippmann zh:加布里埃尔·李普曼
