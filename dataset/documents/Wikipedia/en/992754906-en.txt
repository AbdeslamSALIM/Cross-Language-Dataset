In the 2001 census, it reported a population of 2,029,471. The capital is the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The state is one of the wealthiest states in Bolivia with huge reserves of natural gas. The effors by the Bolivian president Evo Morales to introduce land reforms and redistribute the natural gas revenues with the poorer indigenous people in the western Bolivia has led to divisions within the country and referundum for autonomy. Anti-Morales protests hit BoliviaGovernment and AdministrationAccording to current Constitution, the highest authority in the department lies with the prefect (prefecto, similar to a governor but with restricted powers). The prefect was appointed by the President of the Republic till 2005, since then it has been elected by popular vote to serve for a five-year term.Santa Cruz also has a Departmental Council (Consejo Departamental, similar to a state legislature but with restricted powers) of 23 members called councilors (consejeros). Each of the department's provinces returns at least one councilor, while remaining councilors are assigned to provinces on population basis. By law, the election of councilors is an attribution of municipalities. However, some municipalities such as Camiri (Province of Cordillera) or Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Province of Andrés Ibáñez) have issued internal norms (ordenanzas) in order to have their councilors elected by popular vote.EconomyThe department covers a vast expanse of territory in eastern Bolivia, much of it rainforests, extending from the Andes to the border with Brazil. The department's economy depends largely on agriculture, with sugar, cotton, soybeans and rice being grown. In recent years, the discovery of natural gas in the department has led to plans for the development of a regional natural gas industry that is likely to boost the local economy. The department also hosts El Mutún, the second largest iron ore reserve (after Carajás in Brazil) and largest magnesium deposits are also located there.In July 2004, the people voted in a nation-wide referendum to allow for regulated exportation of the gas.Gas ReferendumProvincesThe Department of Santa Cruz is divided into 15 provincesProvinces of Santa Cruz Department (2005)ProvinceCapitalArea (km²)PopulationAndrés Ibáñez]]Santa Cruz de la Sierra&nbsp;&nbsp;4,8211,549,849Ignacio Warnes]]Warnes1,21662,417José Miguel de Velasco]]San Ignacio]]65,42564,517Ichilo]]Buena Vista14,23282,952Chiquitos]]San José]]31,42970,319Sara]]Portachuelo6,88642,157Cordillera]]Lagunillas86,245108,843Vallegrande]]Vallegrande6,41427,691Florida]]Samaipata]]4,13229,850Obispo Santiesteban]]Montero3,673166,267Ñuflo de Chávez]]Concepción]]54,150116,101Ángel Sandoval]]San Matías ]]37,44214,362Manuel Maria Caballero]]Comarapa2,31022,142Germán Busch]]Puerto Suárez24,90337,637Guarayos]]Ascensión]]20,29338,498]]Call for autonomy Eastern provinces in Bolivia including the Santa Cruz has majority of the natural gas reserves.
