In the course of his career, he was best known by his ring name Bret "The Hitman" Hart.A son of wrestling patriarch Stu Hart, Bret Hart was born into the Hart wrestling family. His seven brothers were either wrestlers or involved backstage with the wrestling business; his four sisters all married professional wrestlers. Three of his brothers-in-law, the Dynamite Kid, Davey Boy Smith, and Jim Neidhart, had very successful careers in the business. His youngest brother, Owen Hart, became a decorated wrestler in his own right before his death in 1999.In terms of in-ring ability, Hart is known for his fluid technical skills and agility. Labeled "the greatest storyteller in the history of the business" by Vince McMahon, he was adept at creating tense and entertaining matches. Mean Gene Okerlund has also placed him in the top five best technical wrestlers of all time. Hart himself frequently described himself as "The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be" (derived from the 1984 film The Natural), which he justifies through three claims: He never injured an opponent through any fault of his own; through the entire course of his career he only missed two shows (both as a result of traffic and flight difficulties); and that he only once refused to lose a scripted match—his final WWF match with Shawn Michaels at Survivor Series 1997 (which culminated in the now infamous Montreal Screwjob).Hart, B. "When I boast about being the best there is, it is because of three reasons...," Bret Hart Calgary Sun column. Hart was widely regarded as one of the most universally popular and gifted technical professional wrestlers of all time.Bret Hart's WWE ProfileThroughout his career Hart competed in the tag team, junior heavyweight (early in his career) and heavyweight singles divisions, achieving success in all divisions. Over the course of his career in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Hart accumulated sixteen championship accolades; he was a seven-time World Heavyweight Champion (five-time WWF Champion and two-time WCW Champion), four-time United States Heavyweight Champion, two-time Intercontinental Champion and three-time World Tag Team Champion (two-time WWF World Tag Team Champion with Jim Neidhart and one-time WCW World Tag Team Champion with Bill Goldberg).

"Hall of Fame Inductions Report", Pro Wrestling TorchEarly lifeBret Hart was born in Calgary, Alberta, the eighth child of wrestling patriarch Stu Hart. His introduction to professional wrestling came at an incredibly early age. As a child, he witnessed his father training with future wrestling stars like Billy Graham in the Dungeon, his household basement which served as possibly the most notorious training room in the world of wrestling. Before school, Hart's father, also a wrestling promoter, would have him hand out flyers to local wrestling shows. At Ernest Manning High School, Hart would gain experience in the amateur wrestling division. Despite being "skin and bones", as Hart refers to his teenage physique, he won significant championships. This would later offer credibility to his career in professional wrestling as being legit. However, rather than directly following his father's foot steps, Hart pursued a college degree. He enrolled in Mount Royal College with aspirations of becoming a director.Career in wrestlingStampede Wrestling (1976-1984)At the age of 19, Bret Hart began working for his father's Stampede Wrestling promotion in Calgary, with his father serving as his manager for a time. Hart first began helping the promotion by refereeing matches, but at one fateful event, a wrestler was unable to perform his match. This forced Stu to request his son stand in as a replacement, paving the way for Hart's very first match in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Before long, he became a regular contender, eventually partnering with brother Keith to win the Tag Team Championship four times. Earlier on, however, he was still unsure he wanted to make a career of professional wrestling and continually contemplated the idea.Hart would gain some of his most prominent experience with Japanese combatants Mr. Hito and Mr. Sakurada, later praising them as his most significant trainers. And before long, Hart was amazing crowds with his high-impact matches against the Dynamite Kid. In the midst of wrestling alongside his brothers and even his aging father, Hart made a point not to ride on the shoulders of his elder as other sons of promoters have. Hart faithfully jobbed as requested of him, taking pride in the believability of his performances. As he said himself, "no one could take a shit kicking like Bret Hart."Although he dreaded doing interviews and speaking in front of a crowd, Hart went on to win the promotion's top titles including two British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championships, five International Tag Team Championships, and six North American Heavyweight Championships. Hart also wrestled the famous Mitsuharu Misawa (as Tiger Mask II) in New Japan Pro Wrestling and remained one of Stampede's most successful performers until the promotion, along with several wrestlers, was acquired by the World Wrestling Federation in August 1984.World Wrestling Federation (1984-1997)WWF debut (1984)Bret Hart started out in the WWF with a cowboy gimmick but soon requested that it be dropped.

Their most notable feuds were with the British Bulldogs, The Fabulous Rougeaus, Strike Force, The Rockers, and Demolition.

Although Hart had signed a 20 year contract, Vince McMahon had asked him to talk to WCW about possibly taking a second look at their original offer to him, as the WWF was in a rough financial position at the time and could not afford the contract. Hart's final match with the WWF would come in Montreal at Survivor Series 1997. Hart did not want to end his career with a loss to Shawn Michaels in his home country; Vince agreed to Bret's idea of forfeiting the championship the next night on RAW or losing it a few weeks later.

Bret listened to Russo and explained that he was still going to try to get Owen out of his contract to come to WCW with him; a few minutes afterwards, Vince McMahon called Bret and told him he would sue him if he tried to get Owen out and continued to talk to Owen about his contract.
