   An Internet service provider (ISP, also called Internet access provider or IAP) is a company which primarily offers their customers access to the Internet using dial-up or other means of data telecommunication.ISPs may provide Internet e-mail accounts to users which allow them to communicate with one another by sending and receiving electronic messages through their ISPs' servers. ISPs may provide other services such as remotely storing data files on behalf of their customers, as well as other services unique to each particular ISP.End-User-to-ISP ConnectionISPs employ a range of technologies to enable consumers to connect to their network.For home users and small businesses, the most popular options include dial-up, DSL (typically Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, ADSL), broadband wireless, cable modem, fiber to the premises (FTTH), and Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) (typically basic rate interface).For customers with more demanding requirements, such as medium-to-large businesses, or other ISPs, DSL (often SHDSL or ADSL), Ethernet, Metro Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, Frame Relay, ISDN (BRI or PRI), ATM, satellite Internet access and synchronous optical networking (SONET) are more likely to be used.With the increasing popularity of downloading music and online video and the general demand for faster page loads, higher bandwidth connections are becoming more popular.Typical home user connectionDSLBroadband wireless accessCable modemFTTHISDNTypical business type connectionDSLSHDSLEthernet technologiesWhen using a dial-up or ISDN connection method, the ISP cannot determine the caller's physical location to more detail than using the number transmitted using an appropriate form of Caller ID; it is entirely possible to e.g. connect to an ISP located in Mexico from the U.S. Other means of connection such as cable or DSL require a fixed registered connection node, usually associated at the ISP with a physical address.ISP InterconnectionJust as their customers pay them for Internet access, ISPs themselves pay upstream ISPs for Internet access.In the simplest case, a single connection is established to an upstream ISP and is used to transmit data to or from areas of the Internet beyond the home network; this mode of interconnection is often cascaded multiple times until reaching a Tier 1 carrier. In reality, the situation is often more complex. ISPs with more than one point of presence (PoP) may have separate connections to an upstream ISP at multiple PoPs, or they may be customers of multiple upstream ISPs and may have connections to each one of them at one or more point of presence.Peering ISPs may engage in peering, where multiple ISPs interconnect at peering points or Internet exchange points (IXs), allowing routing of data between each network, without charging one another for the data transmitted - data that would otherwise have passed through a third upstream ISP, incurring charges from the upstream ISP.ISPs requiring no upstream and having only customers (end customers and/or peer ISPs) are called Tier 1 ISPs.Network hardware, software and specifications, as well as the expertise of network management personnel are important in ensuring that data follows the most efficient route, and upstream connections work reliably. A tradeoff between cost and efficiency is possible.Virtual ISPA Virtual ISP (vISP) is an operation which purchases services from another ISP (sometimes called a "wholesale ISP" in this contextGoogle search 'Wholesale ISP'Amazing.com &quot;Hooking up to the Internet&quot;) which allow the vISP's customers to access the Internet via one or more points of presence (PoPs) owned and operated by the wholesale ISP.There are various models for the delivery of this type of service. The vISP can provide network (internet) access to end users via access nodes owned by the wholesale ISP (e.g. dial-up modem PoPs or DSLAMs installed in telephone exchanges), routing network traffic itself to its destination.  In another model, the vISP does not route any end user traffic, and needs only to provide AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) functions, and may additionally provide "value-add" services like email or web hosting using its own facilities. The service provided by a wholesale ISP in a vISP model is distinct from that of an upstream ISP, in that a vISP in most cases only provides a means of connection for the customer with an actual backbone/upstream ISP handling the routing and transmission of data, while a wholesale ISP handles both in one case; they may however be one and the same company or strongly affiliated, with the vISP being the customer front-end, while the actual backbone provider is a subsidiary or affiliation.A vISP can also refer to a completely automated white label service offered to anyone at no cost or for a minimal set-up fee. The actual ISP providing the service generates revenue from customers using the service, and may also share a percentage of that revenue with the owner of the vISP. All technical aspects are dealt with by the ISP providing the infrastructure, thus leaving the owner of the vISP operation with the task of promoting the service. This sort of service is however declining due to the popularity of unmetered internet access also known as flatrate.Related servicesBroadband Internet accessFixed wireless accessCableTriple playInternet hosting serviceWeb hosting serviceE-mail hosting serviceDNS hosting serviceDynamic DNSSee alsoFree-netInternet backboneNetwork access pointWireless internet service providerReferences*ar:مزود خدمة الإنترنت az:Provayder bs:ISP bg:Интернет доставчик ca:ISP cs:Internet service provider da:Internetudbyder de:Internetdienstanbieter es:Proveedor de servicios de Internet eo:Provizanto de retkonekto eu:ISP fr:Fournisseur d'accès à Internet gl:ISP ko:인터넷 서비스 제공자 hi:अन्तर्जाल सेवा प्रदाता id:Penyelenggara Jasa Internet it:Internet Service Provider he:ספק שירותי אינטרנט kn:ಅಂತರ್ಜಾಲ ಸೇವಾ ಸಂಸ್ಥೆಗಳು kk:Интернет провайдері li:Internet provider ms:Pembekal khidmat Internet nl:Internetprovider ja:インターネットサービスプロバイダ no:Internettleverandør nn:Internettleverandør pl:Internet Service Provider pt:Provedor de acesso à Internet ro:ISP ru:Интернет-провайдер simple:Internet service provider sr:Добављачи интернет услуга у Србији fi:Internet-palveluntarjoaja sv:Internetleverantör tr:Internet servis sağlayıcısı uk:Провайдер zh:互联网服务提供者
