The Anguidae is a large and diverse family of lizards native to the northern hemisphere. The group includes the slowworms, glass lizards, and alligator lizards, among others. They have hard osteoderms beneath their scales, and many of the species have reduced or absent limbs, giving them a rather snake like appearance, although others are fully limbed.Anguids are carnivorous or insectivorous, and inhabit a wide range of different habitats. The group includes both egg-laying and viviparous species. Most species are terrestrial, although some climb trees.ClassificationFamily ANGUIDAESubfamily AnguinaeGenus Anguis - Slow worms (2 species)Genus Ophisaurus - Glass lizards (13 species)Genus Pseudopus - Scheltopusik (1 species)Subfamily DiploglossinaeGenus Celestus - Galliwasps (28 species)Genus Diploglossus - (18 species)Genus Ophiodes - Worm lizards (4 species)Subfamily Gerrhonotinae - Alligator lizardsGenus Abronia - Arboreal alligator lizards (27 species)Genus Barisia - (4 species)Genus Coloptychon - Isthmian alligator lizard (1 species)Genus Elgaria - (6 species)Genus Gerrhonotus - (4 species)Genus Mesaspis - (6 species)ReferencesCategory:Lizards Category:Anguidsbg:Слепоци (семейство) cs:Slepýšovití de:Schleichen es:Anguidae fr:Anguidae hr:Puzaši ka:ბოხმეჭასებრნი lt:Gluodenai hu:Lábatlangyíkfélék nl:Hazelwormen no:Stålormer pl:Padalcowate pt:Anguidae ro:Anguidae ru:Веретеницевые simple:Anguidae sr:Anguidae fi:Vaskitsat sv:Kopparödlor
