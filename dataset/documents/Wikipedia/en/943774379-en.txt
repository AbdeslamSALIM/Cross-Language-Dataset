 Santa Clara County is a county located in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. state of California. It is the primary site of Silicon Valley. As of 2000 it had a population of 1,682,585. The county seat is San Jose.History Santa Clara County was one of the original counties of California, formed in 1850 at the time of statehood. The original inhabitants included the Ohlone, residing on Coyote Creek and Calaveras Creek. Part of the county's territory was given to Alameda County in 1853.The county is named after Mission Santa Clara, which was established in 1777, and named for Saint Clare of Assisi, Italy.In 1882, Santa Clara County tried to levy taxes upon property of the Southern Pacific Railroad within county boundaries. The result was the U.S. Supreme Court case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, 118 U.S. 394 (1886), in which the Court extended Due Process rights to artificial legal entities.After two centuries of an agricultural economy started by the Spanish missionaries, the focus has shifted to technology. This trend is not new. Hewlett Packard HP was founded in 1939, and Fairchild Semiconductor along with other early innovators were located in the county by the late 1950s. The term "Silicon Valley" was itself coined in 1971. The trend accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, and agriculture has been nearly eliminated from the northern part of the county. Today, Santa Clara County is the headquarters for such companies as Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard, Google, Yahoo, eBay, Intel and many others. The county is the main area of the Silicon Valley, which includes several other counties both north and south of Santa Clara.GeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,304&nbsp;square miles (3,377&nbsp;km²), of which, 1,291&nbsp;square miles (3,343&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 13&nbsp;square miles (34&nbsp;km²) of it (1.02%) is water.The San Andreas Fault runs along the Santa Cruz Mountains in the south of the county.Adjacent CountiesSan Benito County, California - southSanta Cruz County, California - south, southwestSan Mateo County, California - northwestAlameda County, California - northStanislaus County, California - eastMerced County, California - southeastNational [[protected area]]Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (part)DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 1,682,585 people, 565,863 households, and 395,538 families residing in the county.

Expressways in California are distinct from freeways; although access to adjoining properties is eliminated, at-grade intersections are allowed. However, unlike expressways virtually everywhere else in California, the Santa Clara County expressways were built, signed, and maintained as county roads; they are not maintained by Caltrans, although they are patrolled by the California Highway Patrol.Many journalists and mapmakers from outside California do not understand the important difference between freeways and expressways, and incorrectly describe or depict Silicon Valley as criss-crossed by a "web" of freeways when many of the lines on the map are really expressways.There is also a large street network dominated by four- and six-lane arterials. Some of the newer boulevards (primarily in the West Valley) are divided with landscaped medians.Major highwaysInterstate 280Interstate 680Interstate 880U.S. Route 101State Route 9State Route 17State Route 82State Route 85State Route 87State Route 130State Route 152State Route 237Mass transitSanta Clara County has consolidated its transportation services into the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority, which operates a rapidly expanding light rail system and a large system of bus routes.
