website = [http://www.mersin.gov.tr/ Mersin]Mersin is a large city and a busy port on the Mediterranean coast of southern Turkey and is the capital of the Mersin Province.HistoryThis coast has been inhabited since the 9th millennium BC. Excavations by John Garstang of the hill of Yümüktepe have revealed 23 levels of occupation, the earliest dating from ca. 6300 BC. A fortification was put up around 4500 BC, but the site appears to have been abandoned between 3200 BC and 1200 BC.In the following centuries the city became a part of many states and civilizations including the Hittites, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks, the Macedonians of Alexander the Great, Seleucids, Lagids. During the Ancient Greek period, the city bore the name Zephyrion (Greek: Ζεφύριονhttp://www.jannis.tu-berlin.de/City_&amp;_Ruler_Names.html retrieved June 14, 2007) and was mentioned by numerous ancient authors. Apart from its natural harbor and its strategic position along the trade routes of southern Anatolia, the city profited from trade in molybdenum (white lead) from the neighbouring mines of Coreyra. Ancient sources attributed the best molybdenum to the city, which also minted its own coins.Later, the area became a part of the Roman province of Cilicia, which had its capital at Tarsus, while nearby Mersin was the major port. The city, whose name was Latinized to Zephyrium, was renamed as Hadrianopolis in honor of the Roman emperor Hadrian.In 395 the Roman Empire was split in two and this area fell into the half ruled by Byzantium (later Constantinople), which became the centre of trade in this part of the world, drawing investments and trade, and causing Mersin to lose its attractiveness.The city was Christianized early; and was the see of a bishop. Le Quien (Oriens christianus, II, 883) names four bishops of Zephyrium: Aerius, present at the Council of Constantinople in 381; Zenobius, a Nestorian, at the Second Council of Constantinople in 432-434; Hypatius, present at the Council of Chalcedon in 451; and Peter, at the Council in Trullo in 692. The city remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, Zephyriensis; the see has been vacant since 1966. http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2z15.htmlThen came the Arabs, Egyptian Tulunids, Seljuk Turks, Mongols, Crusaders, Armenians, Mamluks, Anatolian beyliks, and finally the city was conquered by the Ottomans in 1473.During the American Civil War, the region became a major supplier of cotton to make up for the high demand due to shortage. Railroads were extended to Mersin in 1866 from where cotton was exported by sea, and the city developed into a major trade center. By 1900, the Catholic Encyclopedia reports the city having about 18,000 inhabitants, of whom 8,000 were by ethnicity Greeks, 1,000 Armenians, and 2,000 Roman Catholics; the remaining approximately 9,000 inhabitants were presumably Muslim. The Roman Catholic parish of Mersin was administered by Capuchins; there were also Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition; schools for boys and girls, and hospitals.In 1918 Mersin was occupied by French and British troops in accord with the Treaty of Sevrès. It was liberated by the Turkish army in 1920. In 1924, Mersin was made a province, and in 1933, Mersin and İçel provinces were joined to form the (greater Mersin) İçel province.Up until the 1970s Mersin had a population of 580,000 and a classy feel to it, with carriages parading under palm trees. The seafront was all orchards of oranges and lemons, perfect for a quiet stroll, and you could play on the beach. The heart of this tree-lined bourgois establishment were the patisseries along Flamingo road, a name that evokes nostalgia among those who lived here through the 60s and 70s.Mersin todayToday, Mersin is a large city spreading out along the coast, with Turkey's second tallest skyscraper (the 52-floor Mertim Tower, which was the tallest skyscraper in Turkey for 13 years between 1987 and 2000, until the completion of the İş Bankası Towers in Istanbul), huge hotels, an opera house, expensive real estate near the sea or up in the hills, and many other modern urban amenities, although still nothing like the long-established nightlife and culture of Istanbul or Izmir.The municipality is now trying to rescue the sea front with walkways, parks and statues, and there are still palm trees on the roadsides especially where the young generation like to hang out in the cafés and patisseries of smart neighbourhoods such as Pozcu or Çamlıbel. These are established neighbourhoods where there are many well-known shops and restaurants with years of experience and reputations to protect. The city centre is a maze of narrow streets and arcades of little shops and cafes, with young people buzzing around on scooters. The old quarter near the fish market is where you will find the stalls selling tantuni and grilled liver sandwiches.One of the most distinctive features of the city as a whole is the solar heating panels, they are everywhere, on top of every building.Turkey now plans to construct its first nuclear power plant in the port city of Mersin. In March 2008, Turkey opened bidding for the construction of the plant. Environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, oppose this plan.CuisineThe local cuisine includes: kebab of course but especially the hot sandwich of grilled meats wrapped in flat bread called tantuni; the home-made sausage bumbar; carrot helva (cezerye); karsambaç (a kind of ice slush); künefe a baked cheese pastry (known throughout south-east Turkey including Mersin); and kerebiç, a semolina pudding, especially made in the month of Ramadan, and many other local soups and stews. The traditional drink of this corner of Turkey, including Mersin, is şalgam suyu (the water used to pickle turnips in).EconomyThe port is the mainstay of Mersin's economy. There are 45 piers, a total port area of 785 km² (205 acres), with a capacity of 6,000 ships per year.Adjacent to the port is Mersin Free Zone established in 1986, the first free zone in Turkey, with warehouses, shops, assembly-disassembly, maintenance and engineering workshops, banking and insurance, packing-repacking, labelling and exhibition facilities. The zone is a publicly owned center for foreign investors, close to major markets in the (Middle East, North Africa, East and West Europe, Russian Federation and Central Asia. The trading volume of the free zone was USD 51,8 billion in 2002.Mersin has highway connections to the north and east, and is also connected to the southern railroad. Adana airport is 69 km (43 miles).70% of the male population and 46% of the female population is employed. Unemployment is about 6.7%Mersin port is an international hub for many vessels routing to European countries.Its now operated by PSA.Mersin UniversityMersin University was founded in 1992 and started teaching in 1993-1994, with 11 faculties, 6 schools and 9 vocational schools. The university has had about 10 thousand graduates, has broadened its current academic staff to more than 2100 academicians, and enrolls 38,000 students.CultureBecause the city has been a crossroads for centuries the local culture is a medley of civilizations. Mersin has a State Opera and Ballet, the fourth in Turkey after Istanbul, İzmir and Ankara. Mersin International Music Festival was established in 2001, and takes place every October. The photography association Mersin Fotograf Derneği (MFD), is one of the most popular and active cultural organizations in the city. There is a great museum in the city centre. The municipal cemetery is interesting as people of all faiths and denominations can be buried here.In order to swim in clean water you need to get out of town, perhaps an hour along the coast. The beach at (109km beaches) Kızkalesi, Ayaş,Soloi,Susanoğlu is popular with families while young people prefer Akyar,Yapraklı koy,Narlıkuyu or quieter bays along the coast, some of which are very attractive indeed.Images Image:Mersinnn.JPG|Atatürk's House and Peace Statues Image:Mersin_Peace_Sculpture.jpg|Peace Sculpture Image:Mersin_Church.JPG| One of the two churches in Mersin Image:Mersin Night.JPG| Mersin at night Image:Mersin Wiki 1.jpg| Bird's-eye view of Mersin Image:Mersin Wiki 2.jpg| Bird's-eye view of Mersin 2 Image:Mersin Wiki 12.jpg| Bird's-eye view of Mersin 3 Image:Mersin Wiki 11.jpg| One of the marinas in Mersin Image:Mersin Wiki 3.jpg| "Running Horses" Sculpture Image:Mersin Wiki 4.jpg| Decorative Arch Image:Mersin Wiki 5.jpg| One of the fountains in Mersin Image:Mersin Wiki 6.jpg| Decorative Lake Set Image:Mersin Wiki 7.jpg| The Entrance of the Culture Park, Mersin Image:Mersin Wiki 8.jpg| Mersin Cumhuriyet Meydanı (Republic Square) Image:Mersin Wiki 9.jpg| Mini Open Theatre Image:Mersin Wiki 10.jpg| Fountains Sister CitiesKushimoto, JapanLatakia, SyriaNotable nativesAhmet Kireççi (aka Ahmet Mersinli) - Olympic medalist wrestlerKaracaoğlan - 16th century folk poetSee alsoUniversity of MersinStudent Site of Mersin UniversityMersinWebsite of MersinPeople Of MersinCilicia WarChronology of the Turkish War of IndependenceReferencesBlue Guide, Turkey, The Aegean and Mediterranean Coasts (ISBN 0-393-30489-2), pp. 556-557.Blood-Dark Track: A Family History (Granta Books) by Joseph O'Neill, contains a detailed and evocative history of the city, viewed from the perspective of a Christian Syrian family long resident in Mersin.Richard Talbert, Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, (ISBN 0-691-03169-X), p. 66External links Ministry of Tourism and Culture - Mersin PagePrinceton Encyclopedia of Classical SitesCatholic Encyclopedia &quot;Zephyrium&quot;Mersin Chamber of Commerce and IndustryCategory:Ancient mints Category:Cilicia Category:Port settlements in Turkey Category:Coastal settlements Category:Ancient Greek sites in Turkey Category:Ancient Greek cities Category:Roman sites in Turkey Category:Titular sees Category:Seaside resorts in Turkeyar:مرسين bg:Мерсин cs:Mersin de:Mersin el:Μερσίνη es:Mersin eo:Mersin fr:Mersin it:Mersin he:מרסין lt:Mersinas nl:Mersin (stad) pl:Mersin ro:Mersin ru:Мерсин fi:Mersin sv:Mersin tr:Mersin (şehir)
