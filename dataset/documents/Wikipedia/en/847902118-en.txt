[[Image:Eurovelomap.png|frame|right|Map of EuroVelo bicycle routes Pdf]]EuroVelo, the European cycle route network, is a project of the European Cyclists' Federation to develop 12 long-distance cycle routes crossing Europe. The total length is 60,000 km, of which more than 20,000 km are in place.The EuroVelo routes are similar, in length and conception, to Greenway projects such as the East Coast Greenway in the United States and the Trans-Canada Trail.EuroVelo routes are intended for bicycle touring across the continent, though they are also used locally. The routes are made of both existing bike paths and roads together with proposed and planned cycle routes to connect them. All the routes are unfinished.EuroVelo hopes to get European Union support.For a route to be part of EuroVelo it must:have no gradient above 6%be wide enough for two cyclistshave an average of no more than 1,000 motorised vehicles a daybe sealed for 80% of its lengthbe open 365 days a year, have provision points every 30km, accommodation every 50km, and public transport every 150km.Orbea — EuroVelo: Cycling Around EuropeEuroVelo routes===North-South===EV 1 - Atlantic Coast Route: North Cape - Sagres 8,186 kmEV 3 - Pilgrims Route: Trondheim - Santiago de Compostela 5,122 kmEV 5 - Via Romea Francigena: London - Rome and Brindisi 3,900 kmEV 7 - Middle Europe Route: North Cape - Malta 6,000 kmEV 9 - Baltic Sea to Adriatic Sea (Amber Route): Gdańsk - Pula 1,930 kmEV 11 - East Europe Route: North Cape - Athens 5,964 kmWest-EastEV 2 - Capitals Route: Galway - Moscow 5,500 kmEV 4 - Roscoff - Kyiv 4,000 kmEV 6 - Atlantic Ocean to Black Sea (Rivers Route): Nantes - Constanţa 3,653 km - http://www.eurovelo6.orgEV 8 - Mediterranean Route: Cádiz - Athens 5,388 kmCircuitsEV 10 - Baltic Sea Cycle Route (Hansa circuit): 7,930 kmEV 12 - North Sea Cycle Route: 5,932 kmTotal network: 63,505 kmEuroVelo's aims and administrationThe aim of EuroVelo is to encourage people to try cycling instead of driving. Although some will cycle across the continent, most journeys will be local.Development is by national, regional and local governments and NGOs in all European countries. The international status helps in funds and political support for construction. Only routes approved by the EuroVelo route coordinator can call themselves EuroVelo.Main points on the EuroVelo routes+EuroVelo routes (connections to other EV routes are in parentheses)Route numberRoute namepasses through these Citiesthrough these CountriesLength (km)EV1Atlantic Coast RouteBergen]]&nbsp;(EV12) - Aberdeen&nbsp;(EV12) - Inverness&nbsp; (EV12 ) - Glasgow - Stranraer - Belfast - Galway&nbsp;(EV2) - Cork - Rosslare - Fishguard - Bristol&nbsp;(EV2) - Plymouth - Roscoff&nbsp;(EV4) - Nantes&nbsp;(EV6) - La Rochelle - Burgos&nbsp;(EV3) - Salamanca - SagresNorway, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal8186EV2Capitals RouteGalway&nbsp;(EV1) - Dublin - Holyhead - Bristol&nbsp;(EV1) - London&nbsp;(EV5) - Harwich - Rotterdam - The Hague - Münster&nbsp;(EV3) - Berlin&nbsp;(EV7) - Poznań&nbsp;(EV9) - Warsaw&nbsp;(EV11) - Minsk - MoscowIreland, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia5500EV3Pilgrim's RouteLeón]] - Burgos&nbsp;(EV1) - Bordeaux - Tours&nbsp;(EV6) - Orleans&nbsp;(EV6) - Paris - Namur&nbsp;(EV5) - Aachen&nbsp;(EV4) - Münster&nbsp;(EV2) - Hamburg&nbsp;(EV12) - Odense&nbsp;(EV10) - Viburg - Frederikshavn&nbsp;(EV12) - Gothenburg&nbsp;(EV12) - Oslo - Røros - Trondheim&nbsp;(EV1)Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway5122EV4Roscoff-KyivRoscoff&nbsp;(EV1) - the French Atlantic coast - Le Havre - Calais&nbsp;(EV5) - Middelburg - Aachen&nbsp;(EV3) - Bonn - Frankfurt - Prague&nbsp;(EV7) - Brno&nbsp;(EV9) - Kraków&nbsp;(EV11) - L'viv - KyivFrance, Belgium, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine4000EV5Via Romea FrancigenaLuxembourg]] - Strasbourg - Basel&nbsp;(EV6) - Lucerne - Milan - Piacenza&nbsp;(EV8) - Parma - Florence&nbsp;(EV7) - Siena - Rome&nbsp;(EV7) - BrindisiUnited Kingdom, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Italy3900EV6Atlantic Ocean to Black Sea (Rivers Route)Nantes&nbsp;(EV1) - Tours&nbsp;(EV3) - Orleans&nbsp;(EV3) - Nevers - Chalon-sur-Saône - Basel&nbsp;(EV5) - Passau - Ybbs&nbsp;(EV7) - Linz - Vienna&nbsp;(EV9) - Bratislava - Budapest - Belgrade&nbsp;(EV11) - Bucharest - ConstanţaFrance, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Romania3653EV7Middle Europe RouteSyracuse]] - MaltaNorway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, Malta6000EV8Mediterranean RouteValencia]] - Barcelona - Monaco - Piacenza&nbsp;(EV5) - Mantua&nbsp;(EV7) - Ferrara - Venice - Trieste&nbsp;(EV9) - Rijeka - Split - Dubrovnik - Tirana - Patras - Athens&nbsp;(EV11)Spain, France, Monaco, Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Montenegro, Albania, Greece5388EV9Baltic Sea to Adriatic Sea (Amber Route)Gdańsk&nbsp;(EV10) - Poznań&nbsp;(EV2) - Olomouc - Brno&nbsp;(EV4) - Reinthal - Vienna&nbsp;(EV6) - Maribor - Ljubljana - Trieste&nbsp;(EV8) - PulaPoland, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia, Italy, Croatia1930EV10Baltic Sea Cycle Route (Hansa circuit)Gdańsk]]&nbsp;(EV9) - Kaliningrad - Klaipėda - Riga - Tallinn&nbsp;(EV11) - St PetersburgRussia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia7930EV11East European RouteNorth Cape&nbsp; (EV1, EV7) - the Finnish Lakes - Helsinki&nbsp;(EV10) - Tallinn&nbsp;(EV10) - Tartu - Vilnius - Warsaw&nbsp;(EV2) - Kraków&nbsp;(EV4) - Košice - Belgrade&nbsp;(EV6) - Skopje - Thessaloniki - Athens&nbsp;(EV8)Macedonia]], Greece5964EV12North Sea Cycle RouteNewcastle]] - Edinburgh - Aberdeen&nbsp;(EV1) - Inverness&nbsp;(EV1) - Thurso - the Orkneys - the Shetlands - Bergen&nbsp;(EV1)Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom5932Route commentaries, information and linksEuroVelo 1EuroVelo 2Between The Hague and the German-Polish border EV2 follows Euro-Route R1, an international cycle path connecting Boulogne-sur-Mer with St Petersburg.Euro-Route R1EuroVelo 3EuroVelo 3 is The Pilgrim's Route. It goes from Trondheim in Norway to Santiago de Compostela in Spain. The route follows traces of old roads used for pilgrimages in the Middle Ages. The route passes through Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Belgium, France and Spain. Most of these countries have a developed net of bicycle routes used as part of EV3.The Frie FugleEuroVelo 4===EuroVelo 5=== This route is also a pilgrim route although not used as much as the Santiago route. It is called the Via Francigena and was first recorded by Archbishop Sigeric in the 10th century AD. It has recently been awarded EU funds to reinstate hostelry organisation and for route improvement. There is a supporters' group in several countries and route maps, and Santiago-style passports for stamping at abbeys and cathedrals. The route goes from London to Brindisi through Rome and via the St Bernard's pass in Switzerland.EuroVelo 6EuroVelo 6 is the Rivers Route. It runs from Nantes on the mouth of the Loire, along the river eastward through France. It continues on to Lake Constance in Switzerland and then down the Danube through Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania to the UNESCO Heritage site of the Danube Delta, and ends in Constanţa, on the Black Sea. EV6 includes the Donauradweg, the bicycle path along the Danube; this stretches from Passau in Germany through Austria to Vienna and continues on to Bratislava in Slovakia.EuroVelo 6, in Deutsch and French and EnglishEuroVelo 7Here is a pdf of the current state of Eurovelo 7 http://www.friefugle.dk/Eurovelo_rute_7.pdfEuroVelo 8EuroVelo 9EuroVelo 9, the Amber Route, runs from Gdańsk on the Baltic Sea in Poland through the Czech Republic to Austria and on to Slovenia and finishes at Pula on the Adriatic Sea in Croatia.
