  Aberdeenshire () is one of the 32 unitary council areas in Scotland.In this present day Aberdeenshire does not include Aberdeen City which is a Council Area in its own right. However, Aberdeenshire Council does have its headquarters at Woodhill House, in Aberdeen; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outwith its area's border. Aberdeenshire borders Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south, and Highland and Moray to the west.HistoryAberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage. It is the locus of a large number of Neolithic and Bronze Age archaeological sites, including Longman Hill, Kempstone Hill, Catto Long Barrow and Cairn Lee. Since medieval times there have been a number of crossings of the Mounth (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the North Sea slightly north of Stonehaven) through present day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the Highlands. Some of the most well known and historically important trackways are the Causey Mounth and Elsick Mounth.W. Douglas Simpson, "The Early Castles of Mar", Proceedings of the Society, 102, 10 December 1928[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 C.Michael Hogan, Elsick Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]The present council area is named after the historic county of Aberdeen which had different boundaries and was abolished in 1975, under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 to be replaced by Grampian Regional Council, and five district councils; Banff and Buchan, Gordon, Kincardine and Deeside, Moray and the City of Aberdeen, with local government functions shared between the two levels. In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the Banff and Buchan district, the Gordon district and the Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area, with the other two districts becoming autonomous council areas.DemographicsThe council area has a population of 226,871, representing 4.5% of Scotland's total, and a 20% increase since 1981, 50% since 1971.
