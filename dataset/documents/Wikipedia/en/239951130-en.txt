While at the core Linux Mint is mostly based on Ubuntu, the design of the desktop and User interface are considerably different. These differences include a distinct desktop theme, a custom Linux Mint menu and the Mint Tools, a collection of system tools designed to make system management and administration easier for end users. Linux Mint is available for download in the form of ISO images, which can be used to create Live CDs or Live USBs. The latter can be created either manually or using UNetbootin UNetbootin.BranchesLike many other Linux distributions, Linux Mint is available in different test versions or "branches". The branch with the newest features, or "unstable branch" of Linux Mint, is called "Romeo". It is not activated by default in Linux Mint releases. Users who wish to get cutting-edge features and help the distribution test new packages can add Romeo to their Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) sources.New packages are first released in "Romeo", where they are tested by developers and community members who use it. After a package is found to be stable enough, it is backported to the latest stable release.EditionsMain Edition: The Main Edition of Linux Mint provides a GNOME desktop with multimedia codecs which fit on a single CD.Light Edition: Some of the codecs in the Main Edition are not freely redistributable in some parts of the world. For this reason, users who live in countries where the legislation doesn't allow them to use or distribute the Main Edition have access to a Light Edition of Linux Mint. The Light Edition is a copy of the Main Edition without any patented or proprietary component.KDE Community Edition: Linux Mint also provides a KDE Edition (mostly for individual users). The Gnome desktop is replaced with KDE. The default selection of applications is different and this edition usually comes with more software. The KDE edition doesn't necessarily fit on a CD and can be available as a DVD download.XFCE Community Edition: An attempt to create a version easier on system requirements. The GNOME desktop is replaced with Xfce as the default desktop environment.Mini Community Edition: Linux Mint using GNOME and Openbox to provide a lightweight, fast, and small mint environment..Fluxbox Community Edition: An extremely light and fast alternative to GNOME using Fluxbox as the window manager. It can be used on a Live USB as a bootable environment.RepositoriesLinux Mint has its own repositories for Mint specific or Mint customized tools but also uses Ubuntu's repositories for other software.== Releases ==Originally, Linux Mint didn't follow a predictable release cycle. The project first defined the goals for the next release, and when all the goals are achieved a beta is released and a date is announced for the stable release. Recently however, it has been decided that Linux Mint will correlate with the 6 month Ubuntu release cycle.ColorMeaningRedOld release; not supportedYellowOld release; still supportedGreenCurrent releasePurpleTest releaseBlueFuture release[[Fluxbox]]VersionCodenameEditionCode BaseAPT BaseRelease Date4.0Daryna BETA 028Fluxbox CEDaryna 4.0Gutsy3 Jan2008[[GNOME]]VersionCodenameEditionCode BaseAPT BaseRelease Date2.0BarbaraMainUbuntu EdgyEdgy13 Nov20062.1BeaMainUbuntu EdgyEdgy20 Dec20062.2BiancaMainUbuntu EdgyEdgy20 Feb20072.2BiancaLightUbuntu EdgyEdgy29 Mar20073.0CassandraMainBianca 2.2Feisty30 May20073.0CassandraLightBianca 2.2Feisty15 Jun20073.1CelenaMainBianca 2.2Feisty24 Sep20073.1CelenaLightBianca 2.2Feisty01 Oct20074.0DarynaMainCelena 3.1Gutsy15 Oct20074.0DarynaLightCelena 3.1Gutsy15 Oct2007TestDebian ALPHA 023DebianDebianTesting3 Jan20085ElyssaMainDaryna 4.0Hardy8 June20085ElyssaLightDaryna 4.0Hardy8 June20086FeliciaMainElyssa 5.0IntrepidTBA 20086FeliciaLightElyssa 5.0IntrepidTBA 2008[[KDE]]VersionCodenameEditionCode BaseAPT BaseRelease Date1.0AdaMainKubuntu DapperDapper27 Aug20062.2BiancaKDE CEKubuntu EdgyEdgy20 Apr20073.0CassandraKDE CEBianca 2.2Feisty14 Aug20073.0CassandraMiniKDE CEBianca 2.2Feisty14 Aug20074.0DarynaKDE CECassandra 3.0Gutsy03 Mar20085ElyssaKDE CEDaryna 4.0Hardy15 Sep2008[[XFCE]]VersionCodenameEditionCode BaseAPT BaseRelease Date3.0CassandraXfce CECassandra 3.0Feisty07 Aug20074.0Daryna BETA 008Xfce CECassandra 3.0Gutsy2 Nov20075ElyssaXFCE CEDaryna 4.0Hardy8 Sep2008As of "Elyssa," the minor version number has been dropped (i.e. "Linux Mint 5.0" is now "Linux Mint 5"). This is due to a decision to follow Ubuntu's 6 month release cycle; there should no longer be more than one release per Ubuntu base.Minor version number droppedThe Debian base release is released as an alpha because "it is not intended to be used as your main operating system but to give you a technological preview of how Linux Mint would behave if it was based on Debian."Linux Mint Debian edition - release notes Also note that the ISO acts as a "non-installable" live CD.MintToolsLinux Mint comes with its own set of tools aimed at making the experience easier for the user.MintInstall: A program to download software from Internet catalogs that distributes mint-files. A mint-file does not contain the software, but it contains all the information and sources to download that software. mintInstall allows users to add software through the use of .mint files.MintUpdate: Update-software designed specifically for Linux Mint. MintUpdate assigns updates a safety-level (from 1 to 5), based on the stability and necessity of the update. Updates can be set to notify users (as is normal), be listed but not notify, or be hidden by default. In addition to including updates specifically for the Mint distribution, the development team tests all package-wide updates. This system is designed to prevent inexperienced users from installing updates that are unnecessary or require a certain level of knowledge to configure properly. MintUpdate is currently in beta 1.5 and will be included in the next Mint release. If mintInstall is used to install a program from the default repositories, that program is able to receive updates via mintUpdate.Blueprint: “Integration with mintInstall”&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;MintDesktop: A desktop configuration tool for easy configuration of the Gnome desktop. Also acts as a background process to do various tasks upon login. Also network browsing is made easier (through fusesmb). MintDesktop has received a major overhaul in Mint 4.0.mintDesktop in Launchpad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;MintConfig: (Obsolete from Daryna.) A customizable control center. It gathers all the tools from "Preferences" and "Administration" and organizes them into categories. The purpose of mintConfig was to give users a control center since Gnome didn’t have one. In Daryna only the Gnome Control Center is present.MintAssistant: A customization wizard that appears during first log-in for users, asking a few questions to customize Mint based on the user's level of knowledge and comfort with various Linux components. It currently asks if the user wants to enable or disable fortune-cookies in the terminal, and if the root account should be enabled or disabled.MintUpload: An FTP client that uploads files to a server by right-clicking on the icons and selecting upload. The user will then be given a link he or she can give to other people for quick and easy sharing.MintSpace: The larger sibling of MintUpload. Provides an additional 1GB of storage space and files stay on the server for 7 days (rather than 2 days). MintMenu: A python-coded menu that allows for fully customizable text, icons, and colors. It shares the same hotlinks to software as the Gnome main menu.MintWifi: drivers for quite a few wlan gadgets and mintWifi.py . Located in /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintWifiSoftware from the Mint repositories can be installed in Debian and Ubuntu as well through APT.Comparison with UbuntuLinux Mint is based on Ubuntu and the two distributions have much in common. Both distributions use the same software repositories. For instance, release 2.2 (“Bianca”) uses the package pools of Ubuntu “Edgy Eft” (6.10). Most packages are the same on both distributions and the two systems behave almost identically.Most differences are on the desktop. Ubuntu and Linux Mint both focus on usability, but Linux Mint offers a different user experience, and it includes a number of applications that are not available in Ubuntu (see aforementioned Mint Tools).Many popular multimedia codecs are installed by default in Linux Mint. Ubuntu, and many other free GNU/Linux distributions, do not distribute these codecs with the initial install media due to patent encumberment issues.Ubuntu has a vastly larger support community than Linux Mint. However, the majority of Ubuntu help and advice is also applicable to Linux Mint. Ubuntu supports more languages from the Live CD, and comes with better localization. Lastly, whilst Linux Mint currently only supports x86 architectures, Ubuntu also supports x86-64; although an x86-64 version of Linux Mint is currently in testing.PopularityLinux Mint consistently ranks highly on DistroWatch, which tracks the popularity of various Linux and BSD distributions based on the number of daily page hits which each distribution generates. As of October 2008, Linux Mint was ranked 2nd.http://distrowatch.com/stats.php?section=popularity&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesExternal linksOfficial Linux Mint Web SiteOfficial Linux Mint WikiOfficial Linux Mint BlogOfficial Linux Mint ForumLinux Mint on Distrowatch Category:Debian-based distributions Category:Linux distributions Category:Ubuntu (operating system) derivativesar:لينكس مينت be:Mint ca:Linux Mint cs:Linux Mint da:Linux Mint de:Linux Mint es:Linux Mint fr:Linux Mint id:Linux Mint it:Linux Mint lt:Linux Mint hu:Linux Mint nl:Linux Mint ja:Linux Mint pl:Linux Mint pt:Linux Mint ro:Linux Mint ru:Mint simple:Linux Mint sk:Linux Mint sv:Linux Mint tr:Linux Mint uk:Mint
