 The Red-footed tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria) (known in Brazil as Jabuti) is a tortoise native to South America and popular as a pet. It draws its name from the red or orange scales visible on its limbs, as well as its head and tail. This species is protected under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The redfoot has a larger cousin, the yellow foot tortoise (Geochelone denticulata).DescriptionRed-foot tortoises have red scales on the limbs. The Red-footed tortoise will normally reach between 10 and 16 inches in carapace length, with males generally being slightly larger than females. Color on the head can range from yellow to orange. There is a smaller phenotype commonly called the 'Cherry head' which, true to the name, has bright red markings on the head. This phenotype, that doesn't not bear subspecies classification at this time, ranges in size as an adult from 10-12 ".Habitat and RangeBeing primarily a forest dweller, they have evolved a high domed narrow width carapace to facilitate getting between narrow openings of trees and vegetation in the rain forest. Red-footed tortoises are found in South America and southern central America from northern Argentina to southern Panama, they are also found on some islands of the Caribbean. They live in a variety of habitats including grasslands but they are thought to prefer humid forested areas.Conservation StatusA red-footed tortoise can live for around 50 years. Red footed tortoises face many perils in the wild. In addition to the slash and burning of rainforests, they are eaten wherever they are found." Interestingly enough, tortoises are considered "fish" by the Catholic church and during holy week, red-foots are consumed in huge numbers. Red-foots are collected in large numbers and shipped to many different South American cities to be sold as a delicacy. The fact that red-foots can tolerate long periods of time without food and water, an otherwise evolutionary advantage, makes this species both easy and profitable to transport." - Petra Spiess - 1997.ReproductionSome tortoises such as the Sulcata tortoise (Geochelone sulcata) are notoriously hard to sex. Fortunately sexing is easy with the redfoot. Males have a concave plastron and a much longer, pointed tail with the vent (cloaca) extending from the rear of the shell. Females have a flat plastron and a quite stubby tail with the vent (cloaca) within the edge of the shell. Males approach a desired female with a sideways swinging and jerking of the head. Pritchard (1979) reported the male also makes a clucking sound at that time. Separation of pairs or F/M from larger groups and reintroduction later, seems to facilitate sexual interest in the male Geochelone carbonaria (Schnirel, 2007). It would not be natural to have the two sexes in close proximity in the wild. The reintroduction of a female to a male (it would be better suited to keep the male in familiar surroundings with the female reintroduced), would be more natural to what would occur in the wild when a chance encounter with the opposite sex occurred. The aspect of 'something new' seems to better trigger a sexual response in the male. Pritchard is correct with the sideways swing. It is bilateral in motion.CareOnce acclamated, and given the right environment, Red foots are one of the better tortoise species to maintain in captivity. An area of warmth and high humidity such as South Florida would be an excellent climate for red foots and they can thrive outdoors for most of the year. Living in a dry climate, such as Arizona, One would be better off keeping a Sulcata tortoise (Geochelone sulcata - underlined) or a leopard tortoise (Geochelone Paradalis ssp - underlined). Colder, Northern Climates have their challenges as well. As with any animal, one should put a great deal of research and deliberation in before obtaining a red-foot as a pet. One should be sure that there is a doctor of veterinary medicine with experience with exotic animals including tortoises (preferably red-foots) in the area before obtaining one. In addition, many states prohibit exotic species and one needs to be aware of local laws before getting a red-foot of their own.Red-footed tortoises need a daytime temperature of between 80° and 90°F. Their nighttime temperature should not drop below 70°F. They need a humidity of between 50 and 60 percent. They should have areas in their enclosures that are more humid and areas that allow them to dry out so that they can self regulate according to their humidity needs. Cypress Bark may be a good substrate as long as it can be kept clean and allows the tortoise to dry out. These tortoises have been kept in screened or jalousie windowed porches with astrotuff covered floors. a very large enclosure is necessary or a frequent taking out to roam must be conducted. If red-foots are kept too moist they can develop dermititis and fungal infections. Newspaper may be a better substrate if these requirements cannot be met. They should also have a shallow water dish that allows them to soak because it is very easy for them to become dehydrated and they can absorb water transdermally. Like many other reptiles they need some sort of a hiding place in their enclosures in order to feel safe. Red-foots also need broad spectrum UV light in order to maintain proper bone density. A broad spectrum UV bulb is needed in their enclosures and they should also be taken outside regularly in appropriate weather since no bulb is a perfect substitute for sunlight. There maybe some debate to the above, Less frequency in exposure to sunlight may be acceptable being that they are a rainforest species. "Red-foot and Yellow-foot tortoises do not bask to the same extent as arid-habitat species, and therefore obtain much of their D3 needs in nature from the animal component of their diet". - Highfield 2002.Inactivity and poor feeding habits are the most common signs that red footed tortoises are sick, but they may be very ill by the time they exhibit these signs.FeedingRed Foot tortoises in particular seem very sensitive to environmental change. When first acquiring a red foot, expect a possible long period of fasting. Just when one thinks something is terribly wrong, the redfoot will suddenly start eating again once she/he feels comfortable with the surrounding (SFCRC - 2003). This fasting aspect is more prominent and longer in duration in WC (wild caught) individuals than with long term captives or CB (Captive bred) individuals.Red Foots eat most vegetable and fruits, especially dark green leafy vegetables. Occasionally in the wild they have been known to eat carrion. It was once thought that feeding pet Red Foots moistened dog or cat food once a week or so would take care of their nutritional needs. However, it is now known that this practice leads to malnutrition, stunted growth, improper shell growth, and can ultimately kill the animal. Dog and cat foods contain far too much protein for these tortoises to process which is why it is also important not to feed these tortoises meat. Red-foots should also be fed daily or every other day. Redfoots have been known to practice coprophagy. If one allows a redfoot to exercise in a backyard and a dog is living there, the redfoot will go straight for the dog pile!An ideal red-footed tortoise diet will consist of roughly 80% fibrous vegetables, and 20% fruits and succulent vegetables. It is important that red-foots are provided with diets high in fiber because their digestive tracts need to allow fibrous vegetables to ferment in order to digest food properly. In addition, red foots need a wide variety of vitamins and minerals in specific ratios to each other in order to live long and healthy lives. It can be very difficult to feed these tortoises correctly and information is hard to come by and often contradictory.After reaching maturation red-foots can sometimes have health problems related to overfeeding and may need to be fed only every other day. Red-foots' shell growth provide a rough index of overall nutrition. Excessive "pyramiding" or improper shell shape could indicate a sign of malnutrition. However, good shell growth alone does not necessarily mean that red-foots are being fed properly.[[Image:Gertrudes.jpg|right|thumb|A domesticated Geochelone carbonaria]] External linksRed Foot TortoiseAbout.com-Red Foot TortoiseCategory:Tortoises Category:Reptiles of South Americagn:Karumbe de:Köhlerschildkröte es:Geochelone carbonaria fr:Tortue charbonnière à patte rouge it:Geochelone carbonaria nl:Kolenbranderschildpad ja:アカアシガメ pl:Żabuti czarny pt:Jabuti
