 Cypripedium calceolus is a Lady's Slipper orchid.It is a widespread plant worldwide, found from Europe east through Asia to the Pacific Ocean. It is found in open woodland on moist calcareous soils. It has declined over much of the European part of its range, and as a result is legally protected in a number of countries.In Britain it was formerly a reasonably widespread plant across northern England. By the late 20th century, it had declined to just a single plant at Grass Wood in Wharfedale, Yorkshire,Twist, Colin Rare Plants in Great Britain - a site guide discovered in 1933, and still alive in 2003. A reintroduction program has led to a population of hundreds of plants as of 2003.The Norwegian municipality of Snåsa has a Cypripedium calceolus in its coat-of-arms.Cypripedium calceolus sensu stricto ("in the strict sense") does not occur in North America. The closely related Cypripedium parviflorum and C. pubescens are often still referred to as subspecies or variety of C. calceolus.ReferencesCategory:Cypripediumcs:Střevičník pantoflíček co:Cypripedium calceolus da:Stor Fruesko de:Gelber Frauenschuh et:Kaunis kuldking es:Cypripedium calceolus fr:Sabot de Vénus hsb:Europski črijenk it:Cypripedium calceolus lt:Plačialapė klumpaitė hu:Boldogasszony papucsa nl:Vrouwenschoentje no:Marisko nn:Marisko pl:Obuwik pospolity ro:Papucul doamnei sr:Госпина папучица fi:Lehtotikankontti sv:Guckusko uk:Черевички зозулині
