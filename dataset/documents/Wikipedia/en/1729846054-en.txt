In 1955 he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics with Willis Eugene Lamb for his accurate determination that the magnetic moment of the electron was greater than its theoretical value, thus leading to reconsideration of&mdash;and innovations in&mdash;quantum electrodynamics.He received his bachelor's degree in physics in 1931 from the Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University). From the University of Illinois, he received his master's degree in 1933 and his Ph.D. in 1936. He spent much of his career as a professor at Columbia University in New York City, and served as the university's provost for several years before departing for the newly-created University of Texas at Dallas. During his tenure at Columbia, he was the doctoral supervisor for Gordon Gould, the inventor of the laser.A residential dormitory for undergraduate students at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio on the South Campus is named after Dr. Kusch. The building is named Kusch House. It is located on Carlton Road in Cleveland Heights.External linksPolykarp Kusch bio at nobelprize.org Category:1911 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Case Western Reserve University alumni Category:Columbia University faculty Category:University of Texas at Dallas faculty Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:German physicists Category:German-American scientists Category:University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign alumnibn:পলিকার্প কুশ bg:Поликарп Куш ca:Polykarp Kusch de:Polykarp Kusch es:Polykarp Kusch eo:Polykarp Kusch fr:Polykarp Kusch gl:Polykarp Kusch id:Polykarp Kusch it:Polykarp Kusch he:פוליקרפ קוש sw:Polykarp Kusch ht:Polykarp Kusch nl:Polykarp Kusch ja:ポリカプ・クッシュ no:Polykarp Kusch pl:Polykarp Kusch pt:Polykarp Kusch ro:Polykarp Kusch ru:Куш, Поликарп sl:Polykarp Kusch fi:Polykarp Kusch sv:Polykarp Kusch tr:Polykarp Kusch zh:波利卡普·库施
