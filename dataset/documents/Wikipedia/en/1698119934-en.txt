When he arrived in Los Angeles, he could only drive during the day because the truck had two broken headlights. Eads got his big break on the primetime soap opera Savannah.

ControversyIn 2004, Eads and CSI co-star Jorja Fox gained considerable press attention when they were reportedly fired from the series, allegedly over contract disputes. Eads was reported to be hours late for work on the first day of filming for the fifth season, claiming to have merely overslept, and Fox had allegedly failed to submit a letter to CBS confirming that she would be on time for shooting. The disputes were resolved in just over a week, and the two were rehired by CBS, though neither actor received the pay increase of their fellow cast members.In the year 2006, Eads also garnered unfavourable press in Australia when he was scheduled to appear at the Logies (the Australian equivalent of the Emmys). Allegedly, his publicist called the organizers two hours before the event to state that Eads "didn't like red carpets." He also allegedly indulged in several flings with local soap opera stars. The head of publicity for the event, Jamie Campbell, stated that with guests like Eads, "you certainly earn your money".Celebrities behaving badly | NEWS.com.au Entertainment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;FilmographyStarring rolesEvel Knievel (2004, TV) as Evel KnievelMonte Walsh (2003, TV) as Frank "Shorty" AustinSecond String (2002, TV) as Tommy BakerJust a Walk in the Park as Adam WillingfordCSI: Crime Scene Investigation (2000, TV series) as Nick StokesGrapevine (2000, TV series) as Thumper KleinThe Spring (2000, TV) as GusCrowned and Dangerous (1997, TV) as Riley BaxterThe Ultimate Lie (1996, TV) as Ben McGrathSavannah (1996, TV series) as Travis Peterson (pilot episode); as Nick Corelli (in the series)1995 "Pastime" 4 part mini-series for Irving Community Television Network as Todd OlsonDust to Dust (1994) as Black WolfGuest-starring rolesTwo and a Half MenReferencesExternal linksGeorge Eads Bio at CBS - CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Category:1967 births Category:American television actors Category:People from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Living people Category:Texas Tech University alumnics:George Eads da:George Eads de:George Eads es:George Eads fr:George Eads ko:조지 이즈 it:George Eads nl:George Eads ja:ジョージ・イーズ pl:George Eads pt:George Eads fi:George Eads sv:George Eads zh:乔治·伊兹
