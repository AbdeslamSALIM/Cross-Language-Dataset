The Factbook provides a two- to three-page summary of the demographics, geography, communications, government, economy, and military of 266 U.S.-recognized countries, dependencies, and other areas in the world.The World Factbook is prepared by the CIA for the use of U.S. government officials, and its style, format, coverage, and content are primarily designed to meet their requirements. However, it is frequently used as a resource for research papers and Web sites. As a work of the U.S. government, it is in the public domain.''Factbook'' sourcesIn researching the Factbook, the CIA uses the sources listed below. Other public and private sources are also consulted.Antarctic Information Program (National Science Foundation)Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (Department of Defense)Bureau of the Census (Department of Commerce)Bureau of Labor Statistics (Department of Labor)Central Intelligence AgencyCouncil of Managers of National Antarctic ProgramsDefense Intelligence Agency (Department of Defense)Department of EnergyDepartment of StateFish and Wildlife Service (Department of the Interior)Maritime Administration (Department of Transportation)National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Department of Defense)Naval Facilities Engineering Command (Department of Defense)Office of Insular Affairs (Department of the Interior)Office of Naval Intelligence (Department of Defense)US Board on Geographic Names (Department of the Interior)US Transportation Command (Department of Defense)Oil & Gas JournalCopyrightBecause the Factbook is in the public domain, people are free to redistribute and modify it in any way that they like, without permission of the CIA. However, the CIA requests that it be cited when the Factbook is used. The official seal of the CIA, however, may not be copied without permission as required by the CIA Act of 1949 (50 U.S.C. section 403m). Misuse of the official seal of the CIA could result in civil and criminal penalties.Frequency of updates and availabilityBefore November 2001, The World Factbook website was updated yearly. Since then, the Factbook website is updated every two weeks; the print edition is still updated annually. Generally, information currently available as of January 1 of the current year is used in preparing the printed Factbook, which is released around the middle of each year.Government edition of the ''Factbook''The first classified edition of Factbook was published in August 1962 and the first unclassified version in June 1971.  The World Factbook has been available to the public in print since 1975 and on the World Wide Web since October 1994.Miller, Jill Young. "CIA puts data on the internet." Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel 12 December 1994. The Web version gets an average of 6 million visits per month; it can also be downloaded. The official printed version is sold at cost by the Government Printing Office and National Technical Information Service. In past years, the Factbook was available on CD-ROM, microfiche, magnetic tape, and floppy disk.ReprintsMany Internet sites use information and images from the CIA World Factbook. Several publishers, including Grand River Books, Potomac Books (formerly known as Brassy's Inc.), and Skyhorse Publishing have re-published the factbook in recent years.Entities in the ''Factbook''As of February 2008, The World Factbook consists of 266 entities. These entities can be divided into categories. They are:Independent countries: This category has independent countries, which the CIA defines as people "politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory". In this category, there are 194 entities.Others: The Other category is a list of other places set apart from the list of independent countries. Currently there are two: Taiwan and the European Union.Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: This category is a list of places affiliated with another country. They may be subdivided into categories using the country they are affiliated with:Australia: six entitiesChina: two entitiesDenmark: two entitiesFrance: nine entitiesNetherlands: two entitiesNew Zealand: three entitiesNorway: three entitiesUnited Kingdom: seventeen entitiesUnited States: fourteen entitiesMiscellaneous: This category is for Antarctica and places in dispute. There are six entities.Other entities: This category is for the World and the oceans. There are five oceans and the World (the World entry is intended as a summary of the other 265 entries). Territorial issues and controversiesPoliticalAreas not coveredSpecific regions within a country or areas in dispute among countries, such as Kashmir, are not covered, but other areas of the world whose status is disputed, such as the Spratly Islands, have entries. Subnational areas of countries (such as US States or the Canadian provinces and territories) are not included in the Factbook. Instead, users looking for information about subnational areas are referred to "a good encyclopedia" for their reference needs. This criterion was invoked in the 2007 edition with the decision to drop the entries for French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Reunion. They were dropped because besides being overseas departments, they were now overseas regions, and an integral part of France.KashmirMaps depicting Kashmir have the India–Pakistan border drawn at the Line of Control, but the region of Kashmir administered by China drawn in hash marks.Northern CyprusNorthern Cyprus, which the U.S. considers part of the Republic of Cyprus, is not given a separate entry because "territorial occupations/annexations not recognized by the United States Government are not shown on U.S. Government maps."Taiwan/Republic of ChinaTaiwan has a separate entry not listed under T, but at the bottom of the list. The name "Republic of China" is not listed as Taiwan's "official name" under the "Government" section, due to U.S. acknowledgement of Beijing's and Taipei'sOne-China policy according to which there is one China and Taiwan is a part of it. The name "Republic of China" was briefly added on January 27, 2005, but has since been changed back to "none". The map of the Peoples Republic of China on the World Factbook shows Taiwan included on the map of China.World Factbook-China entry.&lt;/ref&gt;(See also: [[Political status of Taiwan], Legal status of Taiwan)Burma/MyanmarThe U.S. does not recognize the renaming of Burma by its ruling military junta to Myanmar and thus keeps its entry for the country under "Burma". This is done because the name change "was not approved by any sitting legislature in Burma". As a result, the US government has never adopted the name Myanmar.MacedoniaThe Republic of Macedonia is entered as Macedonia, the name used in its first entry in the Factbook upon independence in 1992. In the 1994 edition, the name of the entry was changed to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as a result of the Macedonia naming dispute with Greece, which objected to the use of the name "Macedonia". For the next decade, this was the name the nation was listed under. Finally, in the 2004 edition of the Factbook, the name of the entry was changed back to Macedonia following a November 2004 US decision to refer to the country using this name.European UnionOn December 16, 2004, the CIA added an entry for the European Union (EU). (Before this date, the EU was excluded from the Factbook.) According to the CIA, the European Union was added because the EU "continues to accrue more nation-like characteristics for itself".United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges and Iles EparsesIn the 2006 edition of The World Factbook, the entries for Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Kingman Reef, Johnston Atoll, Palmyra Atoll and the Midway Islands were merged into a new United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges entry. The old entries for each individual insular area remain as redirects on the Factbook website.For an example of a redirect, see what happens with the profile for Kingman Reef. On September 7, 2006, the CIA also merged the entries for Bassas da India, Europa Island, the Glorioso Islands, Juan de Nova Island, and Tromelin Island into a new Iles Eparses entry. As with the new United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges entry, the old entries for these five islands remained as redirects on the website.For an example of a redirect, see what happens with the profile for Juan de Nova Island (mirror). On July 19, 2007, the Iles Eparses entry and redirects for each island were dropped due to the group becoming a district of the French Southern and Antarctic Lands in February.Serbia and Montenegro/YugoslaviaThe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) broke apart in 1991. The following year, it was replaced in the Factbook with entries for each of its former constituent republics. In doing this, the CIA listed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, proclaimed in 1992, as Serbia and Montenegro, as the U.S. did not recognize the union between the two republics. This was done in accordance with a May 21, 1992, decision by the U.S. not to recognize any of the former Yugoslav republics as successor states to the recently dissolved SFRY.from the 2000 edition of The World Factbook. Notice how the disclaimer is printed in the upper right hand corner. One can see how the capital cities of both republics are individually labeled on the map.]]These views were made clear in a disclaimer printed in the Factbook: Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint independent state, but this entity has not been recognized as a state by the United States. Montenegro and Serbia were treated separately in the Factbook data, as can be seen on the map.For an example, see the profile for the FRY in the 1999 World Factbook. In October 2000, Slobodan Milošević was forced out of office after a disputed election. This event led to democratic elections and U.S. diplomatic recognition. The 2001 edition of the Factbook thus referred to the state as Yugoslavia. On March 14, 2002, an agreement was signed to transform the FRY into a loose state union called Serbia and Montenegro; it took effect on February 4, 2003. The name of the Yugoslavia entity was altered in the Factbook the month after the change.KosovoOn February 28, 2008, the CIA added an entry for Kosovo; before this, Kosovo was excluded in the Factbook. The Kosovo declaration of independence is disputed by Serbia, which continues to regard Kosovo as its own territory, and other countries.East Timor/Timor-LesteOn July 19, 2007, the entry for East Timor was renamed Timor-Leste following a decision of the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN).FactualBefore 1998, the United Kingdom profile contained a sentence that asserted the UK had gained independence on 1 January 1801. This terse, confusing description in reference to the Act of Union 1801 has since been greatly expanded.ISBN numbersThis is a list of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs) for the Government editionThe ISBN for each edition can be found on the Government Printing Office Bookstore website. of The World Factbook.
