The event was massively overcrowded; it was oversold to almost twice the capacity of the gymnasium. In addition, thousands without tickets were outside. In order to keep them from sneaking in, Combs' people shut the only door to a stairwell and put a table behind it, despite the crowd jammed inside pounding on the door and pleading for help. At some point people in the crowd outside broke several glass doors in an attempt to get in; this caused a stampede inside the gymnasium in which nine people died.Mikal Gilmore (August 7, 1997). Puff Daddy Cometh. Rolling Stone. Accessed 2008-06-01. In a 1999 ruling, a Court of Claims judge found Puff Daddy and Heavy D. responsible for 50 percent of the incident.

The pair had creative differences over the usage of talent and eventually split. In a statement to Rolling Stone Magazine, JC said, "Sean and I remain friends, just not as close as we once were. Our split where it relates to business was because we saw two totally different avenues. I wanted to drive left and go the way of Def Jam and its mainstay of artists and Puffy Daddy wanted to drive right, business as usual. The split was amicable. Hip Hart Beat Records will one day become a reality. We are close now."Establishing Bad Boy RecordsAfter being fired from Uptown in 1993,Katherine E. Finkelstein (March 17, 2001).

Combs went on to establish Bad Boy Records, taking new hip-hop artist The Notorious B.I.G. with him.Both The Notorious B.I.G. and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by similarly successful LPs, particularly B.I.G.'s Ready to Die. Combs began signing more acts to Bad Boy, including, Dream, Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, Father MC, 112 and Total, as well as producing for Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others, and forming The Hitmen, an in-house production team.Mase and D-Block (known as "The L.O.X." at the time) soon joined Bad Boy, just as a widely publicized rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and B.I.G. were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s. During 1994–1995, he also helped produce songs for TLC's CrazySexyCool, which was the decade's best-selling R&B album. Songs he helped produced include "If I was Your Girlfriend" and "Can I Get A Witness".&quot;Puff Daddy&quot;In 1997, Combs recorded his first commercial vocal as a rapper under the name "Puff Daddy."

His debut album, No Way Out was a #1 album and won the 1998 Grammy Award for best rap album.He collaborated with Jimmy Page on the song "Come with Me" for the Godzilla film. The track, approved by Page, sampled the Led Zeppelin song "Kashmir". Producer Tom Morello supplied live guitar parts, playing bass on the song. Combs and Page filmed a video for "Come with Me", which reached #2 in the UK.By the late 1990s he was receiving criticism for watering down and overly commercializing hip-hop for a mainstream market and as overusing guest appearances by other artists as well as samples and interpolations of past hits for the majority of his own hit songs.Keith Farley. &quot;Forever&quot; - Overview.
