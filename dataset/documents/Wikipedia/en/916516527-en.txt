Retrieved 18 September 2006.The airport, within the incorporated cities of Euless, Grapevine, and Irving, serves 135 domestic destinations and 38 international, and is the largest and main hub for American Airlines (800 daily departures), and also the largest hub for American Eagle. Eighty four percent of all flights at Dallas/Fort Worth are operated by American Airlines. Delta Air Lines moved its Dallas/Fort Worth hub to Los Angeles International Airport in February 2005 in an effort to cut costs and avoid direct competition with American before eliminating it all together due to the Oil price increases since 2003. The airline shrank operations from 256 daily nonstop flights to 22.The airport is often referred to by its IATA airport code, "DFW." It is operated in many ways like a small city. It has its own post office, ZIP Code, and Public Services. The United States Postal Service gave the airport its own city designation, DFW Airport, TX."Contact Us," Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport The members of the airport's Board of Directors are appointed by the "owner cities" of Dallas and Fort Worth. The airport is inside the city limits of three other suburban cities, a situation that has led to legal battles over jurisdiction (see below). To help ensure future harmony with its neighbors, the DFW Airport Board includes a non-voting member — a representative chosen from the airport's neighbors (Irving, Euless, Grapevine, and Coppell) on a rotating basis.DFW is connected by shuttle bus to a commuter rail station just south of the airport. The Trinity Railway Express line serves both downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth.HistoryAs early as 1927, before the area had an airport, Dallas proposed a joint airport with Fort Worth. Fort Worth declined the offer, and thus the two cities opened their own airports, Love Field and Meacham Field. Both airports had scheduled airline service.In 1940, the Civil Aeronautics Administration earmarked $1.9 million for the construction of a Dallas-Fort Worth regional airport. American Airlines and Braniff Airways struck a deal with the city of Arlington to build an airport there, but the governments of Dallas and Fort Worth disagreed over its construction, and the project was abandoned in 1943. After World War II, Fort Worth annexed the site and developed it into Amon Carter Field with the help of American Airlines. Fort Worth transferred its commercial flights from Meacham Field to the new airport in 1953, which was now just  from Dallas Love Field. In 1960, Fort Worth purchased Amon Carter Field and renamed it Greater Southwest International Airport (GSW) in an attempt to compete with Dallas' more successful airport. However, GSW's traffic continued to decline relative to Love Field. By the mid-1960s, Fort Worth was getting 1% of Texas air traffic while Dallas was getting 49%, which led to the virtual abandonment of GSW.The joint airport proposal was revisited in 1961 after the FAA refused to invest any more money in separate Dallas and Fort Worth airports. Although the Fort Worth airport was eventually abandoned, Dallas Love Field became congested and had no more room to expand. Following an order from the federal government in 1964 that they would unilaterally choose a site if both cities could not come to an agreement on a site, officials from the two cities finally agreed on a location for a new regional airport that was north of the abandoned GSW and almost perfectly equidistant from the two city centers. The land was purchased by both cities in 1966, and construction began in 1969.The first landing of a supersonic BAC/Sud (now BAE Systems and Aerospatiale) Concorde in the United States occurred at DFW Airport on September 12, 1973 to commemorate the airport's completion. Concorde later served DFW in a cooperative agreement between Braniff Airways, British Airways, and Air France, before the demise of Braniff ended the service.DFW Airport opened for commercial service on January 13, 1974. The original name was Dallas Fort Worth Regional Airport. The name change to Dallas Fort Worth International Airport did not occur until 1985.History of DFW Airport&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; At the time, it was the largest and costliest airport in the world. Following the Wright Amendment of 1979, which banned long-distance flights from Love Field, DFW became the only airport in the metropolitan area to offer long-haul commercial air passenger service on aircraft with more than 56 passenger seats. Also in 1979, American Airlines moved its headquarters from New York to Fort Worth (adjacent to DFW on the former site of GSW). American began its first hub at DFW in 1981, started flights to London in 1982, and started flights to Tokyo in 1987. Delta Air Lines built up a domestic hub at DFW during the same period, but announced its closure in 2004 in a restructuring of the airline in an attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Today, Delta only flies from DFW to its four hubs.After the closing of Delta's hub in 2005, DFW Airport offered incentives to Southwest Airlines to relocate its hub to DFW from Love Field. Southwest, as in the past, declined the offer, opting to remain at Love Field.In 1989, the airport authority announced plans to rebuild the existing terminals and construct two new runways. After an environmental impact study was released the following year, the cities of Irving, Euless, and Grapevine sued the airport over its expansion plans, a battle that was finally decided (in favor of the airport) by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994. The seventh runway opened in 1996.The four primary North-South runways (those closest to the terminals) were all lengthened from  to their current length of . The first of these, 17R/35L, was extended in 1996 (at the same time the new runway was constructed), and the other three (17C/35C, 18L/36R, and 18R/36L) were extended in 2005. DFW is now the only airport in the world with four serviceable paved runways longer than .A new international terminal (Terminal D) opened in July 2005.A new people mover system, named Skylink, opened on May 21,2005 and is the world's largest high-speed airport train system. Totally automated, Skylink trains run every few minutes and travel at speeds up to .Bombardier Innovia Technology, Bombardier Transportation Website, 2006-02-03Lea+Elliot Skylink Project, 2006-02-03Corgan Associates press release, dated 20 May 2005, retrieved 14 February 2007 Skylink is double tracked, permitting bi-directional operations. The Skylink system was acquired from Bombardier Transportation and has been well-received by passengers.Skylink replaced the original Airtrans system (part of which was later operated as American Airlines' TrAAin system), which was notoriously slow at a top speed of , uni-directional (though it was a state-of-the-art automated system when the airport opened) and whose stations were outside security. Later, the Airtrans at DFW was split into three separate systems, the regular Airport Train, an employee train, and the American Airlines TrAAin - the one that was inside security. All three utilized the same guideway, and the same type of vehicles; the only major difference being the stations used. It served the airport for 31 years from 1974 until 2005 and transported a quarter of a billion passengers between DFW's four terminals and employee facilities, logging a total of 97 million miles (156 million kilometres) on its fleet. It was decommissioned about a month after Skylink opened.http://www.airliners.net/discussions/general_aviation/read.main/3858126/1/ Civil Aviation Forum, Airliners.Net Posted 2008-02-23http://www.vought.com/heritage/special/index.html Click on Airtrans  The old Airtrans tracks leaving the terminal's north and south ends can still be seen from the Skylink.Disasters at DFWOn the afternoon of August 2, 1985, Delta Air Lines Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 on a Fort Lauderdale-Dallas/Fort Worth-Los Angeles route, crashed at DFW Airport after encountering severe wind shear, killing 8 of 11 crew members, and 128 of the 152 passengers on board, as well as 1 person on the ground.On August 31, 1988, Delta Air Lines Flight 1141, a Boeing 727 which was bound to Salt Lake City International Airport in Salt Lake City, Utah, crashed after takeoff from Dallas/Fort Worth Airport, killing 2 of 7 crew members, and 12 of 101 passengers on board.Disasters involving flights with a DFW connectionOn June 2, 1983, Air Canada Flight 797, which was flying on a Dallas/Fort Worth-Toronto-Montreal route, made an emergency landing at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Kentucky; 23 of the 46 people on board were killed by either smoke inhalation or flash fire.On June 1, 1999, American Airlines Flight 1420 crashed upon landing at Little Rock National Airport at Little Rock, Arkansas on a flight from Dallas/Fort Worth, killing the captain and 10 of the 139 passengers.Incidents involving DFWOn December 20, 2007, American Airlines Flight 1538, an MD-80 flying from Dallas/Fort Worth to Orlando International Airport, had to return to Dallas/Fort Worth after the plane suffered an unexpected drop in altitude following a turbine failure in one of the two engines. None of the crew or 115 passengers were injured.

The airport is designed with expansion in mind, and can theoretically accommodate up to thirteen terminals totaling 260 gates, although this level of expansion is unlikely to be reached in the foreseeable future.The terminals at DFW are semicircular (except for the newest terminal, Terminal D, which is a "square U" shape) and built around the airport's central north-south arterial road, Spur 97, also known as "International Parkway." Until the late 1990s, they were designated by a number (2 being northernmost, 4 being southernmost) and a letter suffix ("E" for East, "W" for West). This system was later scrapped, and the terminals are now lettered from A to E. Terminals A, C, and E (from north to south) are on the east side of the airport, while Terminals B and D (from north to south) are on the west side.DFW's terminals are designed to minimize the distance between a passenger's car and airplane as well as reduce traffic around terminals. A consequence of this layout is that connecting passengers had to walk extremely long distances between gates (in order to walk from one end of the semicircular concourse to the other, one must walk the entire length; there were no shortcuts between the ends). Since DFW is American Airlines' largest hub, this has caused problems. The original people mover train (opened with the airport, but notoriously slow and uni-directional) was replaced by SkyLink in April 2005, which serves all five terminals at a considerably higher speed and is bi-directional.Terminal AAmerican Airlines and its regional affiliate American Eagle have a large presence at Dallas/Fort Worth. The world's largest airline, in terms of passengers transported, operates its largest hub at DFW. The two airlines operate at four of the five terminals at the airport. Terminal A, previously called "Terminal 2E" when the airport was first opened, is fully occupied by American Airlines for domestic flights. Prior to the opening of Terminal D, Terminal A operated most of AA's international flights at the airport. During the late 1990s, a significant number of American Eagle flights moved to Terminal B. Also in the late 1990s, American Eagle built a Satellite Terminal (Named Satellite Terminal A2) due to the lack of aircraft gates. It was located near Terminal A and was only accessible via shuttle buses. Satellite Terminal A2 (Gates A2A-A2N) was abandoned in 2005 when American Eagle moved all operations to Terminals B and D. However there are plans underway to redevelop the aging Terminal into a world class hub larger and more exclusive than international terminal D into becoming American Airlines exclusive Central Terminal.Terminal A has 35 gates: A9-A29, A33-A39American Airlines (Albuquerque, Anchorage seasonal, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore/Washington, Birmingham (AL), Boston, Burbank, Charlotte, Chicago-O'Hare, Colorado Springs, Columbus (OH), Dayton, Denver, Detroit, Eagle/Vail, El Paso, Fayetteville (AR), Fresno, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Greensboro November 1, Gunnison seasonal, Hartford/Springfield, Hayden/Steamboat Springs seasonal, Houston-Intercontinental, Huntsville, Indianapolis, Jackson Hole seasonal, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Louisville, McAllen, Memphis, Miami, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Montrose seasonal, Nashville, New Orleans, New York-JFK, New York-LaGuardia, Newark, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, Omaha, Ontario (CA), Orange County, Orlando, Palm Springs, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Portland (OR), Raleigh/Durham, Reno/Tahoe, Richmond, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose (CA), San Juan (PR), Seattle/Tacoma, St. Louis, Tampa Bay, Tucson, Tulsa, Washington-Dulles, Washington-Reagan, West Palm Beach, Wichita)Terminal BThis terminal was originally called "Terminal 2W" when the airport first opened.

Prior to the opening of Terminal D, all non-AA international flights operated from this terminal.Terminal B has 31 gates: B2-B16, B18-B21, B23-B25, B28-30, B33-B36, B39American AirlinesAmerican Eagle (Abilene, Alexandria, Amarillo, Baton Rouge, Bloomington/Normal November 2, Cedar Rapids, Champaign/Urbana, Charleston (SC), Chattanooga, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky, Cleveland, College Station, Columbia (SC), Columbus (OH), Corpus Christi, Des Moines, El Paso November 2, Evansville, Fayetteville (AR), Fort Smith, Fort Walton Beach, Fort Wayne, Grand Junction, Grand Rapids, Greensboro, Greenville (SC), Gulfport/Biloxi, Houston-Hobby, Jackson, Killeen, Knoxville, Lafayette, Laredo, Lawton, Lexington, Little Rock, Longview, Louisville, Lubbock, Madison, Midland-Odessa, Milwaukee, Mobile, Moline/Quad Cities, Monroe (LA), Montrose seasonal, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, Pensacola, Peoria, Pittsburgh, Rochester (NY), Roswell, San Angelo, Santa Barbara, Savannah, Shreveport, Springfield (MO), Texarkana, Tulsa, Tyler, Waco, Wichita Falls)United Airlines (Chicago-O'Hare, Denver, San Francisco)United Express operated by Shuttle America (Chicago-O'Hare, Washington-Dulles)United Express operated by SkyWest Airlines (Chicago-O'Hare, Denver, Los Angeles)Terminal CAmerican Airlines operates all the gates at Terminal C, originally called "Terminal 3E" for only domestic flights.Terminal C has 31 gates: C2-C4, C6-C8, C10-C12, C14-C17, C19-C22, C24-C33, C35-C37, C39American Airlines (See Terminal A)International Terminal DInternational Terminal D designed by HKS, HNTB and Corgan Associates, opened in July 2005. The new terminal is a  facility capable of handling 32,000 passengers daily or 11.7 million passengers annually, with 28 gates and an integrated 298-room Grand Hyatt DFW http://www.granddfw.hyatt.com Hotel. The terminal features 200 ticketing positions and a federal inspection facility capable of processing 2,800 passengers per hour. The concession areas consist of  of retail, including many dining and retail options.The new eight-level parking garage has over 8,100 parking spaces and uses a Smart Technology System that lets guests know which floors are full. Air-conditioned skybridges with moving walkways and elevators connect the garage to the terminal, and an arrivals canopy roof shields pedestrians from inclement weather as they enter and exit the terminal.Terminal D has 29 gates: D6-D8, D10-D12, D14-D18, D20-D25, D27-D31, D33-D34, D36-D40Air Canada (Toronto-Pearson)American Airlines (International) (Some domestic flights (see Terminal A)) (Acapulco seasonal, Belize City, Buenos Aires-Ezeiza, Cabo San Lucas, Calgary, Cancún, Caracas, Cozumel, Frankfurt, Guadalajara, Guatemala City, Honolulu, Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo seasonal, Kahului, León, London-Heathrow, Mexico City, Montego Bay seasonal, Monterrey, Montréal, Nassau November 2, Panama City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Providenciales, Puerto Vallarta, San José (CR), San Salvador, Santiago de Chile, São Paulo-Guarulhos, Tokyo-Narita, Toronto-Pearson, Vancouver)American Eagle (Aguascalientes, Chihuahua, Guadalajara, León, Monterrey, San Luis Potosí, Tampico, Torreón)British Airways (London-Heathrow)KLM (Amsterdam)Korean Air (Seoul-Incheon)Lufthansa (Frankfurt)Mexicana (Mexico City)Sun Country Airlines (Cancún, Minneapolis/St. Paul)TACA (San Salvador)Terminal ETerminal E, originally called Terminal 4E, was occupied primarily by Delta Air Lines until Delta closed its hub in 2005 and retained only flights to its other hubs. Terminal E is distinctive in that it has a satellite terminal connected by an underground walkway. The satellite, previously used by Delta and later used by Delta Connection carriers, is currently unused. Terminal E is also connected to other terminals only by Skylink and is lacking the walkways that link other terminals.Terminal E has 26 gates: E2, E4-E6, E7A, E7B, E8, E9A, E9B, E10-E18, E20-E21, E31-E38. Terminal E had customs facilities that were used when Delta operated flights to Frankfurt in the early 1990s, and when Air France and AeroMexico used to serve D/FW before the International Terminal D was constructed. In the 2000s, SkyTeam partner airlines Continental and Northwest moved to gates adjacent to Delta. Currently, airlines serving Terminal E include:AirTran Airways (Atlanta, Baltimore/Washington seasonal, Orlando)Alaska Airlines (Seattle/Tacoma)Continental Airlines (Cleveland, Houston-Intercontinental, Newark)Continental Express operated by ExpressJet Airlines (Cleveland, Houston-Intercontinental)Delta Air Lines (Atlanta, Salt Lake City)Delta Connection operated by Atlantic Southeast Airlines (Atlanta)Delta Connection operated by Comair (Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky, New York-JFK)Delta Connection operated by Freedom Airlines (New York-JFK)Delta Connection operated by SkyWest Airlines (Salt Lake City)Frontier Airlines (Denver)Midwest Airlines (Milwaukee)Midwest Connect operated by Republic Airlines (Milwaukee)Northwest Airlines (Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul)Northwest Airlink operated by Compass Airlines (Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St.Paul)Northwest Airlink operated by Mesaba Airlines (Minneapolis/St. Paul)Northwest Airlink operated by Pinnacle Airlines (Memphis)US Airways (Charlotte, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Phoenix)US Airways Express operated by Mesa Airlines (Phoenix)US Airways Express operated by Republic Airlines (Philadelphia, Washington-Reagan)New air service developmentWhile D/FW currently serves 40+ international markets, attracting and retaining new air service to newer ones has always been dicey. Record fuel prices, economic downturns, and the competitive threat of American's massive hub operations at D/FW have always made it difficult for new airline tenants to prioritize the airport for expansion opportunities. Still, the airport has been working aggressively to increase the number of international flights, and in 2006 launched the Air Service Initiative Program. It costs $7 million per year and is targeted towards securing flights to markets such as Hong Kong, Dublin, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Bogotá, etc. Since then, D/FW has successfully commenced operations to Providenciales, Turks and Caicos Islands, Panama City, and San Salvador on American and to Amsterdam via KLM. Thanks to the EU-US Open Skies Agreement, D/FW was able to shift its daily service on British Airways and twice daily service on American to London Heathrow from the less-convenient London Gatwick Airport. These shifts, along with the new KLM route, open up more than double the amount of connections to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, and Asia from North Texas. Previously, Lufthansa was the only major airline that provided such global networking.Airport officials have traveled extensively throughout Latin America and Asia over the past few months to market D/FW. Plausible contenders to commence operations to D/FW include foreign-flag Latin American carriers, such as LAN Airlines beginning service to Peru, Chile, or Ecuador. There have also been talks with China Eastern Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airlines to begin direct service from D/FW to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Beijing, or even a lesser known Chinese city. Despite being the 3rd busiest airport in the world, D/FW only offers service to two Asian cities, Seoul and Tokyo, and considers itself "severely behind" other gateways on the East and West Coast in terms of connections and its potentiality to attract tourism and business with such meager frequencies. Ideally, American would provide excellent connections for a Chinese route, but the carrier previously had major problems in negotiating with its pilots union in the 2006 bid to gain China access rights to Beijing. Political and Economic conditions also make it difficult for foreign flag carriers to fly to D/FW; first they have to receive clearance from the Chinese government, and secondly, rising oil prices have led them to be extra cautious against pursuing markets that could be money losers. Logistically speaking as well, some of them will not even have the aircraft capable of such routes until 2009 or later.Other new route discussions that have been tossed around include service to Munich on Lufthansa, American or Iberia to Madrid, Qantas to Sydney/Melbourne and Emirates Airline to Dubai (which will become more likely once the carrier receives its orders of Airbus A350 aircraft).CargoDallas/Fort Worth International Airport handles sixty percent of all air cargo in Texas. Asia and Europe account for over 75% of the cargo at the 25th busiest cargo airport in the world. In a recent survey by Air Cargo World, Dallas/Fort Worth ranked as "The Best Cargo Airport in the World". Frankfurt International Airport came in second, while Hong Kong International Airport and the world's busiest cargo airport, Memphis International Airport, tied for third. http://www.aircargoworld.com/features/0306_2.htmTrade dataAsia 48%Europe 34%Latin America 9%Middle East 3%Indian subcontinent 2%Oceania 2%Africa 1%Rest of World 1%Cargo carriersABX Air (DHL)Air China Cargo (Beijing)Air Transport InternationalAir France Cargo (Paris-Charles de Gaulle)Alpine Air ExpressAmeriflightCaribbean Transport ServicesCathay Pacific Cargo (Hong Kong)China Cargo (Taipei-Taiwan Taoyuan)Emery WorldwideEVA Air Cargo (Taipei-Taiwan Taoyuan)FedEx Express (Memphis)JALCARGO (Tokyo-Narita)Kitty HawkKorean Air Cargo (Anchorage, Miami, Seoul-Incheon)Lufthansa Cargo (Frankfurt)Singapore Airlines Cargo (Brussels, Singapore)Southern AirTradewinds Airlines (Aguadilla)UPS Airlines (Louisville)ReferencesExternal linksDallas-Fort Worth International Airport, official websiteQTVR tour of DFW control towerDFW Tower.com  Category:Airports in Dallas-Fort Worth Category:Economy of Dallas, Texas Category:Economy of Fort Worth, Texasde:Flughafen Dallas/Fort Worth es:Aeropuerto Internacional de Dallas-Fort Worth fa:فرودگاه بین‌المللی دالاس-فورت ورث fr:Aéroport international de Dallas-Fort Worth nl:Luchthaven Dallas-Fort Worth ja:ダラス・フォートワース国際空港 no:Dallas-Fort Worth internasjonale lufthavn pl:Port lotniczy Dallas-Fort Worth pt:Aeroporto Internacional de Dallas-Fort Worth ro:Aeroportul Internaţional Dallas-Fort Worth fi:Dallasin kansainvälinen lentoasema sv:Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport th:ท่าอากาศยานนานาชาติดัลลาส-ฟอร์ตเวิร์ธ vi:Sân bay quốc tế Dallas-Forth Worth zh:达拉斯-沃斯堡国际机场
