He scored a dramatic late goal for Livorno when he headed in a late free kick during a 2006-07 UEFA Cup group stage match against FK Partizan Belgrade on November 2, 2006, ensuring a 1-1 draw and becoming the first Italian goalkeeper to score in European competition.Despite being recognized as one of the Italian league's top young goalkeepers, Amelia has arguably made more headlines from incessant transfer rumors. Although he signed a four-year contract extension till the 2010-11 season with Livorno in January 2007, he became disenfranchised with his club after Livorno coach Daniele Arrigoni was fired that month, and he openly criticized team president Aldo Spinelli in response, saying Spinelli himself should resign "if he's got the balls to do it." Spinelli replied, "I've tried to teach Amelia some manners but he can't hold his tongue, like all Romans."Guardian Unlimited: Sport blog: Livorno let die&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Meanwhile, a number of clubs across Europe, in particular Lazio, Milan and Liverpool expressed interest in his services. channel4.com - Football Italia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;SkySports.comFollowing Livorno's relegation from the top flight, Amelia asked to leave Livorno for a top flight team and on June 5, 2008 Palermo announced to have signed him on a permanent basis.CountryAmelia was the starting keeper for the Azzurrini and conceded only four goals in six games as Italy won the 2004 European Under-21 Football Championship, while taking home the bronze medal with Italy at the Summer Olympics that same year.He earned his first cap for Italy in a friendly against Ivory Coast on November 16, 2005, playing the last twenty minutes as a substitute for Christian Abbiati; this was his only senior-side experience when Italy coach Marcelo Lippi chose him over Morgan De Sanctis as the third-choice goalkeeper behind Gianluigi Buffon and Angelo Peruzzi for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. but never received any playing time.
