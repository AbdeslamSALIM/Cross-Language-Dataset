In the Early Middle Ages, Dorestad was the biggest, most important and flourishing city of West Europe.It was situated where the Rhine and Lek rivers meet, south of the city of Utrecht, in and near the modern town of Wijk bij Duurstede, near and on on the remains of an ancient Roman fortress. Between 600 and around 719 Dorestad was often fought over between the Frisians and the Franks.The city was a North Sea trading center between the late seventh century and the middle of the ninth century, primarily handling goods from the Middle Rhineland. Wine was among the major products traded at Dorestad, likely from vineyards south of Mainz.The city was widely known because it had a mint. Around 640, the master of the mint in Dorestad was Madelinus. Later, sceattas were minted there.Because of its success as a trading city, Dorestad drew the attention of Vikings, who frequently raided the city (834, 835, 844, 857 and 863). Historians think that approximately 7000 Vikings were involved in the first raid in 834. The raid of 857 was led by Rorik of Dorestad. Dorestad became the capital of the Viking Kingdom of Dorestad, which lasted from 850 to 885.The city became in decline around 850 and shrunk down to a small agricultural site. However, in 896 king Zwentibold of Lotharingia mentions in a document still the rights and priviliges of Dorestad. The remains of Dorestad have been partially washed away by the river.References Category:History of the Netherlandscy:Dorestad da:Dorestad de:Dorestad es:Dorestad fr:Dorestad fy:DorestÃªd nl:Dorestad pl:Dorestat sv:Dorestad
