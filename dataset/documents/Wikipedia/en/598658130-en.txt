In 2007, Evans became the first Australian to win the UCI ProTour. Evans has claimed the highest Tour de France finishes for an Australian, placing 2nd in both 2007 and 2008 events. Prior to turning to road cycling in 2001, Evans was a champion mountain biker, riding for the Volvo-Cannondale MTB team, winning the World Cup in 1998 and 1999 and placing 7th in the men's cross-country mountain bike race at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. Cadel is married to Chiara Evans, who is an Italian pianist.CareerEarly daysEvans was born 14 February 1977, in Katherine, Northern Territory. He started his International career as a member of the Australian Institute of Sport MTB team, under the leadership of A.I.S. Head Coach, German-born Heiko Salzwedel and MTB Coach Damien Grundy. He was an exceptional Mountain Biker, winning Silver medals at the 1997 and 1999 MTB U23 World Championships, but also won Bronze medals at the 1995 Junior World Road Cycling Time Trial Championships and Junior World Mountain Bike Championships.During his career on the road he has been a member of the following teams: Saeco (2001), Mapei (2002), Team Columbia (then named Team Telekom) (2003&ndash;2004). For the 2005 season he signed with Davitamon-Lotto, and on his first Tour de France later that year achieved 8th place in the overall General Classification, the first Australian to place in the top ten in the Tour de France since Phil Anderson.2006Evans bettered his Tour de France performance in 2006, finishing 4th overall in the General Classification, post the disqualification of winner Floyd Landis. In 2006, he won the Tour de Romandie, snatching the leader's jersey off two Spaniards, Liberty Seguros' Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde, on the last stage (a 20.4 km Individual Time Trial around the Swiss city of Lausanne.)2007In the 2007 Tour de France, Evans finished runner up in the general classification to Alberto Contador, cementing his position as one of the best cyclists in the world and highest placed Australian ever in Le Tour. He dominated riders such as Carlos Sastre and Alejandro Valverde in the mountains, and finished first in the stage 13 time trial and second in the stage 19 time trial. Evans finished just off the podium as 4th overall in the 2007 Vuelta a Espana. He capped off his year with a strong 5th place finish in the road race at the UCI Road World Championships and in the final UCI ProTour race of the year, the Giro di Lombardia, he finished in 6th place, securing the 2007 UCI ProTour title with 247 points, ahead of Davide Rebellin and Alberto Contador. The 2007 Giro d'Italia winner Danilo Di Luca was the ProTour leader until he was removed from the ProTour rankings due to a three month ban for his role in a drugs scandal.Some of his other successes as a road cyclist include a stage win in the Tour of Austria in 2001, overall win of the Tour of Austria 2004, 5th in the Tour of Germany in 2005, a stage win of the Tour Down Under in 2002, winning the Mountains Classification in the Tour Down Under in 2006, fourteenth place in the 2002 Giro d'Italia (he wore the leader's jersey, Maglia Rosa for one day), and Commonwealth Games time trial Champion in 2002. In 2006 he was crowned Australian Cyclist of the Year, and in 2007 he reprised the award.2008Evans was considered as one of the favorites to win the 2008 Tour de France largely due to the fact that title holder Alberto Contador was not allowed to participate as his team Astana were not invited to the Tour. Evans began the race wearing the #1 race number (dossard) due to his 2nd place finish in 2007. Evans rode strongly throughout the tour, and held the yellow jersey from stages 10 to 14. However, during the climb of the Alpe d'Huez on stage 17, Carlos Sastre of Team CSC took 2 minute 15 seconds from Evans. By the penultimate stage time trial, Evans needed to ride 1 minute 34 seconds faster than yellow jersey wearer Sastre. The majority of the team managers and cycling pundits agreed that Evans would be able to make up the deficit. However, though he beat Sastre on the day, and jumped to second place on the General Classification, Evans was unable to overcome the deficit and remained 58 seconds behind at the end of the tour.After recovering from a knee injury, where he ruptured an anterior cruciate ligament, Evans contested the 245 km mens road race at the Beijing Olympics, finishing in 15th place, 22 seconds behind the winner Samuel Sánchez.Leo Schlink,Australian cyclist Michael Rogers narrowly misses medal in Olympic road race, The Australian, 9 August 2008 He placed fifth in the road time trial four days later.Social activismIn 2008, Cadel Evans wore a cycling undershirt with the Flag of Tibet and supported freedom for Tibet.Cadel Evans support Free Tibet, Site of Sport (magazine)Photo of Cadel Evans with Flag of Tibet, Site of Phayul.comHe stated: Palmarès19969th Atlanta Olympics Mountain Bike Race19981st Overall, Mountain Bike World Cup19991st Overall, Mountain Bike World Cup20007th Sydney Olympics Mountain Bike Cross Country20011st Overall, Tour of Austria20021st Road Time Trial Commonwealth Games1st Stage 5, Tour Down Under1st Stage 1, Settimana Ciclistica Internazionale (Translates to International Cycling Week)1st Stage 4, International UNIQA Classic2nd Road Race Commonwealth Games20041st Overall and Stage 2, Tour of Austria20058th Overall, Tour de France4th Stage 1620061st Overall and Stage 5, Tour de Romandie4th Overall (revised after Floyd Landis DSQ), Tour de France2007Champion, UCI ProTour1st Stage 2, Test Event Beijing 2008 (ITT)2nd Overall, Tour de France6th Stage 83rd Stage 91st Stage 137th Stage 144th Stage 162nd Stage 192nd Overall, Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré2nd Stage 74th Stages 3 and 44th Overall, Vuelta a España2nd Stage 102nd Stage 184th Overall, Tour de Romandie6th Giro di Lombardia7th Overall, 2007 Paris-Nice4th Stage 420083rd Overall, Vuelta a Andalucía1st Stage 21st Stage 4, Paris-Nice1st Stage 3, Settimana internazionale di Coppi e Bartali2nd La Flèche Wallonne7th Liège-Bastogne-Liège2nd Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré2nd Overall, Tour de France6th Stage 14th Stage 43rd Stage 68th Stage 107th Stage 177th Stage 201st, General Classification after Stages 10-1415th, Olympic Road Race5th, Olympic Time Trial  ReferencesExternal linksCycling Federation rider profileCyclingnews.com interview2006 Tour de France Official Rider ProfileCadel Evans profile  Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Australian cyclists Category:Mountain bikers Category:Australian Tour de France stage winners Category:Olympic cyclists of Australia Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2002 Commonwealth Games Category:Commonwealth Games gold medalists for Australia Category:Commonwealth Games silver medalists for Australia Category:People from the Northern Territoryca:Cadel Evans cs:Cadel Evans da:Cadel Evans de:Cadel Evans es:Cadel Evans eu:Cadel Evans fr:Cadel Evans it:Cadel Evans la:Cadel Evans lb:Cadel Evans hu:Cadel Evans nl:Cadel Evans ja:カデル・エヴァンス no:Cadel Evans pl:Cadel Evans pt:Cadel Evans ru:Эванс, Кэдел fi:Cadel Evans sv:Cadel Evans
