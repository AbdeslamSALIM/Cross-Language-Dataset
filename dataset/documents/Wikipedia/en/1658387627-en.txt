One of its attractions is a fine baroque church overlooking the sea.Cervo's connections with classical music date from to 1964, when the International Chamber Music Festival of Cervo was established by the famous Hungarian violinist Sandor Vegh. The event has been held every summer ever since. Music master classes - Accademia di Cervo - are held in September, and a guitar academy is held in June.External linkssummer music academyCategory:Cities and towns in Liguria Category:Italian Rivierade:Cervo (Ligurien) es:Cervo (Italia) eo:Cervo (komunumo) fr:Cervo (Italie) it:Cervo (IM) lij:O Çervo nl:Cervo (Italië) ja:チェルヴォ nap:Cervo (IM) pms:Cervo pl:Cervo pt:Cervo (Itália) vo:Cervo
