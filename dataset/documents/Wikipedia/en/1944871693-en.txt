  Dora Baltea ˈbaltea or Doire Baltée ( or Duria Bautica), is a river in northern Italy. It is a left-hand tributary of the Po River, and is about 160 km (99 mi) long. It originates by Mont Blanc as the confluence of the Dora di Ferret, fed by the Pré de Bar Glacier in Val Ferret, and the Dora di Veny, fed by the Miage Glacier in Val Veny.]] As it crosses the Aosta Valley, the Dora Baltea flows through the city of Aosta (where the Buthier runs into it) and then Saint-Vincent. After it enters Piedmont, it passes through the city of Ivrea and a good part of Canavese, reaching the Po at Crescentino, a little downstream from Chivasso.It is a popular place for whitewater rafting and kayaking. Early in the summer, in May and June, the rivers are usually high with snow melt from the mountains. During July, August and September the water levels are usually lower and the temperature warmer.See alsoThe Dora Riparia is another tributary of the Po.Category:Po basin Category:Rivers of Aosta Valley Category:Rivers of Piedmont Category:Rivers of the Province of Turin Category:Rivers of the Province of Vercelli br:Dora Báltea ca:Dora Baltea cs:Dora Baltea de:Dora Baltea es:Dora Baltea fr:Doire Baltée he:דורה בלטאה it:Dora Baltea nl:Dora Baltea nn:Dora Baltea no:Dora Baltea pl:Dora Baltea ru:Дора-Бальтеа sr:Дора Балтеа ur:دورا بالتیا
