It has the formula Ca(C2H3O2)2. Its standard name is calcium acetate, while calcium ethanoate is the systematic IUPAC name. An older name is acetate of lime. The anhydrous form is very hygroscopic; therefore the monohydrate (Ca(CH3COO)2.H2O, CAS 5743-26-0) is the common form.If an alcohol is added to a saturated solution of calcium acetate, a semisolid, flammable gel forms that is much like "canned heat" products such as Sterno.&quot;Canned Heat&quot; at Journal of Chemical Education &quot;Chemistry comes alive!&quot; Chemistry teachers often prepare "California Snowballs", a mixture of calcium acetate solution and ethanol. The resulting gel is whitish in color, and can be formed to resemble a snowball.Calclacite is a name for calcium acetate chloride pentahydrate, which is treated as mineral species but possess anthropogenic origin.HistoryBecause it is inexpensive, calcium acetate was once a common starting material for the synthesis of acetone before the development of the cumene process.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;UsesIn kidney disease, blood levels of phosphate may rise (called hyperphosphatemia) leading to bone problems. Calcium acetate binds phosphate in the diet to lower blood phosphate levels. Side effects of this treatment include upset stomach.Calcium acetate is a food additive, mainly in candy products.References Category:Acetates Category:Calcium compounds Category:Phosphate binders Category:Carboxylic acidsar:خلات كالسيوم de:Calciumacetat es:Acetato de calcio fr:Acétate de calcium it:Acetato di calcio idrato hu:Kalcium-acetát nl:Calciumacetaat ja:酢酸カルシウム pl:Octan wapnia fi:Kalsiumasetaatti zh:乙酸钙
