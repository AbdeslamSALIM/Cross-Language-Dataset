 | operating system = Mac OS 9 and Windows (prior to Windows Vista) | genre = Desktop Publishing | license = Proprietary | website = Adobe's PageMaker website  PageMaker was the first desktop publishing program, introduced in 1985 by Aldus Corporation, initially for the Apple Macintosh but soon after also for the PC. It relies on Adobe Systems' PostScript page description language. In 1994 Adobe Systems acquired Aldus and PageMaker. The current version is PageMaker 7.0, released July 9, 2001, though updates have been released for the two supported platforms since. PageMaker was awarded an SPA Excellence in Software Award for Best New Use of a Computer in 1986.Many of the graphical user interface (GUI) elements pioneered in the program have since migrated to the rest of the Adobe suite. Adobe has positioned PageMaker to compete more for the small business market, with Adobe InDesign aimed at the high end, professional designer. PageMaker's feature set is well suited for publications such as corporate newsletters and the straight-news sections of newspapers, but for layouts that need a more complex design, such as magazines or the feature sections of newspapers, it may take much longer to accomplish the task in PageMaker than it would in InDesign or QuarkXPress, if the desired results are possible at all.While PageMaker is less powerful than InDesign or QuarkXPress, it is simpler to learn than those two packages and yet more powerful than Microsoft Publisher. It is not uncommon for schools that teach page layout to first teach their students PageMaker to get them comfortable with the concepts of desktop publishing, then move them on to QuarkXPress or InDesign. In 2004, Adobe announced the end of development for Adobe PageMaker but that Adobe will continue to sell and support it. InDesign is seen as the successor product.The Macintosh version only runs in Mac OS 9 or earlier; there is no native support for Mac OS X, nor is there support for Intel-based Macintoshes. It does not run well under Classic (which may have led to its nickname of "RageMaker"), and Adobe recommends customers use an older Macintosh capable of booting into Mac OS 9.According to Adobe, PageMaker "does not install or run on Windows Vista."ReferencesExternal linksAdobe - PageMaker 7 (official site)List of Adobe PageMaker Resources sitesPageMaker HistoryPageMaker, Adobe Category:Desktop publishing softwareda:Adobe PageMaker de:PageMaker es:Adobe PageMaker fr:Adobe PageMaker gl:Adobe PageMaker it:Adobe PageMaker lt:Adobe PageMaker nl:Adobe PageMaker ja:Adobe PageMaker no:Adobe PageMaker pl:Adobe PageMaker pt:Adobe PageMaker ro:Adobe Pagemaker fi:Adobe PageMaker sv:Pagemaker th:อะโดบี เพจเมกเกอร์ zh:Adobe PageMaker
