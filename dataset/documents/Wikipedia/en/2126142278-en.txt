At Wimbledon, Dokić made her professional breakthrough. As a qualifier, she caused one of the biggest upsets in tennis history, defeating World No. 1 Hingis 6–2, 6–0, in the first round.

This success resulted in Jelena reaching her career high doubles ranking of World No. 10.2003After parting ways with her erratic father Damir, who was also her coach, her career problems began. In 2003, she hired Borna Bikić from Croatia to be her trainer (while simultaneously dating his brother Tin), contrary to the wishes of her father Damir on both counts. Her tennis suffered and her slide down the standings continued.A string of first or second round losses commenced as she clearly suffered from a severe loss of confidence. No longer a part of her life physically, her father continued to be a presence as he publicly criticised her choices. At one stage, he termed her boyfriend Enrique Bernoldi, a former Formula One driver with whom she lived at the time, "an idiot."She played matches at 30 events, reaching one final, one semifinal, and seven quarterfinals. At Zurich, she beat the then World No. 1 player, Kim Clijsters, later to lose to Justine Henin in the final. She also reached a final in doubles, in Rome with Nadia Petrova.2004-2005In mid-2004, Dokić returned to her family in Serbia, trying to put her life back in order and regain confidence.

However, she suffered a 4–6, 7–6(4), 6–2 loss to Alexandra Stevenson.

Dokić said she was not satisfied with the contract Pilić's Academy offered her.2007After withdrawing from several ITF events in the early months of 2007, Dokić lost in the early rounds of two $10,000 events in Rome.

Dokic's long awaited return to tennis came during the Australian Open wildcard playoff, where she was hoping to earn a wildcard into the first Grand Slam tournament of 2008. Dokić emerged from the round robin stage with a 3–0 record before retiring in her quarterfinal match while trailing 6–3, 3–1 due to a thigh strain.2008Dokić received a wildcard for the qualifications of the Moorilla Hobart International, where she won four matches to reach the second round of the main draw, where she retired in her match against Flavia Pennetta due to an ankle injury.
