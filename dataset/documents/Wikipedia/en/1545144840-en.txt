Some research has referred to it as eka-gold.Electronic structureNon-relativisticRoentgenium has 6 full shells, 7s+5p+3d+2f=17 full subshells, and 111 orbitals:Bohr model: 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 18, 1Quantum mechanical model: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10 4p65s24d105p66s24f145d10 6p67s15f146d10RelativisticThe stable group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold all have an outer electron configuration nd10(n+1)s1. For each of these elements, their first excited state has a configuration nd9(n+1)s2. Due to spin-orbit coupling between the s electrons, this state is split into a pair of energy levels. For copper, the difference in energy between the ground state and lowest excited state causes the metal to appear reddish. For silver, the energy gap widens and it become silvery. However, as Z increases, the excited levels are stabilised by relativistic effects and in gold the energy gap decreases again and it appears gold. For roentgenium, calculations indicate that the 6d97s2 level is stabilised to such an extent that it becomes the ground state. The resulting energy difference between the new ground state and the first excited state is similar to that of silver and roentgenium is expected to be silvery in appearance.&quot;Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements&quot;, Turler, A., Journal of Nuclear and Radiochemical Sciences, Vol. 5, No.2, pp. R19-R25, 2004. Retrieved on 2008-03-03Extrapolated chemical properties of eka-goldOxidation statesElement 111 is projected to be the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group 11 (IB) in the Periodic Table, below copper, silver, and gold. Each of the members of this group show different stable states. Copper forms a stable +II state, whilst silver is predominantly found as Ag(I) and gold as Au(III). Copper(I) and silver(II) are also relatively well-known. Roentgenium is therefore expected to predominantly form a stable +III state.ChemistryThe heavier members of this group are well known for their lack of reactivity or noble character. Silver and gold are both inert to oxygen. They are both however attacked by the halogens. In addition, silver is attacked by sulfur and hydrogen sulfide, highlighting its higher reactivity compared to gold. Roentgenium is expected to be even more noble than gold and can be expected to be inert to oxygen and halogens. The most-likely reaction is with fluorine to form a trifluoride, RgF3.History of synthesis of isotopes by cold fusion&lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi(&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Ni,xn)&lt;sup&gt;273−x&lt;/sup&gt;Rg (x=1)First experiments to synthesize element 111 were performed by the Dubna team in 1986 using this cold fusion reaction. No atoms were identified that could be assigned to atoms of element 111 and a production cross-section limit of 4 pb was determined. After an upgrade of their facilities, the team at GSI successfully detected 3 atoms of 272Rg in their discovery experiment. A further 3 atoms were synthesized in 2000. The discovery of roentgenium was confirmed in 2003 when a team at RIKEN measured the decays of 14 atoms of 272Rg during the measurement of the 1n excitation function.&quot;Status of heavy element research using GARIS at RIKEN&quot;, Morita et al., Nucl.

The longest-lived of these is 280Rg, which decays through alpha decay and has a halflife of 3.6 seconds. The shortest-lived isotope is 272Rg, which decays through alpha decay and has a halflife of 1.6 ms.Isomerism in roentgenium nuclides&lt;sup&gt;274&lt;/sup&gt;RgTwo atoms of 274Rg have been observed in the decay chains starting with 278Uut. The two events occur with different energies and with different lifetimes. In addition, the two entire decay chains appear to be different. This suggests the presence of two isomeric levels but further research is required.&lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;RgThe direct production of 272Rg has provided four alpha lines at 11.37, 11.03, 10.82, and 10.40 MeV. The GSI measured a half-life of 1.6 ms whilst recent data from RIKEN has given a half-life of 3.8 ms. The conflicting data may be due to isomeric levels but the current data are insufficient to come to any firm assignments.Future experimentsTo date there has been no attempt to synthesise roentgenium in hot fusion reactions. It has been mentioned by the Dubna team that they could complete their Ca-48 projectile program by studying the reactionPa + Ca → Rg → RgReferencesSee alsoIsland of stabilityExternal linksWebElements.com: Roentgenium[http://iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/corish_311004.html IUPAC: Proposal of name roentgenium for element 111]IUPAC: Element 111 is named roentgeniumApsidium: Roentgenium 111Unununium Element At Chemicalelements.com Category:1994 in science Category:Chemical elements Category:Transition metals Category:Synthetic elementsar:رونتجينيوم bn:রোয়েন্টজেনিয়াম be:Рэнтгеній bs:Rentgenijum ca:Roentgueni cs:Roentgenium co:Roentgeniu da:Røntgenium de:Roentgenium et:Röntgeenium el:Ρεντγκένιο es:Roentgenio eo:Rentgenio eu:Roentgenio fa:رونتگنیوم fr:Roentgenium fur:Roentgjeni gv:Roentgenium gl:Roentgenio ko:뢴트게늄 hr:Roentgenij it:Roentgenio he:רנטגניום jv:Roentgenium sw:Roentgeni ku:Ûnûnûnyûm la:Roentgenium lb:Roentgenium lt:Rentgenis hu:Roentgenium ml:റോണ്ട്ഗെനിയം nl:Roentgenium ja:レントゲニウム no:Røntgenium nn:Roentgenium nds:Roentgenium pl:Roentgen (pierwiastek) pt:Roentgênio ru:Рентгений scn:Roentgeniu simple:Roentgenium sk:Roentgenium sr:Рентгенијум sh:Rentgenijum fi:Röntgenium sv:Röntgenium th:เรินต์เกเนียม tr:Röntgenyum uk:Рентгеній ur:Roentgenium zh:錀
