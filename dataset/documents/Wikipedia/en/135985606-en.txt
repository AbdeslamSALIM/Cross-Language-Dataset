Although it was intended to be a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane in the interceptor role, the Typhoon underwent a long gestation period, eventually evolving into one of the Second World War's most successful ground-attack aircraft. In RAF slang, the Typhoon was nicknamed the Tiffy.Design and developmentEven before the new Hurricane was rolling off the production lines in March 1937, Sydney Camm had moved on to designing its future replacement as a private project. This was to be a massive plane designed around the equally massive Napier Sabre engine. The work proved useful when Hawker received [[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1930-1939|specification F.18/37]] in January 1938 from the Air Ministry, which asked for a fighter based around either the Napier Sabre or the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine. The engines were similar in that they were both 24 cylinder designs that were designed to deliver over 2,000 hp (1.5 MW); the difference between the two being, primarily, in the arrangement of the cylinders — an H-block in the Sabre and an X-block in the Vulture.The two resulting models became known as the "R" and "N" (based on the engine manufacturer) and were very similar—the Vulture-powered R plane (the Tornado) had a rounder nose profile and a ventral radiator, whereas the Sabre-powered N (the Typhoon) had a flatter deck and a chin mounted radiator. The basic design of both continued the Hawker tradition of using "older" construction techniques; the front fuselage was welded steel just like the Hurricane, and the design used a massive 40 foot (12 m) wing that was much thicker than those on designs like the Spitfire. Camm did give in to the times for much of the rest of the plane though; it was semi-monocoque from the cockpit rearward, flush riveted, and had wide-set landing gear. Instead of a sliding or lifting canopy the Typhoon was first produced with a side door.Summary of Technical ChangesAs a front line Second World War RAF aircraft the Typhoon was a rarity in that it only appeared as a Mark I. However the Typhoon was modified and updated regularly, so that a 1945 production machine looked quite different from one built in 1942. After D-Day, as Typhoon attrition increased, a number of older aircraft were taken out of storage and overhauled. It was possible to find old R7771, a Typhoon first built in 1942 with "car-door" canopy, unfaired cannon etc. reappearing in front line service (on 182 Sqn.) in February 1945 with a clear-view "bubble" hood, rocket rails and other late series features.Note:R7771 is listed as being shot down by flak on 28 February 1945. W/O F.W. Cuthbertson was killed.  The most important and visible changes are listed: Bentley 1975From mid to late 1941 the solid metal aft canopy fairing was replaced with a transparent structure. The pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape; the side cut-outs were fitted with armour-glass. This applied from the 163rd production Typhoon R7803. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified.Longer exhaust stubs fitted in November 1941.Portside (left) cockpit doors were sealed shut in November 1941. Both modifications were made in an attempt to alleviate the problem of carbon monoxide seepage into the cockpit.12 x .303 Brownings (Typhoon Ia) superseded by 4 x Hispano 20mm cannon (Typhoon IB).A steel strap was fitted internally across the rear fuselage transport joint in September 1942. This was a temporary measure, superseded by Mod 286.Mod 286; 20 alloy "fishplates" were riveted externally across the rear fuselage transport joint. This was a permanent measure designed to stop in-flight rear fuselage structural failures. From December 1942 through to March 1943 all Typhoons without this modification were taken out of service and modified. Introduced on production line from 820th production aircraft EJ902.[[Image:Typhoonnew.jpg|right|thumb|A Charles E Brown photo of EK286 "Fiji V, Morris Headstrom Fiji" a brand new presentation aircraft, at Gloster's Hucclecote airfield, April 1943.

This was also designed to alleviate rear fuselage failure due to harmonic vibration failure of the bracket holding the weight assembly.Replacement of external mass balance weights on the rudder by an internal mass balance weight on a slightly redesigned rudder. Mid-1942.Removable fairings over the cannon barrels were fitted.Fitting of bomb racks capable of carrying 500 lb bombs from October 1942. First used by 181 Squadron. By mid-1943, all Typhoons off the production line were capable of carrying bombs.Bigger, solid rubber, grooved "anti-shimmy" tail wheel tyres were introduced in March 1943 on all Typhoons from EK238 (1,001st production). The new tyres helped to make heavier, bomb-laden Typhoons more manageable during ground manoeuvres.Small extensions on cannon shell case ejector slots. These allowed the casings to clear bombs or drop tanks suspended from the wing racks.Reinforced mainwheels. Openings smaller than earlier wheels and flatter, thicker "spokes."Bigger brake discs. Originally only on "Bombphoons"; eventually all Typhoons used these brakes.Rear view mirror in perspex blister on "car-door" canopy roof. This was not very successful; the mirror was prone to vibration.The gun camera was moved from the leading edge of the outer port wing to the starboard engine bearers, sighting through an opening in the lower engine cowling. The new location was prone to engine vibration but, because the film was still usable, the camera stayed.Exhaust fairings were fitted in mid-1943. These were soon discarded when they were found to be of little benefit to aircraft performance, plus they complicated maintenance.Aerial mast through the rear canopy structure was replaced by a "whip" aerial on the rear fuselage on late "car-door" Typhoons.Wings plumbed and adapted to carry cylindrical 45-gallon drop tanks from early 1943.. Note the bomb rack under the wing. Rows of 5 gallon jerrycans dominate the foreground]]The "car-door" canopy structure was replaced by a clear, one piece sliding "bubble" canopy from mid-1943. Many Typhoons were retrofitted with the new canopies. The first modified Typhoon R8843 DJ-S was flown by New Zealander Wing Commander Desmond J. Scott, C/O of the Tangmere Wing from September 1943.Des Scott Gp Capt Desmond J. Scott, OBE, DSO, DFC and bar also two Croix de guerre (France and Belgium) and Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau From November 1943, all production aircraft, starting with JR333 were so fitted. With the new canopy the pilot's head armour was reshaped and the identification light seen behind the aerial mast structure on "car-door" canopy aircraft was removed. In addition two small, rear opening vents were added below the port side radio hatch, just below the canopy. A small round window on the lower, forward, left side cockpit access panel was omitted.Tailplane tip to fuselage IFF aerials were replaced by a "bayonet" aerial under the wing's centre section.Steel "Mark I" rocket rails introduced: these were first fitted to production aircraft of 181 Sqn. in October 1943. Aluminium "Mark III" rails were used starting in December 1944.The transparent landing light covers on the wing leading edges were discarded on all rocket equipped aircraft, and replaced with metal fairings. Eventually all production Typhoons were manufactured without the lights.A Rebecca transponder unit was fitted in 1944, with the associated aerial appearing under the centre section.A Four-blade propeller unit (de Havilland or Rotol) was introduced from early 1944.Larger Tempest tailplanes were fitted from June 1944 on. Originally they were only used on "Bombphoons" which were able to be cleared to carry 1,000 lb bombs. Starting in the MN production series all Typhoons had the larger tail unit.Note: There were some initial problems experienced with the four bladed propellers leaking oil. Air Ministry correspondenceRetrieved: 20 February 2008.After D-Day, once Typhoons started operating from forward landing grounds in Normandy, it was found that the dust clouds which were stirred up by propeller wash contained hard materials which were damaging the Sabre engines. An urgent modification, fitted to all Typhoons within a week, was a mushroom shaped filter which covered the air intake in the centre of the radiator. These "mushroom" filters, which could become red-hot, had a habit of being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were replaced by drum shaped filters which had "cuckoo clock" doors in front.A small, elongated oval static port appeared on the rear starboard fuselage in late 1944. This was apparently used to more accurately measure the aircraft altitude.Throughout its service life the Typhoon suffered a high frequency vibration of the airframe while in flight, such that pilots reported that touching the cockpit walls was akin to receiving a mild electric shock. Although not dangerous, it was uncomfortable and a specially sprung seat was designed and fitted. This vibration was alleviated to some extent with the introduction of the four-bladed propeller.aerial, no landing lights.]]One Typhoon, R8694, was used by Napiers for trials with an annular radiator: this aircraft was also fitted with a four-bladed propeller.Mason 1991Napier Power HeritageTyphoon carrier fighterIn 1941 Hawker tendered the Hawker P.1009 "Fleet Fighter" in response to [[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1930-1939|specification N.11/40]] for a carrier based fighter. A new centre section was to be fitted, extending the wingspan to over 45 feet: the wings themselves were to swing and fold parallel to the fuselage with the leading edges pointing upwards. The rear fuselage was to be longer and a vee arrestor hook and associated catapult gear was to be fitted. The design chosen was to eventuate as the Blackburn Firebrand.Operational serviceThe R version first flew in October 1939, and the RAF was so impressed they ordered 1,000 as the Tornado. In February 1940, the first N model, now known as the Typhoon, was delivered. The RAF placed a large order for it as well, but moved production to Gloster Aircraft (part of the Hawker Siddeley group), who had no designs to produce at the time. The Typhoon was soon demonstrating problems, including vibrations from the engine causing the wing skinning to peel.Eventually the RAF postponed production plans on both models in May 1940 so that Hawker could concentrate solely on the Hurricane during the Battle of Britain. This was the design's first brush with cancellation. Some small-scale work continued with changes to streamline the fuselage and incorporating a much thinner wing were looked at, as well as alternate engines in the form of large radials. In October, pressure on the RAF eased and work was allowed to continue on the two original designs.The Tornado was cancelled in 1941, with no more than four being built. However the Typhoon had "good enough" performance to warrant production. It soon became clear that as a replacement for the Spitfire the Typhoon was a failure. Performance above 20,000 feet deteriorated rapidly and climb rate was disappointing. Manoeuvreability was also considered to be below par. However, at lower altitudes the Typhoon was fast and stable and showed itself to be a good gun platform. Still, the Typhoon faced cancellation until the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 made its debut in late 1941. [[Image:Hawker Typhoon MkIB.jpg|left|thumb|''EK183'' US-A of 56 Sqn. was a "car-door" Typhoon with the perspex blister and mirror, and has the small tyred tailwheel. The black and white underwing stripes were used to identify Typhoons to friendly forces, as were the yellow stripes on the leading edges.]] The Spitfire Vs, with which the bulk of Fighter Command squadrons were equipped, were outclassed in combat with the new Luftwaffe fighter and suffering heavy losses, with the result that the Typhoon was rushed into squadron service (with Nos. 56 and 609 Squadrons) in an attempt to counter the Fw 190. This decision proved to be a disaster, and several Typhoons were lost to mysterious causes. Once again there was talk of killing the Typhoon.In-flight tail failure was eventually identified, albeit only because one pilot managed to survive and return to tell his story. The problem was found to be caused by fatigue failure of the elevator mass-balance, allowing elevator-flutter to occur which was at its greatest when pulling out of a dive. Diving out of combat was the favourite escape manoeuvre for the Fw 190, which had a distinct speed advantage over the Spitfire. Against the heavy, fast diving Typhoon this manoeuvre should have proved deadly for the Fw pilots, but flutter problems turned the tables.As a "temporary" measure, rectangular strengthening "fishplates" were riveted around the fuselage/empennage joint, the site of the failures.  T.H.V Pheloung (Oamaru, New Zealand) April 1943. Note: On 20 June 1943, Sqn Ldr Pheloung flying EK184, US-C, was hit by flak and crashed into the sea while attacking shipping. An 18 inch wide yellow recognition stripe is visible on the upper wing.]] These fishplates remained a feature on all subsequent Typhoons. Problems with leakage of exhaust fumes into the cockpit and subsequent high carbon monoxide levels also meant Typhoon pilots had to use oxygen from take-off to landing. Vents were later added to the fuselage sides which, added to the new canopy, helped evacuate the fumes, although pilots continued to wear their masks as a precaution through to the end of the war. Cockpit temperatures were very high and eventually an air- ventilation tube was added.Note: In April 1943 F/L A.O. Moffet of the RAE Farnborough was attached to 486(NZ) Sqn. in response to complaints about the overheated cockpits of the Typhoons. For a fortnight "Moff" flew operationally with the unit: his report can be found in That Nothing Failed Them. His tests showed that the cockpit temperatures could reach 135 degrees F.Sortehaug 1998 Wheeler 1963, p. 80-86. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather where it was very difficult to start. Due to the efforts of operational pilots like S/L Roland Beamont (609 Squadron), the Typhoon continued under development despite these design drawbacks.During late 1942 and early 1943, the Typhoon Squadrons on the South Coast were finally effective in countering the Luftwaffe's "tip and run" low-level nuisance raids, shooting down a score or more fighter-bomber Fw 190s. The first two Messerschmitt Me 210 fighter-bombers to be destroyed over the British Isles fell to the guns of Typhoons in late 1942, and during a daylight raid by the Luftwaffe on London on 20 January 1943, five Fw 190s were destroyed by Typhoons.As soon as the aircraft entered service it was immediately apparent the profile of the Typhoon resembled a Fw190 from some angles, and this similarity caused more than one "friendly fire" incident with Allied anti-aircraft units and other fighters. This led to Typhoons being marked up with high visibility black and white stripes under the wings; a precursor of the marking applied to all Allied aircraft on D-Day.It was not until 1943 that the various problems with the airframe and engine had finally started to be worked out of the system. By this time the need for a pure fighter was no longer important and the design was converted into a fighter-bomber, much like the Hurricane had before it. The powerful engine allowed the plane to carry a massive load of (eventually) up to two 1,000 lb (450 kg) bombs, equal to the light bombers of only a few years earlier. The bomb-equipped aircraft were nicknamed, "Bombphoons", and entered service with No. 181 Squadron, formed in September 1942.  Armed with four "60 lb" RP-3 rockets under each wing, the Typhoon would however become much more famous — the so-called "Rocketphoons." In October 1943, No. 181 Squadron made the first Typhoon rocket strikes. Although the rocket projectiles were inaccurate and took some considerable skill to aim properly and allow for the drop after firing, the sheer firepower of just one Typhoon was equivalent to a destroyer's broadside. The top speed of the Typhoon was reduced by some 15 mph by the non-jettisionable rocket rails. By the end of 1943, 18 rocket-equipped Typhoon squadrons formed the basis of the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force ground attack arm in Europe.Inaccuracy notwithstanding, the rockets (backed by the Typhoon's four 20 mm cannon) proved highly effective against many targets, such as unarmoured "soft-skinned" vehicles, road transport, trains and small sea craft. Although great things were expected against the heavily armoured tanks of the Wehrmacht, the rockets needed to hit the thin-walled engine compartment or the tank's tracks to really have any destructive effect. Analysis of destroyed tanks after the Normandy battle showed a "hit-rate" for the air-fired rockets of only 4%.Shores and Thomas 2005, pp. 240–250.The Mk IB (by late 1943 modified with a four-blade propeller and teardrop perspex canopy) nevertheless distinguished itself during 1944 and in the Battle of Normandy.By D-Day, in June 1944, the RAF had 26 operational squadrons of Typhoon IBs. The aircraft proved itself to be the most effective RAF tactical strike aircraft, both on interdiction raids against communications and transport targets deep in North Western Europe prior to the invasion, and in direct support of the Allied ground forces after D-Day.

A heavy dust cloud has been stirred up by the taxiing aircraft.]] A system of close liaison with the ground troops was set up by the RAF and army: RAF radio operators in vehicles equipped with VHF R/T travelled with the troops, often close to the front line. In situations where air support was needed they were able to call up Typhoons operating in a "Cab Rank", which then continuously attacked the targets marked for them (usually smoke shells fired by mortar or artillery) until they were destroyed.On 7 August, the German counter-attack at Mortain, threatening Patton's breakout from the beachhead, was repulsed by 2nd TAF Typhoons, some 81 vehicles destroyed or damaged. In the Vire area, where the British Army was under attack, Typhoons flew 294 sorties on one day, with 2,088 rockets and 80 tons of bombs dispatched. On 24 October 1944, No. 146 Wing of Typhoons attacked a building in Dordrecht where senior German 15th Army staff were meeting; 17 staff officers and 55 other officers were killed.For use in the tactical reconnaissance role, the Typhoon FR IB was developed in early 1944. In this version the port inner cannon was removed and three F.24 (one forward facing 14 inch and two vertical five inch) cameras were carried in its place. Later, when it was found that the missing cannon caused a yaw during firing (the recoil of two cannon on the starboard wing wasn't properly balanced by the single cannon to port), the starboard inner cannon was also removed from some aircraft. Because of the inherent airframe vibration the photographs produced were usually sub-standard. After some service with 268 Squadron from July 1944, the FR IB was phased out in January 1945.In 1943 one Typhoon was converted as a prototype night fighter, the NF Mk IB. R7881 was fitted with A.I. (Airborne Interception, i.e., radar) equipment, special night-flying cockpit and other modifications. Also in 1943, five Typhoons, R8889, R8891, R8925 and DN323 and EJ906 were modified to "Tropical" standard with the fitting of an air filter in a fairing behind the main radiator housing. R8891, DN323 and EJ906 were trialled in Egypt by 451(RAAF) Squadron during 1943.  On 3 May 1945, the Cap Arcona, the Thielbek and the Deutschland were sunk in four separate attacks by RAF Hawker Typhoon 1Bs of 83 Group, 2nd Tactical Air Force: the first by 184 Squadron based in Hustedt, the second by 198 Squadron based in Plantlünne led by Wing Commander John Robert Baldwin, the third by 263 Squadron based in RAF Ahlhorn (Großenkneten) led by Squadron Leader Martin T.S. Rumbold and the fourth by 197 Squadron led by Squadron Leader K.J. Harding based in RAF Ahlhorn.Cap Arcona WrecksiteRetrieved: 5 August 2008The top scoring Typhoon aceNote: An "Ace" is a pilot who shot down five or more enemy aircraft. was Group Captain John Robert Baldwin (609 Squadron and Commanding Officer 198 Squadron, 146(Typhoon) Wing and 123(Typhoon) Wing), who claimed 15 aircraft shot down during 1942–44. Some 246 Axis aircraft were claimed by Typhoon pilots during the war.Thomas 1999Production of the Typhoon, almost entirely by Gloster, was 3,330 machines.Hawker developed an improved version of the Typhoon, the Typhoon II but the differences between it and the Mk I were so great that it was effectively a different plane, the Hawker Tempest.Once the war in Europe was over the RAF was quick to remove the aircraft from front-line squadrons; by mid-1946 the Typhoon was no longer in use as an operational aircraft, with many of the wartime Typhoon units (eg: 198 Squadron) either being disbanded or renumbered.Captured TyphoonsBy 1943, with its change of role to ground attack, the Typhoon was constantly operating over enemy territory: inevitably some flyable examples were to fall into German hands. ; The first Typhoon to be flown by the Luftwaffe was EJ956 SA-I of 486(NZ) Sqn. On 23 March 1943 two aircraft flown by F/O Smith and F/S Mawson were on a "Rhubarb"A "Rhubarb" was a small scale attack on enemy ground targets of opportunity. Usually these were undertaken by a section of two aircraft. Ideally there would be a heavy cloud base at 2,000 to 3,000 ft (609 to 914 m): should fighter opposition be too heavy it would be possible to pull up into the cloud. over France. Just as they were crossing the coast at low altitude Mawson's Typhoon was hit by light flak. He managed to belly-land in a field near Cany-Barville but before he could destroy the aircraft it was surrounded by German troops. The Typhoon was repaired and test flown at Rechlin (a German equivalent to RAE Farnborough) and later served as T9+GK with "Zirkus Rosarius". EJ956 overturned and was written off during a forced landing near Meckelfield, 10 August 1944.Thomas and Shores 1988Sortehaug 1998. ; On 14 February 1944, another Typhoon was captured and later flown in Zirkus Rosarius. JP548 of 174 Squadron, force landed after engine failure near Marigny, France - the pilot, F/O Proddow evaded capture. This Typhoon crashed at Reinsehlen on 29 July 1944, killing Feldwebel Gold. ; A third unidentified Typhoon (possibly an aircraft of 1 Squadron) was also thought to have been flown by the Luftwaffe.Flying the TyphoonIn early March 1943 at Tangmere the then new Squadron Leader of 486(NZ) Squadron, Des Scott, flew a Typhoon for the first time: ;"At 1600 hours I was back at A Flight and surveying the cockpit of a Typhoon, which was like looking up at a second-story window. The small glasshouse, streamlined into the fuselage and directly behind the large engine of this seven-ton monster, was nine feet above ground. You climbed into it by placing the toes of your shoes into small covered recesses in the metal skin...""The 24 cylinders of the Napier Sabre engine were forced into life by what was known as a Koffman starter, which was itself motivated by a large shotgun-type cartridge. When fired, the expansion of this charge turned over the huge motor...If the engine did not come to life with the first explosion you could guarantee to have a fire in the large air intake...""The first thing I noticed was the Typhoon's poor forward visibility. Although my seat was hoisted to its maximum height I had to crab along in zigzag fashion...""With the control column hard back in my lap I opened the motor to 3,000 rpm to ensure all the plugs were cleaned after the slow revs.Note: The Napier Sabre had two spark plugs per cylinder, as did most of the aero engines of the time. The aircraft strained at the leash until I eased back to about quarter boost...""I let go the brakes and slowly pushed the boost lever until it reached the fully-open position. She bounded forward at a great rate and tried to swing slightly to starboard. This tendency was easily corrected by applying a little left rudder. Then we thundered down the runway as straight as an arrow before rocketing into the sky...""My Typhoon and I began our airborne association by climbing up to 15,000 ft, where I pulled her up straight onto her tail. After reaching her zenith she spun off quickly, and I was agreeably surprised when she recovered almost as soon as I had applied corrective action. To make sure she was not fooling me I again put her into a spin, and once more she recovered beautifully. We then headed earthwards in a vertical power dive. As the speedo needle was winding up towards the 450 mph mark, I pulled her up into a loop and rolled off the top. We did ever-increasing tight turns until she blacked me out. We slow-rolled and barrel-rolled as I thrashed her about the sky for a full half hour.""She roared, screamed, groaned and whined, but apart from being rather heavy on the controls at high speeds she came through her tests with flying colours...Applying a few degrees of flap we swung on down into the airfield approach, levelled out above the runway and softly eased down on to her two wheels, leaving her tail up until she dropped it of her own accord.""We were soon back in her bay by the dispersal hut, where I turned off the petrol supply cock. After a few moments she ran herself out and with a spit, sob and weary sigh, her great three-bladed propeller came to a stop. So that was it: I was drenched in perspiration and tired out..."Scott 1983, pp. 15–17.OperatorsSurvivorsOnly one complete Hawker Typhoon still survives - MN235 - and it is on display at the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London. It was previously on display at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) (Smithsonian Institute) before being presented to the museum in commemoration of the RAF's 50th Anniversary in exchange for a Hawker Hurricane. The Hawker Typhoon replica at the Memorial de la Paix, Caen (France) had been reconstructed from some original components.Typhoon Memorial SiteOn 9 June 1994, in recognition of the aircraft and crew's role in the liberation of Normandy, a Typhoon Memorial at Villers Bocage was dedicated by Major M. Roland Heudier. Also present at the ceremony were General Yves Paul Ezanno DFC and bar and Squadron Leader Denis Sweeting, both former Squadron Leaders of 198 Squadron.Typhoon MemorialSpecifications (Typhoon Mk Ib)See alsoReferencesNotesBibliographyBentley, Arthur L. &quot;Typhoon (article and drawings).&quot; Scale Models Magazine Vol. 6 No 74, November 1975.Clarke, R.M.
