A second Houston location was opened in 2000 in a building just off the South Loop, which had formerly housed a Target store. Right before Auchan had decided on a second location, there were 55 checkout stands.Auchan also tried opening a store in the Chicago market in 1989. The store was a large hypermarket in the suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois.

Faced with stiff competition from Wal-Mart, as well as local superstore chains Gigante and Comercial Mexicana, and French rival Carrefour (who also sold their stores and left the country in March 2005) , Auchan decided to sell their stores to Comercial Mexicana and withdrew from Mexico in early 2005.In 1997 Auchan sold its hypermarkets in Thailand to Groupe Casino.In 2007 Auchan sold its Argentine stores to Wal-Mart and retired from this country.Following a conflict with his Moroccan partner ONA, Auchan has sold its 49% in August 2007.ReferencesSee alsoList of French companiesExternal linksOfficial site in EnglishCategory:Companies established in 1961 Category:Companies_of_France Category:Companies of France Category:Retail companies of France Category:Supermarkets of France Category:Supermarkets of Romania Category:Supermarkets of Poland Category:Supermarkets of Portugal Category:Supermarkets of Russiade:Auchan es:Auchan fr:Auchan it:Auchan hu:Auchan nl:Auchan pl:Auchan pt:Auchan ro:Auchan ru:Auchan tr:Auchan uk:Auchan
