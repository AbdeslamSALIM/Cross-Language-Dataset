The area is considered to be semi-arid with approximately 14 inches (350 mm) of precipitation annually; however with its location in the "banana belt," Pueblo tends to get less snow than the other major cities in Colorado. Pueblo is the heart of the Pueblo Metropolitan Statistical Area and an important part of the Front Range Urban Corridor.. Many consider Pueblo to be the economic hub of southeastern Colorado and northern New Mexico. Because of this some people call Pueblo "Colorado's second city," although Pueblo is no longer the second largest city by population. Pueblo is one of the largest steel-producing cities in the United States, because of this Pueblo is referred to as the "Steel City." It is now home to a number of electronics and aviation companies.

Pueblo is also the home of Dutch Clark, the first man from Colorado in the NFL hall of fame. Pueblo's largest football stadium is named after him. At this stadium is where the oldest high school rivalry west of the Mississippi takes place, The Bell Game, which is played by The Pueblo Central Wildcats and the Pueblo Centennial Bulldogs.  Pueblo is the hometown of four Medal of Honor recipients - Drew D. Dix, Raymond G. Murphy, William J. Crawford, and Carl L. Sitter. President Dwight D. Eisenhower upon presenting Raymond G. "Jerry" Murphy with his Medal in 1953 commented, "What is it...something in the water out there in Pueblo? All you guys turn out to be heroes!". In 1993, The City Council adopted the tagline "Home of Heroes" because it can claim more recipients per capita than any other city in the United States. On July 1, 1993, the Congressional Record recognized Pueblo as the "Home of Heroes" (http://www.pueblo.org/homeofheroes/. There is a memorial to the recipients of the medal at the Pueblo Convention Center. Central High School is known as the "School of Heroes", as it is the alma mater of two recipients, Sitter and Crawford, more than any other high school in the country.in the United States by Child Magazine.Go Colorado article that mentions that Buell Children's Museum was ranked second in the United States in 2002]] Courthouse.]] Pueblo is the home to Colorado's largest single event, the Colorado State Fair, held annually in the late summer, and the largest parade, the state fair parade, as well as and an annual Chili Festival.The National Street Rod Association's Rocky Mountain Street Rod Nationals have been held in Pueblo for 23 years, and this is the region's largest and premier street rod event.The highways U.S. Highway 50 and Interstate 25 cross each other at Pueblo, possibly making it the second most important intersection in the state, after I-70 and I-25 in Denver.

Vestas just announced they will build the largest plant in the world that manufactures wind turbines at Pueblo's industrial park at close to 700,000 square feet. Also, AEHI along with other companies want to build a 21,000 acer energy park east of Pueblo and would be the largest of its kind in the U.S.A. It will include nuclear, solar, natural gas, wind turbines and hydroelectric power plants as well as manufacturing companies who want to be located next to major sources of power. The park will be called the Colorado Energy Park and the cost to build it will be close to 10 billion dollars. Here is a link to the Wall Street Journal article on it: http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/aehi-agrees-negotiate-contract-colorado/story.aspx?guid=%7B878490D1-F273-4B8B-A30D-50B21F77EC9F%7D&amp;dist=hpprHistory]] George Simpson, among other traders and trappers such as Mathew Kinkead, claimed to have helped construct the plaza that became known as El Pueblo or Fort Pueblo around 1842. George married Juana Maria Suaso and lived there for a year or two before moving; however, Simpson had no legal title to the land. The adobe structures were built with the intention of settlement and trade next to the Arkansas River, which then formed the U.S./Mexico border. About a dozen families lived there, trading with Native American tribes for hides, skins, livestock, as well as (later) cultivated plants, and liquor. Evidence of this trade, as well as other utilitarian goods, such as Native American pottery shards were found at the recently excavated site. According to accounts of residents who traded at the plaza (including that of George Simpson), the fort was raided sometime between December 23 and December 25, 1854, by Native American Ute Tribe and Jacarilla Apache tribes. They allegedly killed between fifteen and nineteen men, one woman, and captured two children. The trading post was abandoned after the raid, but it became important again between 1858 and 1859 during the Colorado Gold Rush of 1859..  The current city of Pueblo represents the consolidation of four towns: Pueblo (incorporated 1870), South Pueblo (incorporated 1873), Central Pueblo (incorporated 1882), and Bessemer (incorporated 1886). Pueblo, South Pueblo, and Central Pueblo legally consolidated as the City of Pueblo between March 9 and April 6 of 1886. Bessemer joined Pueblo in 1894  .    The consolidated city was once a major economic and social center of Colorado, and was home to important early Colorado families the Thatchers, Ormans and Adams. Until a series of major floods culminated in the Great Flood of 1921, Pueblo was considered the 'Saddle-Making capital of the World'. Roughly one-third of Pueblo's downtown businesses were lost in this flood, along with a substantial number of buildings. Pueblo has long struggled to come to grips with this loss, and has only recently begun a resurgence in growth..  The economic situation of Pueblo was further exacerbated by the decline of American steel in the 1970s and 1980s, and Pueblo still actively seeks to diversify its economic base. The City features a river walk, extensive trail system, industrial park, and revitalized downtown area to this effect.The Steel MillThe main industry in Pueblo for most of its history was the Colorado Fuel and Iron (CF&I) steel mill on the south side of town. The steel-market crash of 1982 lead to the decline of the company. After going through several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by Oregon Steel Mills and recently changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. Since the acquisition, the company has been plagued with labor problems, mostly due to accusations of unfair labor practices. The problems culminated with a major strike in 1997, leading to most of the workforce being replaced.Of the many production and fabrication mills which once existed on the site, only the steel production (electric furnaces, used for scrap recycling), rail, rod, bar, and seamless tube mills are still in operation. The wire mill was sold in the late 1990s to Davis Wire, which still produces products such as fence and nails under the CF&I brand name.The facility operated blast furnaces until 1982, when the bottom fell out of the steel market. The main blast furnace structures were torn down in 1989, but due to asbestos content, many of the adjacent stoves still remain. The stoves and foundations for some of the furnaces can be easily seen from Interstate 25, which runs parallel to the plant's west boundary.Several of the administration buildings, including the main office building, dispensary, and tunnel gatehouse were purchased in 2003 by the Bessemer Historical Society. They are currently undergoing renovation. In addition to housing the historic CF&I Archives, the first phase of the project has been turned into the Steelworks Museum of Industry and Culture http://www.cfisteel.org.Presidential VisitsPresident Woodrow Wilson, on a speaking tour to gather support for the entry of the United States into the League of Nations, collapsed on September 25, 1919 following a speech in Pueblo. He suffered a stroke a week later which incapacitated him for the rest of his presidency.Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt, arrived at the Pueblo Union Depot in order to lay the first brick down for the Y.M.C.A. and check the water resources in Colorado.President George H.W. Bush (when he was Vice President) had come to the Pueblo Nature Center's Raptor Center to release an American Bald Eagle that had its wings healed.Other national leaders to visit Pueblo include President John F Kennedy, President William J. Clinton, Senator John F. Kerry, and Vice President Albert Gore.In the 2008 presidential campaign Pueblo has been visited by both Democratic nominee Senator Obama and Republican nominee Senator McCain. This is due to the fact that the state of Colorado is considered a key "battleground" state and Pueblo, as the democratic strong hold, a key city for Obama to win.The State HospitalHistorically the other major employer in Pueblo was the State Hospital, which formerly served the entire state. Established in 1879 as the Colorado State Insane Asylum it was known as the Colorado State Hospital after 1917. In 1991, the name was changed to the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP). Currently they are building a new Forensic Medium and Maximum Security center. This will be a new state-of-the-art 200-bed high security Forensic Institute. http://www.cdhs.state.co.us/cmhip/aboutus.htmEducationPueblo is home to Colorado State University-Pueblo (CSU-Pueblo), formerly the University of Southern Colorado and before that Southern Colorado State College.
