 Aster (syn. Diplopappus Cass.) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The genus once contained nearly 600 species in Eurasia and North America, but after morphologic and molecular research on the genus during the 1990s, it was decided that the North American species are better treated in a series of other genera. After this split there are roughly 180 species within the genus, all but one being confined to Eurasia.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''Aster'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word ''astron'', meaning &quot;star&quot;, arriving through the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''astrum'' with the same meaning, referring to the shape of the [[Inflorescence|flower head]]. Many species and a variety of hybrids and varieties are popular as garden plants because of their attractive and colourful flowers. ''Aster'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of a number of [[Lepidoptera]] species - see [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on Aster]]. Asters can grow in all hardiness zones.The genus Aster is now generally restricted to the Old World species, with Aster amellus being the type species of the genus, as well as of the family Asteraceae. The New World species have now been reclassified in the genera Almutaster, Canadanthus, Doellingeria, Eucephalus, Eurybia, Ionactis, Oligoneuron, Oreostemma, Sericocarpus and Symphyotrichum, though all are treated within the tribe Astereae. Regardless of the taxonomic change, all are still widely referred to as "asters" in the horticultural trades. See the List of Aster synonyms for more information.In the UK there are only two native members of the genus of which one, Goldilocks is very rare, the other being Aster tripolium, the Sea aster. Aster alpinus spp. vierhapperi is the only species native to North America.&lt;/ref&gt;Some common species are:Aster alpinus, Alpine AsterAster amellus, European Michaelmas Daisy or Italian AsterAster lateriflorus, Lady in BlackAster linosyris, Goldilocks AsterAster pringleiAster scaberAster sibiricusAster tataricus, Tatarian AsterAster tongolensisAster tripolium, Sea AsterSome common North American species that have now been moved are:Aster cordifolius (now Symphyotrichum cordifolium), Blue Wood AsterAster divaricatus (now Eurybia divaricata), White Wood AsterAster ericoides (now Symphyotrichum ericoides), Heath AsterAster laevis (now Symphyotrichum laeve), Smooth AsterAster novae-angliae (now Symphyotrichum novae-angliae), New England AsterAster novi-belgii (now Symphyotrichum novi-belgii), New York AsterAster pilosus (now Symphyotrichum pilosum), Frost AsterAster scopulorum (now Ionactis alpina), Lava AsterThe China aster is in a related genus, Callistephus.
