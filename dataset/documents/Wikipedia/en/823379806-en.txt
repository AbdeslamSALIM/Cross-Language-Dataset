Darmstadtium (), formerly known as Ununnilium, is a chemical element with the symbol Ds and atomic number 110.  This synthetic element is one of the so-called super-heavy atoms. It decays quickly: Heavier isotopes of darmstadtium have half-lives on the order of ten seconds.Official discoveryDarmstadtium was first created on November 9, 1994 at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Wixhausen, a northern suburb of Darmstadt, Germany by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg, under the direction of professor Sigurd Hofmann. Four atoms of it were detected by a nuclear fusion reaction caused by bombarding a lead-208 target with nickel-62 ions: &quot;Production and decay of &lt;sup&gt;269&lt;/sup&gt;110&quot;, Hofmann et al., Z. Phys. A., 1995, 350, 4. Retrieved on 2008-03-02Pb + Ni → Ds + nIn the same series of experiments, the same team also carried out the reaction using heavier nickel-64 ions. During two runs, 9 atoms of 271Ds were convincingly detected by correlation with known daughter decay properties: &quot;New elements-approaching Z=114&quot;, S.Hoffman, Rep. Prog.

Once recognized as discoverers, the team at GSI considered the names darmstadtium (Ds) and wixhausium (Wi) for element 110. They decided on the former and named the element after the city near the place of its discovery, Darmstadt and not the suburb Wixhausen itself. The new name was officially recommended by IUPAC on August 16, 2003.The element has also earned the nickname of policium, because the telephone number of the police is 110 within Germany.Electronic structureDarmstadtium is element 110 in the Periodic Table. The two forms of the projected electronic structure are:Bohr model: 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 17, 1Quantum mechanical model: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10 4p65s24d105p66s24f145d10 6p67s15f146d9Extrapolated chemical properties of eka-platinum/dvi-palladiumOxidation statesElement 110 is projected to be the eighth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group 10 in the Periodic Table, below nickel, palladium and platinum. The highest confirmed oxidation state of +VI is shown by platinum whilst the +IV state is stable for both elements. Both elements also possess a stable +II state. Darmstadtium is therefore predicted to show oxidation states +VI, +IV and +II.ChemistryHigh oxidation states are expected to become more stable as the group is descended, so darmstadtium is expected to form a stable hexafluoride, DsF6, in addition to DsF5 and DsF4. Halogenation should result in the formation of the tetrahalides, DsCl4, DsBr4 and DsI4.Like other Group 10 elements, darmstadtium can be expected to have notable hardness and catalytic properties.History of synthesis of isotopes by cold fusion&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb(&lt;sup&gt;64&lt;/sup&gt;Ni,xn)&lt;sup&gt;272-x&lt;/sup&gt;Ds (x=1)This reaction was first studied by scientists at GSI in 1986, without success.

Using the method of detection of spontaneous fission, they were unable to measure any SF activities and calculated a cross section limit of 1 pb for the decay mode. In three separate experiments between November 1997 and October 1998, the same team re-studied this reaction as part of their new 48Ca program on the synthesis of superheavy elements. Several SF activities with relatively long half-lives were detected and tentatively assigned to decay of the daughters 269Sg or 265Rf, with a cross section of 5 pb. These observations have not been confirmed and the results are taken as only an indication for the synthesis of darmstadtium in this reaction.&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th(&lt;sup&gt;44&lt;/sup&gt;Ca,xn)&lt;sup&gt;276-x&lt;/sup&gt;DsThis reaction was attempted in 1986 and 1987 by the Dubna team.

The most common and readily confirmed mode is SF with a half-life of 11 s. A much rarer and hitherto unconfirmed mode is alpha decay by emission of an 8.77 MeV alpha particle with an observed half-life of ~3.7 m. This decay is associated with a unique decay pathway from the parent nuclides and must be assigned to an isomeric level. The half-life suggests that it must be assigned to a meta-stable state but further research is required to confirm these reports.&lt;sup&gt;271&lt;/sup&gt;DsDecay data from the direct synthesis of 271Ds clearly indicates the presence of two alpha groups. The first has alpha lines at 10.74 and 10.69 MeV with a half-life of 1.63 ms. The other has a single alpha line at 10.71 MeV with a half-life of 69 ms. The first has been assigned to the ground state and the latter to an isomeric level. It has been suggested that the closeness of the alpha decay energies indicates that the isomeric level may decay primarily by delayed gamma emission to the ground state, resulting in an identical measured alpha energy and a combined half-life for the two processess.&lt;sup&gt;270&lt;/sup&gt;DsThe direct production of 270Ds has clearly identified two alpha groups belonging to two isomeric levels. The ground state decays into the ground state of 266Hs by emitting an 11.03 MeV alpha particle with a half-life of 0.10 ms. The isomeric level decays by alpha emission with alpha lines at 12.15,11.15 and 10.95 MeV with a half-life of 6 ms. The 12.15 MeV has been assigned as decay into the ground state of 266Hs indicating that this high spin K-isomer lies at 1.12 MeV above the ground state.Retracted isotopes&lt;sup&gt;280&lt;/sup&gt;DsThe first synthesis of element 114 resulted in two atoms assigned to 288114, decaying to the 280Ds which underwent spontaneous fission. The assignment was later changed to 289114 and the darmstadtium isotope to 281Ds. Hence, 280Ds is currently unknown.&lt;sup&gt;277&lt;/sup&gt;DsIn the claimed synthesis of 293118 in 1999, the isotope 277Ds was identified as decaying by 10.18 MeV alpha emission with a half-life of 3.0 ms. This claim was retracted in 2001 and thus this darmstadtium isotope is currently unknown or unconfirmed.see ununoctium&lt;sup&gt;273m&lt;/sup&gt;DsIn the synthesis of 277112 in 1996 by GSI (see ununbium), one decay chain proceeded via 273Ds which decayed by emission of a 9.73 MeV alpha particle with a lifetime of 170 ms. This would have been assigned to an isomeric level. This data could not be confirmed and thus this isotope is currently unknown or unconfirmed.&lt;sup&gt;272&lt;/sup&gt;DsIn the first attempt to synthesise element 110, a 10 ms SF activity was assigned to 272Ds in the reaction 232Th(44Ca,4n). Given current understanding regarding stability, this isotope has been retracted from the Table of Isotopes.Theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half live data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; It also predicts that the isotope 294110 would have alpha decay half life of the order of 311 years.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesSee alsoIsland of stabilityExternal linksDarmstadtium.comWebElements.com - DarmstadtiumIUPAC: Element 110 is named darmstadtiumApsidium - darmstadtium  Category:Chemical elements Category:Transition metals Category:Darmstadt Category:Synthetic elementsar:دارمشتاتيوم bn:ডারমস্টাডটিয়াম be:Дармштатый bs:Darmštatijum ca:Darmstadi cs:Darmstadtium co:Darmstadtiu da:Darmstadtium de:Darmstadtium et:Darmstadtium el:Νταρμστάντιο es:Darmstadtio eo:Darmŝtatio eu:Darmstadtio fa:دارمشتادیوم fr:Darmstadtium fur:Darmstadti gv:Darmstadtium gl:Darmstadtio ko:다름슈타튬 hr:Darmstadij it:Darmstadtio he:דרמשטטיום jv:Darmstadtium kn:ಡರ್ಮ್‌ಸ್ಟಾಡ್ಟಿಯಮ್ sw:Darmstadti ku:Darmstadtiyûm la:Darmstadtium lb:Darmstadtium lt:Darmštatis jbo:jinmrdarmctati hu:Darmstadtium ml:ഡാംഷ്റ്റാറ്റിയം nl:Darmstadtium ja:ダームスタチウム no:Darmstadtium nn:Darmstadtium pl:Darmsztadt pt:Darmstádio ro:Darmstadtiu ru:Дармштадтий sq:Darmstadtiumi scn:Darmstadtiu simple:Darmstadtium sk:Darmstadtium sl:Darmštatij sr:Дармштатијум sh:Darmštatijum fi:Darmstadtium sv:Darmstadtium th:ดาร์มสแทดเทียม tr:Darmstadtiyum uk:Дармштадтій zh:鐽
