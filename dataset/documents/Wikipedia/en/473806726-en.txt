 The University of Bologna (, UNIBO) is one of the oldest continually operating degree-granting universities in the world, and the second largest university in Italy. It was probably the first university founded in the western world (conventionally AD 1088, but the true date is uncertain) and since 2000, its motto has been Alma mater studiorum (Latin for "fostering mother of studies"). The university of Bologna received a charter from Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosuè Carducci traced the birth of the University back to 1088, making it arguably the longest-lived university in the West. The University of Bologna is historically notable for its teaching of canon and civil law, and is presently one of the most important universities in EuropeTHES — QS World University Rankings 2007.The University counts about 100,000 students in its 23 faculties. It has branch centers in Reggio nell'Emilia, Imola, Ravenna, Forlì, Cesena and Rimini and a branch center abroad in Buenos Aires.HistoryThe University of Bologna's history is one of great thinkers in science and the humanities, making it an indispensable point of reference in the panorama of European culture.The institution that we today call the University began to take shape in Bologna at the end of the 11th century, when masters of grammar, rhetoric and logic began to devote themselves to law, inspiring themselves of the Byzantine Justinian Code.The first recorded scholars were Pepone and Irnerius, the latter of whom was defined by the former as "lucerna iuris". In 1158, at the urging of four doctors (thought to be pupils at the University), Frederick I promulgated the Constitutio Habita, in which the University was legally declared a place where research could develop independently from any other power.In the 14th century, so-called "artists" — scholars of medicine, philosophy, arithmetic, astronomy, logic, rhetoric, and grammar — began to collaborate with the school of jurists. In 1364, the teaching of theology was instituted. Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca, Guido Guinizelli, Cino da Pistoia, Cecco d'Ascoli, Re Enzo, Salimbene da Parma and Coluccio Salutati all studied in Bologna., constructed in 1637 and situated in the Palazzo dell'Archiginnasio]] In the 15th century Greek and Hebrew studies were instituted, and in the 16th century those of "natural magic", which we would refer to as, "experimental sciences." The philosopher Pietro Pomponazzi upheld the study of the laws of nature against the traditionalist position of theology and philosophy. A representative figure of this period was Ulisse Aldrovandi, whose contributions ranged from pharmacopoeia to the study of animals, fossils, and marvels of nature which he collected and classified.In the 16th century Gaspare Tagliacozzi completed the first studies of plastic surgery.In the 17th century, which is thought of as the "golden era" of the University, medicine coincided with the teachings of Marcello Malpighi and students began to employ the microscope for anatomical research. By this time, the University's fame had spread throughout Europe and it was a destination for many illustrious guests. Famous scholars and students included Pico della Mirandola and Leon Battista Alberti, who devoted themselves to canon law; and Nicolaus Copernicus who began his astronomical observations while studying pontifical law. Paracelsus (aka Paracelso), Raymond of Peñafort, Albrecht Dürer, St. Carlo Borromeo, Torquato Tasso, and Carlo Goldoni all spent time at the University.With the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century, the University promoted scientific and technological development. In this period came the studies of Luigi Galvani who was one of the founders of modern electrotechnical studies (along with Alessandro Volta, Benjamin Franklin and Henry Cavendish). Following the establishment of the United Italian State came a period of great prosperity for the University in which the figures of Giovanni Capellini, Giosuè Carducci, Giovanni Pascoli, Augusto Righi, Federigo Enriques, Giacomo Ciamician, and Augusto Murri stand out.In 1888 the eighth centennial of the University was celebrated with a grand ceremony. Representatives from universities all over the world convened in Bologna to honour the "mother of universities," and celebrate their common roots and ideals of progress and tolerance.The University maintained its central position on the scene of global culture until the period between World War I and World War II. As its own influence declined and other universities came to prominence, Bologna was called upon to forge relationships with institutions in the most advanced countries to modernise and reinvigorate its activities. Among the many challenges which it has met with success, Bologna committed itself to the European dimension which has now led to adoption of the new university system.OrganizationThe primary objective of the faculties of the University of Bologna is to define, organise, and connect the academic activities of the degree courses. Corresponding to the defined scientific-disciplinary fields, the faculties are divided into one or more first-level degree courses which are followed by specialised degree courses.Higher education processes are being harmonised across the European Community. Nowadays the University offers 128 different "Laurea" or "Laurea breve" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by a similar number of "Laurea specialistica" specialised degrees (two years). However, some courses have maintained preceding rules of "Laurea specialistica europea", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine which requires six years of courses. After the "Laurea" one may attain 1st level Master. After "Laurea specialistica" and "Laurea specialistica europea" are attained, one may proceed to 2nd level Master, specialisation schools, or doctorates of research.Advanced School of Modern Languages for Interpreters and Translators — SSLMIT — ForlìFaculty of AgricultureFaculty of Architecture Aldo RossiFaculty of EconomicsFaculty of Economics — ForlìFaculty of Economics — RiminiFaculty of Education SciencesFaculty of EngineeringII Faculty of Engineering — Cesena/ForlìFaculty of Exercise and Sport SciencesFaculty of Foreign Languages and LiteratureFaculty of Industrial ChemistryFaculty of LawFaculty of Letters and PhilosophyFaculty of Mathematical, Physical and Natural SciencesFaculty of MedicineFaculty of PharmacyFaculty of Political SciencesFaculty of Political Sciences Roberto RuffilliFaculty of Preservation of the Cultural HeritageFaculty of PsychologyFaculty of Statistical SciencesFaculty of Veterinary MedicineNotable members of the University of Bologna11th centuryIrnerius12th centuryGratianPatriarch Heraclius of JerusalemStephen of TournaiBulgarusMartinus GosiaWilliam of Tyre13th centuryRambertino BuvalelliBettisia GozzadiniWilliam of SalicetoGuido Guinizelli14th centuryDante AlighieriManuel ChrysolorasFrancesco Petrarca (aka Petrarch)Coluccio Salutati15th centuryLeon Battista AlbertiNicolaus CopernicusGeorgius de DrohobyczAlbrecht DürerGiovanni Pico della Mirandola16th centuryGirolamo CardanoIgnazio DantiGirolamo MaggiGiovanni Antonio MaginiParacelsus17th centuryGiovanni CassiniUlisse AldrovandiMarcello Malpighi18th centuryLaura BassiMaria Gaetana AgnesiLuigi GalvaniCarlo Goldoni19th centuryGiosuè CarducciGiacomo CiamicianCamillo GolgiGiovanni PascoliPellegrino Rossi20th centuryUmberto EcoVincenzo BalzaniRomano ProdiAmelio GuizzardiAugusto RighiCarlo Rovelli21st centuryNotesPoints of interestOrto Botanico dell'Università di BolognaSee alsoCoimbra Group (a network of leading European universities)Utrecht NetworkBologna declarationBologna processList of Italian universitiesMedieval universityBolognaExternal linksUniversity of Bologna for foreign students on iAgora — reviews by former international students in Bologna on iAgoraUniversity of Bologna Website   Denunciation of corruption in Italian universities, with a report concerning the University of Bologna in particular, by former THES and The Guardian correspondent Domenico Pacitti  Category:Coimbra Group Bologna Bologna, University of Category:1088 establishments Category:Education in Bologna Category:Buildings and structures in Bologna Category:University of Bolognaar:جامعة بولونيا an:Unibersidat de Bolonia ast:Universidá de Bolonia zh-min-nan:Bologna Tāi-ha̍k ca:Universitat de Bolonya de:Universität Bologna et:Bologna ülikool es:Universidad de Bolonia eu:Bolognako Unibertsitatea fa:دانشگاه بولونیا fr:Université de Bologne fur:Universitât di Bologne ga:Ollscoil Bhologna gd:Oilthigh Bhologna gl:Universidade de Boloña ko:볼로냐 대학교 it:Università di Bologna he:אוניברסיטת בולוניה ka:ბოლონიის უნივერსიტეტი lt:Bolonijos universitetas nl:Universiteit van Bologna ja:ボローニャ大学 no:Universitetet i Bologna oc:Universitat de Bolonha pl:Uniwersytet Boloński pt:Universidade de Bolonha ru:Болонский университет simple:University of Bologna fi:Bolognan yliopisto sv:Universitetet i Bologna tr:Bolonya Üniversitesi uk:Болонський університет zh:博洛尼亚大学
