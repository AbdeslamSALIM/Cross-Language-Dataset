, a simple heterocyclic compound]]Heterocyclic compounds are organic compounds containing at least one atom of carbon, and at least one element other than carbon, such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen within a ring structure.  &lt;/ref&gt; These structures may comprise either [[simple aromatic ring]]s or non-aromatic rings. Some examples are [[pyridine]] (C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N), [[pyrimidine]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[dioxane]] (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).Note that compounds such as cyclopropane, an anaesthetic with explosive properties, and cyclohexane, a solvent, are not heterocyclic; they are merely cycloalkanes. The prefix 'cyclic' implies a ring structure, whereas 'hetero' refers to an atom other than carbon, as above. Many heterocyclic compounds, including some amines, are carcinogenic.Heterocyclic chemistry is the chemistry branch dealing exclusively with synthesis, properties, and applications of heterocycles.3-Membered ringsHeterocycles with three atoms in the ring are more reactive because of ring strain. Those containing one heteroatom are, in general, stable. Those with two heteroatoms are more likely to occur as reactive intermediates. Common 3-membered heterocycles are:HeteroatomSaturatedUnsaturatedNitrogenAziridineOxygenEthylene oxide (epoxides, oxiranes)OxireneSulfurThiirane (episulfides)4-Membered ringsHeteroatomSaturatedUnsaturatedNitrogenAzetidineOxygenOxetaneSulfurThietaneCompound with two sulfur heteroatoms include dithietane and dithiete.5-Membered ringsWith heterocycles containing five atoms, the unsaturated compounds are frequently more stable because of aromaticity.HeteroatomSaturatedUnsaturatedNitrogenTetrahydropyrrole (azolidine, pyrrolidine)Dihydropyrrole (pyrroline), PyrroleOxygenTetrahydrofuran (oxolane)Dihydrofuran, FuranSulfurTetrahydrothiophene (thiolane)Dihydrothiophene, ThiopheneArsenicArsoleA large group of 5-membered ring compounds with two heteroatoms are collectively called the azoles.

Research has shown that cooking certain meats at high temperatures creates chemicals that are not present in uncooked meats. For example, heterocyclic amines are the carcinogenic chemicals formed from the cooking of muscle meats such as beef, pork, fowl, and fish. HCAs form when amino acids and creatine (a chemical found in muscles) react at high cooking temperatures. Researchers have identified 17 different HCAs resulting from the cooking of muscle meats that may pose human cancer risk.&lt;/ref&gt; NCI's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics found a link between individuals with stomach cancer and the consumption of cooked meat, and other studies for colorectal, pancreatic, and breast cancer is associated with high intakes of well-done, fried, or barbecued meats. Other sources of protein (milk, eggs, tofu, and organ meats such as liver) have very little or no HCA content naturally or when cooked.ReferencesExternal linksNomenclature, IUPACHeterocyclic amines in cooked meat, US CDCList of known and probable carcinogens, American Cancer SocietyList of known carcinogens by the State of California, [[Proposition 65]] (more comprehensive)Heterocyclic compoundsar:حلقة غير متجانسة ca:Compost heterocíclic cs:Heterocyklické sloučeniny de:Heterocyclen es:Compuesto heterocíclico fr:Hétérocycle id:Senyawa heterosiklik it:Composto eterociclico he:תרכובת הטרוציקלית mk:Хетероциклично соединение nl:Heterocyclische verbinding ja:複素環式化合物 pl:Związki heterocykliczne pt:Composto heterocíclico ru:Гетероциклические соединения sk:Heterocyklická zlúčenina fi:Heterosyklinen yhdiste sv:Heterocykliska föreningar uk:Гетероциклічні сполуки zh:杂环化合物
