Oenology (BrE) or enology (AmE) is the science and study of all aspects of wine and winemaking from the grape harvest to bottle. An expert in the field of oenology is known as an oenologist.Oenology is usually not considered to include the study of vine growing and grape harvesting. This subfield of agricultural practice and science is called viticulture, which makes "viticulture & oenology" a common designation for training programmes and research centres which include both "outdoors" and "indoors" aspects of wine production.The name oenology is derived from Greek , oinos, "wine"; and , -logia.==See also== Glossary of wine termsViticultureAnnual growth cycle of grapevinesExternal linksViticulture and Enology at University of California DavisBibliography of basic current books about wine and winemaking, from the [[UC Davis] library]Viticulture and Enology at Washington State UniversityCategory:Oenologybs:Enologija ca:Enologia da:Ønologi de:Önologie et:Önoloogia es:Enología fr:Œnologie fur:Enologjie gl:Enoloxía hr:Enologija it:Enologia lb:Önologie mk:Енологија nl:Oenologie ja:ワイン学 no:Ønologi oc:Enologia pl:Enologia pt:Enologia ru:Энология sl:Enologija sr:Енологија fi:Enologia sv:Oenologi
