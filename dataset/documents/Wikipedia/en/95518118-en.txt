The current title sponsor is Liquigas, a provider of liquified gas products in Italy. In 2005 the team was co-title sponsored by Liquigas and Bianchi and was named Liquigas-Bianchi.The team was founded under the name Liquigas in 1999, and was long in the second division team, slowly making a name of itself. From 2005 the team was combined with Team Bianchi for the Pro Tour.In 2007 Cannondale replaced Bianchi as the bicycle sponsor. This marked Cannondale's return to the ProTour after discontinuing sponsorship of the Lampre-Caffita team at the end of the 2005 season.On 11 July 2008 the news broke from the french sports-paper L'Equipe that Spanish rider Manuel Beltrán tested positive for EPO after the first stage of the tour. It was blood abnormalities before the tour start that led France's Anti-Doping Agency to target the rider. According to AP a spokesperson for Liquigas comfirmed the same day that Beltrán was thrown off the tour. It's also reported that the police picked Beltrán up from his hotel where he stayed with the rest of the Liquigas team, as well as searching the rest of the hotel for more doping. The B-Sample has not yet been tested. Status2005 was a very exciting year for the team. Danilo Di Luca won Vuelta al País Vasco, and the one day classics Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne.
