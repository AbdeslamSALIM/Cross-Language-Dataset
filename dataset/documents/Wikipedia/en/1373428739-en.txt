The title is often applied erroneously to all officers of arms.Heralds were originally messengers sent by monarchs or noblemen to convey messages or proclamations. Like other officers of arms, a herald would often wear a surcoat, called a tabard, decorated with the coat of arms of his master. It was possibly due to their role in managing the tournaments of the Late Middle Ages that heralds came to be associated with the regulation of the knights' coats of arms. This science of heraldry became increasingly important and further regulated over the years, and in several countries around the world it is still overseen by heralds. Thus the primary job of a herald today is to be an expert in coats of arms. In the United Kingdom heralds are still called upon at times to read proclamations publicly; for which they still wear tabards emblazoned with the royal coat of arms. The given name Harold is also derived from this office of arms.There are active official heralds today in several countries, including the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, Canada, and the Republic of South Africa. In England and Scotland most heralds are full-time employees of the sovereign and are called "Heralds of Arms in Ordinary". Temporary appointments can be made of "Heralds of Arms Extraordinary". These are often appointed for a specific major state occasions, such as a coronation. In addition, the Canadian Heraldic Authority has created the position of "Herald of Arms Emeritus", with which to honor long-serving or distinguished heraldists. In Scotland, some Clan Chiefs, the heads of great noble houses, still appoint private officers of arms to handle cases of heraldic or genealogical importance of clan members, although these are usually pursuivants.English HeraldsEnglish Heralds of Arms in OrdinaryRichmond Herald of Arms in OrdinaryChester Herald of Arms in OrdinaryLancaster Herald of Arms in OrdinaryYork Herald of Arms in OrdinarySomerset Herald of Arms in OrdinaryWindsor Herald of Arms in OrdinaryEnglish Heralds of Arms ExtraordinaryArundel Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryBeaumont Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryMaltravers Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryNew Zealand Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryNorfolk Herald of Arms ExtraordinarySurrey Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryWales Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryScottish HeraldsScottish Heralds of Arms in OrdinaryAlbany Herald of Arms in OrdinaryIslay Herald of Arms in OrdinaryMarchmont Herald of Arms in OrdinaryRothesay Herald of Arms in OrdinaryRoss Herald of Arms in OrdinarySnowdoun Herald of Arms in OrdinaryScottish Heralds of Arms ExtraordinaryOrkney Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryCanadian HeraldsCanadian Heralds of Arms In OrdinaryChief Herald of CanadaAssiniboine Herald of Arms in OrdinaryAthabaska Herald of Arms in OrdinaryCoppermine Herald of Arms in OrdinaryFraser Herald of Arms in OrdinaryMiramichi Herald of Arms in OrdinarySaguenay Herald of Arms in OrdinarySaint-Laurent Herald of Arms in OrdinaryCanadian Heralds of Arms ExtraordinaryAlbion Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryCapilano Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryCowichan Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryDauphin Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryNiagara Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryRouge Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryCanadian Heralds of Arms EmeritusOutaouais Herald of Arms EmeritusRideau Herald of Arms EmeritusIndian Empire Herald of Arms ExtraordinaryDelhi Herald of Arms ExtraordinarySee alsoHeraldryOfficer of ArmsThe College of ArmsThe Court of the Lord LyonThe Canadian Heraldic AuthorityExternal linksThe Court of the Lord LyonThe College of ArmsThe Canadian Heraldic AuthorityThe Office of the Chief Herald of IrelandGenealogy &amp; Heraldry Bill, 2006 Introduced in the Irish Senate to provide a sound legislative basis for Ireland's heraldic authority.Category:Heraldry Category:Legal occupationscs:Herold da:Herold de:Herold et:Heerold es:Heraldo fr:Héraut it:Araldo he:כרוז lt:Heroldas hu:Herold nl:Heraut no:Herold pl:Herold pt:Arauto ru:Герольд sv:Härold
