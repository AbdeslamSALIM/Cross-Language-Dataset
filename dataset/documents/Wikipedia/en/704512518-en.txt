He holds the record for most goals scored in a single FIFA World Cup finals tournament, with thirteen in 1958. He has also scored the third most goals of any player in the World Cup finals overall, beaten only by: Gerd Müller who scored fourteen goals (in two World Cup tournaments) and Ronaldo who scored fifteen goals (in three World Cup tournaments). Although France did not win the 1958 World Cup, Fontaine became the second player, after Alcides Ghiggia, to score in every match of a World Cup.Though born in Marrakech, he moved to Casablanca where he attended the Lycée Lyautey.Fontaine began his amateur career at USM Casablanca, where he played from 1950 to 1953. Nice recruited him in 1953, and he went on to score 44 goals in three seasons for the club. In 1956, he moved on to Stade de Reims where he teamed up with Raymond Kopa, Kopa went to Real Madrid in 1958, Fontaine scored 121 goals in six seasons at the Stade de Reims. In total, Fontaine scored 165 goals in 200 matches in the Ligue 1, and twice won the championship; in 1958 and 1960.Wearing the blue shirt of France, Fontaine's statistics are even more impressive. On his debut with the team on December 17, 1953, Fontaine scored a hat trick as France defeated Luxembourg 8-0. In seven years, he scored 30 goals in 21 matches for the national team. However, Fontaine will best be remembered for his 1958 FIFA World Cup performance, where he scored 13 goals in just six matches—a feat which included putting four past the defending champions West Germany. This tally secured him the Golden Boot for that tournament.Fontaine played his last match in July 1962, being forced to retire early because of a recurring injury. He briefly managed the French national team in 1967, but was replaced after only two games, both friendlies that ended in defeats.He was named by Pelé as one of the 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was chosen as the best French player of the last 50 years by the French Football Federation in the UEFA Jubilee Awards in November 2003 http://www.uefa.com/uefa/news/Kind=256/newsId=130150.html.With Eugène N'Jo Léa he founded the National Union of Professional Football Players in 1961.Career statistics  |- |1950-51||rowspan="3"|Casablanca|||||||||||||||||||| |- |1951-52|||||||||||||||||||||| |- |1952-53||||||||||||||||||||||  |- |1953-54||rowspan="3"|Nice||rowspan="3"|Division 1||24||18|||||||||||||||| |- |1954-55||28||20|||||||||||||||| |- |1955-56||17||7|||||||||||||||| |- |1956-57||rowspan="6"|Stade Reims||rowspan="6"|Division 1||31||30|||||||||||||||| |- |1957-58||26||34|||||||||||||||| |- |1958-59||32||24|||||||||||||||| |- |1959-60||28||28|||||||||||||||| |- |1960-61||7||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1961-62||7||5|||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||| 200||166|||||||||||||||| |||||||||||||||||| |References and notes External linksUEFA.com - France's Golden PlayerProfile on French federation official siteStats at lequipe.fr       Category:UEFA Golden Players Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:French footballers Category:France international footballers Category:Foreign-born footballers who played for France Category:OGC Nice players Category:Stade de Reims players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:1958 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA 100 Category:French football managers Category:France national football team managers Category:Paris Saint-Germain managers Category:Légion d'honneur recipientsar:جاست فونتين ca:Just Fontaine de:Just Fontaine es:Just Fontaine fr:Just Fontaine gl:Just Fontaine ko:쥐스트 퐁텐 id:Just Fontaine it:Just Fontaine he:ז'יסט פונטיין nl:Just Fontaine ja:ジュスト・フォンテーヌ no:Just Fontaine pl:Just Fontaine pt:Just Fontaine ru:Фонтен, Жюст fi:Just Fontaine sv:Just Fontaine vi:Just Fontaine tr:Just Fontaine zh:朱斯特·方丹
