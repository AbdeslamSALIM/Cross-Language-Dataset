As a teen in the 80's, Harper began to play the slide guitar, mimicking the style of Robert Johnson, to contrast that of the then-popular heavy metal music. Next, Harper took up the Weissenborn to provide further distinction between his style and that of other blues musicians, including Johnson's.ibid, page 11 Harper broke out of the Inland Empire after being offered an invitation by Taj Mahal to tour with the artist. The 20 year-old Harper and the blues legend then recorded Follow the Drinking Ghour(d) and toured the fiftieth state.ibid, page 13CareerAs a young man, Harper recorded the LP Pleasure and Pain with fellow Folk guitarist Tom Freund.

This series of concerts saw the debut of a number of new songs, such as "Get It Like You Like It" and "Dressed In Black."In 2006, Harper released the double album Both Sides of the Gun which debuted at #7 on the Billboard charts.Harper finished a worldwide tour in support of the album in 2006, with support from Damian &quot;Jr. Gong&quot; Marley on the North American leg.Though uncredited, he appears briefly in the 2006 David Lynch film Inland Empire, alongside his wife Laura Dern.Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals recorded a new album, Lifeline, in Paris.
