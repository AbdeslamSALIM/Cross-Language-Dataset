thumb|right|Group logoIdentity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) was a political group in the European Parliament composed of 23 members from European parties variously described as right-wing and nationalist. A common political charter for the group was signed on 9 January 2007, and the group was formally recognized by Parliamentary president Josep Borrell at the start of the EP plenary session on 15 January.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following remarks made by ITS member [[Alessandra Mussolini]] that [[Romania]]n ITS members found insulting, the [[Greater Romania Party]] withdrew from the group disqualifying it as an official group. Hence, it formally ceased to exist on [[14 November]] [[2007]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://euobserver.com/9/25148 MEPs welcome fall of far-right group] EU Observer&lt;/ref&gt;HistoryTo form a political group in the European Parliament there needs to be 20 MEPs from six different states. The accession of Bulgaria and Romania brought into the European Parliament a number of new far right MEPs providing sufficient numbers to form a far right group. Incentives for forming a group are approximately 1 million euro in public funds and guaranteed seats on the committees of the European Parliament. There were concerns in other parties about public funds and influence going towards a group with such an ideology. Despite attempts to block the group's formation, it was formed on 15 January 2007. However other MEPs successfully blocked ITS from gaining positions on Parliamentary committees, including two vice-presidencies, despite normally being entitled to them.The largest component was France's National Front and its chairman in the Parliament, Bruno Gollnisch, was chair of the ITS group. The National Front had previous allied with other far right groups in the 1980s. British independent member, Ashley Mote, is currently in jail for benefit fraud. Following the Bulgarian European Parliament elections, the group gained two more Ataka MEPs, Slavcho Binev and Desislav Chukolov.The PRM announced on 8 November 2007 that it would withdraw its five members from the group on 12 November 2007 over comments made by Alessandra Mussolini over the expulsion of Romanian criminals from Italy in early November 2007, thus dooming the parliamentary group to falter less than a year after its creation.theparliament.com - Far-right group in EU parliament collapses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Andreas Mölzer stated in an interview with Die Presse that the group was searching for other MEPs who might join their group to save it.„Rechtsaußen-Fraktion“ nach Mussolini-Ausbruch vor Ende « DiePresse.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Other MEPs have already welcomed the prospect of the group's demiseBBC NEWS | Europe | EU far-right bloc faces collapse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; with Alyn Smith MEP stating that it "warms the heart" to watch them arguing amongst themselves.

Alessandra Mussolini described it as "more a technical than a political group ... We are mainly getting together out of necessity. Survival is only possible in a political group."The Romanian PRM leader stated that he favours a strong association and eventual EU membership for Turkey provided it settles the dispute regarding Cyprus and that the common ground for the new group is based exactly on the values the group's name suggests.Romanian OTV channel, January 10 2007MembershipThe membership of ITS while it existed between January and November 2007;Party and StateSeatsMEPBureau positionNational Front7Bruno GollnischChairmanCarl LangJean-Marie Le PenMarine Le PenFernand Le RachinelJean-Claude MartinezLydia SchenardiGreater Romania Party5Daniela BuruianăEugen MihăescuVice-chairmanViorica MoisucPetre PopeangăTreasurerCristian StănescuIndependentMircea CoşeaFlemish Interest3Philip ClaeysVice-chairmanKoenraad DillenFrank VanheckeNational Union Attack3Dimitar Stoyanov]]Member at large, representing AtakaSlavcho BinevDesislav ChukolovSocial Alternative1Alessandra MussoliniMember at large, representing ASTricolour Flame1Luca RomagnoliMember at large, representing FTFreedom Party]]1Andreas MölzerMember at large, representing FPÖIndependentUKIP]] for benefit fraud, currently in jail.Vice-chairmanSee alsoEuronatEuropean National FrontGroup of the European Right (1984-89)Technical Group of the European Right (1989-94)Pan-European identityReferencesExternal linksNew political group: Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty in Opening of the January plenary session - Welcome of Bulgarian and Romanian MEPs / Formation of a new political group, European Parliament News (2007-01-15)ArticlesKontakt.
