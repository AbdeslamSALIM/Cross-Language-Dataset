Located in Sławno County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999, it was previously a town in Koszalin Voivodeship (1950&ndash;1998).HistoryAlready in the 11th century a fortified place named Dirlov or Dirlovo existed on the site. The settlement received its city charter in 1312 under the Lübeck law. The town's German name was Rügenwalde and it was used until 1945. Later, after a short rule by Brandenburg, the town passed in 1347 to the duke Bogislaw V from the House of Pomerania dynasty, son-in-law of king Casimir III of Poland. In 1352 the construction of the castle began, and cooperation with Hansa was initiated, with the town becoming a full member in 1412. In 1382 Eric of Pomerania, later the king of Norway, Denmark and Sweden, was born in the town. After losing his thrones, he returned to his birthplace and began to expand his duchy and was buried at the St. Mary Church after his death in 1459. Another significant ruler was Bogislaw X (1454-1523).In 1497 and 1552 Darłówko and part of Darłowo was hit by great storms, which threw ships into the city center. In 1589, 1624, 1648, 1679 and 1722 fires damaged the town. The first lighthouse was built around the year 1715.After the death of the last Pomeranian Duke Bogislaw XIV in 1637 Brandenburg-Prussia inheritet parts of Pomerania, including Darłowo. The harbour of Darłówko was damaged by Russian troops throughout the Seven Years' War, but reconstructed by order of King Frederick II of Prussia in 1772. During the Napoleonic Wars its inhabitants found employment smuggling British goods to the continent. In 1871 the town, along with Prussia, became a part of unified German Empire and was connected to the railway - line in 1878. 289 inhabitants died throughout World War I.In last democratic elections March 5 1933 58.13% (Germany 44%) valid votes for NSDAP (data for the county) .Before the outbreak of World War I the town had about 6,000 inhabitants, before the outbreak of World War II about 8000. During World War II an important firing range operated near the town, on which some of the largest guns in history were tested: Schwerer Gustav and Mörser Karl. Adolf Hitler came to the town a number of times to observe these tests. In early 1945 5 556 individuals were evacuated by ships throughout the Operation Hannibal before Soviet Troops reached the town on March 7, 1945.After World War II, in accordance with the decisions of the Potsdam Conference, the remaining German population was expelled in 1946/47 and the town was given to Poland. Initially it was given the Polish name Dyrłów, and later Darłów, before changing to the current name.TriviaThe German name Rügenwalde was best known in Germany for the production of the Rügenwalder Teewurst in the town; after World War II the production was restarted in West Germany under the old name.Population1782: 2 255  1812: 3 136  1852: 5 060  1875: 5 174  1890: 5 296 (including 27 Catholics, 102 Jews) 1910: 5 978  1939: 8 392 Carlheinz Rosenow: Aus der Heimat Rügenwalde (Kreis Schlawe - Pommern) - Jahrbuch 1987.
