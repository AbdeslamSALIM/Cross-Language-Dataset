 A chair is a kind of furniture for sitting, consisting of a back, and sometimes arm rests, commonly for use by one person. Chairs also often have four legs to support the seat raised above the floor. Without back and arm rests it is called a stool. A chair that has a reclining back and an inclining footrest is a recliner; they are often hand operated. A chair for more than one person is a couch, sofa, settee, loveseat, or bench. A separate footrest for a chair is known as an ottoman, hassock or pouffe. A chair mounted in a vehicle or in a theater is simply called a seat. Chairs as furniture typically can be moved.The back often does not extend all the way to the seat to allow for ventilation. Likewise, the back and sometimes the seat are made of porous materials or have holes drilled in them for decoration and ventilation.The back may extend above the height of the head. There may be separate headrests. Headrests for seats in vehicles are important for preventing whiplash injuries to the neck when the vehicle is involved in a rear-end collision.History of the chairThe chair is of extreme antiquity. Although for many centuries and indeed for thousands of years it was an article of state and dignity rather than an article of ordinary use. "The chair" is still extensively used as the emblem of authority in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom and Canada, and in many other settings. Committees, boards of directors, and academic departments all have a 'chairperson'. Endowed professorships are referred to as chairs. It was not, in fact, until the 16th century that it became common anywhere. The chest, the bench and the stool were until then the ordinary seats of everyday life, and the number of chairs which have survived from an earlier date is exceedingly limited; most of such examples are of ecclesiastical or seigneurial origin. Our knowledge of the chairs of remote antiquity is derived almost entirely from monuments, sculpture and paintings. A few actual examples exist in the British Museum, in the Egyptian Museum at Cairo, and elsewhere.  In ancient Egypt chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. The earliest known form of Greek chair, going back to five or six centuries BCE, had a back but stood straight up, front and back. During Tang dynasty (618 - 907 AD), a higher seat first started to appear amongst the Chinese elite and their usage soon spread to all levels of society. By the 12th century seating on the floor was rare in China, unlike in other Asian countries where the custom continued, and the chair, or more commonly the stool, was used in the vast majority of houses throughout the country.In Europe, it was owing in great measure to the Renaissance that the chair ceased to be a privilege of state, and became a standard item of furniture whoever could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. We find almost at once that the chair began to change every few years to reflect the fashions of the hour.The 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal folding chairs, metal-legged chairs, the Slumber Chair, moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs. The recliner became a popular form, at least in part due to radio and television, and later a two-part. The modern movement of the 1960s produced new forms of chairs: the butterfly chair, bean bags, and the egg-shaped pod chair. Technological advances led to molded plywood and wood laminate chairs, as well as chairs made of leather or polymers. Mechanical technology incorporated into the chair enabled adjustable chairs, especially for office use. Motors embedded in the chair resulted in massage chairs.Design and ergonomicsin the Adirondack style is made of rough wood to give it a rustic look.]] Chair design considers intended usage, ergonomics (how comfortable it is for the occupant), as well as non-ergonomic functional requirements such as size, stack ability, fold ability, weight, durability, stain resistance and artistic design. Intended usage determines the desired seating position. "Task chairs", or any chair intended for people to work at a desk or table, including dining chairs, can only recline very slightly; otherwise the occupant is too far away from the desk or table. Dental chairs are necessarily reclined. Easy chairs for watching television or movies are somewhere in between depending on the height of the screen.Ergonomic design distributes the weight of the occupant to various parts of the body. A seat that is higher results in dangling feet and increased pressure on the underside of the knees ("popliteal fold"). It may also result in no weight on the feet which means more weight elsewhere. A lower seat may shift too much weight to the "seat bones" ("ischial tuberosities").[[Image:Aacomputerchair.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Computer Chair]]A reclining seat and back will shift weight to the occupant's back. This may be more comfortable for some in reducing weight on the seat area, but may be problematic for others who have bad backs. In general, if the occupant is suppose to sit for a long time, weight needs to be taken off the seat area and thus "easy" chairs intended for long periods of sitting are generally at least slightly reclined. However, reclining may not be suitable for chairs intended for work or eating at table. The back of the chair will support some of the weight of the occupant, reducing the weight on other parts of the body. In general, backrests come in three heights: Lower back backrests support only the lumbar region. Shoulder height backrests support the entire back and shoulders. Headrests support the head as well and are important in vehicles for preventing "whiplash" neck injuries in rear-end collisions where the head is jerked back suddenly. Reclining chairs typically have at least shoulder height backrests to shift weight to the shoulders instead of just the lower back.Some chairs have foot rests. A stool or other simple chair may have a simple straight or curved bar near the bottom for the sitter to place his/her feet on.A kneeling chair adds an additional body part, the knees, to support the weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of the weight of the occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests and/or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A hard wood chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported in the back of the seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.There may be cases where padding is not desirable. For example, in chairs that are intended primarily for outdoor use. Where padding is not desirable, contouring may be used instead. A contoured seat pan attempts to distribute weight without padding. By matching the shape of the occupant's buttocks, weight is distributed and maximum pressure is reduced.Actual chair dimensions are determined by measurements of the human body or anthropometric measurements. The two most relevant anthropometric measurement for chair design is the popliteal height and buttock popliteal length.For someone seated, the popliteal height is the distance from the underside of the foot to the underside of the thigh at the knees. It is sometimes called the "stool height." The term "sitting height" is reserved for the height to the top of the head when seated. For American men, the median popliteal height is 16.3 inches and for American women it is 15.0 incheshttp://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pot_anth.html. The popliteal height, after adjusting for heels, clothing and other issues is used to determine the height of the chair seat. Mass produced chairs are typically 17 inches high.For someone seated, the buttock popliteal length is the horizontal distance from the back most part of the buttocks to the back of the lower leg. This anthropometric measurement is used to determine the seat depth. Mass produced chairs are typically 38-43 cm deep.Additional anthropometric measurements may be relevant to designing a chair. Hip breadth is used for chair width and armrest width. Elbow rest height is used to determine the height of the armrests. The buttock-knee length is used to determine "leg room" between rows of chairs. "Seat pitch" is the distance between rows of seats. In some airplanes and stadiums the leg room (the seat pitch less the thickness of the seat at thigh level) is so small that it is sometimes insufficient for the average person.For adjustable chairs, such as an office chair, the aforementioned principles are applied in adjusting the chair to the individual occupant.===Armrests===  A chair may or may not have armrests; chairs with armrests are termed armchairs. In French, a distinction is made between fauteuil and chaise, the terms for chairs with and without armrests, respectively. If present, armrests will support part of the body weight through the arms if the arms are resting on the armrests. Armrests further have the function of making entry and exit from the chair easier (but from the side it becomes more difficult). Armrests should support the forearm and not the sensitive elbow area. Hence in some chair designs, the armrest is not continuous to the chair back, but is missing in the elbow area.A couch, bench, or other arrangement of seats next to each other may have arm rest at the sides and/or arm rests in between. The latter may be provided for comfort, but also for privacy e.g. in public transport and other public places, and to prevent lying on the bench. Arm rests reduce both desired and undesired proximity. A loveseat in particular, has no arm rest in between.See also seats in movie theaters, and pictures of benches with and without arm rests.Chair seatsChair seats vary widely in construction and may or may not match construction of the chair's back (backrest).Some systems include:Solid center seats where a solid material forms the chair seat.Solid wood, may or may not be shaped to human contours.Wood slats, often seen on outdoor chairsPadded leather, generally a flat wood base covered in padding and contained in soft leatherStuffed fabric, similar to padded leatherMetal seats of solid or open designMolded plasticStone, often marbleOpen center seats where a soft material is attached to the tops of chair legs or between stretchers to form the seat.Wicker, woven to provide a surface with give to itLeather, may be tooled with a designFabric, simple covering without supportTape, wide fabric tape woven into seat, seen in lawn chairs and some old chairsCaning, woven from rush, reed, rawhide, heavy paper, strong grasses, cattails to form the seat, often in elaborate patternsSplint, ash, oak or hickory strips are wovenMetal, Metal mesh or wire woven to form seatCoversChairs can include soft cover.Standards and specificationsDesign considerations for chairs have been codified into standards. ISO 9241, "Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals (VDTs) -- Part 5: Workstation layout and postural requirements" is the most common one for modern chair design.There are multiple specific standards for different types of chairs. Dental chairs are specified by ISO 6875. Bean bag chairs are specified by ANSI standard ASTM F1912-98http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ASTM+F1912%2D98. ISO 7174 specifies stability of rocking and tilting chairs. ASTM F1858-98 specifies plastic lawn chairs. ASTM E1822-02b defines the combustibility of chairs when they are stacked.The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (BIFMA)http://www.bifma.org defines BIFMA X5.1 for testing of commercial-grade chairs. It specifies things likehttp://www.lifetime.com/TablesAndChairs/bifma.pdf:chair back strength of 150 pounds (68 kg)chair stability if weight is transferred completely to the front or back legsleg strength of 75 pounds (34 kg) applied one inch (25 mm) from the bottom of the legseat strength of 225 pounds (102 kg) dropped from six inches (150 mm) above the seatseat cycle strength of 100,000 repetitions of 125 pounds (57 kg) dropped from 2 inches (50 mm) above the seatThe specification further defines heavier "proof" loads that chairs must withstand. Under these higher loads, the chair may be damaged, but it must not fail catastrophically.Large institutions that make bulk purchases will reference these standards within their own even more detailed criteria for purchase. http://www.tbpc.state.tx.us/spec_lib/425/specs/06-12a.html Governments will often issue standards for purchases by government agencies (e.g. Canada's Canadian General Standards Board CAN/CGSB 44.15M http://www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/detail?product_id=23061 on "Straight Stacking Chair, Steel" or CAN/CGSB 44.232-2002 on "Task Chairs for Office Work with Visual Display Terminal").AccessoriesIn place of a built-in footrest, some chairs come with a matching ottoman. An ottoman is a short stool intended to be used as a footrest but can sometimes be used as a stool. If matched to a glider, the ottoman may be mounted on swing arms so that the ottoman rocks back and forth with the main glider.A chair cover is a temporary fabric cover for a side chair. They are typically rented for formal events such as wedding receptions to increase the attractiveness of the chairs and decor. The chair covers may come with decorative chair ties, a ribbon to be tied as a bow behind the chair. Covers for sofas and couches are also available for homes with small children and pets. In the second half of 20th century, some people used custom clear plastic covers for expensive sofas and chairs to protect them.Chair pads are cushions for chairs. Some are decorative. In cars, they may be used to increase the height of the driver. Orthopedic backrests provide support for the back. Some manufacturers have patents on their designs and are recognized by medical associations as beneficialhttp://www.physiotherapy.ca/?WCE=C=47%7CK=223736http://www.cartalk.com/content/columns/Archive/1996/June/05.htmlhttp://www.chiroeco.com/article/1996/1996.php3?article=050696f2&amp;menu=050696. Car seats sometimes have built-in and adjustable lumbar supports.Chair mats are plastic mats meant to cover carpet. This allows chairs on wheels to roll easily over the carpet and it protects the carpet. They come in various shapes, some specifically sized to fit partially under a desk.Remote control bags can be draped over the arm of easy chairs or sofas and used to hold remote controls. They are counter-weighted so as to not slide off the arms under the weight of the remote control.English phrases relating to chairsA film or a story is said to keep you on the edge of your seat, if it is suspenseful or engaging.If you nearly fell off your chair, it was because you were very surprised.Activities that are likely to be made insignificant or undone by some future event are said to be like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.When English-speaking philosophers talk about the material world as opposed to ideas, their phrase is tables and chairs.An orchestra awards a musician a chair or seat based on ability. The best player will receive "first chair", or the "principal seat". However, it is also common for this position to be known as 'first stand', a reference to the portable lectern on which the musicians put their sheet music.Musical chairs is a common party game, and a colloquial expression to describe people shuffling from seat to seat, or around different locations.In American slang, to say someone has gotten "the chair" is to say that they have been executed by an electric chair.One who is extremely anxious is 'as nervous as a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs'.See also Bean bag chairChair bagCar seatCushionHistory of the chairElectric chair for information on chairs used in judicial executionsFoamLeatherLeisureList of chairs for an extended list of various chair types and makesLoungerPlastic chairRubber chairSeatingSoft chairSofa swivel chairSplat, the central vertical element of a wooden chair backThroneVelour coverSources and notesExternal linksErgonomics of sitting postures and seatingCategory:Chairsaf:Stoel ar:كرسي gn:Guapyha bn:চেয়ার be:Стул br:Kador bg:Стол ca:Cadira ceb:Silya cs:Židle da:Stol (møbel) de:Stuhl (Möbel) dv:ގޮނޑި es:Silla eo:Seĝo eu:Aulki fa:صندلی fr:Chaise gl:Cadeira (moble) ko:의자 hi:कुर्सी hr:Stolica ig:Oche id:Kursi is:Stóll it:Sedia he:כיסא lb:Stull lt:Kėdė lmo:Cadrega hu:Szék mk:Столица ms:Kerusi nah:Icpalli nl:Stoel nds-nl:Stool ja:椅子 no:Stol nn:Stol nrm:Tchaîse oc:Cadièra pl:Krzesło pt:Cadeira ro:Scaun qu:Tiyana ru:Стул scn:Sedda simple:Chair sk:Stolička sr:Столица fi:Tuoli sv:Stol tl:Upuan ta:கதிரை te:కుర్చీ chr:ᎦᏍᎩᎶ uk:Стілець vec:Caréga yi:שטול zh-yue:凳 bat-smg:Krieslos zh:椅
