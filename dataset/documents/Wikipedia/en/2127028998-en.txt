 Texas are a rock band from Glasgow, Scotland. They were founded by Johnny McElhone (formerly of the bands Altered Images and Hipsway) in 1986 and had their performing debut in March 1988 at Scotland's University of Dundee. They took their name from the 1984 Wim Wenders movie Paris, Texas. Their musical sound went from blues rock on their debut album Southside via the blue-eyed soul of White on Blonde to the disco pop of Red Book.HistoryTexas scored a UK hit in 1989 with their debut single "I Don't Want a Lover." This was taken from their debut album Southside, which went on to sell two million copies worldwide. The follow-up albums Mothers Heaven (1991) and Ricks Road (1993) were less successful and failed to provide the band with any further big hit singles in the UK. Although these albums sold well in France and Spain, this was not sufficient for the record company, meaning the band faced a lot of pressure with their fourth release. In the meantime Ellen DeGeneres had approached the band, and Sharleen Spiteri and Ally McErlaine flew to the U.S. to re-record a song from the third album, "So Called Friend," which went on to become the theme song to DeGeneres' US sitcom Ellen.In 1997 Texas came back with "Say What You Want"; this became their biggest hit single yet, peaking at #3. The album White on Blonde followed, entering at #1, where it would return a year later. Other hit singles from the album were "Halo," "Black Eyed Boy," and "Put Your Arms Around Me"; a reworking of "Say What You Want" with Method Man was released alongside album track "Insane."In 1998, Texas's song "Put Your Arms Around Me" was the lone vocal track for the Andy Tennant film, "Ever After - A Cinderella Story", starring Drew Barrymore.The band's fifth album, The Hush, was released in 1999 with the lead-off single "In Our Lifetime" which was a huge hit in the UK reaching number 4 and was included in the "Notting Hill" Soundtrack. This album went straight into the UK album charts at #1 like its predecessor. The second single, "Summer Son", became a massive hit across Europe reaching the Top 5 in the UK and France, also making #1 in Croatia and Lebanon, leading the album to become their best selling so far.In 2000, a greatest-hits album was released that included three new songs ("In Demand", "Inner Smile," and "Guitar Song"). The video for "In Demand" featured actor Alan Rickman, and in the video for the anthemic follow-up single, co-written by Gregg Alexander, Spiteri dressed up as Elvis Presley. "Inner Smile" was a big hit in Europe and was later featured prominently in the 2002 feature film Bend It Like Beckham. The song "Like Lovers (Holding On)" is featured during the ending credits of the animated feature film Titan A.E.In September 2002, Spiteri gave birth to her daughter Mysty Kyd. However, this did not prevent her from working on another album. Careful What You Wish For was released in late 2003 and was promoted by the lead single "Carnival Girl," which reached #9 in the UK. This was a very different style from previous singles and featured the rapper Kardinal Offishall. Unfortunately, many disliked this perceived change in direction, and although the album was more traditional pop, it sold far less than the previous three releases. A ballad, "I'll See It Through," was released at Christmas time, but by then the project was dead and buried.In the television show The Office, fictional character David Brent claims that Texas used to open for his band, "Foregone Conclusion," before he gave up music to manage the Slough office of Wernham Hogg, a paper supply firm.The band returned in mid-2005 with the single "Getaway," which entered the UK Top 10, the video for which was shot by Christopher Doyle and directed by Tim Royes. The single "Can't Resist" and album Red Book followed in the autumn. On Red Book the band collaborated with The Blue Nile singer Paul Buchanan on a track called "Sleep," which entered the UK charts at #6 in January 2006. British comedian Peter Kay scripted the music video to this song, which mainly consisted of spoofs of famous love scenes. The BBC One charity show Children in Need showed a preview on November 18, 2005, featuring a spoof on Lionel Richie's "Hello", Ghost, and An Officer and a Gentleman. Surprisingly, "Sleep" outsold the lead single. The potential fourth single "What About Us" was released as a promo-only issue.In 2005 Sharleen Spiteri was featured in the song "Stirb nicht vor mir // Don't die before I do" by the German band Rammstein on the album Rosenrot.On September 24, 2007 the band released The BBC Sessions, including radio sessions spanning from 1989 to 2005, with extensive liner notes and interviews with Sharleen Spiteri. Cover songs include Elmore James' "It Hurts Me Too", the Beatles' "I've Got a Feeling", and Ashford &amp; Simpson's "You're All I Need to Get By."MembershipSharleen Spiteri, Vocals and guitar (1988— )Tony McGovern, vocals and guitar (1999— )Ally McErlaine (Alistair Manson McErlaine), guitar (1988— )Johnny McElhone, bass guitar (1988— )Eddie Campbell, keyboards (1991— )Michael Bannister, keyboards (2005— )Neil Payne, drums (2003— )Former membersRichard Hynd, drums (1991–1999)Stuart Kerr, drums (1989–1991)Steve Washington, drums (2001)Mikey Wilson, drums (1999–2001)Mark One, DJ (1999–2001)Charlotte Hodson, backing vocals (2001)Nicole Patterson, backing vocals (1999–2001)DiscographyAlbumsSouthside (1989) UK #3 (Gold), US #88Mothers Heaven (1991) UK #32Ricks Road (1993) UK #18 (Gold)White on Blonde (1997) UK #1 (6x Platinum)The Hush (1999) UK #1 (3x Platinum)The Greatest Hits (2000) UK #1 (6x Platinum)Careful What You Wish For (2003) UK #5 (Gold)Red Book (2005) UK #16 (Gold)The BBC Sessions (2007)External linksOfficial website Category:1980s music groups Category:1990s music groups Category:2000s music groups Category:Scottish musical groupscs:Texas (hudební skupina) da:Texas (musikgruppe) de:Texas (Band) es:Texas (banda) fr:Texas (groupe) it:Texas (gruppo musicale) lt:Texas nl:Texas (band) no:Texas (band) pl:Texas (grupa muzyczna) pt:Texas (banda) ru:Texas fi:Texas (yhtye) sv:Texas (musikgrupp)
