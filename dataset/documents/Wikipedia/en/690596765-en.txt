This article deals with the specific antibiotic called tetracycline. For the group of antibiotics known as the tetracyclines, see tetracycline antibiotics.     | PubChem=643969 | DrugBank=APRD00572 | C=22 | H=24 | N=2 | O=8 |molecular_weight = 444.435 g/mol |bioavailability = 60-80% Oral, while fastingKlajn, Rafal, Chemistry and chemical biology of tetracyclines, retrieved 20 June 2007. Tetracycline was then discovered by Lloyd Conover in the research departments of Pfizer. The patent for tetracycline, , was first issued in 1950. However, Nubian mummies have been studied in the 1990s and were found to contain significant levels of tetracycline; there is evidence that the beer brewed at the time could have been the source. Tetracycline sparked the development of many chemically altered antibiotics and in doing so has proved to be one of the most important discoveries made in the field of antibiotics. It is used to treat many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and some protozoa. It, like some other antibiotics, is also used in the treatment of acne.Cautions, contraindications, side effectsAre as those of the tetracycline antibiotics group:Can stain developing teeth (even when taken by the mother during pregnancy)Inactivated by Ca2+ ion, not to be taken with milk or yogurtInactivated by aluminium, iron and zinc, not to be taken at the same time as indigestion remediesInactivated by common antacids and over-the-counter heartburn medicines.Skin photosensitivity; exposure to the Sun or intense light is not recommendedDrug-induced lupus, and hepatitisTinnitusWhen used for acne vulgaris, skin can be extremely dry and flaky if overusedMay interfere with methotrexate by displacing it from the various protein binding sitesIndicationTetracycline's primary use is for the treatment of acne vulgaris and rosacea.It is also used to treat a very wide range of infections; see tetracycline antibiotics for details.Other usesSince tetracycline is absorbed into bone, it is used as a marker of bone growth for biopsies in humans, and as a biomarker in wildlife to detect consumption of medicine- or vaccine-containing baits.Olson CA, et al. Bait ingestion by free-ranging raccoons and nontarget species in an oral rabies vaccine field trial in Florida. J Wildl Dis. 2000 Oct;36(4):734-43.  The presence of tetracycline in bone is detected by its fluorescence.Mayton CA. Tetracycline labeling of boneIn genetic engineering tetracycline is used in transcriptional activation. Tetracycline is also one of the antibiotics used to treat ulcers caused by bacterial infections. In cancer research at Harvard Medical School, tetracycline has been used to reliably cause regression of advanced stages of leukemia in mice, by putting this inexpensive antibiotic into their drinking water.http://www.hno.harvard.edu/gazette/2000/02.10/leukemia.htmlCell CultureTetracycline is used in cell biology as selective agent in cell culture systems. It is toxic to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and selects for cells harboring the bacterial tetr gene, which encodes a 399-amino acid membrane associated protein. This protein actively exports tetracycline out of the cell rendering cells harboring this gene more resistant to the drug. The yellow crystalline powder can be dissolved in water (20mg/ml) or ethanol (5mg/ml) and is routinely used at 10mg/L in cell culture. In cell culture at 37oCelsius it is stable for 4 days.References    Category:Tetracycline antibiotics Category:Cancer researchar:تتراسايكلن zh-min-nan:Tetracycline cs:tetracyklin de:Tetracyclin es:Tetraciclina eu:Tetraziklina fr:Tétracycline nl:Tetracycline ja:テトラサイクリン pl:Tetracyklina pt:Tetraciclina ru:Тетрациклин sl:Tetraciklin sv:Tetracyklin th:เตตร้าซัยคลิน tr:Tetrasiklin zh:四環素
