He was also a regular player for the French national team during the 1990s.During his career he cultivated a reputation as a stylish maverick, often clashing with his coaches. Since his retirement from the game in 2002 he has become involved in several new pursuits, including acting.CareerGinola played at club level for Toulon (1985&ndash;88), Racing Club Paris (1988&ndash;90), Brest (1990&ndash;92), Paris Saint-Germain (1992&ndash;95), Newcastle United (1995&ndash;97), Tottenham Hotspur (1997&ndash;2000), Aston Villa (2000&ndash;2002) and Everton (2002).FranceGinola made his first senior appearance for Sporting Toulon as a eighteen year-old in a 1985 2-0 victory away at Metz.http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/david-ginola.html&lt;/ref&gt; He played fourteen times in his first season, and by 1986 he was a regular in the Toulon line-up.In 1988 he moved to Racing Club Paris, where he remained until signing for Brest in 1990 and Paris-Saint Germain in 1992.Newcastle UnitedIn 1995, Ginola joined Newcastle United for £2.5 million. He was signed at a time when manager Kevin Keegan was attempting to turn the club into one of the major forces in English football, and the board was prepared to offer strong financial backing to sign a number of European superstars. In the 1995-96, Newcastle finished second, four points behind Manchester United their strongest league performance in decades with Ginola an integral part of the team. However, it was a major disappointment that Newcastle had finished second in the Premier League as they had led by up to 10 points as late as January.In 1996, Barcelona made a move for him, but Newcastle rejected their offer.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_/ai_n14056953&lt;/ref&gt; Ginola later stated his regret that he had never played for one of the "big clubs". To add to their line-up, Newcastle paid £15m, breaking the transfer record, to sign Alan Shearer. Despite this, Newcastle finished second again, being narrowly overtaken by Manchester United. Halfway through the season, Kevin Keegan suddenly resigned as manager to be succeeded by Kenny Dalglish.After two years with the club, Ginola began to have increasing friction with the club authorities and teamates. Keegan had departed in January 1997 and Ginola did not get on with his replacement Kenny Dalglish.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19970426/ai_n14113846&lt;/ref&gt;Tottenham HotspurTottenham Hostpur signed Ginola in July 1997 for £2.5m, where he was joined by Newcastle team-mate Les Ferdinand.

He also won his only English domestic trophy with Spurs, the 1999 League Cup with a 1-0 victory over Leicester City at Wembley Stadium. Ginola is fondly remembered by spurs fans, for his extravagant forward play and personality off the pitch. He played an integral role in their 1999 League cup win, setting up the winner for Allan Nielsen in the final and scoring a long range goal in a 3-1 win against Manchester United in a previous round. The respect and fondness Tottenham fans have for Ginola was shown when he was given one of the biggest cheers on their 125th anniversary when legends were paraded on the pitch. http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/1999/mar/21/match.leicestercity&lt;/ref&gt; http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60186601.html&lt;/ref&gt;Aston VillaIn July 2000 Ginola joined Aston Villa for a transfer fee of of £3 million.

The French manager Gérard Houllier blamed Ginola for the defeat, and he was subsequently branded a ""assassin of French football". After being barracked by French fans, Ginola moved to England with Newcastle United http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/841298.stm&lt;/ref&gt;Aimé Jacquet did not select Ginola for any major tournaments.

His ability to do that was shown in games for Tottenham and Newcastle, with his most memorable goal in Newcastle's stunning 5&ndash;0 win over Premier League giants Manchester United on 20 October 1996, becoming a flamboyant part of the memorable "Entertainers" Newcastle side of his era, which also featured other highly acclaimed players including Les Ferdinand, Rob Lee and Keith Gillespie.ActingGinola has acted in two films since his retirement from football.
