Adopted on July 1, 1991, it is based on the anthem of the Democratic Republic of Armenia (1918-1922), but with different lyrics.The lyrics were written as a poem by poet Mikael Nalbandian (1829-1866) and later set to music by composer Barsegh Kanachyan (1885-1967).LyricsArmenianAccording to the Armenian version of the web site of the Government of the Republic of ArmeniaLatin transcriptionEnglish translationAccording to the English version of the web site of the Government of the Republic of ArmeniaStatus as the national anthem of Armenia Lately, there has been a debate over whether Armenia should do away with its current national anthem and adopt something different. There have been complaints and allegations that the song is "too wimpy" and gloomy.&lt;/ref&gt; A 22-person commission made up of Armenia's wisest and best have been sifting through 85 candidates to come up with a new anthem. The [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] staunchly opposes the idea of changing ''Mer Hayrenik''. The very idea, according to them, is tantamount to sacrilege.&lt;ref name=&quot;new anthem&quot;/&gt; The Armenian Revolutionary Federation is a part of the coalition government.  According to some, one anthem, with lyrics based on a poem by [[Kars Province|Kars]]-born Armenian writer [[Yeghishe Charents]] is considered one of the most favored submissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;new anthem&quot;/&gt; A modified version of the [[Anthem of the Armenian SSR|Soviet-era anthem]] by [[Aram Khachaturian]] with new lyrics is another candidate, along with two other recordings.  Some such as Armenian composer [[Tigran Mansuryan]] prefer the tune of the old Khachaturian anthem, calling it &quot;very Armenian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals are being produced by an orchestra in order for the public to hear the different options being considered for the new state anthem. Despite ongoing debate, Mer Hayrenik will be kept as the state anthem by decision of the National Assembly of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesSourcesArmenian text of the national anthem on the web site of the GovernmentEnglish translation of the anthem on the web site of the GovernmentExternal linksMer Hayrenik, with podcast online listening and MP3 version to download for both vocal and instrumental versionsInstrumental version of &quot;Mer Hayrenik&quot; in MP3 formatVocal version of &quot;Mer Hayrenik&quot; in MP3 formatArmenian part of nationalanthems.info: includes midi, lyrics, a music sheetDebate whether or not to change the national anthem  Category:Armenian music Category:National symbols of Armenia Category:National anthemsbs:Mer Hayrenik ca:Mer Hayrenik cv:Эрмени патшалăхĕн гимнĕ de:Mer Hajrenik el:Μερ Χαϊρενίκ es:Mer Hayrenik fr:Mer Hayrenik ko:아르메니아의 국가 hy:Մեր Հայրենիք hr:Mer Hayrenik id:Mer Hayrenik it:Mer Hayrenik he:המנון ארמניה jv:Mer Hayrenik hu:Örményország himnusza ms:Mer Hayrenik na:Mer Hayrenik nl:Mer Hayrenik ja:アルメニアの国歌 no:Mer Hayrenik pl:Hymn Armenii pt:Hino nacional da Armênia ro:Mer Hayrenik ru:Гимн Армении sl:Mer Hajrenik sr:Химна Јерменије fi:Mer Hayrenik sv:Armeniens nationalsång vi:Mer Hayrenik tg:Суруди миллии Арманистон tr:Ermenistan Ulusal Marşı uk:Гімн Вірменії zh:我的祖國 (亞美尼亞)
