It plunges down towering canyons toward the Aegean Sea through mostly metamorphic formations. At the end, the main stream spreads over the coastal plain of Chrysoupolis and expands as a deltaic system with freshwater lakes and ponds forming the Nestos delta.The length of the river is 230 km, of which 126 km in Bulgaria and the rest in Greece. It forms some gorges in Rila and Pirin.The Mesta's longest tributary is the Dospat River. The banks of the river are covered mainly by deciduous trees that extend into halfway between Bulgaria and Greece where it forms the modern boundary of Greek Macedonia and Thrace, as well as the boundary between the Kavala and the Xanthi prefectures. The river later forms a delta to the north where swamplands, wetlands and a lagoon once existed except in the east.HonourMesta Peak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Mesta River.Category:Rivers of Bulgaria Category:Rivers of Greece Category:Thrace bg:Места ca:Nestos cs:Mesta (řeka) de:Nestos el:Νέστος es:Río Mesta fr:Mesta it:Mesta lt:Mesta hu:Meszta nl:Mesta (rivier) ja:メスタ川 no:Mesta (elv) nn:Elva Mesta pl:Mesta ru:Места (река) sv:Mesta
