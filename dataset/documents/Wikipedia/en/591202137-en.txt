The contemporary team has existed officially since 1990 and was recognised by FIFA and UEFA in 1992, one year after Croatia gained independence from Yugoslavia. Previously sanctioned national teams represented the short-lived Banovina of Croatia and Independent State of Croatia in 19 friendly matches from 1940 to 1944. Although authorized as an affiliate of FIFA in the earlier era, Croatia remained a constituent nation of Yugoslavia and was therefore unable to host a separate national team at competitive level.The modern team played the nation's first competitive matches during a successful qualifying campaign for Euro 96, leading to their first appearance at a major international tournament. They went on to finish third at the 1998 World Cup, led by Golden Boot winner Davor Šuker. Croatia has since qualified for every World Cup that it has entered as an independent nation, having missed only one major tournament—Euro 2000—since they became eligible to participate.The team has achieved several noteworthy results, including victories over Germany, Holland, Italy and England. During their 98 World Cup foray, they defeated the Germans 3&ndash;0 and concluded the tournament with a 2&ndash;1 victory over Holland in the bronze medal playoff. Croatia has overcome four-time world champions Italy twice: an away win during qualifications for Euro 96 and again at the 2002 World Cup, with a 2–1 scoreline on both occasions. Recent results include twofold victories against England: 2–0 at home in the Maksimir Stadium and 3–2 at Wembley Stadium, England's first competitive defeat at the new venue. At Euro 2008, they defeated eventual finalists Germany 2–1.Croatia is the only team to win FIFA's "Best Mover of the Year" more than once, receiving the award in 1994 and 1998. Their FIFA World Ranking has been the most volatile of all nations, ranging from third to 125th (the latter shortly after the team began playing independently). Since 1994, they remained undefeated in competitive matches on home soil. The team eventually lost to England on September 10, 2008, ending a 36 match streak at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb. Croatia's primary supporters, often associated with hooliganism, have been responsible for considerable charges and infamy against the national federation by the governing bodies of football. They obtain further media involvement through the prime broadcasting service of HRT, the principal newscast of Croatia which airs all national team fixtures live.HistoryPre-independenceAt the end of the 19th century football was introduced in Croatia by expatriate Englishmen in the cities of Rijeka and Županja, leading to the Croatian recognition of the rulebook in 1896. By 1908, a modern edition of the sport's laws was published as Croats began to play football regularly in organised clubs. An international representative side was initially formed a year earlier, as FIFA record a Croatian team playing a full-length fixture against domestic opposition in 1906/07. Before independence, Croatian footballers competed in the authorized national teams of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1919–39) and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (1945–90). However, at various times throughout these rulings, Croatian sides were temporarily organised and competed separately in unofficial contests, primarily due to the instability of national boundaries involving the war. p171 mentions the overall instability of national regions due to the breakup of Yugoslavia.  A hastily arranged national side, managed by Hugo Kinert, played a small number of private domestic matches from 1918 to 1919 during World War I. In 1940, Jozo Jakopić led a non-FIFA recognised team which represented the Banovina of Croatia in four friendly matches: two against Switzerland and two against Hungary. Croatia defeated the Swiss 4&ndash;0 in Zagreb on April 2, 1940, marking their debut match as a distinctly recognised side. Following further movement by the Axis power, a Croatian football federation became temporarily active and joined FIFA on July 17, 1941 as the Independent State of Croatia. The directed national side played 15 friendly matches until 1944—all but one as an officially sanctioned national team—under the direction of Rudolf Hitrec. They recorded their first result as a FIFA member on September 8 in Bratislava, drawing 1&ndash;1 with Slovakia. Nonetheless, they were prohibited from participating in competitive matches as FIFA still considered the Yugoslavian federation as the football representative of the country.From 1950, another unofficial Croatian side was active for a brief period, recording two friendly victories over Indonesia and a Yugoslav team playing as "Serbia". This was the last Croatian national team which played during this period as such activities were eventually ceased. When Yugoslavia participated at the 1956 Summer Olympics, their squad included numerous Croatian footballers. Subsequent Yugoslavian teams that played in several World Cup and European Championship tournaments up to 1990 also consisted of Croatian players who collectively achieved small success at competitive level.Official formationThe last Yugoslav team to field a considerable Croatian contingent played against Sweden on May 16, 1991, only a few days before Croatia's independence referendum. Another Croatian team was formed during this time, and went on to play their first modern international fixture against the United States on October 17, 1990 at Maksimir Stadium. Aljoša Asanović was the first goalscorer for the newly established side, as Croatia won the match 2&ndash;1. This was one of only three games played under original manager Dražan Jerković; Croatia would subsequently record another two friendly victories under his guidance before Stanko Poklepović and Vlatko Marković had brief spells in charge. Although Croatia was still regarded as a part of Yugoslavia, this team remained an unofficially sanctioned national side until Croatia were declared independent on October 8, 1991, at which point the team became the official representative of the Croatian republic. The Croatian football federation rejoined the governing bodies of football and went on to organise the first competitive matches for the new national team. Since Croatia were not ranked on their performances prior to independence, they entered the FIFA World Rankings in 125th place.In the summer of 1992, FIFA and UEFA both officially recognised Croatia's football federation, which allowed the country to take part in competitive matches. Miroslav Blažević was appointed manager and led the Croatians into their qualifying campaign for Euro 96 against Estonia on September 4, 1994. Croatia won the game 2–0 at the A. Le Coq Arena in Tallinn, marking their first competitive victory as a distinct side. They ultimately finished on top of their qualifying group and earned the FIFA Best Mover of the Year award for their rapid rise in the international rankings. They suffered their first defeat in competitive matches during the same qualifying campaign on June 11, 1995, losing 1&ndash;0 in their away fixture to Ukraine.'Golden Generation'Goran Vlaović scored the team's first goal at a major tournament when he netted a late winner against Turkey at the City Ground during Euro 96. The Croats followed their opening victory with a 3&ndash;0 win over reigning champions Denmark with Davor Šuker scoring one of the most skillful goals of the tournament; after receiving a long pass, he lobbed the ball into the goal from the 12-yard mark. Croatia were beaten 3–0 by Portugal in their final group fixture, but still advanced out of the group stage to then be knocked out by eventual champions Germany in the quarter finals.                 Croatia's 3-5-2 lineup during the 1998 World Cup. Initial striker Alen Bokšić was withdrawn due to injury.  Miroslav Blažević remained in charge as Croatia set their venture on the 1998 World Cup. They successfully earned a berth at the tournament by defeating Ukraine in a qualifying playoff. Their first opponents were similar first-timers Jamaica. Mario Stanić scored their first World Cup goal, contributing to the 3&ndash;1 victory along with Robert Prosinečki and Davor Šuker at the Stade Félix Bollaert in Lens. Croatia narrowly beat Japan in their next fixture to secure a berth in the next round, despite losing to Argentina in their final group match. Davor Šuker scored his third goal of the tournament as they fended off a challenge from Romania to reach the quarter finals, where they would face former adversaries Germany once again. Although they were initially considered underdogs, Croatia enjoyed a 3&ndash;0 victory with goals from Robert Jarni, Goran Vlaović and Davor Šuker respectively after Christian Wörns was sent off.Croatia went on to face the host nation France in the anticipated semi-final encounter. After a goalless first-half, which admittedly frustrated French coach Aimé Jacquet, Croatia took the lead through Davor Šuker once again. However, opposing defender Lilian Thuram secured the host nation a victory with his first and only international goals in his career as France prevailed 2&ndash;1. The Croatian side won third place by defeating the Netherlands with Davor Šuker capturing the Golden Boot award as the most prolific scorer of the tournament. This was amongst the best performances for a debut nation in the World Cup, eventually vaulting Croatia to third place in the FIFA World Rankings in January 1999, their highest ranking to date.The successful squad of these early years was later dubbed the "Golden Generation". FIFA once again awarded Croatia with the Best Mover of the Year award in 1998. However, despite impressive runs in their first two major competitions, Croatia failed to qualify for Euro 2000, finishing third in their qualifying group behind Yugoslavia and Ireland. During this campaign, play between Croatia and Yugoslavia took place against a background of tension. Both fixtures ended in draws, with political protests occurring during the goalless fixture in Belgrade. In the return match in Zagreb, Croatia needed a victory to qualify, but the game ended in a 2&ndash;2 draw amid controversy. This was one of the last games played by a team representing "Yugoslavia", as that side was soon renamed Serbia and Montenegro to reflect the creation of a new individual state. p207Decline under Jozić and Barić (early 2000s)Despite the retirement of their "Golden Generation", including coach Blažević, Croatia qualified for the 2002 World Cup with an undefeated record. Mirko Jozić led them into tournament where they produced a surprise 2&ndash;1 victory over Italy. Their subsequent loss of form, however, became overly difficult to cope as they lost to Ecuador and missed out on qualification to the knockout stages. Jozić momentarily stepped down as manager, leading to the appointment of Otto Barić; the first and only manager born outside the Balkans to coach the national team.Despite the experience in the Austrian-born manager, Croatia continued to distress during the Euro 2004 qualifications. A lack of victories saw them narrowly place second in their group as they went on to defeat Slovenia in the playoffs. The final tournament saw them fail to advance from their group after losing to England in their final game. However, they managed to display an earlier 2&ndash;2 draw against reigning champions France. Barić followed the pattern of his predecessor and left the management position shortly afterward, stating his criticism as a direct cause.===Kranjčar and Bilić's revival=== A new era for the team began shortly after the 2004 tournament exit. Retiree Zlatko Kranjčar took over as national team coach and commanded Croatia to a top place finish in their qualifying group for the 2006 World Cup, again without losing a single match. Niko Kovač was chosen as team captain during this qualification campaign, a role he kept into the final tournament. Kranjčar faced heavy criticism with the introduction of his son Niko, who was peceived as a biased inclusion by the media. After narrowly losing to Brazil in their opening game, Croatia failed to overcome Japan after an array of chances, including a penalty, went begging. With their advancement reliant on victory against Australia, Croatia took the lead with one of the earliest goals in their tournament history; a second-minute free kick from Dario Srna. However, the match finished 2&ndash;2 with three red cards being issued by referee Graham Poll. This prompted another exit from the group stage as Croatia marked an odd first in football history after Josip Šimunić became the only player to receive three yellow cards in a single match. Poll was widely criticized for his lack of control in the match and soon retired from international officiating, relating the incident as a prime cause.After the exit, the HNS hired former defender Slaven Bilić as national team coach. With a a broad range of younger talent available, he immediately improved the team's results, commencing with a 2&ndash;0 victory over Italy in an away friendly. With an array of competitive matches scheduled for the Euro 2008 qualifications, Bilić temporarily suspended Dario Srna, Ivica Olić and Boško Balaban from the national squad after the trio were absent from his initial training sessions. However, the introduction of younger talent such as Eduardo da Silva, Luka Modrić, Vedran Ćorluka and Ivan Rakitić transformed Croatia into one of the youngest international squads. Performances ultimately improved under Bilić’s guidance as the team complied positively towards his new management style. This excelled the Croats in their qualifying campaign; they remained unbeaten in their first 11 matches which included an earlier home victory over England. With qualifications already assured, Croatia traveled to London for their return fixture against the English side, who needed to avoid defeat in order to qualify. However, Croatia prevailed with a 3&ndash;2 win at the Wembley Stadium, denying England their first major tournament since 1994. National coach Steve McClaren was immediately dismissed for the failing display, which was England's first competitive defeat at the new venue. Bilić led the national side as group winners, suffering only a single defeat against Macedonia in the process.Prior to the tournament, Croatia's qualifying topscorer Eduardo da Silva sustained a major compound fracture while playing in the English Premiership. His injury caused heavy controversy within the national team. Association president Vlatko Marković argued that the incident was "beyond random", as he called for action against Martin Taylor. Leading Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List examined Taylor's training sessions and depicted him to show no sorrow over his actions. A global appeal believed the tackle to be an act of retribution from the English defender, as varied supporters sanctioned Taylor's rough conduct. Bilić was forced to significantly alter the squad for his final selection, including uncapped players Nikola Kalinić and Nikola Pokrivač.Croatia entered the tournament with a weakened strike force, arousing concerns after their warm-up fixtures against Scotland and Moldova showed a lack of attacking quality. Despite such, they finished with maximum group points for the first time in their tournament history after beating co-hosts Austria, Germany and then Poland to ensure advancement to the quarter finals. Niko Kovač remained team captain at what was expected to be his final international tournament, except in the final group fixture when Dario Šimić was temporarily given the captain's armband. Croatia’s tournament run ended in dramatic events as Turkey advanced on penalties after a controversial refereeing error led to a last minute equaliser from Semih Şentürk, voiding an earlier goal from Ivan Klasnić. At the competition, Croatia conceded the fewest goals of any team (2), suffered the fewest losses (0) and scored the earliest goal (4th minute in their opening game against Austria), the latter becoming a new European Championship record.Despite constant speculation of his departure, manager Slaven Bilić renewed his contract to remain in charge for the forthcoming tournament. This marked the first occasion since Miroslav Blažević's managerial tenure that Croatia would enter two consecutive tournaments with the same manager, as all previous coaches were replaced after the failures of the sides they directed. Croatia were again drawn with England in the qualification stages of the 2010 World Cup, with the rematch fixtures voted on FIFA.com as the most anticipated of the campaign. They went on to open with a home win over Kazakhstan before preparing for their rematch. However, the subsequent fixture against the English side, coached by Fabio Capello, saw them fall to their first ever home competitive defeat since 1994 after Theo Walcott netted a hat-trick and Robert Kovač was sent off.Tournament recordsWorld Cup recordCroatia have qualified for every World Cup since their debut of the tournament in 1998. Although they were granted entry into FIFA and UEFA in 1992, they were still unable to enter the 1994 tournament as qualifications had already commenced. Their first World Cup appearance is the nation's best to date, as they have failed to progress beyond the group stage in both of their following tournaments; placing third in their group on both occasions.1930 to 1990 &ndash; Not applicable.Was part of Yugoslavia 1994 &ndash; Could not enter.Was not a full FIFA member until July 1992, qualifications for this tournament already began prior to their independence acknowledgmentYearRoundPositionMatchesWinspenalty kicks]].LossesGFGoals for / scoredGAGoals against / concededFrance 1998Third place37502115South Korea 2002Round 123310223Germany 2006Round 122302123Total3/3-136251511European Championship recordCroatia's best result in UEFA Championship play also came in their debut, in 1996.

Ivo Kraljević served as the manager of the initial federation, established in 1939, and organised non-sanctioned matches played by unofficial national squads up to 1956. These temporary sides, playing non-competitive fixtures, were led by seven different managers.:1918 to 1919 - Hugo Kinert1939 to 1940 - Jozo Jakopić1940 to 1943 - Rudolf Hitrec1943 to 1945 - Bogdan Cuvaj1956 - Bruno Knežević, Leo Lemešić and Franjo WölflStatistically, Dražan Jerković and Vlatko Marković are the most successful managers in Croatia's history; they both recorded victories in each of their few games in charge. Miroslav Blažević, who was the first official manager of the team, holds the highest number of competitve victories, having led Croatia to their best performances at major international tournaments.NameTenurePlayedWonDrawnLostWin %Points per gameCalculated by multiplying wins by 3, plus draws, divided by games played.Achievements 1990&ndash;19913300100.003.00 1992411225.001.00 19931100100.003.00 1994&ndash;20007336221549.311.781996 Euro]] - quarter-final1998 World Cup - third place 2000&ndash;20021896350.001.832002 World Cup]] - group stage 2002&ndash;200424118545.831.702004 Euro]] - group stage 2004&ndash;200625118644.001.642006 World Cup]] - group stage 2006&ndash;present28196367.852.252008 Euro]] - quarter-finalTotals17691513351.701.84Last updated: Ukraine 0&ndash;0 Croatia, October 11, 2008.

However, during the 2006 World Cup fixture against Japan, Dario Šimić surpassed this distinction and went on to total 100 national caps since his presence in all major tournaments from 1996. He became the first Croatian player to reach this milestone and subsequently retired in 2008, being treated to a brief media appraisal.Davor Šuker is Croatia's leading goalscorer with 45&nbsp;international goals in his appearances for the team, a record that saw him recognised as Croatia's "Golden Player" at the UEFA jubilee celebration in 2004. Šuker retired in 2002 and his achievement is still to be challenged, with Darijo Srna in a distant second position with 17 goals (as of September 2008). Amongst the closest contenders was Brazilian-born Eduardo da Silva, who opted to play for Croatia and prolifically commenced his international career with 13 goals in 22 senior appearances (as of August 2008), making him amongst the most consistent strikers for Croatia. The record for goals in a single match is held by Mladen Petrić, who scored four times during Croatia's 7&ndash;0 home victory over Andorra on October 7, 2006.The national team's joint record for highest-scoring victory comes from two 7&ndash;0 results, over Andorra in 2006 and against Australia in a pre-tournament friendly during 1998. Croatia's worst defeat is also a joint record, with two 5&ndash;1 defeats against the German national team in the 1940s, as well as a 4&ndash;0 loss to Italy during the same period when the Croatian team represented the short-lived Independent State of Croatia. In the modern era, Croatia suffered a 4&ndash;1 defeat against Slovakia in a 1994 friendly, a 3&ndash;0 defeat to Portugal at Euro 96 and a 3&ndash;0 loss to Netherlands in a 2008 friendly (Croatia's worst defeat on home soil since 1990).Jurica Vranješ is the youngest player to appear for the national team in the modern era, debuting at 19&nbsp;years, 4&nbsp;months and 13&nbsp;days against Egypt on June 13, 1999. Goran Jurić was the oldest player to debut, earning his first cap at 34&nbsp;years, 1&nbsp;month and 28&nbsp;days in a game against Slovenia on April 2, 1997, while Dražen Ladić is the oldest Croatian to compete at international level, playing his farewell match at 37&nbsp;years, 4&nbsp;months and 27&nbsp;days old on May 28, 2000, a friendly against France in Zagreb.Stadium  The Croatia team plays its home matches at the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb, where they have maintained a record of only one competitive defeat since 1994. Croatia remained undefeated in competitive matches at the stadium until their downfall against England on September 10, 2008 in a 2010 World Cup qualifying fixture. With a burden of injuries and a red card in the second half, the English won by four goals to one. The stadium takes its name from the surrounding neighbourhood of Maksimir. It is one of the oldest facilities in the country, with the current building regarded as an innovative refurbishment of the original stadium built in 1912. The stadium has hosted national team fixtures since their competitive home debut against Lithuania; it also hosted the matches of Croatian teams during the World War eras.Further improvements, designed to increase the current 40,000 seating capacity, are planned, as part of a renovation expected to make Maksimir the most expensive football stadium in the world. However, UEFA threatened in 2008 to limit the number of fans allowed during future fixtures as a penalty for crowd troubles at the European Championships. Shortly after the final proposition of Maksimir's renovation plans, Zagreb mayor Milan Bandic expressed a refusal to proceed with the construction due to exceeding costs of the operation; until a consensus is reached the refurbishment has once again been postponed. In 2006, a large divot in the stadium's turf resulted in an infamous own goal let in by goalkeeper Paul Robinson. Friendly games have sometimes been played at Hajduk Split's home ground, the Poljud Stadium, and minor exhibitions at the Kantrida Stadium in Rijeka among others.A comprehensive list of national team games on 'Sve O Sportu' shows each home game played by Croatia.

Statistics include official FIFA-recognised matches only.SupportersCroatia's prominent supporters are followers of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have both been associated in recent years with hooliganism. Though violence between the two groups has marked fixtures in the domestic league, Croatia's international performances remain clear of such clashes.Their fans have nonetheless been heavily sanctioned for their conduct at international performances since the team's formation. The Croatian football federation has been penalized repeatedly for acts of alleged racism by the fans, initially during matches at Euro 2004 which led to a threat by UEFA to expel the Croatian side. In recent years, the Croatians have showed defiance against national security and regulations. During the 2006 World Cup, a Croatian supporter evaded security and made his way onto the field, approaching the Croatian players in excitement. The trespassing fan was arrested after being escorted off the field by Dado Pršo as the whole incident prompted a brief media sensation. When Croatia played Italy in a friendly match in Livorno, the small group of Croats responded to the waving of communist flags by forming the shape of a swastika, the symbol of the Nazi regime. The Croatian football federation eventually faced further charges by UEFA for the incident. Similar events occurred at Euro 2008 as UEFA penalized Croatia for the display of inappropriate banners against Turkey. After an initial investigation by FIFA, another fine was issued to the Croatian football federation for the racial abuse shown towards striker Emile Heskey during the loss to England on September 10, 2008.Croatian supporters have additionally been sanctioned for their constant use of flares during major fixtures. Such a tendency also derives from domestic league derby matches, and Croatia's traveling performances have been marked several times with tifo choreography from their followers.Related images from Reuters, Eurosport and Javno news service: Croatia fans with flares in the stands, Similar celebrations, Primary photo gallery The use of such pyrotechnic devices has been strongly prohibited, which has led to numerous confiscations from Croatian supporters. Former defender and current agent Igor Štimac and midfielder Luka Modrić admitted that the use of highly supporting procedures have motivated the Croatian squad prior to fixtures.Ethnic and religious disturbances, often caused by patriotic differences from the war, have also occurred involving Croatian followers. On June 3, 1990, Yugoslavia played the Netherlands in Zagreb in a warmup fixture prior to the 1990 World Cup. The Croatian crowd expressed disapproval towards the Yugoslavian national anthem and players, subsequently cheering for the Dutch side. In the same year, Maksimir Stadium hosted a patriotic riot between a large turnout of Croats and Serbs. The two cross-ethnic fans assaulted each other as a signal of the recent hatred instigated by the parliamentary election. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia in such a manner, Croatian followers have caused heavy tensions between affiliated supporters of the former Yugoslavian state. During the 2006 World Cup, encounters in Mostar between Bosniaks and Croatians led to numerous arrests and severe injuries after the cross-religious nationalists began to attack each other. Further clashes between opposing fans, mostly that of Muslim involvement, occurred at Euro 2008 against Turkey. The two supporters gathered in Vienna shortly before the quarter final fixture, which initially prompted heavy security. After the match, Croatian fans bypassed the police resistance and clashed with the Turkish supporters. The brawl resulted in further arrests on both sides as the perpetrators were escorted away from each other.MediaNational team fixtures are regularly shown live and replayed on Croatia's principal broadcasting station HRT, with Igor Štimac anchoring commentary since his retirement. Additionally, the national team have been prominent subjects of media association since their formation. In 2007, they founded a minor charity movement after their affiliated calendar appearances were purchased nationwide. The following year, the Vlado Malešević Foundation revealed the production of a football anthem dedicated to Croatia's national team, with all proceeds also devoted to charity.Shortly after his appointment, manager Slaven Bilić and his rock band released a hit titled "Vatreno Ludilo" (Fiery Madness) which recalls the team's progress during the 1998 World Cup and champions its present ambitions. The song became a #1 hit in the Croatian music charts and was played widely during the Euro 2008 campaign. Bilić's enthusiasm was ultimately well received in Croatia, inspiring the team's nickname "Bilić Boys". Other prominent Croatian bands such as Dino Dvornik, Zaprešić boys, Prljavo kazalište and Baruni have also recorded mantras which have been used to support the national team."Here are the best, and the worst of the Croatian Football Anthems." Football anthems refer to unofficial fan songs preferred by supporters, which can be found at 'BecomeaCroatiafan.com'. Croatian football anthems Retrieved on 2008-07-19. Popular hymns have included:Malo nas je al nas ima (We are little, but we are many)Samo je jedno (There is but one thing my life)Moj dom je Hrvatska (Croatia is my homeland)Srce Vatreno (Heart of Fire)Hrvatska je prvak svijeta (Croatia are world champions).Additionally, the squad themselves adopted the song Lijepa li si (how beautiful you are) by influential rock band Thompson, primarily because of its modern similarity to the national anthem.Bilingual comparison of lyrics: Croatian national anthem and How beautiful you are The correlation with Thompon's music has increased heavily in the buildup to significant fixtures. When Croatia faced Israel in a home qualifier, the music was not played as usual due to political concerns involving the band's criticism from Jewish organisations. At the conclusion of the match, the squad and management team voiced their opinions and opposed against Thompson's alleged controversy.  During Croatia's final qualifying victory against England at Wembley Stadium, British performer Tony Henry mispronounced the closing lyrics of the Croatian anthem. Henry's fear of criticism was later retracted as the players credited his error as a relieving factor behind their victory.Notes and referencesExternal links &amp; further readingOfficial[http://www.hns-cff.hr Croatian Football Federation official website] Official supporters' club website StatisticsDetailed list of all Croatia's games  (Last updated August 20, 2008)Croatia - List of international matches at RSSSF (Last updated May 16, 2008)Croatia - Players' stats at RSSSF (Last updated June 20, 2008)News and fans[http://hr.nogonet.com NogoNet.com - Croatian football news portal] [http://www.nogometni.net Nogometni.net - Croatian football news portal] Official website of Sportnet.hr Official website of Sportske novosti [http://www.becomeacroatiafan.com/index.asp Become a Croatia Fan - English supporters' website]      Category:Franjo Bučar Award winners Category:European national football teams Category:Croatia national football team Category:National sports teams of Croatiaar:منتخب كرواتيا لكرة القدم bs:Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija ca:Selecció de futbol de Croàcia cs:Chorvatská fotbalová reprezentace da:Kroatiens fodboldlandshold de:Kroatische Fußballnationalmannschaft et:Horvaatia jalgpallikoondis es:Selección de fútbol de Croacia eo:Kroata nacia teamo de futbalo fr:Équipe de Croatie de football gl:Selección de fútbol de Croacia ko:크로아티아 축구 국가대표팀 hr:Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija id:Tim nasional sepak bola Kroasia it:Nazionale di calcio della Croazia he:נבחרת קרואטיה בכדורגל jv:Tim nasional sépak bola Kroasia ka:ხორვატიის ეროვნული საფეხბურთო ნაკრები lv:Horvātijas futbola izlase lt:Kroatijos vyrų futbolo rinktinė hu:Horvát labdarúgó-válogatott mk:Национален фудбалски тим на Хрватска mt:Tim Nazzjonali tal-Futbol tal-Kroazja mr:क्रोएशिया फुटबॉल संघ nl:Kroatisch voetbalelftal ja:サッカークロアチア代表 no:Kroatias herrelandslag i fotball pl:Reprezentacja Chorwacji w piłce nożnej pt:Seleção Croata de Futebol ru:Сборная Хорватии по футболу sk:Chorvátske národné futbalové mužstvo sl:Hrvaška nogometna reprezentanca sr:Фудбалска репрезентација Хрватске sh:Hrvatska nogometna reprezentacija fi:Kroatian jalkapallomaajoukkue sv:Kroatiens herrlandslag i fotboll vi:Đội tuyển bóng đá quốc gia Croatia tr:Hırvatistan Millî Futbol Takımı uk:Збірна Хорватії з футболу wuu:克罗阿希亚国家足球队 zh:克羅地亞國家足球隊
