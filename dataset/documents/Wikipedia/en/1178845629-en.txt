He started to play guitar as a private study at the age of 12 and since then he has played in various bands including Nightwish, of which he is a founding member, Brother Firetribe and Altaria.Emppu most often supports the keyboard or orchestral parts of Nightwish songs, Marco Hietala easing back to allow the higher pitched guitar of Emppu to take precedence. Vuorinen's solo techniques include short range tapping and minor to extreme whammy bar use for vibrato. His solos are usually more melodically oriented than in many other Heavy Metal bands, such as Children of Bodom, but he can also Shred.Vuorinen is often referred to as "The short one" when amongst Nightwish members, as well as his other projects, standing at only 5'5" (165cm) in height.As of 2008 one of his side-projects Brother Firetribe released their two albums, "False Metal" (Re-released as "Break Out"), and "Heart Full Of Fire" worldwide.EquipmentVuorinen originally used Washburn guitars for earlier albums (WASHBURN CS-780: white and purple guitars with golden hardware) but he has recently endorsed ESP Guitars. He currently uses a custom made ESP Horizon, the ESP EV-1 with Seymour Duncan pickups (TB-5 in the bridge, SHR-1n in the middle and an SH-2n in the neck), 1 in purple and 1 in white, along with an ESP Eclipse in Vintage Black, which he used for the music video to Nightwish's Amaranth and Bye Bye Beautiful.His current main amplifiers are Mesa Boogie Rectifiers with Marshall speaker cabinets.After seeing that the infamous purple guitar had suddenly gone and with many fans voicing their concerns, Vuorinen answered this question from David from Canada:External linksNightwish official siteEmppu Vuorinen fanlistingCollection of gathered factsOfficial Brother Firetribe WebsiteNightmail, October 2007 Category:Male singers Category:Finnish heavy metal guitarists Category:Nightwish members Category:1978 births Category:Living peoplebg:Ерно Вуоринен cs:Emppu Vuorinen da:Erno Vuorinen de:Emppu Vuorinen es:Emppu Vuorinen fr:Emppu Vuorinen it:Emppu Vuorinen hu:Emppu Vuorinen nl:Emppu Vuorinen ja:エンプ・ヴオリネン no:Emppu Vuorinen pl:Erno Vuorinen pt:Erno Vuorinen ro:Emppu Vuorinen ru:Вуоринен, Эрно sk:Emppu Vuorinen sr:Емпу Вуоринен fi:Emppu Vuorinen sv:Erno Vuorinen tr:Emppu Vuorinen uk:Вуорінен Ерно
