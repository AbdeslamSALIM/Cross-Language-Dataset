The charge-cooling effect of direct fuel injection permits a higher compression ratio without the risk of detonation, improving horsepower and torque. Fuel consumption has been reduced approximately 0.4 to 0.8 km/L across the range, even though the official window stickers say otherwise - the EPA changed its testing methodology in 2008. Fuel consumption is 6 km/L city, 8.5 km/L Motorway for the base model. The drag coefficient is 0.35 Cd and all models get a power lift gate and a tire pressure monitoring system.
