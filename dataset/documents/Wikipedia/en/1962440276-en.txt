 Telepinu or (Telepinus) was the name of a king of the Hittites ca. 1460 BC (short chronology). At the beginning of his reign, the Hittite Empire had contracted to its core territories, having long since lost all of its conquests, made in the former era under Hattusili I and Mursili I -- to Arzawa in the West, Mitanni in the East, the Kaskas in the North, and Kizzuwatna in the South. Telepinu was able to recover a little ground from the Hurrians of Mitanni, by forming an alliance with the Hurrians of Kizzuwatna; however, with the end of his reign, the Hittite Empire enters a temporary "Dark Ages", the Middle Kingdom, lasting around 70 years, when records become too scanty to draw many conclusions.See alsoHistory of the HittitesExternal linksReign of Telipinu    Category:Hittite kingsca:Telepinus de:Telipinu es:Telepinu fr:Telibinu gl:Telibinus ko:텔레피누 it:Telepinu he:תלפינוש nl:Telepinu ja:テリピヌ pl:Telepinu ru:Телепину sh:Telepinu tr:Telepinus
