East(ern) Francia (Regnum Francorum orientalium), known variously as Francia Orientalis or the Kingdom of the East Franks, was the realm allotted to Louis the German by the 843 Treaty of Verdun. It is the precursor of the Holy Roman Empire.The Verdun Treaty divided the Carolingian Empire of the Franks into an East, West, and Middle. As this agreement did not abolish the entity of Francia itself, the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire is taken to coincide with the rise of the Ottonian dynasty. Therefore the Kingdom of East Francia lasted from 843 to the coronation of Duke Henry I of Saxony in 919; more commonly, the Holy Roman Empire is thought to begin in 962 with the Coronation of Otto the Great (translatio imperii).East Francia was divided into four stem duchies: Swabia (Alamannia), Franconia, Saxony and Bavaria (including Carinthia); to which after the death of Lothair II were added the eastern parts of Lotharingia by the 870 Treaty of Meerssen. The duchies decomposed over the next centuries, recently Swabia after the the end of the Hohenstaufen dynasty in 1268.From the 10th century, East Francia became also known as Regnum Teutonicum ("Teutonic kingdom", "Kingdom of Germany"), a term often used by the Papacy during the Investiture Controversy, perhaps as a polemical tool by Pope Gregory VII against the Emperor Henry IV in the late eleventh century.Robinson, "Pope Gregory", p. 729..See alsoList of German monarchsReferencesCategory:843 establishments Category:Franks Francia, Eastern Category:History of Germany by place Category:History of Switzerland Category:History of Austria Category:Czech historybr:Frankia ar reter ca:França oriental cs:Východofranská říše da:Østfranken de:Ostfrankenreich es:Francia Oriental eo:Orientfranka imperio eu:Ekialdeko Frantzia fa:فرانک خاوری fr:Francie orientale ko:동 프랑크 왕국 it:Regnum Teutonicorum he:פרנקיה המזרחית la:Regnum Francorum orientalium hu:Keleti Frank Királyság nl:Oost-Francië ja:東フランク王国 pl:Państwo wschodniofrankijskie ro:Francia Răsăriteană ru:Восточно-Франкское королевство simple:East Francia sk:Východofranská ríša fi:Itä-Francia uk:Східне Франкське королівство zh:東法蘭克王國
