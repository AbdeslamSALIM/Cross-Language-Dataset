He is currently part of the Danish Team CSC, where he has been since 2004.After winning the gold medal at the 1997 Under-23 World Championship as an amateur, Arvesen turned pro with Italian team Asics in 1998, where later Team CSC teammate Ivan Basso rode as a stagiare. The two riders moved on to Davide Boifava's team, Riso Scotti-Vinavil in 1999, which was renamed Amica Chips-Tacconi Sport in 2000, but Arvesen's three years in Italy didn't get him the results his World Under-23 Championships win had foretold. In 2001 Arvesen and Basso split up, as Arvesen moved on to Danish Team Fakta, where he experienced his most successful years culminating in a stage win in the 2003 Giro d'Italia.In 2004, Team Fakta closed, and Arvesen and sports director Kim Andersen both moved on to Team CSC. At Team CSC, Arvesen has been riding mostly as a domestique, but he managed to win the stage race Danmark Rundt as well as CSC Classic in 2004. For the 2004 Tour de France, Arvesen helped team captain Basso finish second overall, and he was named the toughest rider in the peloton when he managed to finish the three-weeks long race after crashing severely on several stages. For the 2005 Tour de France he would once more ride in support of Basso. This time Arvesen had the strength to ride aggressively, and on the 17th stage of the race, he got in a breakway with 16 other riders which lasted all the way to the finish line. As the leading group slowly disintegrated, he and Italian rider Paolo Savoldelli were the last riders for the sprint, but Savoldelli was too fast for Arvesen.Savoldelli Successful On A Day Of Change, LeTour.fr In the 2006 UCI ProTour spring season Arvesen got a handful of top 10 placings.
