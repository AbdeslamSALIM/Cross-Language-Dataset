, NIG (Neues Institutsgebäude), early 1960s, out of service since July 2007]]A paternoster or paternoster lift is a passenger elevator which consists of a chain of open compartments (each usually designed for two persons) that move slowly in a loop up and down inside a building without stopping. Passengers can step on or off at any floor they like.HistoryFirst built in 1884 by Londoner J. E. Hall as the Cyclic Elevator, the name paternoster ("Our Father", the first two words of the Lord's Prayer in Latin) was originally applied to the device because the elevator is in the form of a loop and is thus similar to rosary beads used as an aid in reciting the Lord's prayer.Paternosters were popular throughout the first half of the 20th century as they could carry more passengers than ordinary elevators. They were more common in continental Europe, especially in public buildings, than in the United Kingdom. However, a number of United Kingdom, multi-storey, university buildings were built in the early 1960s with paternoster lifts: they included buildings at Aston University; Birmingham University's Gisbert Kapp building, Muirhead Tower, and University Library (working until the early nineties?, but now gone (05)); Leicester University's Attenborough Building; Leeds University's Roger Stevens building, now closed, Salford University's tower block, now demolished; Sheffield University's Arts Tower, De Montfort University's Fletcher Building (now replaced with high speed lifts,) and James Went Building (now demolished) Oxford University's Psychology/Zoology building and Thom Building, and Newcastle University. Until the late 1980's St. Thomas' Hospital, Westminster had a paternoster for staff use, while one administrative building at AEE Winfrith had one until the late 1990s.Today, in many countries the construction of new paternosters is no longer allowed because of the high danger of accidents (people tripping or falling over when trying to enter or alight). Also, an increased sensitivity to the needs of the disabled, e.g., wheelchair users, has led to the paternoster's gradual demise.In April 2006, Hitachi announced plans for a modern paternoster-style elevator with computer-controlled cars and normal elevator doors to alleviate safety concerns.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hqrd.hitachi.co.jp/global/news_pdf_e/merl060301nrde_elevator.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://www.hitachi.co.jp/New/cnews/month/2006/03/0301.html&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522multi-car%2522%2Belevator%2Bsite:hitachi.co.jp%26hl%3Den&lt;/ref&gt;Surviving paternosters, still in use]]  Numerous working paternosters are known to survive in Europe:AustriaCity Hall of Vienna (at stairway 6 near the northern entrance)House of Industry, Schwarzenbergplatz 4, Vienna (oldest paternoster in Austria)Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour, Stubenring, ViennaMinistry of Defence, Rossauer Lände 1, ViennaFederal Computing Centre, Hintere Zollamtsstraße 4, ViennaVersicherungsanstalt für Eisenbahnen und Bergbau (Insurance institution of the railway and mining industries), Linke Wienzeile, ViennaThe Ringturm (Wiener Städtische Versicherung / Vienna City Insurance Headquarters Building), Schottenring 30, ViennaBelgiumA functioning paternoster can be found at the Flemish Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, where it is used as an art display.Czech RepublicThe Komerční Banka building on Václavské náměstí in Prague.

The building is not open to the public. A paternoster was installed there on construction, in 1966–67 (by architects Basil Spence & Partners) because each floor has a small area and it was anticipated that staff and students would make many short journeys. This expectation has been fulfilled, and the paternoster is considered to have been a very valuable device. Occupants of the Pontecorvo Building are currently being relocated to allow its demolition.There is a paternoster at Technology House, the headquarters of Boxclever, in Bedford, which was switched off on 11/02/08 due to health and safety reasonsThere is a paternoster at Thomson House, an office building at Birchwood Park near Warrington. Although covered over during re-refurbishments in 2005 due to maintenance costs, the paternoster is still operable if uncovered.ReferencesExternal linksA clip of new students trying a Paternoster in LeicesterThe Elevator MuseumList and photos of paternoster lifts Paternosters still in operation in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria Link to a tour of the University of Essex Albert Sloman library in England with picture of the paternoster liftPages about history of paternosters in the world and especially in the Czech Republic  List of all paternosters in Prague with information and photographs.
