 Veronica Mars is an American television series created by Rob Thomas. The series premiered on September 22, 2004, during UPN's last two years, and ended on May 22, 2007, after a season on UPN's successor, The CW Television Network. Balancing murder mystery, high school and college drama, and social commentary with sarcasm and off-beat humor in a style often compared to film noir, the series starred Kristen Bell as the title character: a student who progressed from high school to college during the series while moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. Thomas originally wrote ''Veronica Mars as a young adult novel; however the protagonist was a male. Episodes had a distinct structure; Veronica solved a different "case of the week" mystery while continually trying to solve a season-long arc. The first two seasons of the series had a season-long mystery arc, introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the season finale. The third season took on a different format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that would last the course of several episodes.Said to be "a little bit Buffy and a little bit Bogart", the critically acclaimed first season's run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode in the United States; the second season attracted an average of 2.3 million viewers. While a decrease from the first season, it included the series' highest rated episode with 3.6 million viewers. The third and final season saw an increase to an average of 2.5 million viewers. The series, described as a "critical darling", appeared on a number of fall television best lists. Veronica Mars also garnered a number of awards and nominations. In 2005, the series was featured on AFI's TV Programs of the Year. During the series' run, it was nominated for two Satellite Awards, four Saturn Awards and five Teen Choice Awards.Season synopsesSeason onesaid that his impression of Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) was "turned upside down" over the course of the first season.]] The first season revolves around Veronica Mars, a high school student and private investigator in the fictional Southern California seaside town of Neptune. As the daughter of well-respected County Sheriff Keith Mars, Veronica's biggest problem was getting dumped by her boyfriend, Duncan Kane, until the murder of her best friend Lilly Kane. After Lilly's murder, Veronica's life falls apart. Her father accuses Lilly's father, popular software billionaire Jake Kane, of being involved in the murder; this provokes Neptune's wrath and Keith's ouster as sheriff in a recall election. Veronica's mother, Lianne, develops a drinking problem and leaves town. Veronica's "09er" friends&mdash;wealthy students from the fictional 90909 ZIP code&mdash;force her to choose between them and her father; Veronica chooses her father. After being forced out as sheriff, Keith opens a private investigation agency, Mars Investigations, where Veronica works part-time. Veronica helps her father solve cases and conducts her own investigations on behalf of friends and acquaintances at school.Veronica discovers new evidence which suggests that Abel Koontz, the man imprisoned after confessing to Lilly's murder, is innocent. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder case, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an "09er" party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace Fennel, Neptune High basketball star; Eli &quot;Weevil&quot; Navarro, leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang; and Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie, Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, as well as those provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into in a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan Echolls, who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and went out of his way to harass her.Season twoThe second season begins with the introduction of two new cases: a bus accident that kills several of Veronica's classmates, and the death of PCH biker gang member Felix Toombs. A school bus full of Neptune High students plunges off a cliff, killing almost everyone on board. Veronica, who was supposed to be on the bus, makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed. Logan picks a fight with Weevil and the PCHers and ends up accused of killing Toombs, a charge he denies. Partway through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan's innocence and they team up to find the real killer. This season shows Veronica's life returning to much the way it had been before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the '09ers. However, her private-eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. '09ers Dick Casablancas and Cassidy &quot;Beaver&quot; Casablancas deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas, with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive, and takes a romantic interest in Jackie Cook.Season threeIn the third season Veronica, Logan, Wallace, Mac and Dick are freshmen at Neptune's Hearst College. Stosh &quot;Piz&quot; Piznarski and Parker Lee are introduced as the respective roommates of Wallace and Mac. The first mystery is established when Parker becomes the latest victim of the Hearst serial rapist, a storyline begun in the second season. Feeling guilty for not helping her, Veronica sets herself to catching the rapist. The next mystery, a murder, commences in the same episode the rapist is discovered. During the season, Keith begins an affair with a married client, Wallace struggles to balance academics and sports, Mac begins dating again after previous failed relationships, and Dick has a breakdown and appeals to Logan for help. The season also chronicles Veronica and Logan's failing attempts to maintain their relationship in the face of Veronica's mistrust. The couple breaks up midway through the season, and Logan begins dating Parker while Veronica goes out with Piz. Logan and Parker, however, soon break up due to his continuing love for Veronica. Keith is challenged in the sheriff's election by longtime rival P.I. Vinnie Van Lowe and faces charges after he destroys evidence incriminating Veronica. In the final scene, Veronica casts her vote for Keith in the election and walks off down a rainy street.Cast and characters, Parker, Wallace, Piz, Veronica, Keith, Logan, Dick, Mac and Don.]]The first season had seven regular characters. Kristen Bell portrayed the titular Veronica Mars, a high school junior and skilled private detective. Teddy Dunn played Duncan Kane, Veronica's ex-boyfriend and Lilly's brother. Jason Dohring played Logan Echolls, the "bad-boy" 09er son of an A-list actor. Percy Daggs III portrayed Veronica's best friend and frequent partner in mystery solving Wallace Fennel. Francis Capra portrayed Eli &quot;Weevil&quot; Navarro, the leader of the PCH Biker gang and Veronica's friend. Enrico Colantoni played Veronica's father Keith Mars, a private investigator and former Balboa County Sheriff. Sydney Tamiia Poitier played Mallory Dent, Veronica's journalism teacher at Neptune High. Although she was given series regular billing, Poitier appeared in only four episodes, but was given credit for seven. Poitier's removal from the series was rumored to be due to budget issues.Thomas, who said he "conceived the show as a one-year mystery", decided that he needed to introduce and eliminate several characters to be able to create an "equally fascinating mystery" for the series' second season. Thomas felt that he could not bring back the Kanes and the Echolls and "have them all involved in a new mystery"; he needed "new blood". The second season saw the introduction of Tessa Thompson as Jackie Cook, a romantic interest of Wallace and daughter of a famous baseball player. Previous recurring characters Dick Casablancas and Cassidy &quot;Beaver&quot; Casablancas were upgraded to series regulars. Dick, played by Ryan Hansen, was the 09er friend of Logan, a womanizer and former high-school bully turned frat boy. Kyle Gallner acted as "Beaver", Dick's introverted younger brother. Dunn, who portrayed Duncan Kane, left the series midway through the season. Thomas explained that the Logan-Veronica-Duncan love triangle had run its course, and to keep the series fresh, there would need to be "other guys in her life". |title=Ausiello on Teddy Dunn and ''Veronica Mars |accessdate=2008-09-23 |last=Ausiello |first=Michael |date=February 1, 2006 |publisher=''TV Guide'' He attributed Dunn's removal to fan interest dominating the Logan-Veronica relationship, saying "it became clear that one suitor won out".The third season introduced two new series regulars, Parker Lee and Stosh &quot;Piz&quot; Piznarski. Julie Gonzalo portrayed Parker, Mac's extroverted roommate at Hearst College and "everything that Mac is not". Piz, played by Chris Lowell, was Wallace's roommate at Hearst College and a music lover with his own campus radio show. Piz was named after the director of the pilot, Mark Piznarski. The character's role was to have another male friend for Veronica who was middle-class, and not upper-class. Thomas used the radio show as a narrative device to capture the mood of the university. Cindy &quot;Mac&quot; Mackenzie and Don Lamb, recurring characters in the first two seasons, were upgraded to series regulars. Mac, portrayed by Tina Majorino, was a computer expert befriended by Veronica. Lamb, portrayed by Michael Muhney, was the Balboa County Sheriff who won the office from Keith in the recall election spearheaded by Jake Kane.Casting, who portrayed Duncan Kane, originally auditioned for the role of Logan.]] Kristen Bell was chosen to play Veronica Mars from more than 500 women who auditioned for the role. Bell felt that it was "just luck" that Rob Thomas saw that "I have some sass to me, and that's exactly what he wanted". Bell thought that it was her cheerleader looks and an outsider's attitude that set her apart from the other women who auditioned. Jason Dohring, who played Logan Echolls, originally auditioned for the role of Duncan Kane. Ironically, Teddy Dunn originally auditioned for Logan, but ended up portraying Duncan Kane. Dohring felt that his audition for Duncan "was a little dark", and he was told by the producers that it was "not really right". The producers then asked Dohring to read for the role of Logan. The audition process for Logan was originally Duncan, and Dohring acted one scene from the pilot; bashing the headlights of a car in with a crowbar. During the final auditions, Dohring read two times with Bell and met with the studio and the network. When reading with Bell, Dohring acted the whole scene as if he had raped her, and tried to give the character an evil and fun feel. At the time of Dohring's audition for Logan, the character was only going to be a guest star in the pilot. Percy Daggs III auditioned for the role of Wallace Fennel two times before being cast, and he had to go through three tests with the studio and network executives. During his first audition, Daggs read four scenes from the pilot. Just before his studio test, Daggs read with Bell and had "a great conversation". He said that she "made me feel comfortable about auditioning" and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing Wallace as the season went on. Thomas described Amanda Seyfried, who portrayed the murdered Lilly Kane, as "the biggest surprise of the year". When casting a series regular, he was able to see all the best actors in town, mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular. When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time-to-time as "the dead girl", Thomas did not receive the same level of actors. Thomas said that he had "never had a more cut and dry audition" than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was "about 100 times better than anyone else that we saw, she was just spectacular". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.ProductionConceptionRob Thomas originally wrote Veronica Mars as a young adult novel for publishing company Simon &amp; Schuster. Prior to his first television job on Dawson's Creek, Thomas sold two novel ideas. One of these was provisionally titled Untitled Rob Thomas Teen Detective Novel, which formed the basis for the series. The novel had many elements similar to Veronica Mars, but the protagonist was male. Thomas's father was a vice-principal at Westlake High School in Austin, Texas, and the main character attended a "thinly disguised version" of the school. As Thomas had begun writing for film and television, he did not resume his teen detective idea for several years. Writing a novel could take months for Thomas, whereas a television script only took a "couple of weeks". As television scripts paid more, Thomas wrote the television version of the teen detective project before it became a novel as a spec script. Since no studio or network had asked him to write it, and he would not get paid unless it sold, Thomas said that "it was never a very pressing project for me". Tinkering with it from time to time, Thomas wrote project notes a year before he actually started writing the television script. Most of his original ideas made it into the script, but some changed drastically. Since Thomas wanted to use flashbacks, he had to shorten the timeline so that the murder could happen in a recent time. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed. Thomas intended to take the script to FX, HBO or Showtime, but gave UPN "credit" as they only wanted it a bit lighter to match their standards and practices. There was also a lengthy debate whether Veronica could be a rape victim; UPN eventually consented. Thomas changed the gender of the protagonist because he thought a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique. In the aired version of the "Pilot" episode, Lilly Kane was found by the pool in the same spot where she was murdered. However, Thomas stated that Lilly's body was originally going to be found in the ocean, and he had a plan for events which led to Lilly's body being dumped. When Thomas pitched the idea to UPN, the network felt that it was "too dark and creepy" for Jake Kane to dispose of his daughter's body to protect his son, and the idea was changed.Season and episode formatEpisodes had a distinct structure; Veronica solved a different "case of the week" mystery while continually trying to solve a season-long arc. The first two seasons of Veronica Mars had a season-long mystery arc, introduced in the first episode of the season and solved in the season finale. The third season took on a different format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that would last the course of several episodes. Thomas felt that Bell had been overworked in the first season, and the mystery involving Logan and Weevil in the second season was an attempt to give her some time off. He said that the mystery arcs of the second season had "way too many suspects, way too many red herrings", and that the third season needed a change. The third season was initially planned to include three separate mysteries that would be introduced and resolved in a series of non-overlapping story arcs. Thomas realized by talking to CW Entertainment President Dawn Ostroff that viewers got too confused by his original format, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying "subtle" motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have "a theory on whodunit" when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. This was changed when The CW ordered a 20 episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes. The second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was first changed from a six episode arc to a five episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. The third mystery was originally going to be "unlike any of the others we've done before". Previously, "nice characters" like Wallace and Mac had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was going to believe them as a suspect. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a situation where the Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, "key players with really interesting stuff to do".FilmingMuch of the series' scenes were filmed at Stu Segall Productions in San Diego. The setting of Neptune High for the first two seasons was located in Oceanside, California. The series' third season setting of Hearst College was mostly filmed on the campuses of San Diego State University, University of San Diego, and the University of California, San Diego. Assistant Location Manager Steven Lee said that the filming locations were decided by the director and by the production designer, Alfred Sole. Sole reportedly "really liked the look and feel of the school" and San Diego State University invited the series with "open arms". Taping at the university led to financial and employment benefits for the university and its students. Alumni worked as crewmembers while students worked as actors; half of the third season extras were students from the university's film department.Music[[Image:VeronicaMarsNoir.JPG|thumb|Rob Thomas released a Veronica Mars noir image which captured the series' theme and music.]] "We Used to Be Friends" by The Dandy Warhols was used as the series' theme song. Composer Josh Kramon was originally going to produce a noir version of an '80s song for the theme. However, Rob Thomas was "pretty much set on finding a song", and "We Used to Be Friends" was chosen right from the beginning. In third season, the theme song was remixed in a softer piano style with dark and vibrant electronic beats to reflect the more noir-influenced opening credits. Kramon wrote the original background music to convey the film noir themes. For the pilot, Thomas wanted "a really atmospheric, kind of modern noir type of vibe", and Kramon used sounds similar to that of Air and Zero 7. Kramon used "traditional sounds" for the series, but also processed and filtered them. Among the instruments used were piano, vibraphone and guitar. When using an acoustic piano, Kramon would use compression so that it did not sound like a traditional piano. Live bass and percussion was also used, as Kramon did not like to program them. The main instrument used was guitar, but Kramon felt that piano was "by far the most important instrument for working on TV shows, especially when you're doing everything yourself." A week before choosing the sounds for the episodes, the crew had a "spotting session", where they would discuss with Thomas and the producers which type of music was going to be featured. Kramon did not decide the songs to be featured, but composed and created the whole score. Since there was little orchestral music, and Kramon could play guitar, piano, bass and drums, he played the whole score without hiring a musician. Veronica Mars: Original Television Soundtrack, a song compilation from the series' first and second seasons, was released by Nettwerk Records on September 27, 2005. Thomas revealed that the primary goal for the soundtrack was to "get more publicity, which will in turn hopefully get more viewers for the show".DVD releasesThe first season of Veronica Mars was released in the USA under the title Veronica Mars: The Complete First Season as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on October 11, 2005. In addition to all the episodes that had been aired, DVD extras included an extended "Pilot" episode, over 20 minutes of unaired scenes and an unaired opening sequence. The same set was released on May 16, 2008 in Region 2, and on June 4, 2008 in Region 4. The second season was released in the USA under the title Veronica Mars: The Complete Second Season as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on August 22, 2006, Region 2 on August 15, 2008, and Region 4 on September 10, 2008. In addition to all the aired episodes, DVD extras included two featurettes: "A Day on the Set with Veronica Mars" and "Veronica Mars: Not Your Average Teen Detective", a gag reel, a promo trailer for the third season and additional scenes, including an alternate ending to "My Mother, the Fiend". The third season was released in the USA under the title Veronica Mars: The Complete Third Season as a widescreen six-disc Region 1 DVD box set on October 23, 2007. In addition to all the aired episodes, DVD extras included "Pitching Season 4", an interview with Rob Thomas discussing a new direction for the series that picks up years later, with Veronica as a rookie FBI agent; "Going Undercover with Rob Thomas"; webisode gallery with cast interviews and various set tours; unaired scenes with introductions by Rob Thomas; and a gag reel.Cancellation and futureIn January 2007, Dawn Ostroff announced that while she was pleased with the gradual ratings improvement of Veronica Mars, the series would be put on hiatus after the February sweeps to air a new reality series, Pussycat Dolls Present. When the hiatus ended, the series returned for the last five episodes of the season with non-serialized plotlines. At the 2007 CW Upfront, Ostroff announced that ''Veronica Mars was not part of the new primetime lineup and was "not coming back". Thomas created a trailer that took place four years after the third season finale, with the working title "Veronica in the FBI", and released it on the third season DVD. When asked if the FBI concept could happen, Ostroff said that the series was probably completely gone "in any form". Ostroff also said that Kristen Bell and Rob Thomas might collaborate on another project for the CW network, although it was unclear if this would be related to Veronica Mars or not. In June 2007, TV Guide writer Michael Ausiello confirmed that the cancellation of Veronica Mars was official.Thomas stated that he was interested in writing a feature film based on the series, in the interest of providing closure to the storylines and character arcs. In September 2008, Entertainment Weekly's Michael Ausiello reported that Thomas still planned to make a film, even though he was busy with other projects. He met with Bell to discuss the plot, which would likely involve Veronica solving crime in college rather than as an FBI agent. Thomas felt that the "FBI scenario was more of a 'What if...?'", aimed at getting a fourth season, and that he "would want to bring back our key players, and it would be tough to believe that the FBI stationed Veronica in Neptune." Ausiello later reported that Enrico Colantoni would be involved in the project. Colantoni said that he was fully aware of the talks taking place, adding, "cult shows have translated well into the film arena. Nothing's official, but they're talking about it." In addition to the feature-film possibility, Thomas has had a meeting with DC Comics to talk about a ''Veronica Mars comic book series.ImpactRatingsBelow, "rank" refers to how well Veronica Mars rated compared to other television series which aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. The television season tends to begin in September, of any given year, and end during the May of the following year. "Viewers" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series' regular timeslot. Although the viewer average may be higher for some seasons than others, the rank will not necessarily be higher. This is due to the number of programs aired during primetime. In some seasons there may be more regular programs aired during primetime than in others. The "season premiere" is the date that the first episode of the season aired. Similarly, the "season finale" is the date that the final episode of the season aired.SeasonTimeslot (EDT)NetworkSeason PremiereSeason FinaleTV SeasonRankViewers(in millions)1Tuesday 9:00 P.M.

Robert Abele of LA Weekly said "in this smart, engaging series about a former popular girl turned crime-solving high school outcast, the hard-boiled dialogue comes from its teen protagonist's mouth in a way that stabs any potential cutesiness in the heart with an ice pick." In her review, Paige Weiser of the ''Chicago Sun Times said that "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in. The show never soft-peddles the timeless, fundamental truth that high school is hell." Joyce Millman of ''The Phoenix felt that the series was "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of ''The Village Voice saw the series as "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as "a captivating star", and said that the series "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are". Kay McFadden of ''The Seattle Times called the series an update to the "classic California film noir through the prism of a hard-boiled high-school girl who may be this season's most interesting character creation". She described it as "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness."Veronica Mars was also positively received by other writers. Joss Whedon, who made a guest appearance in the second season episode "Rat Saw God", said that it was the "Best. Show. Ever. Seriously, I've never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn't making, and maybe even more than those ... These guys know what they're doing on a level that intimidates me. It's the Harry Potter of shows." Kevin Smith, who guest starred in the episode "Driver Ed", said that Veronica Mars was "hands-down the best show on television". Stephen King described the series as "Nancy Drew meets Philip Marlowe, and the result is pure nitro. Why is Veronica Mars so good? It bears little resemblance to life as I know it, but I can't take my eyes off the damn thing." Ed Brubaker called it "the best mystery show ever made in America".''Marvel Spotlight: Ed Brubaker/Billy Tan, Marvel Publishing, August 2006, p. 13.Although the series was a critical success throughout its run, criticisms began to emerge in the third season. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad described the third season as "disappointing", mainly because the episodes offered nothing new: "most fans of Veronica Mars felt that season three was clearly its weakest". Eric Goldman of IGN said that the main issue was the shift in the overall tone, with a lighter feeling than the previous seasons. He felt that Logan had been most affected by the tone change, robbed of his darker aspects and changed into an "increasingly extraneous character". Goldman felt that despite the concerns over final five episodes, the series ended with "three very strong episodes, with lots of strong dialogue and Veronica proving again just how tough she can be, and what a strong character she is". Goldman concluded that although third season "was very choppy", it still had "plenty of witty dialogue and a continually engaging performance by Kristen Bell as the title character". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette opined that Veronica Mars had taken a dive "creatively", from "the mopier version of its theme song to stalled storylines". The reviewer felt that "the arcing mysteries had grown less convincing and compelling as time went on and were too drawn out". Fox News Channel's Bridget Byrne pointed out that Veronica had "gone from punky to-dare we say-preppy" in the third season. Byrne further explained that "with her quick, bright wit and sharp eye for life's darker moments Veronica has left high school and is going to college, doffing her dark threads and spiked tresses for something a little more stylish."The series, described as a "critical darling", appeared on a number of fall television best lists. In 2005, the series was featured on AFI's TV Programs of the Year, and on the lists of MSN TV, ''The Village Voice, the Chicago Tribune, People Weekly and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It was named the second best series by Ain't It Cool News, fourth best returning series by Time, fifth best series by Newsday, PopMatters and San Jose Mercury-News, and sixth best by Entertainment Weekly and USA Today. In 2006, the series was ranked number one on the lists of Ain't It Cool News and the Chicago Sun-Times, and was ranked number six by Metacritic. In 2008, British film magazine Empire ranked Veronica Mars number 48 in their list of the "50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time". The magazine said that "smart storylines and witty riffs on pop culture pepper the scripts, while Kristen Bell lent ballsy charm to the title role and ensured that every episode of the show's three seasons was television gold. Its untimely cancellation was a slap in the face that still smarts to this day." Empire named "Not Pictured" the best episode of the series.FandomVeronica Mars attracted a loyal and devoted fan base which included internet communities. A group of fans calling themselves the "Cloud Watchers" organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading "Renew Veronica Mars". They also hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series' return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying "I love those people and they have been so good to me, but it's not going to happen". In May 2007, a Veronica Mars and Prison Break convention, "Breakout", was held featuring Jason Dohring and Michael Muhney. A second convention, "Breakout Beyond", was held from June 13 to June 15, 2008, featuring guest talks by Bell, Dohring, Capra and Hansen.Awards and nominationsYearAwardRecipientResult2005American Film Institute Award]] for Television Programs of the YearWonSatellite Award for Outstanding Actress in a Series, DramaKristen BellNominationSaturn Award for Best Television ActressKristen BellNominationTeen Choice Award for Choice TV Breakout ShowNominationTeen Choice Award for Choice TV Breakout Performance, FemaleKristen BellNominationTelevision Critics Association Awards for Outstanding New Program of the YearNominationTelevision Critics Association Awards for Individual Achievement in DramaKristen BellNomination2006Family Television Award for Favorite Father/DaughterKristen Bell, Enrico ColantoniWonInternational Cinematographers Guild Publicists Award for The Maxwell WeinbergPublicist Showmanship Award for TelevisionNominationSatellite Award for Actress in a Series, DramaKristen BellNominationSaturn Award for Best Actress on TelevisionKristen BellWonSaturn Award for Best Network Television SeriesNominationTeen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress: Drama/Action AdventureKristen BellNominationTeen Choice Award for Choice TV SidekickPercy Daggs IIINominationTeen Choice Award for Choice TV Parental UnitEnrico ColantoniNominationWriters Guild of America Award for Episodic DramaRob Thomas for "Normal Is the Watchword"Nomination2007Saturn Award for Best Actress on TelevisionKristen BellNominationSaturn Award for Best Network Television SeriesNominationWriters Guild of America Award for On-Air Promotion (Radio or Television)NominationReferences==External links==  Complete Episode, Soundtrack, and Character Information from marsinvestigations.net, a fansiteVeronica Mars CWiki on CWTV.comVeronica Mars on Warnerbros.comMovie Based On Series?Full Streaming Episodes of Veronica MarsPhotos of Veronica MarsCategory:Veronica Mars Category:2000s American television series Category:2004 television series debuts Category:2007 television series endings Category:American drama television series Category:CTV network shows Category:CW network shows Category:Serial drama television series Category:Teen dramas Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
