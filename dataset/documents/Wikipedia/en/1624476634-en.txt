He currently has a number of Manson guitars, as well as instruments by other manufacturers including a Fender 'Aloha' Stratocaster, a Gibson Les Paul DC Lite, a Gibson SG, Jackson Randy Rhoads (custom), a Parker 'Fly', a Peavey EVH Wolfgang and finally a Yamaha Pacifica. Bellamy's famous Manson shape has been compared to a Yamaha Pacifica, a Fender Telecaster, a Schecter and a Godin Triumph.The first and most famous is his silver Manson. Bellamy came up with the basic concept for this guitar and Hugh Manson helped him realize it. It has a built-in Z.Vex Fuzz Factory which gives Bellamy his distinctive sound and the ability to use controlled feedback. In addition, it has an MXR Phase 90 phaser, a Roland midi pickup and uses Seymour Duncan and Kent Armstrong pickups. All of his other Mansons follow this same basic design (apart from Bellamy's 7 string which was not originally built for him but for a local jazz guitarist) with some just having different pickups and finishes, as with his mirrored Manson, and some taking the idea even further. Matt's black Manson has a MIDI strip that controls a Digitech Whammy IV, when it is connected, a Z.Vex Wah Probe and a number of other built in effects. For the 2006 album, Black Holes and Revelations, he bought a new guitar, the "Black Kaoss Manson". The guitar features two P-90s, a Fernandes Sustainer System on the neck and a touch pad which connects to a Korg Kaoss Pad. He also bought the M1D1, which is similar to the Black Kaoss Manson but has a Bare Knuckle Nail Bomb humbucker in the bridge position and a Fernandes Sustainer System (FSK-101 model, which is the humbucker version of the latter one) on the neck. He is also known to use an Ibanez Destroyer on stage (Hullabaloo). Bellamy uses Diezel amp heads, along with Marshall Mode Four cabinets ("We use Marshall because when we jump on them they still work, and they sound good... real good!"), Soldano Cabinets and Line 6 digital effects. Most of Bellamy's rack effects are made with Line 6 modules; his studio rack set-up also includes a Nord Modular.External linksMatthew Bellamy guitar rigReferences Category:1978 births Category:English guitarists Category:English male singers Category:English rock guitarists Category:English rock musicians Category:English rock pianists Category:English rock singers Category:Falsettos Category:Living people Category:Muse members Category:People from Cambridge Category:People from Teignmouth Category:Seven-string guitaristsca:Matt Bellamy cs:Matthew Bellamy de:Matthew Bellamy es:Matt Bellamy fr:Matthew Bellamy ga:Matthew Bellamy gl:Matt Bellamy ko:매튜 벨라미 id:Matthew Bellamy is:Matthew Bellamy it:Matthew Bellamy lt:Matthew Bellamy nah:Matthew Bellamy nl:Matthew Bellamy ja:マシュー・ベラミー no:Matthew Bellamy pl:Matthew Bellamy pt:Matthew Bellamy ru:Беллами, Мэтью simple:Matthew Bellamy sk:Matthew Bellamy fi:Matthew Bellamy sv:Matthew Bellamy tr:Matthew Bellamy uk:Метью Белламі
