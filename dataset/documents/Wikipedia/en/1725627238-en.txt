He is known for his versatility, and can play anywhere in midfield.Club careerLeko's career began with NK Dinamo Zagreb in 2000 in his native Croatia, although he was not an immediate success. After spending some time on loan at NK Croatia Sesvete, he became a regular starter in 2001/2002, helping Dinamo Zagreb win the Croatian Cup, scoring in the final against NK Varteks and being named Man of the Match. Leko eventually moved to Dynamo Kyiv in 2002 for €4m (a then club record). In his first season in Ukraine, Dynamo won the double, with Leko playing 18 times.In February 2006, it was announced that Leko would be leaving Dynamo Kyiv, having turned down a new contract offer. He subsequently signed for AS Monaco on a free transfer on June 4, 2006.On June 3 2008 it was reported that Leko was a potential transfer target for Scottish champions Celtic FC. It was said that Leko had spoken to fellow Croatian and former striker of Celtic's rivals Glasgow Rangers, Dado Pršo, who had advised him that it would be a good move.Pršo talks up Celtic move to LekoRecently Chelsea and A.Madrid have also been linked with midfielder, but Everton have emerged as late favourites after a very slow summer for the sleeping giants. Although any sign of transfer movement would be welcome at Goodison Park one outspoken fan (Ezy) is close to suicide after another 'no frills' player is linked.International careerLeko made his Croatia debut in 2002 against Hungary, but was not included in the 2002 World Cup squad. He scored a goal in a 4-0 victory against Belgium in a Euro 2004 qualifier, and was included in the the final stage's squad, but only played 22 minutes during the tournament.Selected to represent the nation in the 2006 World Cup, Leko made two substitute appearances, against Brazil and Australia. He was also part of the final squad for Euro 2008.At the tournament quarter final clash between Croatia and Turkey, Leko was supposed to make his first appearance in the competition as a late substitute as Slaven Bilic wanted to put him on to hold on for a Croatian victory. However, officiating referee Roberto Rosetti disallowed the substitution from occurring as he also allowed Turkey an extra 2 minutes to find a late equalizer to send the game to a penalty shootout which Turkey eventually won.ReferencesExternal linksDynamo Kiev profile     Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatia international footballers Category:Dinamo Zagreb players Category:Dynamo Kyiv players Category:AS Monaco FC players Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:People from Zagreb Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Croatian First League players Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukrainear:جيركو ليكو de:Jerko Leko es:Jerko Leko fr:Jerko Leko gl:Jerko Leko hr:Jerko Leko id:Jerko Leko it:Jerko Leko lt:Jerko Leko hu:Jerko Leko nl:Jerko Leko ja:イェルコ・レコ pl:Jerko Leko ru:Леко, Йерко fi:Jerko Leko
