Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi (born March 26, 1940) is the current Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Before being elected Speaker in the 110th Congress, she was the House Minority Leader from 2003 to 2007, holding the post during the 108th, and 109th Congresses.Since 1987, she has represented the 8th Congressional District of California, which consists of four-fifths of the City and County of San Francisco. The district was numbered as the 5th during Pelosi's first three terms in the House.With her election as Speaker, she is the first female Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. She is the second Speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains, with the first being Washington's Tom Foley, who was the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi. As Speaker of the House, Pelosi ranks second in the line of presidential succession, following Vice President Dick Cheney. This makes her the politically highest ranking woman in American history. She was born five days before her fellow Democrat Barney Frank.Early life and careerPelosi was born to Italian-American parents in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest of six children, she was involved with [[politics]] from an early age.

She was elected as party chairwoman for Northern California on January 30, 1977. She later joined forces with one of the leaders of the California Democratic Party, 5th District Congressman Phillip Burton. And in 1987, after her youngest child became a high school senior, she decided to run for political office.Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.http://www.noiaw.org/pages/about/board_members.php&lt;/ref&gt;FamilyPelosi has five children: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, as well as seven grandchildren.

Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt, and took office on June 2, 1987.Pelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949, and Republicans, who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. Pelosi has kept this tradition going. Since her initial victory in 1987, she has been re-elected 10 times, receiving at least 75% of the vote. She has never participated in candidates' debates.Edward Epstein: "CAMPAIGN 2006: Eighth Congressional District / 3 challengers fight for Pelosi seat," San Francisco Chronicle, October 20, 2006, p.

She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that position. Since then, she has campaigned for candidates in 30 states and in 90 Congressional districts, making her a vital factor for the Democratic Party.In 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a minority and major party in the House.Blocking of impeachment proceedings against BushIn the wake of George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed that Democrats should pursue impeachment proceedings against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant.In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming Congressional elections — which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994 — Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was "off the table." (A week earlier, she had told the Washington Post that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, "you never know where" investigations might lead.)&quot;Democrats Won't Try To Impeach President&quot;, from the Washington Post 2006-05-12Since becoming Speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi has held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In early July 2007, antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan announced that unless Pelosi moved to impeach Bush by July 23, Sheehan would run against Pelosi as an independent candidate in the 2008 election."Sheehan considers challenge to Pelosi", by Angela K. Brown, Associated Press, July 8, 2007.On July 10, 2008, Pelosi said of Dennis Kucinich's article of impeachment against President George W. Bush, introduced that day, "This is a Judiciary Committee matter, and I believe we will see some attention being paid to it by the Judiciary Committee. Not necessarily taking up the Articles of Impeachment because that would have to be approved on the floor, but to have some hearings on the subject. My expectation is that there will be some review of that in the Committee.""Pelosi Says House Judiciary May Hold Hearings On Kucinich Impeachment Resolution", by John Bresnahan, CBS News, July 10, 2008 In the July 31, 2008, issue of Time Pelosi said, "You can't talk about impeachment unless you have the facts, and you can't have the facts unless you have cooperation from the Administration." Speaker of the HouseDemocratic nomination and election as SpeakerOn November 16, 2006, Pelosi was unanimously chosen as the Democratic candidate for Speaker, effectively making her Speaker-elect. While the Speaker is elected by the full House membership, in modern practice the election is a formality, since the Speaker always comes from the majority party.Pelosi supported her longtime friend, John Murtha of Pennsylvania, for the position of House Majority Leader, the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003. Pelosi and Hoyer had a somewhat frosty relationship dating back to 2001, when they ran against each other for minority whip. However, Hoyer was elected as House Majority Leader over Murtha by a margin of 149-86 within the caucus.On January 3, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio with 233 votes compared to his 202 votes in the election for Speaker of the House.

President Bush acknowledged this by beginning his speech with the words, "Tonight, I have a high privilege and distinct honor of my own — as the first President to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madam Speaker."]]With her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian and the first Italian-American to hold the Speakership. She is also the second Speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.In her speech to Congress she stated:"I accept this gavel in the spirit of partnership, not partisanship, and look forward to working with you on behalf of the American people. In this House, we may belong to different parties, but we serve one country."SFGate.com (2006). Text of Nancy Pelosi's speech. Retrieved January 6, 2007.During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the Speaker's position:"This is a historic moment — for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them."She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:"The election of 2006 was a call to change — not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end."As Speaker, Pelosi is still the leader of the House Democrats. However, by tradition, she does not normally participate in debate (though she has the right to do so), and almost never votes on the floor. She is also not a member of any House committees.Since her election as Speaker, the approval rating of Congress has dropped to a historic low of 14%, based on a Gallup poll, with over 70% saying they disapproved of Congress's job performance.CNN Political Ticker: Pelosi calls Bush a 'total failure'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Pelosi has also come under fire from Democratic activists for not being aggressive enough in confronting Bush.The &quot;Hundred Hours&quot; Prior to the U.S. 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly-empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress' term.Office of the Majority Leader Steny Hoyer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Later she said this referred to business hours rather than clock time, and began on the Tuesday (January 9, 2007) after the swearing-in ceremony on January 4.The origin for the name "first hundred hours" is a play on words derived from former Democratic President Franklin D.

They sent Bush a letter saying, "there is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror."

An Israeli spokeswoman said Pelosi would convey "that Israel is willing to talk if they (Syria) would openly take steps to stop supporting terrorism" in order to be "a partner for negotiations." The delegation talked "extensively" with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert about a relaunched 2002 Saudi peace plan with Israel, which Olmert welcomed as a "new way of thinking, the willingness to recognize Israel as an established fact and to debate the conditions of the future solution," but expressed reservations over the plan and invited Arab leaders to discuss them. The delegation met with the families of the three kidnapped Israeli soldiers during the visit and Pelosi said she planned to raise the issue when she met with Assad.At a press conference after her meeting with Assad, Pelosi said that she had conveyed a message from Olmert to Syrian President Assad saying that Olmert was ready to negotiate for peace. Olmert's office later clarified what he had actually told Pelosi, saying that "although Israel is interested in peace with Syria, that country continues to be part of the axis of evil and a force that encourages terror in the entire Middle East."Pelosi's Delegation Presses Syrian Leader on Militants Sources at the Israeli Prime Minister's Office at the time said that, "Pelosi took part of the things that were said in the meeting, and used what suited her."PMO: Pelosi did not carry any message from Israel to AssadThe Bush Administration disapproves of Syria's backing of Hamas and Hezbollah and says Syria is destabilizing Lebanon's government as well as fueling Iraq's violence by allowing Sunni insurgents to operate from its territory.

Bush stated that Congress was relatively inactive and said, "This is not a record to be proud of, and I think the American people deserve better", Pelosi responded by calling the president "a total failure, losing all credibility with the American people on the war, on the economy, on energy, you name the subject" and that Congress had been "sweeping up after his mess over and over and over again."Electoral historyPelosi's only close race so far has been the special election to succeed Sala Burton's seat after her death in February 1987.
