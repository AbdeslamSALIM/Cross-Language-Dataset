Located immediately northeast of the constellation of Pegasus, it is the northeastern star of the Square of Pegasus.HR 15, database entry, The Bright Star Catalogue, 5th Revised Ed. (Preliminary Version), D. Hoffleit and W. H. Warren, Jr., CDS ID V/50. As a connecting star to Pegasus, it is also known as δ Pegasi, though this name is no longer used; another such doubly-named connecting star is β Tauri.Alpheratz (Alpha Andromedae), The Internet Encyclopedia of Science, David Darling.

Although it appears to the naked eye as a single star, with overall apparent visual magnitude 2.06, it is actually a binary system composed of two stars in close orbit. The chemical composition of the brighter of the two stars is unusual as it is a mercury-manganese star whose atmosphere contains abnormally high levels of mercury, manganese, and other elements, including gallium and xenon.Alpheratz, Stars, Jim Kaler. Accessed on line August 13, 2008. It is the brightest mercury-manganese star known.SystemThe radial velocity of a star away from or towards the observer can be determined by measuring the red shift or blue shift of its spectrum. The American astronomer Vesto Slipher made a series of such measurements from 1902 to 1904 and discovered that the radial velocity of α Andromedae varied periodically. He concluded that it was in orbit in a spectroscopic binary star system with a period of about 100 days.A list of five stars having variable radial velocities, V. M. Slipher, Astrophysical Journal 20 (September 1904), pp. 146–148, . A preliminary orbit was published by Hans Ludendorff in 1907, Provisorische Bahnelemente des spektroskopischen Doppelsterns α Andromedae, H. Ludendorff, Astronomische Nachrichten 176 (December 1907), p. 327, . and a more precise orbit was later published by Robert Horace Baker.The orbit of α Andromedae, Robert Horace Baker, Publications of the Allegheny Observatory of the Western University of Pennsylvania 1, #3 (1910), .The fainter star in the system was first resolved interferometrically by Xiaopei Pan and his coworkers during 1988 and 1989, using the Mark III Stellar Interferometer at the Mount Wilson Observatory, California, United States.

Because of the difference in luminosity between the two stars, its spectral lines were not observed until the early 1990s, in observations made by Jocelyn Tomkin, Xiaopei Pan, and James K. McCarthy between 1991 and 1994 and published in 1995.The two stars are now known to orbit each other with a period of 96.7 days. The larger, brighter star, called the primary, has a spectral type of B8IVpMnHg, a mass of approximately 3.6 solar masses, a surface temperature of about 13,800 K, and, measured over all wavelengths, a luminosity of about 200 times the Sun's. Its smaller, fainter companion, the secondary, has a mass of approximately 1.8 solar masses and a surface temperature of about 8,500 K, and, again measured over all wavelengths, a luminosity of about 10 times the Sun's. It is an early-type A star whose spectral type has been estimated as A3V.Chemical peculiaritiesIn 1906, Norman Lockyer and F. E. Baxandall reported that α Andromedae had a number of unusual lines in its spectrum.Some Stars with Peculiar Spectra, Norman Lockyer and F. E. Baxandall, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Containing Papers of a Mathematical and Physical Character 77, #520 (June 21, 1906), pp. 550–553, . In 1914, Baxandall pointed out that most of the unusual lines came from manganese, and that similar lines were present in the spectrum of μ Leporis.On the enhanced lines of Manganese in the spectrum of α Andromedae, F. E. Baxandall, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 74 (January 1914), pp. 250–256, . In 1931, W. W. Morgan identified 12 additional stars with lines from manganese appearing in their spectra.Studies in Peculiar Stellar Spectra. I. The Manganese Lines in α Andromedae, W. W. Morgan, Astrophysical Journal 73 (March 1931), pp. 104–117, . Many of these stars were subsequently identified as part of the group of mercury-manganese stars,Table II, A study of the &lambda;3984 feature in the mercury-manganese stars, C. R. Cowley and G. C.

Smith, Astrophysics and Space Science 237, #1-2 (March 1996), pp. 77–105, , .,&nbsp;§3.4. In the case of α Andromedae, the brighter primary star is a mercury-manganese star which, as well as the elements already mentioned, has excess xenon. Ryabchikova, Malanushenko, and Adelman have observed that the secondary has excess barium in its atmosphere and suggest that it be classified as a metallic-line star.In 1970, Georges Michaud suggested that such chemically peculiar stars arose from radiative diffusion. According to this theory, in stars with unusually calm atmospheres, some elements sink under the force of gravity, while others are pushed to the surface by radiation pressure.,&nbsp;§4.Diffusion Processes in Peculiar A Stars, Georges Michaud, Astrophysical Journal 160 (May 1970), pp. 641–658, .

However, Adelman and his coworkers have discovered, in observations made between 1993 and 1999 and published in 2002, that the mercury line in its spectrum at 398.4 nm varies as the primary rotates. This is because the distribution of mercury in its atmosphere is not uniform. Applying Doppler imaging to the observations allowed Adelman et al. to find that it was concentrated in clouds near the equator.The Variability of the Hg II λ3984 Line of the Mercury-Manganese Star α Andromedae, Saul J.

(سرة alone is sirrah.) The word horse reflects the star's historical placement in Pegasus. Another term for this star used by medieval astronomers writing in Arabic was al rās al Mar'ah al Musalsalah (English: the head of the woman in chains),p. 35, [http://books.google.com/books?id=5xQuAAAAIAAJ Star-names and Their Meanings], Richard Hinckley Allen, New York: G.
