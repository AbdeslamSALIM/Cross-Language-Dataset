It is not commonly found above 60°N in latitude, except for Finland, Sweden and the Northwestern-most parts of Russia.This hedgehog is about 20&nbsp;cm in length, and lives in woodland, farmland, and suburban areas. It is nocturnal, and if alarmed will roll itself into a ball, protecting itself against potential predators with its spines.Unlike the smaller, warmer climate species, the West European Hedgehog may hibernate in the winter. It is omnivorous, feeding on a wide range of invertebrates, but preferring slugs, earthworms, beetles and other insects. The preferred arthropods are the millipedes Glomeris marginata and Tachypodoiulus niger as well as the ground beetle Carabus nemoralis. It is also known to eat frogs, small rodents, young birds and birds' eggs.This species has become a serious pest in the Western Isles of Scotland, where introduced hedgehogs eat the eggs of ground-nesting waders such as Snipe, Dunlin, Redshank and Lapwing. It is also considered a pest in New Zealand where it preys upon the native giant snails (Powelliphanta), weta, and various other native invertebratesBlonde hedgehogs have a rare recessive gene giving rise to beady, button-black eyes and attractive creamy-coloured spines; they are not strictly speaking albino. They are extremely rare except on the Channel Island of Alderney and are nicknamed "Alderney Spike Girls". A population of around a thousand is believed to exist. They allegedly carry no fleas, and are a localised island variant of Erinaceus europaeus.A low coverage assembly of the genome of Erinaceus europaeus was released by the Broad Institute in June 2006 as part of the Mammalian Genome Project.Protection listOn August 28, 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) in 1997 included the West European Hedgehog on the list of species and habitats in the UK that need conservation and greater protection. BBC NEWS, Hedgehogs join 'protection' listBAP Terrestrial Mammal ListIn Denmark, hedgehogs are protected by law.http://www.skovognatur.dk/DyrOgPlanter/Pattedyr/Insektaedere/Pindsvin.htm The Forest and Nature Department It is illegal to capture or hurt them, but it is accepted to house underweight hedgehogs found out during winter. Garden owners are encouraged to attract hedgehogs with a bit of dry cat food, to utilize their pest control abillities.References  External linksARKive Photographs and Videos.WildlifeOnline - Natural History of the European HedgehogCategory:Hedgehogs Category:Mammals of Europe Category:Fauna of Russia Category:Fauna of Finland Category:Fauna of Estonia Category:Fauna of Lithuania Category:Fauna of Sweden Category:Fauna of Norway Category:Fauna of Denmark Category:Fauna of Germany Category:Fauna of the Czech Republic Category:Fauna of Slovakia Category:Fauna of Poland Category:Fauna of Austria Category:Fauna of Slovenia Category:Fauna of Italy Category:Fauna of San Marino Category:Fauna of Liechtenstein Category:Mammals of Switzerland Category:Fauna of France Category:Fauna of Monaco Category:Fauna of Jersey Category:Fauna of Guernsey Category:Fauna of the United Kingdom Category:Fauna of the Republic of Ireland Category:Fauna of the Isle of Man Category:Fauna of Andorra Category:Fauna of Spain Category:Fauna of Portugal Category:Fauna of RomaniaCategory:Fauna of the Azoresbg:Западноевропейски таралеж ca:Eriçó comú cv:Чĕрĕп cs:Ježek západní co:Ricciu da:Pindsvin de:Braunbrustigel et:Siil myv:Сеель es:Erinaceus europaeus fr:Hérisson européen gl:Ourizo cacho it:Erinaceus europaeus lb:Kéisecker lt:Ežys hu:Európai sün nl:Egel no:Europeisk pinnsvin nn:Piggsvin oc:Erinaceus europaeus pl:Jeż zachodni ru:Ёж sk:Jež tmavý fi:Siili sv:Igelkott uk:Європейський їжак
