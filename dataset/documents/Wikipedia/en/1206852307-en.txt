In a regular heptagon, in which all sides and all angles are equal, the sides meet at an angle of 5π/7 radians, 128.5714286 degrees. Its Schläfli symbol is . The area of a regular heptagon of side length a is given byA = \fraca^2 \cot \frac \simeq 3.63391 a^2.The heptagon is also sometimes referred to as the septagon, using "sept-" (an elision of septua-, a Latin-derived numerical prefix, rather than hepta-, a Greek-derived numerical prefix). The OED lists "septagon" as meaning "heptagonal".ConstructionA regular heptagon is not constructible with compass and straightedge but is constructible with a marked ruler and compass. This type of construction is called a Neusis construction. It is also constructible with compass, straightedge and angle trisector. The impossibility of straightedge and compass construction follows from the observation that 2cos(2π/7) ≈ 1.247 is a zero of the irreducible cubic x''3 + ''x2 - 2''x'' - 1. Consequently this polynomial is the minimal polynomial of 2cos(2π/7), whereas the degree of the minimal polynomial for a constructible number must be a power of 2.

Let A lie on the circumference of the circumcircle. Draw arc BOC. Then BD = BC gives an approximation for the edge of the heptagon.HeptagramsTwo kinds of heptagrams can be constructed from regular heptagons, labeled by Schläfli symbols , and , with the divisor being the interval of connection.Blue,  and green  heptagrams inside a red heptagon.UsesThe United Kingdom currently (2008) has two heptagonal coins, the 50p and 20p pieces, and the Barbados Dollar is also heptagonal. The 20 eurocent coin has cavities placed similarly. Strictly, the shape of the coins is a curvilinear heptagon to make them curves of constant width: the sides are curved outwards so that the coin will roll smoothly in vending machines. The Brazilian 25 cents coin has a heptagon inscribed in the coin's disk.Some old versions of Coat of arms of Georgia (country) including Soviet days had used  heptagram as an element.See alsoHeptagramHeptagonal tilingExternal linksDefinition and properties of a heptagon With interactive animationApproximate construction methodAnother approximate construction methodPolygons - HeptagonsCategory:Polygonsar:سباعي (مضلع) ast:Heptágonu az:Düzgün yeddibucaqlı ca:Heptàgon cs:Sedmiúhelník de:Siebeneck es:Heptágono fr:Heptagone gl:Heptágono ko:칠각형 it:Ettagono ka:ჰეპტაგონი hu:Hétszög nl:Zevenhoek ja:七角形 no:Heptagon pl:Siedmiokąt foremny pt:Heptágono ru:Правильный семиугольник sl:sedemkotnik sr:Седмоугао fi:Seitsenkulmio sv:Heptagon th:รูปเจ็ดเหลี่ยม tr:Yedigen zh:七边形
