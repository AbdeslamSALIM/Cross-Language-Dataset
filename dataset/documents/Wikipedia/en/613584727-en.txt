 Nigeria is currently divided into 36 states and one federal capital territory. The states are further divided into 774 Local Government AreasBefore and after independence in 1960, Nigeria was a federation of three Regions: Northern, Western, and Eastern. Provinces were also used in colonial times. In 1963, two provinces were detached from the Western Region to form the new Mid-Western Region. In 1967, the regions were replaced by 12 states due to a military decree; only the former Mid-Western Region escaped division, and formed a single state following the restructuring. From 1967 to 1970 the areas of Mid-Western State and the Eastern Region attempted to secede, as Biafra. In 1976, seven new states were created, making 19 altogether; the Federal Capital Territory (now called Abuja) was established also. In 1987 two new states were established, followed by another 9 in 1991, bringing the total to 30. The latest change, in 1996, resulted in the present number of 36 states.Current States and FCTFormer state boundaries1991-19961987-1991See alsoExternal linksNigeria Category:States of Nigeria Category:Subdivisions of Nigeria Category:First-level administrative country subdivisionsar:ولايات نيجيريا de:Verwaltungsgliederung von Nigeria es:Organización territorial de Nigeria fr:Subdivisions du Nigéria ko:나이지리아의 행정 구역 ig:States no n'ime Naigeria it:Stati della Nigeria nl:Bestuurlijke indeling van Nigeria ja:ナイジェリアの州 pl:Podział administracyjny Nigerii pt:Estados da Nigéria fi:Nigerian osavaltiot uk:Адміністративний поділ Нігерії yo:Awon Ipinle Naijiria zh:尼日利亚行政区划
