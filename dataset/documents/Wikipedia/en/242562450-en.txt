It is located 4.1 km. (2.5 miles) from the center of Paris.NameThe name Gentilly was recorded for the first time in the 6th century as Gentiliacum, a royal estate of some importance where coinage was minted. The etymology of the name seems to be "estate of Gentilius", a Gallo-Roman landowner. However, some other researchers think that the name is connected with Latin gentilis (meaning "gentile", "pagan", "foreigner") in reference to foreign goldsmiths who may have settled in Gentilly in the Early Middle Ages.HistoryOn January 1, 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighboring communes. On that occasion, about half of the commune of Gentilly was annexed to Paris, and forms now the neighborhoods of Maison-Blanche and Glacière, in the 13th arrondissement of Paris.On December 13, 1896, about half of the territory of Gentilly was detached and became the commune of Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, leaving Gentilly as a rump commune after the 1860 and 1896 losses of territory.TransportGentilly is served by Gentilly station on Paris RER line .External linksOfficial website Category:Communes of Val-de-Marneceb:Gentilly de:Gentilly es:Gentilly fr:Gentilly it:Gentilly nl:Gentilly pl:Gentilly pt:Gentilly vi:Gentilly vo:Gentilly
