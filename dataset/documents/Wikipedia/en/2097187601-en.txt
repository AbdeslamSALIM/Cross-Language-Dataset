It was founded on September 28, 1891 as Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club by British railway workers, in the Peñarol suburb of Montevideo.Peñarol is named after its home neighborhood in Montevideo, which in turn takes its name from the city of Pinerolo in Italy. Club colors are yellow and black, deriving from the colors used in railway signs and barriers.Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (1891-1913).]]The Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club was founded on September 28, 1891, through the impetus of employees and workers of Montevideo's Central Uruguay Railway (British-owned) company, which operated in Uruguay since 1878. Of the 118 founding members of the club, 72 were British, one German and 45 Uruguayans.Due to the complicated that was the name for the spanish speaking followers, the club was usually known only as CURCC or "Peñarol" in honor of their town located 10 km from Montevideo. The first chairman of the Nobel institution was Frank Henderson, who exercised his office until the year 1899.In 1892, CURCC joined Football,leaving that way Rugby and Cricket somehow relegated,sports that previously had dominance in the club so far. The first match was disputed by the club facing a combination of students from English High and finished with a victory of CURCC by 2 to 0. In 1895, the club chose Julio Negron as captain, this being the first Uruguayan player to hold this award, because until that moment only English players have had this honour.Already in 1900, the CURCC along with Atletico Uruguay, Deutscher Fussball Klub and Albion, was a founder of the Uruguay Football Association League, debuting on June 10 with a victory 2 to 1 over Albion, the first official goals of the club were scored by Juan Pena and William Davies. That same year took place the first match versus Nacional,a rival that with the years became a traditional opposition. CURCC imposed in that first match by 2 to 0.At the end of the 1900 season CURCC won for the first time the Uruguayan championship,success that they repeated the following year. In 1903, CURCC was the first club to reach over ten goals in an official match of the Uruguayan championship after defeating Triumph by 12 to 0, mark equaled by Montevideo Wanderers in 1908. Double Digits Domestical&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt;After witnessing the first crowning of Nacional, and the suspension of the championship because of the civil war in 1904, CURCC were again champions in 1905 and 1907. However, this year W. Bayne took over the administration of CUR company. Bayne, rejected to preside the club,arguing the continuing economic problems and work it entailed, and that way being the first administrator of CUR railway company in refusing to be president of the club, going this role to the lower-ranking employees. This was the starting point for a series of conflicts between the company and the club ended with the demerger of the latter in 1913.In 1908, the club withdrew from the Uruguayan league in protest at the scheduling of the tournament, returning the following season, the same year disagreements happened in CUR after a group of supporters of CURCC burnt one of the wagons that were used to carry rival players.After a new championship in 1911, the following year a study commission was designed to reform sectors of the club, among the proposals included the participation of partners who were not employees of CUR (the railway company), as well as changing the CURCC institutional name to Peñarol.In June 1913, the assembly of CURCC rejected these proposals, the main reason for this was that the company wanted to dissociate the club from the Peñarol village, because of prejudices that had been formed around, mainly related to violence .However, in November of that year the CURCC approves the subjects to the section of soccer fans in view of the intent of these continuing with the club.That request was delivered to CURCC the November 15 1913. Finally on December 13 of that year, the football section dissociated itself completely from CURCC, retaining the name of CURCC Peñarol.Amateur Era (until 1931)On March 12, 1914 the CURCC Peñarol officially changed its name to the Club Atlético Peñarol,  change being approved by the Uruguayan league on March 14. On May 13 of that year the executive power of the government granted legal personality to the club.In their first years under the name of Peñarol, the club failed to make great performances, and during this period the most important event was the inauguration of the Las Acacias stadium on May 19, 1916. The first club championships, with its current name, arrived in 1918 and 1920. However, in 1922 the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) disaffiliated Peñarol, and other clubs which together gave birth to the Uruguayan Football Federation, parallel organ unrecognized by the AUF.In 1926, Peñarol won the championship of the so-called Provisional Council, competition that has arisen following the reunification of the Uruguayan football (AUF and FUF) occurred a year before, currently unrecognized by the AUF as an official championship.After performing for the first time a tour of Europe in 1927, Peñarol again lifted with the Uruguayan championship in 1928 and 1929. This last year Julio Maria Sosa was declared as the first honorary president of the club. The following year,Peñarol played for the first time an official match in the Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, which ended with a 1 to 0 victory over Olimpia.Professionalism and first titles (1932-1959)Uruguayan champion with Peñarol in 1938.]]On April 29, 1932, the AUF officially introduced professionalism, with the debut of Peñarol versus River Plate. That same year Peñarol won his first professional championship with 17 victories in 27 matches, which enabled them to accumulate 40 points, 5 over their nearest persecutor Rampla Juniors. Also in 1932, the club played its first classic of the professionalism against National, which the aurinegros won 2-0.Having placed second in the season 1933, in which John Young became the first scorer of the club in a professional tournament with 33 goals, Peñarol won the first of 4 championships in a row, between 1935 and 1938, in addition to the Championship Competition in 1936. During this period the club appointed Tochetti Francisco as the second honorary president of the institution.Peñarol closed the decade of the 1930 with a second place, after losing a match to National, in a tournament marked by the first strike of professional footballers in Uruguay.The years 1940 began with Peñarol new location in the second position. Situation in which they remained until 1943. The following year, Peñarol again took the title after beating in title game in double definition National 0 to 0 and 3 to 2, with goals from Luis Prais, Obdulio Varela and Ernesto Vidal. In 1945 the club repeated the title this time with Nicolas Falero and Raul Schiaffino as scorers of the tournament with 21 victories. That year also the club bought the land where years later was built the Peñarol Palace.After the strike decreed by the Uruguayan Mutualist of Professional Footballers in 1948 due to which the Uruguayan championship was suspended, in 1949 Peñarol got a new crown with 4 point lead over Nacional and with Oscar Miguez maximum scorer of the tournament.After positioned second in 1950, in 1951 Peñarol was again champion in the year to submit bids for construction of Peñarol Palace, which was finally opened in 1955. The decade of 1950 continued with obtaining the national championships in 1953, 1954, 1958 and 1959.Champion of America and the World (1960-1969)[[Image:Penarol1966.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peñarol champion of the Copa Libertadores in 1966.]]In 1960 Peñarol qualifyied as a champion of the Uruguayan championship in 1959, to the then newly created Champions Cup of America (current Copa Libertadores), competition that brought together the champions from seven countries affiliated to the CONMEBOL (the representatives of Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela did not attend the tournament). Peñarol made its debut in this tournament on April 19 versus Jorge Wilstermann of Bolivia with 7 to 1 victory, becoming the first goal of the match, and in the history of the cup, the one converted by Luis Borges. After eliminating San Lorenzo de Almagro in semifinals, the club won its first continental championship after beating Olimpia of Paraguay. In late season lost the final of the Intercontinental Cup, also created that year, after a draw against Real Madrid 0 to 0 in Montevideo, in front of 71,872 spectators, and losing 1 to 5 in Spain. At the local league Peñarol won a new Uruguayan championship.In 1961, Peñarol as champion Uruguay and America in the previous season, played a new version of the Champions Cup, reaching the same title in the final versus Palmeiras of Brazil, after winning by 1 to 0 in Montevideo, with goal by Alberto Spencer, and 1 to 1 tie in Sao Paulo. In the second half of the year Peñarol won the Uruguayan championship, and for the first time in its history, the Intercontinental Cup, by defeating Benfica of Portugal by 5 to 0 in Centenario stadium in Montevideo, having lost the first leg to 0 to 1.The next year, the club was one step away from achieving the consecration of the third Champions Cup, however, after losing in the first final by 0 to 1 and win the second leg, in a game marked by incidents, by 3 to 2 , a third definition was needed, played in neutral field at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires Peñarol fell to Santos, brazilian team that highlighted among others Pele, for 3 to 0, thus seeing impossible the chance of boosting a new continental championships. The consolation was obtaining the Uruguayan championship again, which earned the club get his first five consecutive years "gold quinquenio" (1958-1962).After a season without a title, which highlighted at the international level by obtaining the key with greater goal difference in the history of the Copa Libertadores after overcoming the 14 to 1 overall against the Everest of Ecuador (5 to 0 and 9 to 1), Copa Libertadores Trivia&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt; Peñarol won the Uruguayan championship in 1964 and 1965, this past year also reached the finals of Copa Libertadores in which they were defeated by Independiente of Avellaneda. However, in 1966 Peñarol won its third America consecration as champion after defeating River Plate in a third match definition played in Santiago, Chile for 4 to 2. That same year also won its second Intercontinental Cup after overcoming Real Madrid by 2 to 0, both in the Centenario and in Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium.In the following years, Peñarol continued getting achievements nationally and internationally, obtaining the national championships in 1967 and 1968, and the South American Supercup of Intercontinental Champions in 1969, tournament that brought together South American clubs that so far had won the Intercontinental Cup and was officially recognized by the Conmebol in 2005. During this period Peñarol had also the highest recorded unbeaten period in the Uruguayan championship, which was extended to 56 matches between September 3, 1966 and September 14, 1968, when they fell defeated by Liverpool 0 to 2.  This marked is also the longest unbeaten done by any South American professional club at the first division and the second if one considers the amateur stage, behind Boca Juniors. The transition (1970-1979)In 1970, Peñarol again reached the finals of Copa Libertadores, which lost defeated by Estudiantes of La Plata. It is worth mentioning that at that tournament the club achieved the greatest goal difference in the history of the competition after beating Valencia in Venezuela by 11 to 2. .Copa Libertadores Trivia&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt; The following year, in a tournament divided into two phases, Peñarol ranked second behind Nacional. After the first stage, the club accumulated 32 points, same amount that Nacional, however they were unable to keep pace in the final phase, which added 7 units, 1 less than the tricolours. After completing again as a runner-up in 1972, in 1973, the year in which arrived to Peñarol the historic scorer of Uruguayan football Fernando Morena, the club won the Uruguayan championship, repeated in 1974 and 1975. In 1974 Peñarol became the first Uruguayan club to win a Copa Libertadores match in Argentina, after defeating Huracan in Buenos Aires by 3 to 0. The arch rivals Nacional wouldn't reach the same honour until 2002 when they won over Velez Sarsfield.After finishing second in 1976 and 1977, the following year, Peñarol won its twenty-fourth championship, season in which Fernando Morena obtained two records, the highest number of goals in a season (36) and the largest number of goals in a game, converted 7 versus Huracan Buceo.The decade of the 1970's was closed for good obtaining a new national championship.Again at the top (1980-1989)After starting the decade of the 1980 reaching third place, in 1981 Peñarol was champion again after overcoming Nacional by three points. The champion team featured the figures of Ruben Paz, scorer of the tournament with 17, and Fernando Morena, who returned this season to the club by a record number until that moment, of U.S. $ 1,029,000. The following year, Peñarol won the Copa Libertadores after defeating Cobreloa away by 1 to 0, with goal by Fernando Morena in minute 89, who was also scorer of the competition with 7. In the second half of the year, Peñarol repeated the win of the Uruguayan championship, again with Morena as scorer with 17 entries, and won for the third time in its history the Intercontinental Cup, against Aston Villa of England by 2 to 0 at Tokyo,Japan.In 1983, the club had a discreet role at the local level, placing in seventh place, but not at all at the international level, in which in semifinals after imposing to Nacional, reached a new final of Copa Libertadores, however, failed to revalidate the title of last year falling to Gremio of Porto Alegre. In 1984 and 1986, the club rose up again with the Uruguayan championship, being the last of these conquests particularly unique since, the club's economic problems did not allow the team to play the first match of this year, losing points accordingly, however, it was agreed that in the case that Nacional surpassed Peñarol by less than 2 points of advantage, a definition match had to be played. At the end of season Nacional finished top of Peñarol by a point, and thus the final was played in which Peñarol won by 4 to 3 on penalties. In 1987, the club despiting the myriad economic problems as well as the youth of the squad, of 22-year average, was crowned champion of Copa Libertadores for the fifth time, beating America of Cali, 1 to 0 in the third and decisive match in Chile with a goal by Diego Aguirre 5 seconds away from the 120 minute of the extra time. As a curious fact, this was the third Copa Libertadores obtained by Peñarol in the National Stadium of Santiago in Chile.Despiting this success at the international scene, that year Peñarol did not make a good performance in the Uruguayan championship, positioning eighth.In subsequent years, although improving the performance, failed to award any tournament until 1993.The Second &quot;Golden Quinquenio&quot; (1990-1999)From 1993 to 1997 the club achieved its second quinquenio,five consecutive years winning the uruguayan championship. In the year 1999 becomes Uruguayan champion again.2000 -PresentThe Old RivalryThe first clash between Peñarol and its traditional rival, National, date from July 15, 1900, date on which Peñarol playing under the name of CURCC won by 2 to 0 with annotations by Aniceto Camacho. This is considered the oldest rivalry outside the British Isles. It was during this years in which CURCC was awarded the highest goal scoring derby in history after winning by 7 to 3, on November 1, 1911 for the Cup of Honour. Overall, considering official matches and friendlies, Peñarol as 'CURCC' and Nacional met in 59 opportunities, with 24 victories for CURCC and 20 for Nacional.First time under the current name, Peñarol faced Nacional on December 14, 1913. During the amateurism National obtained a slight advantage, but with the advent of professionalism Peñarol reversed this trend. Throughout this era, several episodes have been placed on the memories of the fans, between one of the most remembered derbies, was the "Classic of the leak, occurred on October 9, 1949 for the first round of the Copa Uruguaya. At the end of the first half Peñarol was imposing by 2 to 0, however, during the break before the second half, Nacional decided not to go to the field and withdraw leaving the stadium through the back doors of the locker rooms. While followers of Nacional justified that the abandonment of the match was due to disconformities with the arbitration,   fans "aurinegros" argued that the real reason of the withdrawal would have been the afraid to suffer several more goals. Since December 14, 1913, Peñarol-Nacional faced on 432 occasions, with 154 victories to Peñarol and 137 defeats.Therefore, when considering the eras in professional and amateur matches and friendlies, both local and international and including the results of CURCC, both clubs met 491 times, with 178 victories of Peñarol and 157 of Nacional, ending the remaining 156 games in a tie. SupportersPeñarol and Nacional compete for the preference of the uruguayans. Generally, it is argued that the country is divided into two, in allusion to the fans of either club.Indeed, a survey conducted nationwide by the consultant company FACTUM in 2006, revealed that Peñarol has 45% of the fans, while Nacional 35%, as published in the Uruguayan paper El observador. Encuesta a nivel país realizada por la Consultora FACTUM This also means that comparing the inquiry with investigations from other countries, Peñarol is nationwide, the most followed South American club by percentage.1) Peñarol : 45% of Uruguay2) Boca Juniors : 40% of Argentina3) Nacional : 35 % of Uruguay4) Clube de Regatas do Flamengo : 33 % of Brazil5) River Plate : 32% of ArgentinaThe Fan Base of Peñarol is known as The Caterva Aurinegra.Uniform[[Image:Replica_rocket.jpg|thumb|150px|Replica of the Rocket locomotive with yellow and black colors.]]Home KitSince its inception the colors that represented the CURCC and subsequently Peñarol have been yellow and black. This distinctive was taken from the railway, which in turn comes from the Rocket locomotive, designed and built by George Stephenson, winner of an aptitude test in 1829, thus making the contract for the Liverpool-Manchester railway line, from where the model expanded to the rest of the world.The first kit used by CURCC in 1891 was divided into two halves, black to the right and yellow and black stripes on the left, black trousers and socks. This kit was reintroduced for the Clausura 1996 tournament of the uruguayan championship and for the debut game of the Copa Libertadores 1998, in a victory 3-1 over rivals Nacional. This game was also the first of Peñarol hosted for the cup in the inner country,at the Campus Municipal of the Maldonado city. In 1901 and 1908 the club wore for some games a shirt with yellow and black in squares. The current kit of Peñarol -yellow and black stripes- dates from 1905 and since then has been used almost continuously with few variations, like socks alternating between black and yellow, as well as some variations in the number of stripes on the shirt.Alternative KitRegarding the away uniform, it is known with relative certainty that the first used was a squared shirt, similar to the kit used in 1901, but with black and orange squares. Since then there have been used different models, including one a with horizontal stripes in 1984, yellow shirt and black shorts in 1987, as well as uniforms totally black, gray or yellow used in the past decade. Additionally, other colours have been used for international friendlies, especially in the decade of the 1960 and 1970, like green against Inter Bratislava for the Montevideo Cup.On June 3, 1919, in Rio de Janeiro, for the "Roberto Chery Cup", Brazil and Argentina tied 3-3, respectively wearing Peñarol and Uruguay kits. The cup was then gifted to Peñarol, as Chery was the club's goalkeeper. He died on May of that year, after the 1919 Copa América in Brazil.The club uniforms adopted after Peñarol were:Olimpo de Bahía BlancaClub Almirante BrownClub GuaraníDeportivo Táchira Fútbol ClubThe StrongestStadium, where Peñarol frequently plays.]]Peñarol plays often in the Estadio Centenario, state-owned and which was inaugurated on July 18, 1930. It has a capacity of 76,609 spectators, while the playing field has dimensions of 110 x 70 metres. It is located in Battle Park, Montevideo.However, Peñarol has an own stadium, now known as Jose Pedro Damiani (formerly "The Acacias"), inaugurated on April 19, 1916 and has capacity for 15,000 spectators. Normally it is not used for lack of space and consistent infrastructure for the development of a game of the institution, although it has been used on several occasions, the last one in August 1997 against Rampla Juniors. The Vip stands and the entrance of Las Acacias were part of the Estadio Pocitos, where the first ever goal in World Cup history was scored by French forward Lucien Laurent.Currently there are negotiations by the investor group, Ficus Capital, and the club, to build a stadium that could meet the requirements to host not only local fixtures but also international competitions. Primarily the idea is to build a stadium of approximately 40,000 seats, or remodel "Acacias" to reach such capacity. However, the difficult economic and institutional situation of the club makes it difficult for the project to take place in the short or medium term.AchievementsNational competitionsUruguayan Primera DivisiónAmateur Era (9): 1900, 1901, 1905, 1907, 1911 (C.U.R.C.C.), 1918, 1921, 1928, 1929.
