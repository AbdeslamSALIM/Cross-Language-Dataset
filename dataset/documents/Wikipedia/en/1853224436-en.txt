 The Freedom Party of Austria (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs, FPÖ) is a political party in Austria. Its current leader is Heinz-Christian Strache. The FPÖ is generally regarded as a populist party and often classified as a nationalist party, although it has its origins in the national-liberal and pan-German traditions. In April 2005 former party leader Jörg Haider and other leading party members seceded from the FPÖ to form a new party, the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ).HistoryOriginsThe Freedom Party was founded in 1956 and had its roots in the Pan German movement, which included both elements of liberalism and nationalism. It absorbed the political currents of former parties such as the Landbund and the Greater German People's Party of the First Republic. Its immediate predecessor was the Federation of Independents, which had obtained 12% of the vote in the 1949 general election but later collapsed after internal strife.Even though many of the FPÖ's leading proponents such as Anton Reinthaller and Friedrich Peter were former Nazis, as a third party, it had a broad appeal among voters who felt uncomfortable both with the perceived deference to the Roman Catholic Church of the People's Party and the socialism of the Socialist Party. During the following decades, its adherents included anti-clerical liberals, business representatives striving for more economic liberalism and pan-German nationalists, some of whom were sympathetic to certain Nazi policies. Even today, the lower ranks of the party organisation are largely made up of members of German-nationalist Studentenverbindungen. However, this has rarely stopped other parties from cooperating with it, for instance Bruno Kreisky's minority government (1970&ndash;1971) could survive only because the FPÖ agreed to tolerate it.In 1980, the FPÖ's liberal wing gained control under the leadership of Norbert Steger, who entered into a coalition government with the Social Democrats in 1983. Since results of local elections and polls showed that this threatened the party's existence, discontent with the party leadership grew, which enabled Jörg Haider to take over the party leadership at the Innsbruck convention of 1986 with the help of the party's German-nationalist wing. Social Democratic Chancellor Franz Vranitzky subsequently announced a fresh election and then entered into a coalition with the People's Party.Jörg Haider In 1970 Jörg Haider became the leader of the FPÖ youth movement, where he was perceived to be a liberal. As a federal deputy in Carinthia he gained some notoriety and popularity in attacking linguistic privileges of the Slovene minority. Haider rose rapidly through the party ranks, becoming party leader in 1986.The FPÖ attracted since then more and more protest votes and those who desired no association with the other major parties. The party's mixture of populism and anti-establishment themes propagated by its aggressive leader steadily gained support over the years, reaching about 27% of the vote in the 1999 general election.Jörg Haider became Governor of Carinthia in 1989 for the first time, but had to resign in 1991 following a remark in the regional parliament. A speaker in the parliament called Haider's plan of reducing unemployment benefits a "forced work placement reminiscent of Nazi policies." Haider replied by saying: "It would not be like the Third Reich, because the Third Reich developed a proper employment policy, which your government in Vienna has not once produced." He was appointed Deputy Governor of Carinthia the week after he had to resign and regained the post of Governor in 1999 and has held it since then.In 1993 most of the remaining liberals within the FPÖ, including four members of the National Council (lower house of the parliament), seceded from the party to found the Liberal Forum. This party managed to remain in parliament until 1999. Following the split with the liberal wing, the FPÖ left the Liberal International in 1993. The Liberal Forum party took over that membership in its place.The coalition governmentIn the 1999 general election, the FPÖ received 27% of the votes, more than in any election before; they even beat the People's Party by a small margin (about 400 votes, with 4.6 million Austrians voting), which had until then always taken first or second place in national elections.In early 2000, the FPÖ joined a coalition government with Wolfgang Schüssel's People's Party. The Freedom Party had to take a junior part in the coalition, as otherwise the ÖVP would have continued their coalition with the SPÖ. There was a great degree of outrage both within the country and internationally. The heads of government of the other 14 EU members decided to cease cooperation with the Austrian government, as it was felt in many countries that the cordon sanitaire against coalitions with parties considered as right-wing extremists, which had mostly held in Western Europe since 1945, had been breached. For example, for several months, other national leaders refused to shake hands and socialize with members of the Schüssel government. This was described as "sanctions" by representatives of the ÖVP and FPÖ, and supporters of the government often blamed the Social Democrats and President Thomas Klestil for them, and questioned their loyalty to the country. The EU leaders soon saw that their measures were counterproductive, and returned to normality during the summer of 2000, even though the coalition remained unchanged.Contextually with the formation of the Schüssel government, Haider stepped down from the leadership of the Freedom Party. This was widely seen as a cynical move to appease foreign criticism, as he was alleged to control the party from behind the scenes. He retained the governorship of Carinthia.Even though the FPÖ members of the government and the party leadership at that time consisted largely of politicians such as Susanne Riess-Passer and Karl-Heinz Grasser, whose career had so far depended entirely on Haider's populism, Haider himself appeared to be increasingly discontent with the situation, as his party began to lose in regional and local elections, since it was no longer in the position to gain votes by criticizing the government. This caused a dispute within the party, which escalated at a special party convention at Knittelfeld that caused three leading members of the government to resign (so-called Knittelfeld Putsch).The 2002 general election resulted in a landslide victory (42.3% of the vote) for the People's Party. The Freedom Party, which had been stronger than the People's Party in 1999, was reduced to 10.2% of the vote, less than half its previous share. Nevertheless, the coalition government of the People's Party and Freedom Party was renewed in February 2003.In September 2003 regional elections, notably in Upper Austria, also brought heavy losses, with the Greens for the first time receiving more votes than the Freedom Party. The 2004 European Parliament election reduced the Freedom Party's share of the vote to a mere 6%. Similar results were achieved at several state and local elections. The FPÖ seemed to have largely lost its appeal to voters, except in Carinthia, where it gained 42.5% in the state election of 7 March 2004. However, that success, most likely resting entirely on Haider's personal charisma, appeared to be rapidly losing its effectiveness in the rest of the country.Secession of Jörg Haider and the BZÖIn early 2005 the FPÖ was increasingly ridden by internal strife between populist and nationalist factions. Its bargaining position within the coalition government has already been considered to be low by many political observers for some time, which has allowed Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel to pursue largely policies favoured by his own party.On 4 April 2005 several prominent party members (among them former chairman Jörg Haider, his sister and current Chairwoman Ursula Haubner, Vice Chancellor Hubert Gorbach, as well as most of the 18 representatives in Parliament) left the party and founded a new party called Alliance for the Future of Austria. Regional party organizations seem to be split between the two factions. In Haider's stronghold Carinthia the old FPÖ completely became an organization of the BZÖ. Austria's chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel immediately changed his coalition with the FPÖ into a cooperation with the BZÖ. On 23 April Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as new chairman of the party, following Hilmar Kabas, who had taken this position temporarily after Ursula Haubner's resignation.In the first election where FPÖ and BZÖ competed against each other (in Styria on 2 October 2005), the FPÖ lost all its seats in the regional parliament, but still obtained a far larger number of votes (4.6%) than Haider's BZÖ (1.7%). It was reduced to a share of 5.7% in the Burgenland state election one week later, where the BZÖ did not run.However, the FPÖ did reasonably well in the Vienna elections on 23 October, where Heinz-Christian Strache was the leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a share of 14.9% (down from more than 20%), while the BZÖ gained only 1.2%. As a result, the BZÖ has been all but eliminated in all states except for Carinthia and the federal level.The FPÖ did reasonably well in the 2006 general election and gained a further 3 seats (21 in total). However the Greens gained 4 seats and became tied in seats as the third largest party on absentee votes. The BZÖ only barely made it past the 4% threshold needed to enter parliament and received 7 seats. The subsequent "grand coalition" between SPÖ and ÖVP left both parties in opposition.PlatformThe platform of the Freedom Party is based on five main points http://www.fpoe.at/index.php?id=393:No accession of Turkey into the European UnionNo intrusion of EU policy in AustriaNo increase in the Austrian contribution to the EURestrict Austrian citizenship lawStop the misuse of the asylum systemPopular support+ National Council of AustriaElection year# of total votes% of overall vote# of seats1956]]283,7496.5%61959]]336,1107.7%81962]]313,8957.0%81966]]242,5705.4%61970]]253,4255.5%61971]]248,4735.5%101975]]249,4445.4%101979]]286,7436.1%111983]]241,7895.0%121986]]472,2059.7%181990]]782,64816.6%331994]]1,042,33222.5%421995]]1,060,17522.0%411999]]1,244,08726.9%522002]]491,32810.0%182006]]519,59811.0%212008]]857,02817.5%34LeadershipThe chart below shows a timeline of the FPÖ chairpersons and the Chancellors of Austria since 1956.
