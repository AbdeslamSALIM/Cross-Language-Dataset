At the age of 17, he found out that local band L.A.P.D. (which consisted of James Shaffer and Reginald Arvizu) was searching for a drummer. He auditioned and was chosen, but needed permission from his mother to go with the band. In fact, she would often drop him off and pick him up from practices. After L.A.P.D. broke up, David was recruited by Mike Muir to join Infectious Grooves but opted out to remain with his bandmates. When Jonathan Davis joined the band, they changed the name to KoЯn and Welch, Shaffer and Arvizu took up pseudonyms, while Silveria and Davis remained using their given names.Silveria divorced his wife Shannon in 2002, going so far as covering up a tattoo of her name with a huge tribal tattoo. He has two children, David Jr. and Sofie Aurora.Silveria has been seen playing bass while performing the song "Earache My Eye" live.Silveria had to undergo surgery to remove an extra rib which was causing nerve problems in his left arm. His wrist gave out in Fargo, ND during the song "It's Gonna Go Away". He sat out the rest of the "Sick and Twisted 2000" and "Summer Sanitarium Tours". Mike Bordin filled in for him. Silveria then returned for the album recording of Untouchables and some performances since (Silveria's own explanation for the issue is that "I hit too fucking hard").HiatusAt 13 December of 2006, it was announced that Silveria would be going on hiatus, but after a long period of waiting, it was said by Jonathan Davis on a Swedish radio station after being asked if Silveria will be on the next album (Untitled, 31 July 2007), He responded : "I don't know, probably not."http://www.bandit.se/sound.php?id=8-20080214105223-0&lt;/ref&gt; He has since started running his sushi restaurants and bar/grill joints, choosing a new life of relative anonymity when compared to drumming for a well-known rock band.Silveria has not given any interviews since he went on his "hiatus." He since has dedicated his time to his children and running his steak house and sushi restaurant. In a recent interview with HeadBanger's Blog, Jonathan Davis said that he had not heard anything from David since his "hiatus."David's EquipmentThe following is a listing of the drums and equipment used by David Silveria during his musical career with KoЯn:David's ''KoЯn'' Tour Kit (1993-2006):Tama Starclassic Maple Custom Drums & Paiste Signature Cymbals :Tama Drums - Black22x18" Bass Drum14x6.5" Signature Snare Drum10x5.5" Rack Tom12x6.5" Rack Tom15x15" Floor Tom16x16" Floor Tom20x16" Gong Bass Drum8" Signature Splash10" Signature Splash15" Signature Heavy Hi-Hat (custom)18" Signature Power Crash20" Signature Power Crash20" Signature Power Ride18" Signature Heavy China13" Signature Exotic/Percussion Mega Cup ChimeKudarat Agong8" Signature BellCombo LataHardwareIron Cobra Flexi Glide Twin PedalIron Cobra Lever Glide Hi-Hat StandSultan Kudarat AgongCombo LataCustom chrome Tama rack including the footboards, clamps, memory locks, and star-cast mounting systemRemo Drum Heads (coated Ambassador, clear Emperors, clear Powerstroke 3)Pete Englehart Ribbon Crasher PercussionD Drum Triggers and Roland PadsVater David Silveria's KoЯn DSK Tour sticksCustom TAMA ROC 'N ThroneSultan Kudarat Agong Combo LataReferences Category:Korn members Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:American rock drummers Category:American heavy metal musicians Category:Heavy metal drummers Category:People from Alameda County, California Category:California musicians Silveria, David Category:Nu metal drummersbg:Дейвид Силверия da:David Silveria de:David Silveria es:David Silveria fr:David Silveria it:David Silveria nl:David Silveria pl:David Silveria pt:David Silveria ru:Сильверия, Дэвид sl:David Silveria fi:David Silveria sv:David Silveria
