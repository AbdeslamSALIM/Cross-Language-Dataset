 Michael Laurence Nyman, CBE (born 23 March 1944, London) is an English composer of minimalist music, pianist, librettist and musicologist, perhaps best known for the many scores he wrote during his lengthy collaboration with the filmmaker Peter Greenaway, and his multi-platinum soundtrack album to Jane Campion's The Piano. His operas include The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, Noises, Sounds &amp; Sweet Airs, Facing Goya, Man and Boy: Dada, and Love Counts, and he has written six concerti, four string quartets, and many other chamber works, many for his Michael Nyman Band, with and without whom he tours as a performing pianist. Nyman has stated his preference for writing opera to other sorts of music.MICHAEL NYMAN talks to John Leeman about his opera Man and Boy: Dada http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2005/Dec05/Nyman_Interview.htmBiographyMichael Nyman was born to a working class secular Jewish family in Stratford, Newham who made their living assembling furs. He was raised in Chingford, North East London, and spent the time he was supposed to be going to bar mitzvah classes remaining on the bus and riding to St. Albans or Woolwich. He also collected bus tickets as a hobby (a plot point in Man and Boy: Dada). He was rejected from the Yardley Lane Primary School choir as a "tuneless growler", but his musical potential was observed by teacher Leslie Winters when he transferred to Sir George Monoux Grammar School. As the Nymans owned no musical instruments, Nyman spent copious time in the Winters household, and Leslie's brother, Geoffrey Winters, recommended Nyman to the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he had studied with Alan Bush.Pwyll ap Siôn. The Music of Michael Nyman: Texts, Contexts and Intertexts Aldershot, Hants: Ashgate, 2007. pp 15-16.Nyman was accepted at the Royal Academy in September, 1961, and studied with Bush and Thurston Dart, focusing on piano and seventeenth century baroque music. He won the Howard Carr Memorial Prize for composition in July 1964.Siôn, 18 In 1969, he provided the libretto for Harrison Birtwistle's opera, Down by the Greenwood Side and directed the short film Love Love Love (based on, and identical length to, The Beatles' "All You Need Is Love"Pwyll ap Siôn. The Music of Michael Nyman. Burlington, Vermont: Ashgate Publishing, 2007. p. 83) before settling into music criticism, where he is generally acknowledged to have been the first to apply the term "minimalism" to music (in a 1968 article in The Spectator magazine about the English composer Cornelius Cardew). He wrote introductions for George Frideric Handel's Concerti Grossi, Op. 6 and conducted the most important interview with George Brecht in 1976.Nyman, who had studied with the noted Baroque music scholar Thurston Dart at King's College London, drew frequently on early music sources in his scores for Greenaway's films: Henry Purcell in The Draughtsman's Contract and The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover (which included Memorial and Miserere Paraphrase), Heinrich Ignaz Franz von Biber in A Zed and Two Noughts, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in Drowning by Numbers, and John Dowland in Prospero's Books, largely at the request of the director.Nyman says he discovered his aesthetic playing the aria, "Madamina, il catalogo è questo" from Mozart's Don Giovanni on his piano in the style of Jerry Lee Lewis, which "dictated the dynamic, articulation and texture of everything I've subsequently done."Andrew Ford. "Jerry Lee Lewis Plays Mozart." Composer to Composer London: Quartet Books, 1993. pp 192-195, p 194Nyman's popularity increased significantly after he wrote the score to Jane Campion's award-winning 1993 film The Piano. The album became a classical music best-seller. Although Nyman's score was central to the movie, he did not receive an Academy Award nomination despite being nominated for both a British Academy Award and a Golden Globe. He has scored numerous other films, the majority of them art films from Europe. His few forays into Hollywood composing have been Gattaca, Ravenous (with musician Damon Albarn), and The End of the Affair. He wrote settings to various texts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for "Letters, Riddles and Writs", part of Not Mozart. He has also produced a soundtrack for the silent film Man with the Movie Camera.Among Nyman's better known non-film works are the opera Noises, Sounds &amp; Sweet Airs (1987), for soprano, alto, tenor and instrumental ensemble (based on Nyman's score for the ballet La Princesse de Milan); Ariel Songs (1990) for soprano and band; MGV (Musique à Grande Vitesse) (1993) for band and orchestra; concertos for saxophone, piano (based on The Piano score), violin, harpsichord, trombone, and saxophone & cello recorded by John Harle and Julian Lloyd Webber; the opera The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), based on a case-study by Oliver Sacks; and four string quartets. Recently, he produced a new opera on the subject of cloning on a libretto by Victoria Hardie titled Facing Goya, an expansion of their one-act opera Vital Statistics. The lead, a widowed art banker, is written for contralto and the role was first created by Hilary Summers. His newest operas are Man and Boy: Dada (2003) and Love Counts (2005), both on libretti by Michael Hastings.On children's television shows, he has created the music for Katie and Orbie and Titch.Many of Nyman's works are written for his own ensemble, the Michael Nyman Band, a group formed for a 1976 production of Carlo Goldoni's Il Campiello. Originally made up of old instruments such as rebecs and shawms alongside more modern instruments like the saxophone in order to produce as loud a sound as possible without amplification, it later switched to a fully amplified lineup of string quartet, three saxophones, trumpet, horn, bass trombone, bass guitar and piano. This line up has been variously altered and augmented for some works.Nyman also published an influential book in 1974 on experimental music called [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0521653835 Experimental Music: Cage and Beyond] (Catalan, Spanish and French translations), which explored the influence of John Cage on classical composers. In the 1970s, Nyman was a member of the infamous Portsmouth Sinfonia — the self-described World's Worst Orchestra — playing on their recordings and in their concerts. He was the featured pianist on the orchestra's recording of Bridge Over Troubled Waters on the Martin Lewis-produced 20 Classic Rock Classics album on which the Sinfonia gave their unique interpretations to the pop and rock repertoire of the 1950s-1970s. Nyman created a similar group called Foster's Social Orchestra, which specialized in the work of Stephen Foster. One of their tracks appeared in the film Ravenous and an additional track, not used in the film, appeared on the soundtrack album.He has also recorded pop music, with the Flying Lizards; a version of his Bird List from the soundtrack to Peter Greenaway's The Falls appears on their album Fourth Wall under the title "Hands 2 Take."On 7 July 2007 Nyman performed at Live Earth in Japan.Personal lifeHe is married to Aet Nyman and has two daughters, Molly and Martha. His first string quartet quotes "Unchained Melody" in homage to Aet, who appears in Greenaway's The Falls, for which he also composed music. Molly is a composer in her own right; in collaboration with Harry Escott she has written several film scores including for The Road to Guantanamo by her father's frequent collaborator, Michael Winterbottom. Martha is a development researcher for the BBC. Michael Nyman supports Queens Park Rangers football club.Nyman and Aet separated, and Nyman was publicly humiliated over a brief relationship started on MySpace with Jane Slavin.Richard Kay.
