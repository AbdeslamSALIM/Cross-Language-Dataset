The obverses showed the emblem of Algeria, while the reverses carried the values in Eastern Arabic numerals. In later decades, coins were issued sporadically with various commemorative subjects. However, the 1 and 2 santeem were not struck again, whilst the 5, 10 and 20 santeem were last struck in the 1980s.In 1992, a new series of coins was introduced consisting of ¼, ½, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinar. The 10, 20, 50 and 100 dinar coins are bimetallic.Coins in general circulation are 5 dinar and higher. Following the massive inflation which accompanied the transition to a more capitalist economy in the early 1990s, the santeem and fractional dinar coins have dropped out of general circulation, whilst the 1 and 2 dinar coins are rarely used.http://www.bank-of-algeria.dz/piece7.htm Nonetheless, prices are typically quoted in santeem in everyday speech; thus a price of 100 dinar is read as عشر الاف ("ten thousand").
