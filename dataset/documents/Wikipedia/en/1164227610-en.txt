He succeeded to the throne of Norway upon the death of his father Olav V on 17 January 1991. The son of the then Crown Prince Olav and of Princess Märtha of Sweden, Harald was born at the Crown Prince Residence at Skaugum, Asker, near Oslo.Harald became the first Norwegian-born prince since the birth of Olav IV in 1370. Harald V is the formal head of the Church of Norway and the Norwegian Armed Forces. As he is the great-grandson of King Edward VII, he is also in the line of succession to the British throne. He is a second cousin to Queen Elizabeth II.King Harald has two sisters, Princess Ragnhild, Mrs. Lorentzen (born 1930), living in Brazil, and Princess Astrid, Mrs. Ferner (born 1932), living in Oslo.Childhood and educationWhen Prince Harald was born in Skaugum he was the first heir to the throne of Norway to be born in Norway for several hundred years. The young prince was baptised in the Royal Chapel in the Royal Palace in Oslo on 31 March by bishop Johan Lunde.In 1940 the entire royal family had to flee their homes because of the German invasion. The dramatic journey northbound was marked by the Germans' repeated attempts to kill the King through bombing. It was deemed safer for the family to split up. The King and Crown Prince Olav would remain in Norway and the Crown Princess was to make her way to Sweden with the three children. The latter party reached Sweden on the night of 10 April, but although Crown Princess Märtha was Swedish-born, they encountered problems at the border station. According to Princess Astrid and others who were present, they were admitted only after the driver threatened to ram the border gate. Another account does not describe the escape so dramatically.Hegge, Per Egil; Harald V, En biografi; N.W. Damm & Søn AS; 2006 However when the King and Crown Prince inquired of the Swedish foreign minister whether they could sleep one night in Sweden without being interned, they were denied.Prince Harald spent the following days in Sälen before relocating to Prince Carl Bernadotte's home in Frötuna on 16 April. On 26 April the group moved to Drottningholm in Stockholm. Accounts tell us that King Gustaf V had an amicable relationship with his Norwegian guests, but the topic of the war in Norway was not to be raised. However, influential Swedish politicians including Minster of Justice Westman wanted the Crown Princess and Prince Harald to be sent back to Norway so he could be proclaimed King by the Germans. After the King and Crown Prince had to leave Norway on 7 June they felt Sweden might not be the best place for the rest of the family. They started planning for them to be relocated to the USA. On 17 August the Crown Princess and her children left for the USA from Petsamo, Finland aboard the ship American Legion.Harald and his mother and sisters lived in Washington, D.C. during the war (his father Olav and grandfather King Haakon residing in London with the exiled government). One of the notable events he remembers from that time is standing behind Franklin D. Roosevelt when he was sworn in for his fourth term on the South Portico of the White House in 1945. The young prince also visited Norwegian servicemen on training in the US and Canada. He attended The White Hall Country School from 1943. Prince Harald returned to Norway along with his family at the war's end in 1945.In the autumn of 1945 he was enrolled in third grade of Smestad skole as the first royal to attend a public school. In 1955 he graduated from Oslo katedralskole and in the autumn of that year, Harald began studies at the University of Oslo. Later he attended the Cavalry Officers' Candidate School at Trandum, followed by enrollment at the Norwegian Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1959.In 1960, Harald entered Balliol College, Oxford where he studied history, economics and politics until 1962. He was a keen rower during his student days at Oxford. In 1960 he also made his first official journey abroad, visiting the United States in connection with the fiftieth anniversary of the American Scandinavian Foundation.Adult lifeThe Crown Prince of Norway serves as deputy of the King from the day he is 18 years of age. Crown Prince Harald attended Council of State for the first time on 27 September 1957 and took the oath to the Constitution of Norway on 21 February 1958. In the same year he also served as regent in the King's absence for the first time.Harald married a commoner, Sonja Haraldsen, in Oslo on 29 Aug 1968, a marriage that sparked much public controversy. The couple have two children, Princess Märtha Louise and His Royal Highness Crown Prince Haakon, heir to the Norwegian throne.IssueNameBirthNotesPrincess Märtha Louise]]22 September 1971married to Ari Behn since 2002, has issue (three daughters)Crown Prince Haakon Magnus]]20 July 1973Mette-Marit Tjessem Høiby]] since 2001, has issue (one daughter and one son)The King heads the government meetings at Oslo Palace every Friday (Council of State). He also has weekly meetings with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. He receives foreign envoys, and opens parliament every September. According to the Norwegian constitution, he appoints his government. Since 1884 parliamentarism has been in place in Norway, so the government has to have support from Parliament. The King appoints the leader of the parliamentary block with majority as prime minister. When the parliamentary situation is unclear the king relies on the advice of the president of Parliament and the sitting prime minister. He travels extensively throughout Norway and makes official state visits to other countries. He is the source of all honours in the kingdom, and is the Grand Master of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav.An avid sailor, Harald represented Norway in the yachting events in the Olympic Games several times during his Crown Prince years, and carried the Norwegian flag at the opening parade of the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. With his sailing crew he won World Championship bronze, silver and gold medals, in 1988, 1982, and 1987, respectively. In July 2005, the King and his crew aboard the royal sailboat Fram XV won the gold medal at the European Championships in Sweden. In the 2007 World Championship the King obtained a sixth place.Sandefjords Blad on the King's performance in the World Championship  Retrieved 10. September 2007Twice during recent years King Harald has been absent as ruler owing to hospitalization and convalescence: in December 2003 to mid-April 2004 due to urinary bladder cancer, and in April to early June 2005 due to aortic stenosis (for details see "The King's health", below). Crown Prince Haakon served as the country's regent on both occasions.Positions as King of Norway and honorary titlesAs King of NorwayThe King is the nominal head of the Church of Norway.He is a Four-star General, an Admiral and formally the Supreme Commander of the Norwegian Armed Forces.

A successful operation took place on 8 December at Norway's National Hospital, Rikshospitalet, in Oslo: his bladder was removed and a new one constructed. The King was then on sick leave from all official duties. Crown Prince Haakon was Norway's regent during King Harald's illness and convalescence. The King resumed his duties on 13 April 2004.and George W. Bush at the White House during the March 2005 State Visit to the U.S.]] The King was once known to be a chain-smoker, but quit that habit entirely when he was diagnosed with cancer.On 1 April 2005 Harald underwent successful heart surgery, an aortic valve replacement, correcting his aortic stenosis. It had been known for some time that he had this condition; however, until early 2005 it had only been of a moderate degree. During the three-hour operation at Rikshospitalet the doctors also performed a coronary bypass procedure on the King. On 10 April it was announced that the King had also undergone a pericardiocentesis to treat a complication of surgery, a pericardial effusion (an accumulation of fluid around the heart).After the two operations in the spring of 2005, King Harald remained on sick leave for almost two months, Crown Prince Haakon again substituting as the country's regent. The King returned to work on 7 June, a date which carried particular significance in 2005, with Norway celebrating the centennial of the dissolution of the 1814&amp;ndash;1905 union with Sweden. The King recuperated well enough to win the European Championships in ocean sailing just three months after his latest operation.Following advice from his personal physician, King Harald finally decided in late 2005 to scale down his official duties, primarily effected by taking Wednesdays off and trying to keep weekends free as much as possible. However, he planned to continue attending weekend sports events of interest, and to lead Friday Cabinet meetings and carry out other constitutional duties.PatronagesThe Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and LettersThe National Rifle Association of NorwayThe Norwegian Association of UN VeteransThe Norwegian Reserve Officers’ FederationNorges Militære Kameratforeningers Forbund ("The Norwegian Federation of Military Associations")The Norse FederationThe Norway-America AssociationDet Nasjonale Aldershjem for Sjømenn ("The Norwegian Seamen’s Retirement Home")Norsk Anchorite Klubb ("The Norwegian Anchorite Club")The Norwegian Association of Hunters and AnglersThe Norwegian Bible SocietyThe Norwegian Seamen’s Church – Church of Norway AbroadThe Offshore Northern Seas FoundationThe Bergen Philharmonic OrchestraThe Norwegian Academy of Technological SciencesBergen International FestivalThe Norwegian Cancer SocietyLions Clubs International – NorwayNasjonalforeningen for folkehelsen ("The National Association for Public Health")The Norwegian Olympic Committee and Confederation of SportsThe Norwegian Choir AssociationThe Norwegian Forestry SocietyFriends of the Earth Norway/Norwegian Society for the Conservation of NatureRidderrennet ("The Knights’ Race", a Norwegian skiing event for the blind and mobility impaired)The Norwegian Society for Sea RescueThe Sons of Norway FoundationThe American-Scandinavian FoundationThe Anglo-Norse SocietyThe Norwegian Lutheran Memorial Church, Minneapolis, MinnesotaRoyal House web page on the King's patronages Retrieved 7 November 2007Skogfjorden, the Norwegian language program of Concordia Language Villages, Bemidji, MinnesotaAncestors  Patrilineal descentHarald's patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Harald V were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Oldenburg, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.House of OldenburgEgilmar I of Lerigau, dates unknownEgilmar II of Lerigau, d. 1142Christian I of Oldenburg, d. 1167Moritz of Oldenburg, d. 1209Christian II of Oldenburg, d. 1233John I, Count of Oldenburg, d. 1275Christian III, Count of Oldenburg, d. 1285John II, Count of Oldenburg, d. 1314Conrad I, Count of Oldenburg, 1300 - 1347Christian V, Count of Oldenburg, 1340 - 1423Dietrich, Count of Oldenburg, 1398 - 1440Christian I of Denmark, 1426 - 1481Frederick I of Denmark, 1471 - 1533Christian III of Denmark, 1503 - 1559John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, 1545 - 1622Alexander, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg, 1573 - 1627August Philipp, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, 1612 - 1675Frederick Louis, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, 1653 - 1728Peter August, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, 1696 - 1775Karl Anton August, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, 1727 - 1759Friedrich Karl Ludwig, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, 1757 - 1816Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, 1785 - 1831Christian IX of Denmark, 1818 - 1906Frederick VIII of Denmark, 1843 - 1912Haakon VII of Norway, 1872 - 1957Olav V of Norway, 1903 - 1991Harald V of Norway, 1937 -ReferencesExternal linksRoyal House of NorwayOfficial Website of the Norwegian Royal FamilyOfficial Website of the Norwegian Royal Family: biography of the KingBiography from Norwegian government web siteSummary biography of the KingThe Royals &ndash; Regularly updated news coverage of the Norwegian royal family (Aftenposten)The Royal Norwegian Order of St OlavThe Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav - H.M.
