[[Image:Flag of FIAV.svg|right|thumb|220px|Flag of the Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques.]]Vexillology is the scholarly study of flags. The word is a synthesis of the Latin word vexillum and the suffix –''ology'', meaning "study of". The vexillum was a particular type of flag used by Roman legions during the classical era. Unlike most modern flags, which are suspended from a pole or mast along a vertical side, the square vexillum was suspended from a horizontal crossbar along its top side, which was attached to a spear.The term was coined in 1957 by the American scholar Whitney Smith, the author of many books and articles on the subject. It was originally considered a sub-discipline of heraldry, and is still occasionally seen as such. It is sometimes considered a branch of semiotics. http://convention.allacademic.com/nca2003/view_paper_info.html?pub_id=998&amp;part_id1=91216 It is formally defined in the FIAV (Fédération internationale des associations vexillologiques) constitution as "the creation and development of a body of knowledge about flags of all types, their forms and functions, and of scientific theories and principles based on that knowledge." A person who studies flags is a vexillologist, and a person who designs flags is a vexillographer.Every second year FIAV organizes the International Congress of Vexillology (ICV). The 2007 ICV was in Berlin, Germany; the 2009 ICV will be in Yokohama, Japan. Internet activity of vexillologists is centered on the Flags of the World website and mailing list.Flag Identification Symbols (FIS)The Flag Identification System was created by Whitney Smith and adopted by FIAV.The first row represents use on land and the second use on water, each divided into private (civil), government (state), and military (war) use.UsagePrivate UseGovernment UseMilitary UseLand UseCivil FlagState FlagWar FlagSea UseCivil EnsignState EnsignWar EnsignThere are 63 representing symbols that can describe the flag, including: FISText modeDescriptionUsage20px]]C**/***Civil Flagby private persons on land20px]]*S*/***State Flagby state institutions on land20px]]**W/***War Flagby military on land (army)20px]]***/C**Civil Ensignon private vessels (merchant ensign)20px]]***/*S*State Ensignon state owned vessels20px]]***/**WWar Ensignby navy20px]]CS*/***Civil and State Flagby private persons and state on land20px]]*SW/***State and War Flagby state services and military on land20px]]CSW/***National Flagfor all purposes on land20px]]***/CSWNational Ensignfor all purposes on vessels20px]]CSW/CSWNational Flag and Ensignfor all purposes on land and seaOther symbols are used to describe other aspects of the usage of the flag, such as official status and which side of the flag is being shown. The ones in general use are:Normal or de jure version of flag, or obverse sideDesign proposed but not officially adoptedDesign is a reconstruction based on observationsReverse side of flagDesign is an acceptable variantAlternative version of flagDe facto version of flagFlag has different designs on its obverse side and its reverse sideObverse side meant to be hoisted with pole to the observer's rightDesign officially authorized to represent nation by government of that nationDesign used in the past, but now abandoned (not part of Smith's original set)Reverse side is mirror image of obverse sideReverse side is congruent with obverse sideInformation on reverse side is not availableFlag can be hung vertically by hoisting on a normal pole, then turning the pole 90°Flag can be hung vertically by rotating the design firstVertical hoist method of flag is unknownDesign has no element that can be rotatedFlag can be hoisted vertically onlyPrinciples of flag designFlag designs exhibit a number of regularities, arising from a variety of practical concerns, historical circumstances, and cultural prescriptions that have shaped and continue to shape their evolution.First among the practical issues confronting a vexillographer is the necessity for the design to be manufactured (and often mass produced) into or onto a piece of cloth, which will subsequently be hoisted aloft in the outdoors to represent an organization, individual or idea. In this respect, flag design departs considerably from logo design: logos are predominantly still images to be read off a page, screen, or billboard, while flags are alternately draped and fluttering images to be seen from a variety of distances and angles. The prevalence of simple bold colors and shapes in flag design attests to these practical issues.Flag design is also a historical process in which current designs often refer back to previous designs, effectively quoting, elaborating, or commenting upon them. Families of current flags may derive from a few common ancestors as in the cases of the Pan-African colours, the Pan-Arab colors, the Pan-Slavic colours, the Nordic Cross and the Ottoman flag.Certain cultures prescribe the proper design of flags, through heraldic or other authoritative systems. Prescription may be based on religious principles: see, for example, Islamic flags. As a discipline, vexillology is beginning to promote design principles based on a body of research on flag history and design. Prominent examples are [http://www.nava.org/Flag%20Design/GFBF/index.html Ted Kaye's five Good Flag, Bad Flag principles] published and endorsed by the North American Vexillological Association:Keep It Simple: the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory.Use Meaningful Symbolism: the flag’s images, colors, or patterns should relate to what it symbolizes.Use 2&ndash;3 Basic Colors: limit the number of colors on the flag to three, which contrast well and come from the standard color set.No Lettering or Seals: never use writing of any kind or an organization’s seal.Be Distinctive or Be Related: avoid duplicating other flags, but use similarities to show connections.VexillologistsGraham Bartram, Chief Vexillologist of the Flag Institute, and Secretary-General for Congresses of FIAVBruce Berry, founder member of the Southern African Vexillological Association (SAVA), editor of the SAVA Journal and SAVA Newsletter, and collector of Rhodesian and South African flagsWilliam Crampton, founder of the Flag InstituteMarc Leepson, author of Flag: An American BiographyMichel Lupant, current president of the FIAVOttfried Neubecker, most important German vexillologist, author of the German navy Flaggenbuch of 1939George H.
