It is near the present location of San Salvador that the Pipil groups, established their capital, Cuscatlán. Not very much is known about this city, since it was abandoned by its inhabitants in an effort to avoid Spanish rule.Under the orders of Pedro de Alvarado, Gonzalo de Alvarado and Diego de Holgiun were ordered to take the settlement they found and to develop it. Diego de Holgiun became the first mayor of San Salvador as the town was founded on April 1, 1525. However, in the sixteenth century, it was rebuilt and changed locations twice afterwards 1528 and 1545. Originally founded in what is now the archaeological site Ciudad Vieja, north of the present-day city, it was moved to the Valle de Las Hamacas or the Acelhuate Valley, named so due to the intense seismic activity that characterizes it, which boasted more space and more fertile land, thanks to the pristine and now extremely polluted Acelhuate River. As the population of the country remained relatively small up until the early twentieth century, the city grew slowly.GeographyThe city's altitude averages  above sea level located, on a valley on the skirts of the Quezaltepec volcano or San Salvador. In fact, the valley got its nickname from the Spaniards who called the area'"El Valle de las Hamacas"' (The Valley of the Hammocks) due to its constant seismic activity.San Salvador, the Capital of El Salvador - AlfaTravelGuide.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;ClimateSan Salvador is mainly hot, the coldest months being November, December, January, and February.

This increased sharply over the next three years to 465, with a slight decrease during 2006 to 456.PollutionPollution remains one of the city's biggest problems. Located in a valley, San Salvador is a perfect pollution trap. Fueling this, the city struggles with an increasing traffic problem. New highways and arterial roads offer some relief. According to a study by the United Nations, El Salvador was the second worst polluter of carbon dioxide emissions in Central America.Disasterscaused by one of the 2001 El Salvador earthquakes.]] The city has suffered from severe earthquakes over the years, the most disastrous of which occurred in 1854. Also worthy of mentioning is the 1917 eruption of the San Salvador volcano, which resulted in three major earthquakes and damaged the city so extensively that the government was forced to move the capital to the present-day city of Santa Tecla, then named Nueva San Salvador. The most recent earthquake, in 2001, resulted in considerable damage, especially in Las Colinas suburb where a landslide destroyed homes and killed many people. During the 1980s, conflicts in El Salvador erupted into a civil war, and many people fled to the city since most of the fighting occurred outside of it (San Salvador itself was not directly affected by the war until the final offensive of 1989).LandmarksCatedral Metropolitana, Metropolitan CathedralTeatro Nacional de El Salvador, the National Theatre of El SalvadorPalacio Nacional, the National PalaceMonumento al Salvador del Mundo, Monument to the Savior of the WorldCasa Presidencial, the Presidential MansionMonumento a La Libertad, Monument to LibertyTorre Cuscatlan, a city landmark owned by Banco Cuscatlán.Gallery of San Salvador Image:Great_San_Salvador.JPG|''Great San Salvador, seen from Quetzaltepec volcano'' Image:North_San_Salvador.JPG|''Northwest San Salvador'' Image:NationalcathedralES.jpg|''The new Metropolitan Cathedral'' Image:Salvadordelmundo.jpg|''Monumento al Salvador del Mundo (Monument to the Savior of the World)'' Image:Revolution_Monument_San_Salvador.JPG|''Monument to Revolution'' Image:Nattheatre.jpg|''National Theatre in San Salvador downtown'' Image:Five_Star_Hotel_San_Salvador.JPG|''Five star Hilton Hotel in zona rosa'' Image:Office_Buildings_San_Salvador.JPG|''Office buildings near to el Salvador del Mundo''  Sister CitiesGuatemala City, GuatemalaManagua, NicaraguaMexico City, MexicoSan Pedro Sula, HondurasTaipei, TaiwanLos Angeles, United StatesReferences  External linksMunicipality of the city of San SalvadorSan Salvador city tour.
