  In Greek mythology, a nymph is any member of a large class of mythological entities in human female form. They were typically associated with a particular location or landform. Others were part of the retinue of a god, such as Dionysus, Hermes, or Pan, or a goddess, generally Artemis.But see Jennifer Larson, "Handmaidens of Artemis?" The Classical Journal 92.3 (February 1997), pp. 249-257. Nymphs were the frequent target of satyrs.Nymphs live in mountains and groves, by springs and rivers, and in valleys and cool grottoes. They are frequently associated with the superior divinities: the huntress Artemis; the prophetic Apollo; the reveller and god of wine, Dionysus; and rustic gods such as Pan and Hermes.The symbolic marriage of a nymph and a patriarch, often the eponym of a people, is repeated endlessly in Greek origin myths; their union lent authority to the archaic king and his line.Meaning of ''nymph''"The idea that rivers are gods and springs divine nymphs," Walter Burkert remarks (Burkert III.3.3) "is deeply rooted not only in poetry but in belief and ritual; the worship of these deities is limited only by the fact that they are inseparably identified with a specific locality." Nymphs are personifications of the creative and fostering activities of nature, most often identified with the life-giving outflow of springs. The Greek word νύμφη has "bride" and "veiled" among its meanings: hence a marriagable young woman. Other readers refer the word (and also Latin nubere and German Knospe) to a root expressing the idea of "swelling" (according to Hesychius, one of the meanings of νύμφη is "rose-bud").Nymph classificationsand the Nymphs]]As H.J. Rose states, "all these names are simply feminine adjectives, agreeing with the substantive nympha, and there was no orthodox and exhaustive classification of these shadowy beings." He mentions dryads and hamadryads as nymphs of trees generally, meliai as nymphs of ash trees, and naiads as nymphs of water, but no others specifically.The following is not the Greek classification, but is intended simply as a guide:Land nymphsAlseids (glens, groves)Auloniads (pastures)Hesperides (nymphs of the west, daughters of Atlas)Aegle ("dazzling light")ArethusaErytheia (or Eratheis)Hespera (or Hespere)Hesperia (or Hispereia)Saraesa (beautiful wind)Leimakids (meadows)Minthe (mint)Napaeae (mountain valleys, glens)Oreads (mountains, grottoes)Wood nymphsDryads (trees)Hamadryads (oak tree and others)Epimeliad (apple tree)Leuce (white poplar tree)Meliae (manna-ash tree)Water nymphs ("$Ephydriads")Helead (fen)Maia (partner of Zeus and mother of Hermes)Naiads (usually fresh water)Crinaeae (fountains)Eleionomae (marshes)Hyades (rain)Limnades or Limnatides (lakes)Pegaeae (springs)Potameides (rivers)Corycian Nymphs (Corycian Cave)Nereids (daughters of Nereus, the Mediterranean Sea)Oceanids (daughters of Oceanus and [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]], any water, usually salty)Other nymphsLampades (underworld)The MusesNephelae (clouds)Pleiades (daughters of Atlas and constellation)Adaptations The Greek nymphs were spirits invariably bound to places, not unlike the Latin genius loci, and the difficulty of transferring their cult may be seen in the complicated myth that brought Arethusa to Sicily. In the works of the Greek-educated Latin poets, the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams (Juturna, Egeria, Carmentis, Fontus), while the Lymphae (originally Lumpae), Italian water-goddesses, owing to the accidental similarity of name, could be identified with the Greek Nymphae. The mythologies of classicizing Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cult of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium. Among the Roman literate class their sphere of influence was restricted, and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element.Nymphs in modern Greek [[folklore]][[Image:SophieAndersonTheHeadOfANymph.jpg|left|225px|thumb|'The Head of a Nymph' by Sophie Anderson]] The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century, when they were usually known as "nereids". At that time John Cuthbert Lawson wrote: "...there is probably no nook or hamlet in all Greece where the womenfolk at least do not scrupulously take precautions against the thefts and malice of the nereids, while many a man may still be found to recount in all good faith stories of their beauty, passion and caprice. Nor is it a matter of faith only; more than once I have been in villages where certain Nereids were known by sight to several persons (so at least they averred); and there was a wonderful agreement among the witnesses in the description of their appearance and dress."Usually female, they were dressed in white, decked with garlands of flowers, but they frequently had unnatural legs, like those of a goat, donkey or cow. They were so beautiful that the highest compliment was to compare some feature of a woman (eyes, hair, etc.) with that of nereid. They could move swiftly and invisibly, ride through the air and slip through small holes. Although not immortal, their lives exceeded man's tenfold, and they retained their beauty until death.They tended to frequent areas distant from man, but could be encountered by lone travellers outside the village, where their music might be heard, and the traveller could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool, either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night. They might appear in a whirlwind. Such encounters could be dangerous, bringing dumbness, besotted infatuation, madness or stroke to the unfortunate human. When parents believed their child to be nereid-struck they would pray to Saint Artemidos, the Christian manifestation of Artemis."heathen Artemis yielded her functions to her own genitive case transformed into Saint Artemidos", as Terrot Reaveley Glover phrased it in discussing the "practical polytheimsm in the worship of the saints", in Progress in Religion to the Christian Era 1922:107.Stock stories about nereids include the girl who fell ill and died and was seen after death dancing with the nereids; the nereid changeling; and the man who won a nereid as his wife by stealing a piece of her clothing. The latter would become an ideal wife until she recovered her clothing and returned to her own people. NereidsModern sexual connotations  by Armand Van Helden.]]Due to the depiction of the mythological nymphs as females who mate with men or women at their own volition and are completely outside male control, the term is often used for women who are perceived as behaving similarly. (For example, the title of the Perry Mason detective novel "The Case of the Negligent Nymph" (1956), by Erle Stanley Gardner, is derived from this meaning of the word.)The term "Nymphomania" was created by modern psychology as referring to a "desire to engage in human sexual behavior at a level high enough to be considered clinically significant", "Nymphomaniac" being the person suffering from such a disorder.Due to widespread use of the term among lay persons (often shortened to "nympho") and stereotypes attached, professionals nowadays prefer the term "Hypersexuality" which can refer to males and females alike.The word "nymphette" is used to identify a sexually precocious girl. The term was made famous in the novel "Lolita" by Vladimir Nabakov. The main character, Humbert Humbert, uses the term countless times and usually in reference to the title character.Depictions in popular cultureand the Nymphs by John William Waterhouse]] Unlike mermaids, few nymphs have been depicted on film, in television, or in other forms of mass media and popular culture. Among them are:Nymphs appear frequently in fantasy fiction, including the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis, the Xanth series by Piers Anthony, and The Belgariad by David EddingsLady in the Water (2006), a film by M. Night Shyamalan, which features a water nymph (called a Narf) of a mythology he created for the movie.In the film ''Sirens'', an erotic dream sequence of a woman swimming turns into a lesbian version of Waterhouse's painting Hylas and the Nymphs.Nymph was the title of a pornographic movie, with Chasey Lain as a water nymph.Nymphs appear as monsters in the RPG Dungeons &amp; Dragons and in many videogames, including EverQuest, Fable, Age of Wonders and Daggerfall.In The Tempest, ''Ariel'' appears as a water nymph in Act 1 Scene 2.Richard III longs "To strut before a wanton ambling nymph".In the book "Rebel Angels"(a sequel to "A Great and Terrible Beauty") by Libba Bray, Gemma and her friends have a scary encounter with water nymphs.The television show Charmed has several episodes that featured nymphs, specifically hamadryads (though they are never referred to as such); who are depicted as carefreeNymphs are generally green creatures in Magic: the Gathering, a collectible card game.Nymph is a skateboard company growing in Quebec city. They also have done a movie and start filming a second.==See also==AnimismApsarasGenius lociHouriHuacasKamiLandvaettirLampadesMelusineOndine (mythology)Pitsa panelsRåSirenSlavic fairiesSprite (creature)SuccubusCalypsoReferences  SourcesLawson, John Cuthbert, Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1910 p131Tomkinson, John L., [http://www.anagnosis.gr/index.php?pageID=74&amp;la=eng Haunted Greece: Nymphs, Vampires and other Exotika,] Anagnosis, Athens, 2004, ISBN 960-88087-0-7Information pageNereidsExternal linksTheoi.com: Nymphs Category:Nymphs Category:Classical elements Category:Musesar:حورية (ميثولوجيا إغريقية) an:Ninfa ast:Ninfa br:Nimfezed bg:Нимфа ca:Nimfa cs:Nymfy da:Nymfe (mytologi) de:Nymphe el:Νύμφες es:Ninfa eo:Nimfoj fr:Nymphe (mythologie) ko:님프 hr:Nimfa id:Nymph it:Ninfa (mitologia) he:נימפה lb:Nymph lt:Nimfa hu:Nimfák mk:Нимфа nl:Nimf (mythologie) ja:ニュンペー no:Nymfe (mytologi) pl:Nimfa (mitologia) pt:Ninfa (mitologia) ro:Nimfe ru:Нимфы sk:Nymfa (mytológia) sl:Nimfa sr:Нимфа fi:Nymfit sv:Nymf th:นิมฟ์ tr:Nemf uk:Німфи zh:宁芙
