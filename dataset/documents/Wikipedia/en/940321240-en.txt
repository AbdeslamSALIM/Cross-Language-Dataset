The film's tagline is: "A romantic comedy with the works."PlotThe film is about the coming of age of two sisters and their friend, as seen through the romantic lives of the three main characters: Kat, Daisy, and Jojo, who all work as waitresses at Mystic Pizza in Mystic, Connecticut, a fishing town with a large Portuguese American population.The movie also touches on an Old World work ethic. Kat and Daisy are sisters and rivals; the former works all the time and attends Yale University, while the latter just wants to have fun. Kat is the apple of her Portuguese mother's eye, while Daisy is not: She is promiscuous and is not as goal-oriented as her younger sister.There is also a dynamic between Kat's Anglo-American employer and the resulting relationship between them. The class distinctions and variant European heritages are explored in various scenes of the film.Vincent D'Onofrio and Adam Storke co-star; in his screen debut, Matt Damon has a small part (his sole line in the film being, "Mom, do you want my green stuff?").The film was based on a pizza shop that caught the eye of Hollywood screen writer, Amy H. Jones. The actual Mystic Pizza in Mystic, Connecticut has become overwhelmingly popular due to the film's success.References in popular cultureIn the 30 Rock season two premiere SeinfeldVision, the character Jenna Maroney appears in Mystic Pizza: The Musical.
