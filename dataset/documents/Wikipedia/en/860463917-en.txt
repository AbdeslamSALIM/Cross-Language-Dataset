In chemistry, A suspension is a heterogenous fluid containing solid particles that are sufficiently large for sedimentation. Usually they must be larger than 1 micrometre. Chemistry: Matter and Its Changes, 4th Ed. by Brady, Senese, ISBN 0471215171 The internal phase (solid) is dispersed throughout the external phase (fluid) through mechanical agitation, with the use of certain excipients or suspending agents. Unlike colloids, suspensions will eventually settle. An example of a suspension would be sand in water. The suspended particles are visible under a microscope and will settle over time if left undisturbed. This distinguishes a suspension from a colloid in which the suspended particles are smaller and do not settle.The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. In a solution, the dissolved substance does not exist as a solid and the two are homogeneously mixed.A suspension of liquid droplets or fine solid particles in a gas is called an aerosol. In the atmosphere these consist of fine dust and soot particles, sea salt, biogenic and volcanogenic sulfates, nitrates, and cloud droplets.Suspensions are classified on the basis of the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium, where the former is essentially solid while the latter may either be a solid, a liquid or a gas.Common examplesMud or muddy water, is where soil, clay, or silt particles are suspended in water.Flour suspended in water, as pictured to the right.PaintChalk powder suspended in water.Dust particles suspended in air.See alsocolloidsolemulsionturbiditysettleable solidssediment transportsolutionmixtureTyndall effectReferencesCategory:Homogeneous chemical mixtures Category:Colloidal chemistryca:Suspensió cs:Suspenze (chemie) da:Suspension (kemi) de:Suspension (Chemie) et:Suspensioon el:Αιώρημα es:Suspensión (química) fa:سوسپانسیون fr:Suspension (chimie) id:Suspensi it:Sospensione (chimica) lt:Suspensija hu:Szuszpenzió nl:Suspensie ja:懸濁液 no:Suspensjon (kjemi) nds:Suspension (Chemie) pl:Zawiesina pt:Suspensão (química) ru:Суспензия sk:Suspenzia sl:Suspenzija fi:Suspensio sv:Suspension th:สารแขวนลอย vi:Huyền phù uk:Суспензія zh:混悬剂
