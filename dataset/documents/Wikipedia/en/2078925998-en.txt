The first public release was on August 26, 1997.Release history of Crystal Space from the Internet Archive It is typically used as a game engine but the framework is more general and can be used for any kind of 3D visualization. It is very portable and runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Mac OS X. It is also free software, licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License, and was SourceForge.net's Project of the Month for February 2003.SourceForge.net Project of the Month, February 2003It can optionally use OpenGL (on all platforms), SDL (all SDL platforms), X11 (Unix or GNU/Linux) and SVGALib (GNU/Linux). It can also optionally use assembler routines using NASM and MMX.Engine designCrystal Space is programmed in object oriented C++. It is very modularly built with a number of more or less independent plugins. The client programs use the plugins, like the OpenGL 3D renderer, by registering them via Crystal Space's Shared Class Facility (SCF).FeaturesCrystal Space has modules for 2D and 3D graphics, sound, collision detection and physics through ODE and Bullet.Graphics:OpenGL renderingSupports hardware acceleration from all major card vendorsAllows use of shadersLibrary of common shaders like normal mapping, parallax mapping and hardware skinningSupports software rendering with limited featuresMesh objects:Plugin-based mesh systemTriangle-based meshes with frame and bone animation supportCollision detection and dynamics:ODE and Bullet dynamicsSimplified collision detection when full dynamic simulation is not neededSee alsoGame engineCrystal Entity LayerCELstartPlaneShiftReferencesExternal linksOfficial Crystal Space siteCrystal Space Community siteCrystal Space engine details and reviewsCategory:1997 software Category:Free game engines Category:Free software programmed in C++ Category:Cross-platform softwarede:Crystal Space es:Crystal Space fr:Crystal Space nl:Crystal Space pl:Crystal Space pt:Crystal Space sv:Crystal Space
