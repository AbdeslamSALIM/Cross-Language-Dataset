It is subdivided into 100 qəpik. The word manat is borrowed from the Russian word "монета" (coin) which is pronounced as "maneta". Manat was also the designation of the Soviet ruble in both the Azerbaijani and Turkmen languages.The Azerbaijani manat symbol, , is currently not encoded in Unicode, and m, man., or ман. can be used as a substitute for the manat symbol.First Manat, 1919-1923The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic and the Azerbaijani Soviet Socialist Republic issued their own currency between 1919 and 1923. This currency was called the manat (منات) in Azerbaijani and the ruble (рубль) in Russian, with both language appearing on the banknotes. The manat replaced the first Transcaucasian ruble at par and was replaced by the second Transcaucasian ruble after Azerbaijan became part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Federal Socialist Republic. No subdivisions were issued and the currency only existed as banknotes.BanknotesThe Democratic Republic issued notes in denominations of 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 manat, whilst the ASSR issued notes in denominations of 5, 100, 1000, 5000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 250,000, 1 million and 5 million manat.Second Manat, 1992-2006The second manat was introduced on 15 August, 1992. It had the ISO 4217 code AZM and replaced the Soviet ruble at a rate of 10 rubles to 1 manat.From early 2002 to early 2005, the exchange rate was fairly stable (varying within a band of 4770&ndash;4990 manat per US dollar). Starting in the spring of 2005 there was a slight but steady increase in the value of the manat against the US dollar; the reason most likely being the increased flow of petrodollars into the country, together with the generally high price of oil on the world market. At the end of 2005, one dollar was worth 4591 manat. Banknotes below 100 manat had effectively disappeared by 2005, as had the qəpik coins.CoinsCoins were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 qəpik, dated 1992 and 1993. Although brass and cupro-nickel were used for some of the 1992 issues, later issues were all in aluminium. Banknotes The following banknotes were issued for this currency1, 5, 10, 250 manat (all first issued in 1992)50, 100, 500, 1000 manat (all first issued in 1993)10,000 manat (first issued in 1994)50,000 manat (first issued in 1996)Banknotes with denominations from 1 to 250 manat featured Baku's Maiden Tower.Third Manat, 2006-On 1 January 2006, a new manat (ISO 4217 code AZN, also called the "manat (national currency)") was introduced at a value of 5000 old manat. Since 1 October 2005, prices have been indicated both in new manats and in old manats to ease transition. Coins denominated in qəpik, which had not been used from 1993 onwards due to inflation, have been reintroduced with the redenomination.The former manat (ISO code 4217 AZM) remained valid till 31 December 2006. http://publications.europa.eu/code/en/en-5000700.htmCoinsCoins in circulation are 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 and 50 qəpik (the latter being bimetallic, similar to the €2 coin)BanknotesBanknotes in circulation are 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 manat. They were designed by Austrian Robert Kalina, who was also responsible for the current euro banknotes. The notes look quite similar to those of the euro and the choice of motifs was inspired by the euro banknotes.Banknotes of the Third ManatImageValueDimensionsMain ColourDescriptionObverseReverseThemeObverseReverse1 manat120 × 70 mmGreyCultureAzerbaijani folk music instrumentsOrnaments]] of ancient Azerbaijani carpets5 manat127 × 70 mmOrangeWriting and literatureAncient writers, poets, and books from AzerbaijanRock drawings of Qobustan, samples of Orkhon script and letters from the contemporary Azerbaijani alphabet10 manat134 × 70 mmBlueHistoryMaiden Tower]] against a background of the Icheri Sheher wallOrnaments of ancient Azerbaijani carpets20 manat141 × 70 mmGreenKarabakhSigns of power (a sword, a helmet and a shield)Symbol of peace (harybulbul)50 manat148 × 70 mmYellowHistory and futureYouth, stairs (as a symbol of progress), the sun (as a symbol of force and light) and chemical and mathematical symbols (as signs of science)Ornaments of ancient Azerbaijani carpets100 manat155 × 70 mmMauveEconomy and development10px]]) and symbols of economic growthOrnaments of ancient Azerbaijani carpetsExport restrictionsAzerbaijani law prohibits the export of the local currency by non-residents. the Best of Azerbaijan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;See alsoEconomy of AzerbaijanReferences External links [http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2291608 Der Standard article on the redenomination]Azerbaijan International.
