Rangjung Dorje (Wylie: rang 'byung rdo rje) (b. 1284 - d. 1339) was the third Karmapa, an important figure in the history of Tibetan Buddhism. He reportedly produced a spontaneous black crown (which would later be a symbol of the line) at the age of three and declared himself to be the mindstream reimbodiment of Karma Pakshi. Born to a Nyingma family, he received the full transmission of the Nyingma tradition in addition to the Karma Kagyu.ExegesisSuchan (1998: unpaginated) links Rangjung Dorje to Rigdzin Kumaradza, Vimalamitra and Padmasambhava:  The third Karmapa Lama, Rangjung Dorje, was a disciple of Nyingma Kumaradza. The latter taught Rangjung Dorje the nying-thig, "heart-essence," teachings transmitted by Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra. Therefore, Rangjung Dorje belongs to the nying-thig lineage of the Nyingma school. As a group, the Karmapa Lamas were among the earliest recognized Tulku, or lamas reincarnated as deities or lineage of deceased teachers. They were particularly influential at the Yuan and Ming courts of China.Suchan, Tom (1998). The Third Karmapa Lama, Rangjung Dorje (1284-1338).

Their influence also extended to the court of the Tangut Xia Kingdom where a disciple of Dusum Khyenpa was given the title "Supreme Teacher" by a Tangut Xixia King..."Rhie, Marylin & Thurman, Robert (1991).

Source: http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/zab_mo_nang_don (accessed: January 29, 2008)), which concern the Vajrayana inner yoga practices. Other important texts of his include the Aspiration Prayer of Mahamudra, Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom, Instructions on Sahajayoga Mahamudra, and A Treatise on Buddha Nature. His mastery of both the Kagyu Mahamudra and Nyingma Dzogchen was widely renowned, and he was a Kalachakra master as well.In 1321 the famous scholar Dolpopa (1292-1361) visited Tsurphu Monastery for the first time and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his Zhentong (gzhan stong) method.Stearns, Cyrus (1999).
