Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel (September 16, 1853 &ndash; July 5, 1927) was a German medical doctor.BiographyKossel was born in Rostock as the son of Prussian consul Albrecht Kossel and his wife Clara. In 1872, Kossel went to the University of Strasbourg to study medicine, where he visited lectures of Anton de Bary, Waldeyer, Kundt, Baeyer and Felix Hoppe-Seyler. He graduated in 1878 at the University of Rostock.Kossel was awarded the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for research in cell biology, especially proteins and nucleic acids. He also discovered the amino acid histidine (1896), thymic acid and agmatine (1910).Kossel's field of work was physiological chemistry, especially the chemistry of tissues and cells. He began his investigations into the constitution of the cell nucleus at the end of 1880, and in the nineties he began his investigations of proteins, the alterations in proteins during transformation into peptone, the effects of a phenetol diet on the urine, the peptonic components of the cells. In 1896 he discovered histidine, then worked out the classical method for the quantitaive separation of the hexone bases. With his distinguished English pupil Henry Drysdale Dakin he investigated arginase, the ferment which hydrolyses arginine into urea and ornithine, and later he discovered agmatine in herring roe and devised a method for preparing it.One of Kossel's students was American biochemist Edwin B. Hart, who would later return to the United States to participate in the "Single-grain experiment" (1907-1911) and be part of research teams that would determine the nutritive causes of anemia and goiter.Kossel had one daughter and one son, Walther (1888-1956), who was a prominent Professor of Theoretical Physics at Danzig Institute of Technology (1932-1945).Selected worksUntersuchungen über die Nukleine und ihre Spaltungsprodukte ("Investigations into the nucleins and their cleavage products", 1881)Die Gewebe des menschlichen Körpers und ihre mikroskopische Untersuchung ("The tissues in the human body and their microscopic investigation", 1889-1891)Leitfaden für medizinisch-chemische Kurse ("Textbook for medical-chemical courses", 1888)Die Probleme der Biochemie ("The problems of biochemistry", 1908Die Beziehungen der Chemie zur Physiologie ("The relationships between chemistry and physiology", 1913)References Category:German physiologists Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:German Nobel laureates Category:People from Rostock Category:People from Mecklenburg-Schwerin Category:University of Strasbourg alumni Category:University of Rostock alumni Category:University of Marburg faculty Category:University of Heidelberg facultyar:ألبرشت كوسل bs:Albrecht Kossel bg:Албрехт Косел ca:Albrecht Kossel cs:Albrecht Kossel de:Albrecht Kossel es:Albrecht Kossel fr:Albrecht Kossel ko:알브레히트 코셀 hr:Albrecht Kossel id:Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel it:Albrecht Kossel sw:Albrecht Kossel nl:Albrecht Kossel ja:アルブレヒト・コッセル oc:Albrecht Kossel pl:Albrecht Kossel pt:Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel ro:Albrecht Kossel ru:Коссель, Альбрехт sl:Albrecht Kossel sr:Албрехт Косел sv:Albrecht Kossel uk:Альбрехт Коссель zh:阿尔布雷希特·科塞尔
