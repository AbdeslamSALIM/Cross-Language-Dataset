 Obituary is one of the pioneering bands of the death metal genre. The band came from Tampa, Florida, and was founded as Xecutioner in 1985. Shortly before the release of its first album, they changed their name to Obituary. It still remains an influential band of the Florida death metal movement that arose in the late 1980s. The 1990 release Cause of Death has been described as a seminal album in the genre, and vocalist John Tardy is recognized as one of the first vocalists to use an abnormally low growl (compared to the screechy growls used by predecessors Death and Possessed). Obituary is listed by Nielsen Soundscan as the fifth best-selling death metal band of all time and its albums have sold 368,184 copies. Its 1992 release The End Complete has also more than 103,378 copies in the United States alone.After 1997's Back from the Dead album, the band had grown tired of touring which led to the band disbanding. During the hiatus, Donald Tardy played in Andrew W.K.'s touring band (during W.K.'s appearance on Saturday Night Live Tardy wore an Obituary shirt). Allen West focused on his two projects, Lowbrow and Six Feet Under while not playing in Obituary. Trevor Peres formed Catastrophic in 2001. The band reformed in 2003 and Catastrophic continued to exist alongside the reformed Obituary. Catastrophic released one album, The Cleansing, in 2001. Obituary's reunion album, Frozen in Time, was released in 2005. The band's first live DVD, Frozen Alive, was released in January 2007.Obituary is currently signed with Candlelight Records for its seventh album Xecutioner's Return (2007) and new EP Left to Die (2008). On July 15, 2008, frontman John Tardy reported that Obituary have begun working on new material for their next album due out in 2009.Obituary's guitarist, Allen West, was recently imprisoned for DUI (driving under the influence of alcohol) and released in January 2008. During his incarceration, Ralph Santolla served as West's replacement. It is uncertain at this time whether or not West will be returning to the band.Line-upJohn Tardy - vocals (1985&ndash;present)Ralph Santolla - lead guitar (2007&ndash;present)Trevor Peres - rhythm guitar (1985&ndash;present)Frank Watkins - bass guitar (1989&ndash;present)Donald Tardy - drums (1985&ndash;present)Former membersAllen West - lead guitar (1985&ndash;1989, 1992&ndash;2006) (see also Six Feet Under)James Murphy - lead guitar (1990&ndash;1992) (see also Death, Disincarnate, Cancer, Testament)Daniel Tucker - bass guitar (1988&ndash;1989)Peter Klavinger - lead guitar (1999 show)Jack Owen - lead guitar (one live show 2007)DiscographyStudio Albums1989: Slowly We Rot1990: Cause of Death1992: The End Complete1994: World Demise1997: Back from the Dead2005: Frozen in Time2007: Xecutioner's Return2009: TBAEPs And Singles1994: Don't Care2008: Left to DieCompilations2001: Anthology2008: The Best of ObituaryLive Albums1998: DeadDVDs2006: Frozen AliveReferencesObituary at AllmusicObituary at RockdetectorNotesExternal linksObituary at Roadrunner RecordsCategory:American death metal musical groups Category:Tampa musical groups Category:Reunited musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Florida heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups with siblingsang:Obituary bg:Obituary ca:Obituary da:Obituary de:Obituary es:Obituary fr:Obituary id:Obituary it:Obituary he:אוביטוארי lt:Obituary nl:Obituary ja:オビチュアリー pl:Obituary pt:Obituary ro:Obituary ru:Obituary fi:Obituary tr:Obituary
