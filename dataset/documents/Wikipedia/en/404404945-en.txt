 The Fabrosauridae is a proposed family of primitive ornithischian dinosaurs from the Late Triassic and Jurassic. However, recent studies indicate the Fabrosaurs are not a natural grouping of dinosaurs, consisting of unrelated genera. The proposed "Fabrosaurs" descended from a Lesothosaurus-like animal. Proposed fabrosaurids were 1-2 meters long, and were lightly-built and bipedal. Their skulls were triangular and had very large eye sockets. They were herbivorous and would have used agility to escape predators.ReferencesCategory:Ornithischiansca:Fabrosàurid de:Fabrosauridae es:Fabrosauridae fr:Fabrosauridae it:Fabrosauridae nl:Fabrosauridae pl:Fabrozaury simple:Fabrosauridae sv:Fabrosaurider vo:Fabrosauridae zh:法布爾龍科
