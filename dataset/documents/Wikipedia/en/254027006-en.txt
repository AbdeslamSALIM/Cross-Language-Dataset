He has 48 caps and two goals, as of the end of 2004. He played for his country at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004.In the 2002 World Cup, Panucci was widely blamed for failing to clear a pass that led to the equalising goal by Seol Ki-Hyun in the dying minutes of the round of 16 match.Panucci had not played for Italy for over three years after Euro 2004 in Portugal, having been ignored by Marcello Lippi with whom he had fallen out with in his days at Inter, for the period of the 2006 World Cup. However, the 34 year-old was given a second chance by coach Roberto Donadoni, who called him up for the European Championship qualifiers against Georgia, Scotland and the Faroe Islands.Panucci then expressed his delight at earning his 50th Italy cap in the stadium where he began his career for the Azzurri in the 2-0 win over Georgia in their Euro 2008 qualifying tie in Genoa. Panucci came through the port club's youth ranks before joining AC Milan in 1993. "It was really emotional for me to play in an arena where I grew up. It may have seemed a little scripted but I'll never forget the standing ovation I received."Panucci has currently 55 caps for the Azzurri, with 4 goals. He managed to score his first international goal for the Azzuri since April 2002, when he headed a crucial injury-time winning goal against Scotland on November 17 2007 in their Euro 2008 qualifying Group B match. Italy then managed to clinch their place at the European Championship finals.Euro 2008On June 13, he scored Italy's first goal against Romania in Euro 2008 Italy vs Romania match report and became the oldest player to score in outfield play in the competition.Personal lifeIn 1996, Panucci narrowly avoided death due to a change of flight plans. He was part of the Italy squad at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, but had to leave the team due to injury.
