  Microsoft PowerPoint is a proprietary presentation program developed by Microsoft. It is part of the Microsoft Office system, and runs on Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS computer operating systems. The Windows version can run in Linux operating system, under the Wine compatibility layer.PowerPoint is widely used by business people, educators, students, and trainers and is among the most prevalent forms of persuasive technology. Beginning with Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft revised the branding to emphasize PowerPoint's place within the office suite, calling it Microsoft Office PowerPoint instead of just Microsoft PowerPoint. The current versions are Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 for Windows and 2008 for Mac.HistoryMicrosoft Office PowerPoint was originally developed by Bob Gasking and software developer Dennis Austin under the name Presenter for Forethought.Absolute Powerpoint by Ian ParkerForethought released PowerPoint 1.0 for the Apple Macintosh in April 1987. It ran in black and white, generating text-and-graphics pages for overhead transparencies. A new full-color version of PowerPoint shipped a year later after the first color Macintosh came to market.Microsoft Corporation purchased Forethought and its PowerPoint software product for $14 million on July 31, 1987. In 1990 the first Windows versions were produced for Windows 3.0. Since 1990, PowerPoint has been included in Microsoft Office suite of applications -- except for the Basic Editions of the suite.OperationPowerPoint presentations consist a number of individual pages or "slides". The "slide" analogy is a reference to the slide projector, a device that has become somewhat obsolete due to the use of PowerPoint and other presentation software.Slides may contain text, graphics, movies, and other objects, which may be arranged freely on the slide. PowerPoint, however, facilitates the use of a consistent style in a presentation using a template or "Slide Master".The presentation can be printed or displayed live on a computer and navigated through at the command of the presenter. For larger audiences the computer display is often projected using a video projector. Slides can also form the basis of webcasts.PowerPoint provides three types of movements:Entrance, emphasis, and exit of elements on a slide itself are controlled by what PowerPoint calls Custom AnimationsTransitions, on the other hand are movements between slides. These can be animated in a variety of waysCustom animation can be used to create small story boards by animating pictures to enter, exit or moveWith callouts, speech bubbles with edited text can be sent on and off to create speech. The overall design of a presentation can be controlled with a master slide; and the overall structure, extending to the text on each slide, can be edited using a primitive outliner.Presentations can be saved and run in any of the file formats: the default .ppt (presentation), .pps (PowerPoint Show) or .pot (template). In PowerPoint 2007 and Mac OS X 2008 versions, the XML-based file formats .pptx, .ppsx and .potx have been introduced, along with the macro-enabled file formats .pptm, .potm, .ppsm..Cultural effectsSupporters and critics generally agreePowerPoint Presentations: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Essay&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The Technology Source Archives - The Use of PowerPoint in Teaching Comparative Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; that the ease of use of presentation software can save a lot of time for people who otherwise would have used other types of visual aid—hand-drawn or mechanically typeset slides, blackboards or whiteboards, or overhead projections. Ease of use also encourages those who otherwise would not have used visual aids, or would not have given a presentation at all, to make presentations. As PowerPoint's style, animation, and multimedia abilities have become more sophisticated, and as the application has generally made it easier to produce presentations (even to the point of having an "AutoContent Wizard" suggesting a structure for a presentation), the difference in needs and desires of presenters and audiences has become more noticeable.File formats The binary format specification has been available from Microsoft on request but since February 2008 the .ppt format specification can be freely downloaded and implemented under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise patent licensing.In Microsoft Office 2007 the binary file formats were replaced as the default format by the new XML based Office Open XML formats, which are published as an open standard.See alsoPowerPoint animationSlideshowComparison of office suitesPresentation softwareReferencesExternal linksPowerpoint team blogOfficial Microsoft PowerPoint websitePowerPoint 2007 ViewerPowerPoint Heaven — The Power to Animate Tutorials and animations in regards to using PowerPoint.PowerPoint FAQ pages Frequently Asked Questions on PowerPoint.Free Trial Download of PowerPoint from MicrosoftPowerPoint creator Robert Gaskins' websiteCategory:Mac OS software Category:Mac OS X software PowerPoint Category:Presentation software PowerPoint Category:Windows softwarear:مايكروسوفت باوربوينت az:Microsoft PowerPoint bs:Microsoft PowerPoint bg:Microsoft PowerPoint ca:Microsoft PowerPoint cs:Microsoft PowerPoint da:Microsoft PowerPoint de:Microsoft PowerPoint es:Microsoft PowerPoint eu:Microsoft PowerPoint fa:مایکروسافت پاورپوینت fr:Microsoft PowerPoint ko:마이크로소프트 파워포인트 hr:Microsoft PowerPoint id:Microsoft PowerPoint it:Microsoft PowerPoint he:Microsoft PowerPoint lt:Microsoft PowerPoint nl:Microsoft Office PowerPoint ja:Microsoft PowerPoint no:Microsoft Office PowerPoint pl:Microsoft PowerPoint pt:Microsoft PowerPoint ro:Microsoft PowerPoint ru:Microsoft PowerPoint simple:Microsoft PowerPoint sl:Microsoft PowerPoint fi:Microsoft PowerPoint sv:Microsoft PowerPoint tl:Microsoft PowerPoint tr:Microsoft PowerPoint uk:Microsoft PowerPoint zh:Microsoft PowerPoint
