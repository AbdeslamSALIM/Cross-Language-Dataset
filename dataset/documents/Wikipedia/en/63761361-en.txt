Located on the Warta River, it is one of the oldest cities in Poland, making it an important historical centre and a vibrant centre of trade, industry, and education. Poznań is Poland's fifth largest city and fourth biggest industrial centre. It is also the administrative capital of the Greater Poland Voivodeship.Poznań's cathedral is the oldest in the country, containing the tombs of the first Polish rulers: Duke Mieszko I, King Boleslaus the Brave, King Mieszko II, Duke Casimir I the Restorer, Duke Przemysł I, and King Przemysł II.EtymologyThe name Poznań probably comes from a personal name Poznan (from the Polish participle poznan(y)) and would mean "Poznan's town." It is also possible the name comes directly from the verb poznać which means "to get to know" or "to recognize".The earliest surviving references to the city were by Thietmar in his chronicles: episcopus Poznaniensis ("Bishop of Poznań", 970) and ab urbe Poznani ("by" or "from the city Poznań", 1005). Early spellings include Posna and Posnan, which have also historically been used in English.The official city name in full is The Capital City of Poznań (). Poznań is known as Posen in German, and was officially known as Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen ("Capital and Residence City of Poznań") between 20 August 1910, and 28 November 1918. The city has been known in Latin as Posnania and civitas Posnaniensis. Its Yiddish name is פּױזן, or Poyzn.History  Mieszko I, the first known duke of the Polans, built one of his castles in Poznań. The Cathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul is the oldest Polish cathedral, founded in Poznań during the latter half of the 10th century. The city would become the capital of Greater Poland. Mieszko I's son, Boleslaus the Brave, was crowned king in 1025 and the Kingdom of Poland was formed. Greater Poland became the 'cradle of the Polish state', and both Mieszko I and Boleslaus I are buried in Poznań. Lubrański Academy, the second Polish university (not a "full" university, in fact, as science students had to go to Kraków) was established in 1519.Poznań was the capital of the Greater Poland area when it came under the control of Prussia in 1793 and had its administrative area renamed to South Prussia. During the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806, local Polish resistance fighters rebelled, thereby assisting the efforts of Napoleon while simultaneously driving out the occupying Prussian forces. The city became part of the Duchy of Warsaw in 1807 and was capital of the Poznań Department. Napoleon's defeat led to the Congress of Vienna, where the boundaries of Europe were redrawn by the victors. Greater Poland was returned to Prussia and became the capital of the autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen. From the time of the Revolutions of 1848, Poznań was the capital of the Prussian Province of Posen. It became part of the German Empire during the unification of German states in 1871.Shortly after Imperial Germany's defeat in World War I, the Great Poland Uprising (1918-1919) occurred, leading to the creation of the Second Polish Republic, in which Poznań became the capital of Poznań Voivodeship. During World War II, Poland suffered under Nazi occupation and the Polish population was severely repressed. In 1945, the city was declared a Festung (a fortified locale in which German forces were expected to conduct a last-ditch defense) by order of Hitler. As Poznań lay on the direct route from Warsaw to Berlin, the Red Army first besieged and then assaulted the German defenses, culminating in the assault on the Cytadela (citadelle) and resulting in serious damage to the city. Since the war's end, Poznań has been the capital of the surrounding area through administrative district boundary changes in 1957, 1975, and 1999; Poznań currently administrates Greater Poland Voivodeship, one of 16 provinces in the country.Anti-communist protests in 1956 played a significant role in liberalising the post-war communist regime. and Georg Braun's Civitates Orbis Terrarum, Köln 1618]] ]]  tram in Poznań]] Historical populationDetailed demographic tables: Historical population of Poznań Historical population summary:1600 : about 20,000 inhabitants1732 : 4000 inhabitants1793 : 15,000 inhabitants before1918 : 156,091 inhabitants (from government data)1939 : 274,155 inhabitants1946 : 268,000 inhabitants2000 : 572,900 inhabitantsMay 2002: 578,900 inhabitants2020 population Forecast:Poznań City 584,500 (small increase)Poznań County 305,500 (significant increase)Poznań Metro Area 890,000GeographyCity area  (2002)Geographical location:52°17'34N - 52°30'27N16°44'08E - 17°04'28EHighest point: Mt.

The rapidly growing city annexed the neighboring villages of Grunwald, Łazarz, Górczyn, Jeżyce, Wilda, Winogrady in 1900, Piątkowo and Rataje in later years. Today, Poznań is divided into five districts, which are further divided onto several dozens of neighborhoods. The districts are:Stare MiastoNowe MiastoJeżyceGrunwaldWildaEconomyPoznań has been an important center of trade since the Middle Ages. Starting in the 19th century, local heavy industry began to grow. Several major factories were built, including the steel mill and railway factory of Hipolit Cegielski (see H. Cegielski - Poznań S.A.).Today Poznań is one of the major centers of trade with Germany. Many Western European companies started their Polish branches in Poznań, or in the nearby localities of Tarnowo Podgórne and Swarzędz. It is the site of annual Poznań International Fair.Most foreign investors are German and Dutch companies (see "Major corporations" above), with a few others. Investors are mostly from the food processing, furniture, automotive and transport & logistics industries. Foreign companies are primarily attracted by low labour costs, but also by the relatively good road and railway network, good vocational skills of workers and relatively liberal employment laws. As compared with Germany, there are far fewer restrictions, e.g. on shop opening hours.For a list of major Poznań-based corporations see Major corporations in PoznańCultureThe annual Malta Theater festival is probably the most characteristic cultural event of the city. There are also Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition (held every 5 years), and Classical Music Festival (annual).EducationPoznań is home to a few state-owned universities and a number of smaller, mostly private-run colleges and institutions of higher education.

This has resulted in a massive investment from foreign companies in Poznań itself, as well as in communities west and south of Poznań (namely, Kórnik and Tarnowo Podgórne). Worth noticing is the positive attitude of public administration towards investments, and less annoying "red tape" than elsewhere in Poland.City investment into transportation was mostly in the public transport area. While the number of cars since 1989 has at least doubled, the policy of improving public transport gave good effects. Limiting car access to the city center, building new tram lines (inc. Poznański Szybki Tramwaj) and investing in new rolling stock (such as modern Combino trams by Siemens and Solaris low-floor buses) actually increased the level of ridership. This is a notable success, even considering the fact that Polish society only possesses about half of the "old EU"'s purchasing power, hence not everybody can afford to own a car.Future investments into transportation include the construction of a "third ring road" around the city, and the completion of A2 (E30) highway towards Berlin. In the public transport area (and non-car transportation), further investment must be made into the development bicycle paths (and the linking of presently existing ones), and an attempt is presently made of developing Karlsruhe-style light rail system for commuters. All that is made more complicated (and more expensive) by the heavy neglect of transportation throughout communist era.ConstituencyMembers of Sejm elected in 2005 from Poznań constituency:Arkady Radosław Fiedler, POWaldy Dzikowski, POMaria Pasło-Wiśniewska, PODariusz Lipiński, POMichał Stuligrosz,POTomasz Górski, PiSJan Filip Libicki, PiSMałgorzata Stryjska, PiSJacek Tomczak, PiSKrystyna Łybacka, SLDMembers of European Parliament elected from Poznań constituency:Filip Kaczmarek, POMarcin Libicki, PiSJan Kułakowski, Unia WolnościJan Masiel, SamoobronaWitold Tomczak, LPRMarek Siwiec, SLDTwin townsPoznań is twinned with:Wprowadzenie :: Miejski Informator Multimedialny&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Assen, Netherlands; since 1992 Braşov, Romania; since 2003 Brno, Czech Republic; since 1966 Hannover, Germany; since 1979 Jyväskylä, Finland; since 1979 Kharkiv, Ukraine; since 1998 Nablus, West Bank; since 1997 Nottinghamshire, United Kingdom; since 1994 Pozuelo de Alarcón, Spain; since 1992 Rennes, France; since 1998 Shenzhen, People's Republic of China; since 1993 Toledo, Ohio, United States; since 1991 Győr, Hungary; since 2008Notable residentsAnna Anderson (c. 1900 - 1984), pretender of Grand Duchess Anastasia of RussiaLothar von Arnauld de la Perière (1886 - 1941), German U-boat commanderIsidor Ascheim (1891-1968), painter and printmakerStanisław Barańczak (born 1946), poetHerbert Baum (1912 – 1942) resistance fighterZygmunt Bauman (born 1925), sociologistBernhard Baumeister (1828-1917), actorJózef Brzeziński, biologistBrigitte Burmeister (died 1940), novelistHeinrich Caro (1834-1910), chemistHipolit Cegielski (1815-1868), businessmanDezydery Chłapowski (1788-1848), generalAugust Cieszkowski (1814-1894), philosopherAntoni Czubiński (1928-2003), historianLeopold Damrosch (1832 – 1885), conductorLudwig Dessoir, (1810 - 1874), actorFranciszek Dobrowolski (1830-1896), theater directorTytus Działyński (1796-1861), political activistMałgorzata Dydek (born 1974), basketball playerAkiva Eiger (1761-1837), Rabbi of Poznań (1815-1837)Jean Paul Ertel (1865-1933), composerEwaryst Estkowski (1820-1856), teacherFredrak Fraske (1872-1973), the last surviving United States veteran of the Indian WarsJean Gebser (1905-1973), human consciousness scientistEduard Gerhard (1795 - 1867), archaeologistFriedrich Goltz (1834 - 1902), physiologistKonstanty Gorski (1859-1924), composer and violinistPaul von Hindenburg (1847-1934), Field Marshal and President of the Weimar RepublicMaksymilian Jackowski (1815-1905), activistJohn Jonston (1603-1675), naturalist and physicianStefan Jurga (born 1946), professor and rector of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań (1996-2002)Jan A.P.
