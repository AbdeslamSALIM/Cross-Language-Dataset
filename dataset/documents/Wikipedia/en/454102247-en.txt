Mr. Olympia is an international bodybuilding competition which is held annually by the International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB). Winning is considered to be the highest accolade in the sport of professional bodybuilding.The competition was created by Joe Weider to allow the Mr. Universe winners to continue competing and to earn money. The first Mr. Olympia was held on September 18, 1965 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York City, with Larry Scott winning his first of two straight titles.The record number of wins is eight, held by Lee Haney (1984–1991) and Ronnie Coleman (1998–2005). Dexter Jackson currently holds the title of Mr. Olympia.The film Pumping Iron (1977), featured the build up to the 1975 Mr. Olympia, in Pretoria South Africa and helped launch the acting careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno, both finalists in the contest.There is a parallel contest, the Ms. Olympia, for female bodybuilders. In addition, the Fitness Olympia and Figure Olympia are held for fitness and figure competitors, respectively.History1960sThe 1965 and 1966 Mr Olympia were won by Larry Scott, a famous bodybuilder of the time. Scott displayed a physique with defined muscle shape in his biceps, triceps, shoulders and chest, which were all large, rounded and fully shaped. His upper arms measured over 20 inches and were, at the time, among the largest ever displayed at a professional bodybuilding competition. Scott subsequently retired after his 1966 victory.Harold Poole continues to hold two Mr. Olympia distinctions. One is that in 1965 he competed in the first Mr. Olympia at the age of 21, he remains the youngest ever competitor to have participated in the Olympia to this day. The other distinction is that he was the only man to compete in all three of the initial Mr. Olympia contests. He was runner up in the 1965, 1966 and 1967 shows.The 1967 Mr Olympia heralded a new era in bodybuilding competition. Sergio Oliva, nicknamed "The Myth", won the next 3 Mr Olympia competitions. At 5ft 11ins and 240lbs,1 in bodyweight, Oliva displayed a level of muscle mass and definition - including a "V" shape of a large, well-formed upper-body that tapered down to a narrow waist - unlike anything seen in prior competitions. His upper arms measured nearly 22 inches, with his chest measured at 58 inches,2 which tapered down to a 29 inch waist and two well-muscled legs. Oliva would go on to win the Mr. Olympia competition in 1967, 1968, and 1969 - where he would defeat Arnold Schwarzenegger 4 to 3, marking Schwarzenegger's first and only loss in a Mr. Olympia competition.1970sArnold Schwarzenegger defeated Sergio Oliva at the 1970 Mr Olympia after finishing second the year before. At 6ft 2inches and 240lbs. he was able to match Sergio Oliva for size in his upper arms, chest and back. However, contest judges deemed that Schwarzenegger's extra definition and muscularity over Sergio Oliva were substantial enough to award him the title. Schwarzenegger successfully defended his title against Oliva in 1972, after which Oliva retired from the IFBB. Schwarzenegger went on to win the next three Mr. Olympia competitions, including the 1975 Mr. Olympia competition, which was highlighted in the film Pumping Iron and featured other notable bodybuilders such as Lou Ferrigno, Serge Nubret, and Franco Columbu, who would go on to win the 1976 competition.After winning the 1975 competition, Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from competitive bodybuilding; this was depicted in the 1977 docudrama, Pumping Iron.Frank Zane won the 1977, 1978, and 1979 competitions. While not as physically massive as previous competitors such as Schwarzenegger, Oliva, or Ferrigno, Zane developed his physique to highlight symmetry, aesthetics, and definition. As such, Zane was able to defeat opponents who exceeded his own muscle-mass but lacked his level of muscular definition.1980sIn 1980, Schwarzenegger came out of retirement to win in what has been viewed as a controversial decision. Based on a noticeable lack of conditioning, compared to his previous competitions, allegations were made that Schwarzenegger was declared the winner based on his popularity and increasing celebrity, rather than his physique. Critics argued that the judges had been changed to those of Schwarzenegger's associates, and that Schwarzenegger himself had been a late entry into the competition. CBS Sports, despite the time, money and effort required to send a film crew half way around the world to Australia to film a sporting event, refused to air that contest due to their sincere belief that it was fixed.The following year, Franco Columbu was awarded a similarly controversial victory, which led critics to argue that the judging had lost its objective viewpoint and now awarded on reputation rather than quality of physique.Chris Dickerson won the 1982 competition, Samir Bannout won the 1983 competition, and Lee Haney won a record-setting eight consecutive competitions, starting in 1984.1990sHaney retired from competitive bodybuilding after his last Mr. Olympia victory in 1991.Having placed 2nd to Haney the previous year, Dorian Yates won the 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 competitions. During this time, judging in professional bodybuilding competitions started placing greater emphasis on muscle mass, with many bodybuilding traditionalists commenting that muscle mass had now become the most important factor to winning, even greater than that of symmetry, aesthetics and proportion.Yates retired from competitive bodybuilding after his 1997 victory. Starting in 1998, Ronnie Coleman won the next eight competitions.In 1994 Joe Weider decided to add a separate Masters Olympia competition for professional bodybuilders to continue to compete at the highest levels in their later years.2000sColeman won the Mr. Olympia competition eight consecutive times, tying the record set by Haney. Coleman returned in 2006 to defend his title but instead placed second to Jay Cutler, who won his first title after three consecutive years of finishing second in placing to Coleman. Cutler then successfully defended his title again in 2007. Coleman came in fourth place and announced his retirement from competition. In 2008, Dexter Jackson defeated Jay Cutler and became the new Mr. Olympia. In the same year, Dennis Wolf and Phil Heath, who many say are the future of the contest, placed 4th and 3rd respectively.QualifyingAll Mr. Olympia competitors must meet the qualifying criteria. Possible methods of qualifying are:Previous Mr. Olympia winner (but if more than 5 years have passed IFBB approval is required)Top 6 finalist from previous year's Mr. OlympiaTop 6 finalist from same year's Arnold ClassicTop 5 finalist from same year's New York Men’s Professional (previously the Night of the Champions)Top 3 finalist from any other competition in the I.F.B.B professional tour held during the subsequent year prior to the Mr. OlympiaThe winner of the Masters Professional World ChampionshipsOn top of this, the event organizer can nominate one competitor, who has not qualified by other means, as a “special invitee”. Schwarzenegger was able to enter into the 1980 Mr. Olympia contest because of this rule and the fact that he had won the Mr. Olympia contest 5 years prior.WinnersYearWinnerVenue196522px]] Larry ScottNew York City, New York, United States196622px]] Larry ScottNew York City, New York, United States196722px]] Sergio OlivaNew York City, New York, United States196822px]] Sergio OlivaNew York City, New York, United States196922px]] Sergio OlivaNew York City, New York, United States197022px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerNew York City, New York, United States197122px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerParis, France197222px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerEssen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany197322px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerNew York City, New York, United States197422px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerNew York City, New York, United States197522px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerPretoria, Gauteng, South Africa197622px]] Franco ColumbuColumbus]], Ohio, United States197722px]] Frank ZaneColumbus]], Ohio, United States197822px]] Frank ZaneColumbus]], Ohio, United States197922px]] Frank ZaneColumbus]], Ohio, United States198022px]] Arnold SchwarzeneggerSydney, New South Wales, Australia198122px]] Franco ColumbuColumbus]], Ohio, United States198222px]] Chris DickersonLondon, England, United Kingdom198322px]] Samir BannoutMunich, Bavaria, Germany198422px]] Lee HaneyNew York City, New York, United States198522px]] Lee HaneyBrussels, Belgium198622px]] Lee HaneyColumbus]], Ohio, United States198722px]] Lee HaneyGothenburg, Sweden198822px]] Lee HaneyLos Angeles]], California, United States198922px]] Lee HaneyRimini, Emilia-Romagna, Italy199022px]] Lee HaneyChicago, Illinois, United States199122px]] Lee HaneyOrlando]], Florida, United States199222px]] Dorian YatesHelsinki, Finland199322px]] Dorian YatesAtlanta]], Georgia, United States199422px]] Dorian YatesAtlanta]], Georgia, United States199522px]] Dorian YatesAtlanta]], Georgia, United States199622px]] Dorian YatesChicago, Illinois, United States199722px]] Dorian YatesLong Beach]], California, United States199822px]] Ronnie ColemanNew York City, New York, United States199922px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200022px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200122px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200222px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200322px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200422px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200522px]] Ronnie ColemanLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200622px]] Jay CutlerLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200722px]] Jay CutlerLas Vegas]], Nevada, United States200822px]] Dexter JacksonLas Vegas]], Nevada, United StatesNumber of winsWinsNamesYears822px]] Lee Haney1984–199122px]] Ronnie Coleman1998–2005722px]] Arnold Schwarzenegger1970–1975, 1980622px]] Dorian Yates1992–1997322px]] Sergio Oliva1967–196922px]] Frank Zane1977–1979222px]] Larry Scott1965–196622px]] Franco Columbu1976, 198122px]] Jay Cutler2006–2007122px]] Samir Bannout198322px]] Chris Dickerson198222px]] Dexter Jackson2008References See alsoList of male professional bodybuildersExternal linksOlympia 2006Photo history of all of the Mr. Olympia winnersSite with pictures and resultsHistory Of Mr OlympiaCategory:Professional bodybuilding competitionsar:بطولة مستر أوليمبيا bg:Мистър Олимпия de:Mr. Olympia es:Mister Olympia fr:Mr. Olympia it:Mister Olympia lt:Mr. Olympia nl:Mr Olympia ja:ミスター・オリンピア pl:Mr. Olympia pt:Mr. Olympia ro:Mr. Olympia ru:Мистер_Олимпия sk:Mr. Olympia fi:Mr. Olympia sv:Mr. Olympia
