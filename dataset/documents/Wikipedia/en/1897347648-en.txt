 Regional cup best  = | The Albania national football team is the national football team of Albania and is controlled by the Football Association of Albania. Although not considered as one of the strongest footballing sides in Europe, Albanians are passionate about their football and the national team has occasionally managed to perform well against more illustrious opponents.Founded on June 6, 1930, Albania had to wait 16 years to play the first international match, debuting against Yugoslavia in 1946. In 1932 Albania had already joined FIFA (during the congress June 12 - June 16) and in 1954 it was one of the founding members of UEFA. Albania had been invited to play in World Cup 1934, but owing to organizing difficulties it didn't take part.In addition to the senior football team, Albania also has teams of U21, U19, and U17 level. One of the most successful is the feeder of the senior team, the U21 level. In the finals of the Euro 1984 U21 championship they went all the way to the quarter-finals, only to be knocked out by Italy 2-0 on aggregate. They became the only Albanian team in any level to qualify for a competitive tournament. Currently Albania does not have a women's. Most of the matches of Albanian national team have been played in Qemal Stafa. The stadium was built around the 1930s as a multi-use stadium. Today, it is mostly used for football matches. The stadium has a capacity of 19,200 spectators with 15,000 seats. Albania has also used the Loro-Boriçi stadium in Shkodra where they have had some successful matches, like beating Russia 3-1 in a home Euro 2004 qualifying match. There is a rumor that the Football Association of Albania is planning to build a stadium in Tirana with a capacity of around 30,000.Albania has an official supporters' association, the Tifozat Kuq e Zi who self-finance their activities using help from FSHF to arrange traveling and stadium visits for the matches.Tifozat Kuq e ZiOn December 2007, Albanian Football Federation president Armando Duka announced Arie Haan would replace Croatia's Otto Baric as Albania head coach. He signed a two-year contract on January 4, 2008. FIFA Haan named Albania boss''Albania start their FIFA World Cup 2010 Qualifying campaign against Sweden on September 6, 2008. They have been drawn in Group 1 with Sweden, Portugal, Denmark, Hungary and Malta.On March 14, 2008, Albania was suspended from international football (FIFA and UEFA) due to heavy political interference in the FA. The suspension lasted 46 days.Albania suspension lifted by FIFA FIFA says its emergency committee has decided to lift suspension of AlbaniaFIFA lifts suspension of Albania over alleged interferenceHistoryThe early years oversaw a notably successful Balkan Cup in the 1946 campaign. Albania won the cup after overcoming Yugoslavia on level points but a better goal difference. The final match was played and won against Romania 1-0. Four days earlier, Albania had already beaten Bulgaria 3-1. Interestingly, Albania wasn't expected to participate, but the withdrawal of Greece from the tournament offered Albania a chance to join in the re-established post-war cup.After taking part for the first time in European Championships in 1963, for edition 1964, in the 1968 European qualifiers, they managed a 0-0 draw against West Germany, which eventually eliminated West Germany from qualification. During that era, Albania boasted arguably its greatest ever footballer, Panajot Pano.The 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers brought further notable results with a 2-2 draw away to Poland and a 2-0 win over eventual semi-finalists Belgium.The qualifiers for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers saw Albania forced to play some home games on neutral venues due to civil unrest at home. However, they achieved a 4-1 win over Turkey in an away friendly match in 1998 - the only time Albania have scored more than 3 goals in a full international match (although they did win 5-0 at home to Montenegro on September 22, 1946, Montenegro was at that time part of Yugoslavia).During the 2004 European qualifiers, Albania managed a heroic 3-1 win against Russia in Shkodër.The 2006 World Cup qualifiers qualifiers have seen Albania's results improve markedly, including an epic 2-1 victory against the then newly crowned European Champions, Greece.Recently, the U19 team also known as Shpresat (The Team of Hopes), managed to qualify for the Elite round in the Euro U19 2008 which is going to be held in Czech Republic. Along the way, they lost against Spain (2-0), won a very important match against Serbia (2-1) and drew with Lichtenstein (0-0). They are expected to resume the tournament in March 1.UEFA European U-19 C'shipFIFA World Cup 1966 QualificationThe first time that Albania competed for a place in the world's elite for the World Cup 1966 in England was a match against Netherlands in mid-1964. Drawn in Group 5 with the Dutch were also Northern Ireland and Switzerland. Albania only got a point from this qualification round in a game against Northern Ireland in Tirana, which actually prevented Northern Ireland from qualfiying.Group 5May 24, 1964, Rotterdam, Netherlands -  2&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 October 25, 1964, Tirana, Albania -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 April 11, 1965, Tirana, Albania -  0&nbsp;-&nbsp;2 May 2, 1965, Geneva, Switzerland -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0 May 7, 1965, Belfast, Northern Ireland -  4&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 November 24, 1965, Tirana, Albania -  1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 Switzerland qualified.RankTeamPtsPldWDLGFGA196411732863219536622264416015212UEFA Euro 1984 QualificationsIn its first participation of a Euro qualifier in group edition, Albania finished last out of four other teams competing for the spot in the tournament. In 8 played matches Albania got 2 points, with 2 draws, 6 losses, and no wins. On the other hand, Albania made some power nations nervous. They lost 0-1 away to Turkey with the goal being scored in the 86th minute. In the next two games Albania tied Northern Ireland to a scoreless draw and lost 1-2 to Germany, both home games. In the last three matches, Albania tied Turkey, in Qemal Stafa, also losing to Austria 2-1 in Tirana. The last game of the competition was an away game to Germany. After 22 minutes Albania went ahead 0-1 with a goal by Genc Tomori.

This was the season when Albania was undefeated at home. Tying two and winning two, but with 0 points on the road. Albania started the undefeated run with a 1-1 draw against eventual winners of the group, Switzerland. Then a back to back encounter with Russia, saw the lose 4-1 in Russian soil, but when they returned, they paid them back by beating them 3-1. This game was the biggest for Albania. After missing a penalty, Albania scored first after just 20 minutes, but Russia tied 56 minutes later. Then after a lot of pressure from Albania, Russia conceded 2 goals in just 3 minutes. In the two other home games, Albania tied Republic of Ireland 0-0 and beat Georgia 3-1.

Two months after Greece beat Portugal to win the European championship, Albania defeated Greece 2-1 in a match which Albania scored goals in the 2' and 11' minute. Albania went on to disappoint by losing to Georgia away and Denmark at home, before returning to winning ways by beating Kazakhstan 0-1. February and March 2005 would be the toughest part of the qualification for Albania since they had to play Ukraine, Turkey, and Greece, losing all three of those ties. Later Albania would beat Georgia 3-2 and Kazakhstan 2-1. The last positive result for Albania in this tournament would be a 2-2 draw away at Ukraine. At the end Albania got 13 points and topped Georgia and Kazakhstan.

Starting with the 2-2 away draw to Belarus, two wins against Luxembourg home and away (2-0, 0-3) and a 0-0 draw away to Bulgaria have been the most cherished results. Great matches have been played against Netherlands in both legs, although allegedly dubious referee decisions have marred Albania's performances,Disallowed Albanian goal, versus the Netherlands, Euro 2008 qualifier: ESPNsoccernet website.

Other set-backs have also been suffered after drawing 0-0 against Slovenia and losing 0-2 to Romania in both matches played at home. Albania ended hopes of qualifying mathematically when they failed to win over Slovenia away and managed a yet again 0-0 draw. In the penultimate match at home against Bulgaria, Albania excelled playing wonderfully but ended up in a very unlucky draw. After going ahead with dominating football, they conceded in the dying minutes and later missed a penalty. In the last match at home, Albania was hugely disappointing losing 2-4 against Belarus. Contrary to the popular belief that this would be the easiest match during the campaign, Albania not only missed a chance to break the points-record of all competitions but also produced a very lethargic performance in a rainy night. Albania's Euro campaign ended with a disaster match, losing 6-1 away to Romania which eventually resulted in the resignation of the coach Otto Barić and his assistant.Baric: Po largohemGroup G | score = 2 &ndash; 2 | team2 =  | goals1= Kalachev Romaschenko  | goals2= Skela   Hasi  | stadium = Dinamo Stadium, Minsk  Attendance: '23,000 'Referee: Asumaa (Finland)|report = Report- | score = 0 &ndash; 2 | team2 =  | goals1= | goals2= Dică   Mutu  | stadium = Qemal Stafa, Tirana  Attendance: 10,000Referee: Benquerença (Portugal)| report = Report- |score= 2 &ndash; 1  |team2 =  |goals1 = van Persie   Beqaj  |goals2 = Curri  |stadium = Amsterdam ArenA, Amsterdam Attendance: 40,000 Referee: Yefet (Israel)|report = Report- |score= 0 &ndash; 0 |team2 =  |goals1 = |goals2 = |stadium = Vasil Levski National Stadium, Sofia Attendance: 25,000Referee: Eriksson (Sweden)|report = Report- |score= 2 &ndash; 0 |team2 =  |goals1 = Kapllani   Haxhi |goals2 =|stadium = Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 8,000Referee: Silagava (Georgia)|report = Report- |score= 0 &ndash; 3 |team2 =  |goals1 = |goals2 =Skela   Kapllani  |stadium = Stade Josy Barthel, Luxembourg Attendance: 4,325Referee: Malzinskas (Lithuania)|report = Report-|score = 0 &ndash; 1  |team2 =  |goals1 = |goals2 = van Nistelrooy |stadium = Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 19,600Referee: Riley (England)|report = Report-|score = 1 &ndash; 1  |team2 =  |goals1 = Kishishev  |goals2 = Berbatov  |stadium = Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 8,000Referee: Stuchlik (Austria)|report = Report-|score = 2 &ndash; 4  |team2 =  |goals1 = Bogdani   Kapllani  |goals2 = Romaschenko    Kutuzov   |stadium = Qemal Stafa, Tirana Attendance: 5,000Referee: Demirlek (Turkey)|report = Report-|score = 6 &ndash; 1 |team2 =  |goals1 = Dică   Tamaş  Niculae  Marica  |goals2 = Kapllani  |stadium = Lia Manoliu Stadium, Bucharest Attendance: 25,000Referee: Trivkovic (Croatia)|report = ReportRomania and Netherlands qualified.Some memorable matchesDateTournamentPlaceMatchScoreOctober 9, 1946Balkan CupTirana, Albania Albania - Bulgaria '3&nbsp;-&nbsp;1October 13, 1946Balkan CupTirana, Albania Albania - Romania '1&nbsp;-&nbsp;0December 17, 1967Euro 1968 Qual.Tirana, Albania Albania - West Germany '0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0December 22, 1984World Cup 1986 Qual.Tirana, Albania Albania - Belgium '2&nbsp;-&nbsp;0January 21, 1998FriendlyAntalya, Turkey Turkey - Albania '1&nbsp;-&nbsp;4October 14, 1998Euro 2000 Qual.Oslo, Norway Norway - Albania '2&nbsp;-&nbsp;2October 11, 2000World Cup 2002 Qual.Tirana, Albania Albania - Greece '2&nbsp;-&nbsp;0April 25, 2001FriendlyGaziantep, Turkey Turkey - Albania '0&nbsp;-&nbsp;2March 29, 2003Euro 2004 Qual.Shkodër, Albania Albania - Russia '3&nbsp;-&nbsp;1February 18, 2004FriendlyTirana, Albania Albania - Sweden '2&nbsp;-&nbsp;1September 4, 2004World Cup 2006 Qual.Tirana, Albania Albania - Greece '2&nbsp;-&nbsp;1October 8, 2005World Cup 2006 Qual.Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine Ukraine - Albania '2&nbsp;-&nbsp;2March 28, 2007Euro 2008 Qual.Sofia, Bulgaria Bulgaria - Albania '0&nbsp;-&nbsp;0June 6, 2007Euro 2008 Qual.Luxembourg City, Luxembourg Luxembourg - Albania '0&nbsp;-&nbsp;3September 12, 2007Euro 2008 Qual.Tirana, Albania Albania - Netherlands '0&nbsp;-&nbsp;1October 17, 2007Euro 2008 Qual.Tirana, Albania Albania - Bulgaria '1&nbsp;-&nbsp;1SquadThe Kosovo dilemmaDue to the fact that some national team players were born in Kosovo (around 92% ethnic Albanian country)Statistical Office of Kosovo, there is a clear possibility that those players could leave for the future Kosovo national football team. Kosovo has declared its independence and this will start a new process as FIFA and UEFA look to accept the newly formed country and its football federation, similar to the case of Montenegro and its break-up from the union with Serbia.The current and most selected players in the national team who were born in Kosovo (or registered as citizens of the Republic of Kosovo) are: Arjan Beqaj, Armend Dallku, Blerim Rrustemi, Debatik Curri, Lorik Cana and Besart Berisha. Lorik Cana has faithfully declared that Albanians have one national team and he will remain with AlbaniaLeter e hapur nga Lorik Cana: Na bashkon kombëtarjaLetër e hapur drejtuar gjithë dashamirësve të Kombëtares kuqezi while Debatik Curri said, "One strong national team is better than two weak ones", similar to Besnik Hasi (now retired).Debatik Curri: Më mirë një kombëtare e fortë se sa dy të dobëta. Another uncapped Kosovo-born player, Ilir Nallbani, has reiterated his desire to play for Albania saying "I am Albanian, I want the red-and-black jersey. If I am given the chance, I will choose Albania."Nallbani: Jam shqiptar, dua një fanellë kuqezi! Others however have remained silent.In international football, players are normally committed to play for a specific national team to the exclusion of all others once they play in all or part of any match recognised as a full international by FIFA. However, an exception is made in cases where one or more newly-independent states are created out of a former state. Based on current FIFA rules, a player will be eligible to play for Kosovo, even if he had previously represented Albania, if at least one of the following statements about him is trueRegulations for the Status and Transfer of Players:He was born in Kosovo.At least one of his parents and/or at least one of his grandparents was born in Kosovo.He has lived in Kosovo continuously for any two-year period.Due to mixed ancestries, it is probable that a large percentage of the players eligible to play for Kosovo will also remain eligible to play for Albania, and vice versa. However, once they have played for either Albania or Kosovo, they are no longer eligible to play for the other one.Current PlayersNote:Players containing the  flag possess dual nationality.
