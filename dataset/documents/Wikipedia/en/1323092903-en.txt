   ]] s Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861]]Pudding most often refers to a dessert, but can also be a savory dish. There are two main types.The word pudding probably comes from the French boudin, originally from the Latin botellus, meaning "small sausage," referring to encased meats used in Medieval European puddings. In the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries, pudding is a common term for any dessert.Baked, steamed and boiled puddingsThe first type of pudding is a solid mass formed by mixing various ingredients with a grain product or another binder (e.g., batter, flour, cereal, blood, eggs, suet). These puddings are cooked by baking, steaming or boiling.This type of pudding is still common in various places and is served as either a main-course dish or a dessert. In Australia, pudding is usually used to describe this type, though the term also may be used to refer to the second type (see below) as well. These are less common in North America.Many puddings of this type resemble cakes, characteristically with more moisture and usually served in chunks rather than slices. Others are types of sausages. Dessert pudding is often accompanied by custard or ice cream.Boiled pudding was a common main course aboard ships in the Royal Navy in the 18th and 19th centuries. Pudding was used as the primary dish in which daily rations of flour and suet were prepared.Suet puddingSteamed pies consisting of a filling completely enclosed by suet pastry are also known as puddings. These may be sweet or savoury and include such dishes as steak and kidney pudding.Creamy puddingsThe second and newer type of pudding consists of sugar, milk, and a thickening agent such as cornstarch, gelatin, eggs, rice or tapioca to create a sweet, creamy dessert. These puddings are made either by simmering on top of the stove in a saucepan or double boiler or by baking in an oven, often in a bain-marie. They are typically served chilled, but a few types, such as zabaglione and rice pudding, may be served warm.This is the most familiar meaning of the term in North America and some European countries such as the Netherlands, whilst in Britain egg-thickened puddings are considered custards and starch-thickened puddings are blanc-mange. Pudding may be made from scratch or a mix or may be purchased ready to eat. The gelatin dessert company Jell-O is the primary producer of pudding mixes and prepared puddings in North America.List of types of puddingBaked, steamed and boiled puddingsSavoryBatter puddings, including Yorkshire pudding and popoversBlack puddingBoudinCheese puddingCorn puddingGoettaGroaty puddingHaggisHog's puddingKishkeKugelPease puddingPennsylvania Dutch hog mawPolenta (mămăligă, cornmeal mush)Red puddingScrappleSteak and kidney puddingWhite puddingDessertBread puddingBread and butter puddingCabinet puddingCarrot puddingChèCheshire puddingChocolate pudding (British Isles and Australasian version)Christmas pudding ("plum pudding")Clootie dumplingCottage puddingDuffGrape-Nuts puddingIndian puddingFiggy duffFiggy puddingFruit puddingHasty pudding Jam Roly-PolyRice puddingSpotted dickSticky date puddingSticky toffee puddingSummer puddingTapioca puddingCreamy puddingsBavarian creamBlancmangeCrema catalanaCreme anglaiseCrème brûlée (burnt cream)Creme caramelCornstarch puddings, including banana, butterscotch, lemon, pistachio, vanilla and chocolate (North American and Asian version)CustardFlanFoolHaupiaJunketJell-O BrandMango puddingMoussePanna cottaPot de cremePudding PopsRice pudding, including kheerSemolina puddingSyllabubTrifleZabaglione (sabayon)Miscellaneous dessertsIn these examples, the word ''pudding is used in the British sense meaning "any dessert," rather than the specific puddings discussed above.''Bakewell puddingPudding cakePudding pieQueen of puddingsCultural referencesThe proverb, "The proof of the pudding's in the eating" dates back to at least the 17th century.title =Ask Yahoo | http://ask.yahoo.com/20020903.html&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;Puddin' 'n' Tain&quot; was a popular doo-wop song by the Alley Kats.
