Henry Raspe (; 1204 &ndash; February 16, 1247) succeeded Hermann II as Landgrave of Thuringia in central Germany in 1241; he later was elected anti-king in 1246-1247 in opposition to Conrad IV of Germany.In 1226, Henry's brother Ludwig IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, died en route to the Sixth Crusade, and Henry became regent for his under-age nephew Hermann II. He managed to expel his nephew and the boy's young mother, St. Elisabeth of Hungary, from the line of succession and ca. 1231 formally succeeded his brother as landgrave.In 1242 Henry, together with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, was selected by Emperor Frederick II to be administrator of Germany for Frederick's under-age son Conrad.After the papal ban on Frederick imposed by Pope Innocent IV in 1245, Raspe changed sides, and on 22 May 1246 he was elected counter-king in opposition to Conrad. The strong papal prodding that led to his election earned Raspe the derogatory moniker of "Pfaffenkönig" (parsons' king). Henry defeated Conrad in the Battle of Nidda in southern Hesse in August 1246, but he died several months later in Wartburg Castle near Eisenach in Thuringia.   |-    Category:1204 births Category:1247 deaths Category:Rulers of Thuringiade:Heinrich Raspe et:Heinrich Raspe es:Enrique Raspe fr:Henri le Raspon it:Enrico Raspe hu:Raspe Henrik nl:Hendrik Raspe ja:ハインリヒ・ラスペ pl:Henryk Raspe ru:Генрих IV Распе
