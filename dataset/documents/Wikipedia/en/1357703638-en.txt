He is sometimes confused with Karl Ludwig Hencke, another German astronomer.BiographyEncke studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the University of Göttingen under Carl Friedrich Gauss; but he enlisted in the Hanseatic Legion for the campaign of 1813–1814, and became lieutenant of artillery in the Prussian army in 1815. Having returned to Göttingen in 1816, he was at once appointed by Bernhardt von Lindenau as his assistant in the observatory of Seeberg near Gotha.There he completed his investigation of the comet of 1680, for which the Cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817; he correctly assigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812. That comet is now called 12P/Pons-Brooks.Following a suggestion by Jean-Louis Pons, who suspected one of the three comets discovered in 1818 to be the same one already discovered by him in 1805, Encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet. At this time, all the known comets only had an orbital period of seventy years and more, where the aphelion is far beyond the orbit of Uranus. The most famous comet of this family was Comet Halley with its period of seventy-six years. Therefore the orbit of the comet discovered by Pons was a sensation, because his orbit was found to have a period of 3.3 years, therefore the aphelion had to be within the orbit of Jupiter. Encke predicted its return for 1822, but this return was only observable from the southern hemisphere and was seen by Carl Ludwig Christian Rümker from Australia. The comet was also identified with the one seen by Pierre Méchain in 1786 and by Caroline Herschel in 1795.Encke sent his calculations as a note to Gauss, Olbers, and Bessel. His former mathematics professor published this note and Encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets. The first object of this family, the Encke comet, was named after him and so it is one of the few comets not named after the discoverer, but after the one who calculated the orbit. Later this comet was identified as the origin of the Taurids meteor showers.The importance of the predicted return based on the calculation by Encke was rewarded by the Royal Astronomical Society in London by presenting their Gold Medal to him in 1824. In this year Encke married Amalie Becker (1787–1879), daughter of a bookseller. They had three sons and two daughters.Eight masterly treatises on its movements were published by him in the Berlin Abhandlungen (1829–1859). From a fresh discussion of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced (1822–1824) a solar parallax of 8.57 arcsecond, long accepted as authoritative.In 1822 he became director of the Seeberg observatory, and in 1825 was promoted to a corresponding position at Berlin, where a new observatory, built under his superintendence and with the support of Alexander von Humboldt and King Frederick William III of Prussia, was inaugurated in 1835. Encke became director of the new observatory.He directed the preparation of the star-maps of the Berlin Academy (1830–1859), edited from 1830 and greatly improved the Astronomisches Jahrbuch, and issued four volumes of the Astronomische Beobachtungen of the Berlin observatory (1840–1857). Within the following time Encke was involved in the discovery and orbital parameter determination of other short periodic comets and asteroids.In 1837, Encke described a broad variation in the brightness of the A Ring of Saturn. The Encke Division was later named in honor of his observations of Saturn's rings.In 1844, Encke became professor for astronomy at the University of Berlin. Much labor was bestowed by him upon facilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids. With this end in view he expounded to the Berlin Academy in 1849 a mode of determining an elliptic orbit from three observations, and communicated to that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations by means of rectangular coordinates (republished in W. Ostwald's Klassiker der exacten Wissenschaften, No. 141, 1903).Encke visited England in 1840. Incipient brain-disease compelled him to withdraw from official life in November 1863. He still was director of the Berlin observatory until his death on 26 August 1865 in Spandau. His successor was Wilhelm Julius Foerster.He contributed extensively to the periodical literature of astronomy.Encke is buried at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin, the Friedhof II der Jerusalems- und Neuen Kirchengemeinde (61 Baruther Street). His grave is close to that of the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.HonorsTwice, in 1824 and 1830, the recipient of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society.Encke crater on the Moon is named for him.The asteroid 9134 Encke is named in his honour.The Encke gap of Saturn's rings is named after him.ReferencesExternal linksObituary of &quot;John Francis Encke&quot; Category:German astronomers Category:German people of the Napoleonic Wars Category:People from Hamburg Category:Prussian Army personnel Category:Recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:Humboldt University of Berlin facultyca:Johann Encke de:Johann Franz Encke el:Γιόχαν Ένκε es:Johann Encke fr:Johann Franz Encke it:Johann Franz Encke lb:Johann Franz Encke nl:Johann Encke ja:ヨハン・フランツ・エンケ pl:Johann Franz Encke ru:Энке, Иоганн Франц sk:Johann Franz Encke sl:Johann Franz Encke sv:Johann Franz Encke zh:恩克
