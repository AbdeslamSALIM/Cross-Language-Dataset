He was one of the world's leading clay court players in the 1990s, and at his peak was known as "The King of Clay."Muster, King of Clay, Gets His Slam Crown He won the French Open in 1995.CareerMuster first came to prominence when he reached the final of the French Open junior tournament and the Orange Bowl juniors tournament in 1985. He turned professional later that year and won his first tour title at Hilversum, (Netherlands) in 1986.In 1988, Muster reached six tour finals, winning four of them. He finished the year ranked in the world's top 20 for the first time.Early in 1989, Muster became the first Austrian to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open and, shortly after that, the first Austrian to be ranked in the world's top 10. In March, he defeated Yannick Noah in the semifinals of the Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida (now known as the Sony Ericsson Open) to set up a final match with World No. 1 Ivan Lendl. But in the hours that followed that semifinal victory, Muster was struck by a drunk driver, severing ligaments in his left knee and forcing him to default the final. He flew back to Vienna to undergo surgery. With the aid of a special chair designed to allow him to practice hitting balls while recovering from knee surgery, Muster returned to competitive tennis just six months later.Back In The SwingMuster's comeback continued in 1990, when he won four titles (three on clay and one on hardcourts), was runner-up in three tournaments, and reached the semifinals of the French Open. He also helped Austria reach the semifinals of Davis Cup, where they were eliminated 3–2 by the United States despite Muster winning both his singles rubbers against Andre Agassi and Michael Chang. For these achievements, Muster was named the ATP Tour's "Comeback Player of the Year."Muster won two more titles in 1991 and three in 1992 (all on clay courts).In 1993, he reached nine tournament finals, winning seven of them. He won 55 of 65 matches on clay.Muster won three clay court titles in 1994. He also beat Michael Stich of Germany in a first round Davis Cup tie in Graz. Muster won the five-set, 5 hour 25 minute match 12-10 in the final set. The match was the longest professional tennis match in the world that year.In 1995, Muster won 12 tournament finals in 14 attempts, which is a record. Between February and June, he won 40 consecutive clay court matches (the longest winning streak on the surface since Björn Borg had won 44 in 1977-79). At the French Open, Muster won his first and only Grand Slam singles title, when he defeated former champion Michael Chang in the final 7–5, 6–2, 6–4. Muster had a 65-2 win-loss record on clay during 1995; however, his record on other surfaces was less impressive.Muster continued to rack-up clay court victories in 1996. He won seven tournaments, six of them titles he successfully defended after winning them in 1995. His win-loss clay court record in 1996 was 43-3. This made his 1995-96 record on the surface 111-5 – the best two-year clay court record since the open era began in 1968. In February, Muster attained the World No. 1 ranking. He held the ranking initially for just one week and then regained it for five weeks in March and April. Muster remains one of the most controversial World No. 1s because almost all his tournament victories were on clay courts and he was beatable on all other surfaces.Muster achieved his best results on hard courts in 1997. He won two hard court titles, was the runner-up at the ATP Masters Series event in Cincinnati, and reached the semifinals of the Australian Open. At both Cincinnati and the Australian Open, Muster lost to Pete Sampras in straight sets. He compiled a 29-8 win-loss record on hard courts while slumping to 9–9 on clay.Muster reached his last top-level tournament final (on clay) in 1998. He retired from the professional tour in 1999.Muster only lost one Davis Cup singles match on clay during his career, to Goran Ivanišević in 1997. He won 29 Davis Cup singles matches on that surface.When his playing career finished, Muster moved to Australia and lived on a large farm with his wife (Jo Beth Taylor) and child. He has since moved back to Austria, where he has served as coach of the Austrian Davis Cup team and established an apparel brand called "Toms."Grand Slam singles finalWin (1)'''Year'''Championship'''Opponent in Final'''Score in Final1995French OpenUSA Michael Chang7–5, 6–2, 6–4Singles finalsWins (44)LegendGrand Slam (1)Tennis Masters Cup (0)ATP Masters Series (8)ATP Tour (35)| valign=top width=33% align=left |Titles by SurfaceHard (3)Grass (0)Clay (40)Carpet (1)|No.DateTournamentSurfaceOpponent in the finalScore1.4 August, 1986Hilversum]], NetherlandsClaySUI Jakob Hlasek6–1, 6–3, 6–32.11 July, 1988Boston]], U.S.ClayUSA Lawson Duncan6–2, 6–23.1 August, 1988Bordeaux]], FranceClayHAI Ronald Agenor6–3, 6–34.15 August, 1988Prague]], Czech RepublicClayARG Guillermo Pérez-Roldán6–4, 5–7, 6–25.26 September, 1988Bari]], ItalyClayURU Marcelo Filippini2–6, 6–1, 7–56.8 January, 1990Adelaide]], AustraliaHardUSA Jimmy Arias3–6, 6–2, 7–57.12 March, 1990Casablanca]], MoroccoClayARG Guillermo Pérez-Roldán6–1, 6–7, 6–28.21 May, 1990Rome]], ItalyClayURS Andrei Chesnokov6–1, 6–3, 6–19.17 June, 1991Florence]], ItalyClayAUT Horst Skoff6–2, 6–7, 6–410.16 September, 1991Geneva]], SwitzerlandClayAUT Horst Skoff6–2, 6–411.27 April, 1992Monte Carlo]], MonacoClayUSA Aaron Krickstein6–3, 6–1, 6–312.15 June, 1992Florence, ItalyClayITA Renzo Furlan6–3, 1–6, 6–113.31 August, 1992Umag]], CroatiaClayARG Franco Davín6–1, 4–6, 6–414.1 March, 1993Mexico City]], MexicoClayESP Carlos Costa6–2, 6–415.14 June, 1993Florence, ItalyClayESP Jordi Burillo6–1, 7–516.21 June, 1993Genova]], ItalyClaySWE Magnus Gustafsson7–6, 6–417.9 August, 1993Kitzbühel]], AustriaClayESP Javier Sánchez6–3, 7–5, 6–418.16 August, 1993San Marino]]ClayITA Renzo Furlan7–5, 7–519.30 August, 1993Umag, CroatiaClayESP Alberto Berasategui7–5, 3–6, 6–320.4 October, 1993Palermo]], ItalyClayESP Sergi Bruguera7–6, 7–521.28 February, 1994Mexico City, MexicoClayBRA Roberto Jabali6–3, 6–122.2 May, 1994Madrid, SpainClayESP Sergi Bruguera6–2, 3–6, 6–4, 7–523.20 June, 1994Sankt Pölten]], AustriaClayESP Tomás Carbonell4–6, 6–2, 6–424.6 March, 1995Mexico City, MexicoClayBRA Fernando Meligeni7–6, 7–525.10 April, 1995Estoril]], PortugalClayESP Albert Costa6–4, 6–226.17 April, 1995Barcelona]], SpainClaySWE Magnus Larsson6–2, 6–1, 6–427.1 May, 1995Monte Carlo, MonacoClayGER Boris Becker4–6, 5–7, 6–1, 7–6, 6–028.22 May, 1995Rome, ItalyClayESP Sergi Bruguera3–6, 7–6, 6–2, 6–329.12 June, 1995French Open, ParisClayUSA Michael Chang7–5, 6–2, 6–430.26 June, 1995Sankt Pölten, AustriaClayCZE Bohdan Ulihrach6–3, 3–6, 6–131.24 July, 1995Stuttgart Outdoor]], GermanyClaySWE Jan Apell6–2, 6–232.14 August, 1995San MarinoClayITA Andrea Gaudenzi6–2, 6–033.28 August, 1995Umag, CroatiaClayESP Carlos Costa3–6, 7–6, 6–434.18 September, 1995Bucharest]], RomaniaClayAUT Gilbert Schaller6–3, 6–435.30 October, 1995Essen]], GermanyCarpetUSA MaliVai Washington7–6, 2–6, 6–3, 6–436.11 March, 1996Mexico City, MexicoClayCZE Jiří Novák7–6, 6–237.15 April, 1996Estoril, PortugalClayITA Andrea Gaudenzi7–6, 6–438.22 April, 1996Barcelona, SpainClayCHI Marcelo Ríos6–3, 4–6, 6–4, 6–139.29 April, 1996Monte Carlo, MonacoClayESP Albert Costa6–3, 5–7, 4–6, 6–3, 6–240.20 May, 1996Rome, ItalyClayNED Richard Krajicek6–2, 6–4, 3–6, 6–341.22 July, 1996Stuttgart Outdoor, GermanyClayRUS Yevgeny Kafelnikov6–2, 6–2, 6–442.16 September, 1996Bogotá]], ColombiaClayECU Nicolás Lapentti6–7, 6–2, 6–343.17 February, 1997Dubai]], UAEHardCRO Goran Ivanišević7–5, 7–644.31 March, 1997Miami]], U.S.HardESP Sergi Bruguera7–6, 6–3, 6–1Runner-ups (11)No.DateTournamentSurfaceOpponent in the finalScore1.19 September, 1988Barcelona]], SpainClaySWE Kent Carlsson6–3, 6–3, 3–6, 6–12.24 October, 1988Vienna]], AustriaCarpetAUT Horst Skoff4–6, 6–3, 6–4, 6–23.3 April, 1989Miami]], U.S.HardTCH Ivan LendlW/O4.30 April, 1990Monte Carlo]], MonacoClayURS Andrei Chesnokov7–5, 6–3, 6–35.7 May, 1990Munich]], GermanyClayTCH Karel Nováček6–4, 6–26.18 January, 1993Sydney Outdoor]], AustraliaHardUSA Pete Sampras7–6, 6–17.25 October, 1993Vienna, AustriaCarpetCRO Goran Ivanišević4–6, 6–4, 6–4, 7–68.7 August, 1995Kitzbühel]], AustriaClayESP Albert Costa4–6, 6–4, 7–6, 2–6, 6–49.23 October, 1995Vienna, AustriaCarpetBEL Filip Dewulf7–5, 6–2, 1–6, 7–510.11 August, 1997Cincinnati]], U.S.HardUSA Pete Sampras6–3, 6–411.13 April, 1998Estoril]], PortugalClayESP Alberto Berasategui3–6, 6–1, 6–3Singles performance timelineTournament198519861987198819891990199119921993199419951996199719981999Career&nbsp;SRGrand Slam tournamentsAustralian OpenANHA1RSF3RA3R2RQF3R4RSF1R1R0 / 11French Open1R2R3R3RASF1R2R4R3RW4R3RQF1R1 / 14WimbledonAA1RAAAA1R1R1RAAAAA0 / 4U.S. OpenA1R3R1RA4RAAQFQF4RQF1R3RA0 / 10Grand Slam SR0 / 10 / 20 / 30 / 30 / 10 / 30 / 10 / 30 / 40 / 41 / 30 / 30 / 30 / 30 / 21 / 34Year End ChampionshipTennis Masters CupAAAAARRAAAARRRRRRAA0 / 4A = did not participate in the tournament  NH = tournament not heldReferencesExternal links       [[Andre Agassi]]&lt;br&gt; Pete Sampras
