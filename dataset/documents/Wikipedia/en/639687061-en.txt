  The International Basketball Federation (French: Fédération Internationale de Basketball), more commonly known by the French acronym FIBA (pronounced ), is an association of national organizations which governs international competition in basketball. Originally known as the Fédération Internationale de Basketball '''Amateur' (hence FIBA), in 1989 it dropped the ''Amateur from its official name but retained the initialism, because of the first two letters of the word '''ba'sketball''.The FIBA defines the international rules of basketball, specifies the equipment and facilities required, regulates the transfer of athletes across countries, and controls the appointment of international referees. 213 national federations are now members, organized since 1989 into five zones or "commissions": Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.FIBA is a world basketball tournament for men's national teams held quadrennially by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA).A parallel event for women's teams, the FIBA World Championship for Women, is also held quadrennially, in the same year as the men's event but in a different country.The champion team wins the Naismith Trophy, which was first awarded in the 1967 tournament.The tournament structure is similar but not identical to that of the FIFA World Cup; both of these international competitions have been played in the same year since 1970.HistoryThe association was founded in Geneva in 1932, two years after the sport was officially recognized by the IOC. Its original name was Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur. Eight nations were founding members: Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, and Switzerland. During the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, the Federation named James Naismith (1861-1939), the founder of basketball, as its Honorary President.FIBA has organized a World Championship for men since 1950 and a World Championship for Women since 1953. Both events are now held every four years, alternating with the Olympics.In 1989, FIBA opened the door to Olympic participation by professionals such as players from the NBA in the United States. At this point, the Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur became the Fédération Internationale de Basketball, but retained FIBA as an abbreviation.The Federation headquarters moved to Munich in 1956, then returned to Geneva in 2002. Patrick Baumann is the Secretary General of FIBA.In 1991 it founded FIBA Hall of Fame, the first induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2007 during EuroBasket 2007.Presidents Vicepresidents1932-48:  Leon Bouffard / 1932-39:  James A.

The NBA has 29 teams in the USA plus one in Canada, while the WNBA has 14 teams in the USA only.The men's Euroleague is totally controlled by ULEB, a consortium of European domestic and transnational leagues. The ULEB Eurocup, known as the ULEB Cup until the 2008-09 season, is jointly run by ULEB and FIBA Europe, but only the two preliminary rounds of that competition are run by FIBA Europe. Both competitions, however, use FIBA's rule set. (EuroLeague Women, despite the similar name to the men's Euroleague, is run by FIBA Europe.)The NBL and WNBL are separate organizations based in Australia. Both leagues, which use FIBA rules, have teams throughout Australia plus one in New Zealand.Current &amp; Upcoming TournamentsTournamentDateTeamsU18 European Championship Men 2008 Division AJuly 25 - August 316U18 European Championship Men 2008 - Division BJuly 25 - August 320U20 European Championship Men 2008 Division AAugust 1 - 1016U20 European Championship Men 2008 Division BAugust 1 - 1019U16 European Championship Women 2008 Division AAugust 8 - 1716U16 European Championship Women 2008 Division BAugust 8 - 1718U16 European Championship Men 2008 Division AAugust 15 - 2416U16 European Championship Men 2008 Division BAugust 15 - 2423FIBA World Rankings#1 men's team: #1 women's team: #1 combined ranking: ReferencesExternal linksFIBA official siteInterBasket - International Basketball News, Blog and Forum, covering FIBA, Euroleague, NBAHistory of amateur and professional basketball in Canada at Frozen HoopsThePlayersForum.com - Site dedicated to helping sports players achieve their dream of playing internationallyTalkBasket - Basketball news and discussionsMediaZone - Official Broadband Provider siteNew Tournament FIBA U17 World Championship      Category:Basketball Category:Basketball organizations Category:1932 establishments Category:IOC Recognised International Federations Category:International Basketball Federation Category:Supraorganizationsca:Federació Internacional de Bàsquet da:FIBA de:Fédération Internationale de Basketball el:Διεθνής Ομοσπονδία Καλαθοσφαίρισης es:Federación Internacional de Baloncesto fr:Fédération internationale de basket-ball amateur gl:FIBA hr:Međunarodna košarkaška federacija it:Federazione Internazionale Pallacanestro he:פיב&quot;א lv:Starptautiskā basketbola federācija lt:Tarptautinė krepšinio federacija nl:FIBA ja:国際バスケットボール連盟 no:FIBA pl:Fédération Internationale de Basketball pt:Federação Internacional de Basquetebol ru:Международная федерация баскетбольных ассоциаций sr:Међународна кошаркашка федерација fi:FIBA sv:FIBA ta:பன்னாட்டுக் கூடைப்பந்தாட்டக் கூட்டணி tr:Uluslararası Basketbol Federasyonu vls:FIBA zh:国际篮球联合会
