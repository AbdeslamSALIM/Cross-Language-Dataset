           Jan Ingemar Stenmark (born March 18, 1956 in Joesjö, Storumans municipality) is a former Swedish skier, active during the '70s and '80s. He is regarded as one of the most prominent Swedish sportsmen, and as the greatest slalom and giant slalom specialist of all time. He competed for Fjällvinden Tärnaby.Stenmark was born in the province of Lappland. His family moved to Tärnaby when he was four years old, where he became neighbours with Stig Strand, who would later win the World Cup Slalom title. He began skiing at the age of five and won his first national competition at the age of eight.Competitive recordStenmark has won more alpine ski competitions than any other man with a total of 86 races in the Alpine Skiing World Cup, Hermann Maier being the second with 53 victories. He only won in two disciplines: slalom and giant slalom (the other events are downhill, super-G, which did not exist until 1982, and combined). Stenmark rarely competed in the other disciplines, as he was not comfortable with speeds in excess of 120 km/h (75 mph).He won the Overall World Cup title three times in 1976-78. He also achieved four of the top ten most successful seasons ever in giant slalom competition. Stenmark won every giant slalom race during the 1977-78 (7 of 7) and 1978-79 seasons (10 of 10). In the 1979-80 season he won ten out of eleven giant slaloms. He has six of the top ten most successful seasons ever in slalom competition: he won all the slalom races during the 1975-76 season (7 of 7), and almost every slalom race in the 1976-77 (9 of 10), 1981-82 (8 of 9), 1979-80 (7 of 8), 1974-75 (7 of 8), and 1980-81 (8 of 10) seasons.Including Alpine Skiing World Cup, FIS World Championships and Olympic competition, Stenmark finished as follows:1st place: 92 times;2nd place: 45 times;3rd place: 28 times;4th place: 10 times;5th place: 13 times;6th place: 10 times;7th place: 8 times;8th place: 7 times;9th place: 5 times;10th place: 4 times.Stenmark was not allowed to participate in the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo due to his status as a professional and therefore could not defend his gold medals from 1980. In the 1988 Games he was allowed back into the Olympic competition.For his three straight World Alpine Skiing World Cup titles (1976-78), Stenmark earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1979 (Shared with Erik Håker and Raisa Smetanina). Stenmark also earned the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal twice as well (1975 & 1978). His 1978 medal was shared with tennis player Björn Borg, making them the only two men to ever win the honor twice (female alpine skier Anja Pärsson received the medal in 2006 and 2007).OtherDuring the years from 1976-78 Stenmark, along with tennis player Björn Borg, became a national icon in Sweden. This was not changed by the fact that he - for tax reasons - soon moved to Monaco. On December 26, 2004 he survived the Indian Ocean earthquake while on vacation in Thailand. Stenmark also won the 1996 Swedish Superstars championship.World Cup victoriesOverallSeasonDiscipline1975]]Giant Slalom1975]]Slalom1976]]Overall1976]]Giant Slalom1976]]Slalom1977]]Overall1977]]Giant Slalom1977]]Slalom1978]]Overall1978]]Giant Slalom1978]]Slalom1979]]Giant Slalom1979]]Slalom1980]]Giant Slalom1980]]Slalom1981]]Giant Slalom1981]]Slalom1983]]Slalom1984]]Giant SlalomIndividual victoriesDateLocationRace17 december 1974Italy Madonna di CampiglioSlalom12 january 1975Switzerland WengenSlalom23 february 1975Japan NaebaGiant Slalom2 march 1975Canada GaribaldiGiant Slalom13 march 1975USA Sun ValleyGiant Slalom15 december 1975Italy Sterzing / VipitenoSlalom11 january 1976Switzerland WengenSlalom24 january 1976Austria KitzbühelSlalom27 january 1976Germany ZwieselGiant Slalom7 march 1976USA Copper Mountain, U.S.Slalom14 march 1976USA AspenSlalom3 januari 1977Switzerland LaaxSlalom10 january 1977Germany BerchtesgadenSlalom16 january 1977Austria KitzbühelSlalom23 january 1977Switzerland WengenSlalom6 february 1977Austria St. AntonSlalom6 march 1977USA Sun ValleyGiant Slalom18 march 1977Norway VossSlalom20 march 1977Sweden ÅreSlalom21 march 1977Sweden ÅreGiant Slalom25 march 1977Spain Sierra NevadaGiant Slalom10 december 1977France Val d'IsèreGiant Slalom13 december 1977Italy Madonna di CampiglioSlalom14 december 1977Italy Madonna di CampiglioGiant Slalom5 january 1978Germany OberstaufenSlalom8 january 1978Germany ZwieselGiant Slalom9 january 1978Switzerland ZwieselSlalom18 march 1978Switzerland ArosaGiant Slalom9 december 1978Austria SchladmingGiant Slalom21 december 1978Yugoslavia Kranjska GoraSlalom22 december 1978Yugoslavia Kranjska GoraGiant Slalom7 january 1979France CourchevelGiant Slalom16 january 1979Switzerland AdelbodenGiant Slalom23 january 1979Austria SteinachGiant Slalom4 february 1979Czechoslovakia JasnáGiant Slalom10 february 1979Sweden ÅreGiant Slalom11 february 1979Sweden ÅreSlalom4 march 1979USA Lake PlacidGiant Slalom12 march 1979USA Heavenly ValleyGiant Slalom17 march 1979Japan FuranoSlalom19 march 1979Japan FuranoSlalom8 december 1979France Val d'IsèreGiant Slalom11 december 1979Italy Madonna di CampiglioSlalom12 december 1979Italy Madonna di CampiglioGiant Slalom21 january 1980Switzerland AdelbodenGiant Slalom27 january 1980France ChamonixSlalom27 february 1980USA Waterville ValleySlalom1 march 1980Canada Mont-Sainte-AnneGiant Slalom10 march 1980Italy Cortina d'AmpezzoSlalom11 march 1980Italy Cortina d'AmpezzoGiant Slalom13 march 1980Austria SaalbachGiant Slalom15 march 1980Austria SaalbachSlalom9 december 1980Italy Madonna di CampiglioSlalom10 december 1980Italy Madonna di CampiglioGiant Slalom6 january 1981France MorzineGiant Slalom18 january 1981Austria KitzbühelSlalom26 january 1981Switzerland AdelbodenGiant Slalom1 february 1981Austria St AntonSlalom2 february 1981Austria SchladmingGiant Slalom8 february 1981Norway OsloSlalom11 february 1981Norway VossGiant Slalom14 february 1981Sweden ÅreGiant Slalom9 january 1982France MorzineGiant Slalom12 january 1982Germany Bad WiesseeSlalom17 january 1982Austria KitzbühelSlalom19 january 1982Switzerland AdelbodenGiant Slalom9 february 1982Austria KirchbergGiant Slalom14 december 1982Italy CourmayeurSlalom23 january 1983Austria KitzbühelSlalom11 february 1983France MarksteinSlalom13 february 1983Germany TodtnauGiant Slalom26 february 1983Sweden GällivareGiant Slalom13 december 1983Italy CourmayeurSlalom20 december 1983Italy Madonna di CampiglioSlalom10 january 1984Switzerland AdelbodenGiant Slalom17 january 1984Switzerland ParpanSlalom23 january 1984Austria KirchbergGiant Slalom4 february 1984Bulgaria BorovetzGiant Slalom7 march 1984USA VailGiant Slalom15 december 1985Italy Alta BadiaGiant Slalom25 january 1986Austria St AntonSlalom27 february 1986Norway HemsedalGiant Slalom18 march 1986USA Lake PlacidGiant Slalom29 november 1986Italy SestrièresSlalom14 february 1987France MarksteinSlalom19 february 1989USA Aspen, ColoradoGiant SlalomExternal linksHolmenkollen medalists - click Holmenkollmedaljen for downloadable pdf file Ski-db.com - Ingemar Stenmark         Category:1956 births Category:Alpine skiers at the 1976 Winter Olympics Category:Alpine skiers at the 1980 Winter Olympics Category:Alpine skiers at the 1988 Winter Olympics Category:Holmenkollen medalists Category:Living people Category:Olympic alpine skiers of Sweden Category:Superstars competitors Category:Swedish alpine skiers Category:Winter Olympics medalists Category:Olympic gold medalists for Sweden Category:Skiersbs:Ingemar Stenmark da:Ingemar Stenmark de:Ingemar Stenmark et:Ingemar Stenmark es:Ingemar Stenmark fr:Ingemar Stenmark hr:Ingemar Stenmark it:Ingemar Stenmark nl:Ingemar Stenmark ja:インゲマル・ステンマルク no:Ingemar Stenmark pl:Ingemar Stenmark ru:Стенмарк, Ингемар sl:Ingemar Stenmark fi:Ingemar Stenmark sv:Ingemar Stenmark
