  Camouflage are a German synthpop and dance music trio consisting of Marcus Meyn, Heiko Maile and Oliver Kreyssig. Their only American hit was "The Great Commandment" which climbed to #59 in 1987, though it did spend three weeks at #1 on the US dance chart. They also had two additional minor dance hits in 1989.HistoryIn 1983, Heiko Maile, Marcus Meyn, Martin Kahling and Oliver Kreyssig, four friends from Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany, formed the band Licenced Technology. It was short lived, as Martin Kahling left in 1984. Soon after, the remaining three members renamed themselves "Camouflage", inspired by a Yellow Magic Orchestra song of the same name. The three young musicians set up their first studio in the basement of Heiko's parents' house, calling it "Boy's Factory". Their first live gigs at local music clubs soon followed. In 1985, Camouflage recorded two demo tapes at their studio, and the following year, the group won a local radio music contest, after a friend of theirs handed one of the demos in. A small Frankfurt music label, "Westside", showed interest in taking Camouflage on. There, the song "The Great Commandment" was recorded to be presented to bigger music companies. After considering offers from several record companies, Camouflage decided to sign a contract with Metronome.Working with Axel Henninger, Camouflage re-recorded "The Great Commandment" in Axel's studio in 1987. The single was released in September of that year and rose to number 14 in the German charts. Their follow-up single "Stranger Thoughts" was released in February 1988, rising to number 20. In March, "Voices & Images," Camouflage's debut album, was released. The album topped the US Billboard Dance Charts twice having been played often by small independent radio stations. In New York, Heiko, Oli and Marcus signed a contract with the US label Atlantic that same year, releasing "Voices & Images" and the single "That Smiling Face" for the US market in the fall of 1988. In an old factory loft near their hometown, Heiko, Oli and Marcus set up "Boy's Factory 2," their new studio.With producer Dan Lacksman of Telex, the band recorded a new album "Methods of Silence" at Synsound Studio in Brussels that following year. Now left to experiment more freely after the commercial success of their first album, Dan's recording work revealed an interesting mix of digital high-tech and out-dated studio equipment. Single "Love is a Shield" (position 9 in German charts) stayed in the charts for over six months, and the album reached 13. After follow-up single "One Fine Day," the band embarked on their first live concert tour to great financial success.More recently Polydor released "Archive#1 (Rare Tracks)"Rare tracks Camouflage compiled, a new Camouflage compilation. Expected in the shops by November 20th 2007 the release brings together a host of rare tracks and remixes spread over two discs.DiscographyAlbumsVoices &amp; Images (1988)Methods of Silence (1989)Meanwhile (1991)Bodega Bohemia (1993)Spice Crackers (1995)Best of - We Stroke The Flames (1997)Rewind - Best of 85-87 (2001)Sensor (2003)Relocated (2006)Singles"The Great Commandment" (1987)"Strangers' Thoughts" (1988)"Neighbors" (1988)"That Smiling Face" (1989)"Love Is a Shield" (1989)"One Fine Day" (1989)"Heaven (I Want You)" (1991)"This Day" / "Handsome" (double A side) (1992)"Suspicious Love" (1993)"Close" (1993)"Jealousy" (1993)"Bad News" (1995)"X-Ray" (1996)"Love Is A Shield" (12") (1997)"Thief" (1999)"The Great Commandment 2.0" (2001)"Me And You" (2003)"I Can't Feel You" (2003)"Motif Sky" (2006)"Something Wrong" (2006)"The Pleasure Remains" (2007)See alsoList of Number 1 Dance Hits (United States)List of artists who reached number one on the US Dance chartReferencesExternal linksOfficial websiteForum (in Spanish)French page for CamouflageRomanian site Blue MusicSHOUT!
