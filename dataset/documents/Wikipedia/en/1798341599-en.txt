  C. brinkmani  Centrosaurus ( SEN-tro-SAW-rus, meaning "pointed lizard" (from Greek kentron/κεντρον = "point or prickle" + sauros/σαυρος = "lizard")) is an herbivorous ceratopsian dinosaur from the late Cretaceous of North America, approximately 75 million years ago.The name refers to the series of small hornlets placed along the margin of the frill, and not to the horn on its nose (which was unknown when the dinosaur was named). It is not to be confused with the stegosaur Kentrosaurus, whose name is derived from the same Greek word.Descriptions, and bony processes over the front of the frill. Museum of Victoria.]] Centrosaurus massive body was borne by stocky limbs, although at 18-20 ft (6m) it was not a particularly large dinosaur. Like other centrosaurines, Centrosaurus had a single large horn over the nose.. It may curve forwards or backwards in different species.A pair of small horns is also found over the eyes; in Centrosaurus apertus these are directed upwards, whereas they are directed to the sides in C. brinkmani. The frill of Centrosaurus was moderately long, with fairly large fenestrae and small hornlets along the outer edge.C. apertus is distinguished by having two large hornlets which hook forwards over the frill, while in C. brinkmani these hornlets are small and covered with small, finger-like growths.HistoryThe first Centrosaurus remains were discovered by paleontologist Lawrence Lambe in strata along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. Later, vast bonebeds of Centrosaurus were found in Dinosaur Provincial Park, also in Alberta. Some of these beds extend for hundreds of meters and contain thousands of individuals of all ages and all levels of completion. Scientists have speculated that the high density and number of individuals would be explained if they had perished while trying to cross a flooded river.Classification[[Image:Centrosaurus skin.jpg|thumb|Skin impression of Centrosaurus]] Centrosaurus gives its name to the Centrosaurinae subfamily to which it belongs. Its closest relatives appear to be Styracosaurus and Monoclonius. It so closely resembles the latter of these that some paleontologists have considered them to represent the same animal. Later research showed, however, that they were in fact separate genera. The critical differences being found in the configuration of the hornlets at the top of the frill.PalaeobiologyLike other Ceratopsidae, the jaws of Centrosaurus were designed to shear through tough plant material; the frill provided an attachment for large jaw muscles. The discovery of gigantic bone beds of Centrosaurus in Canada suggest that it was a gregarious animal and traveled in large herds.See alsoRelated animalsAvaceratopsBrachyceratopsMonocloniusPachyrhinosaurusStyracosaurus"Centrosaurus."
