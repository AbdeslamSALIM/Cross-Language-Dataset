 Caraway or Persian cumin (Carum carvi) is a biennial plant in the family Apiaceae, native to Europe and western Asia.The plant is similar in appearance to a carrot plant, with finely divided, feathery leaves with thread-like divisions, growing on 20–30 cm stems. The main flower stem is 40–60 cm tall, with small white or pink flowers in umbels. Caraway fruits (erroneously called seeds) are crescent-shaped achenes, around 2 mm long, with five pale ridges.The plant prefers warm, sunny locations and well-drained soil.Cultivation and usesThe fruits, usually used whole, have a pungent, anise-like flavor and aroma that comes from essential oils, mostly carvone and limonene. They are used as a spice in breads especially rye bread, which is denser because of the yeast-killing properties of the essential oil, limonene. Caraway is also used in liquors, casseroles, and other foods, especially in Central European and Scandinavian cuisine, for instance sauerkraut. It is also used to add flavor to cheeses such as havarti. Akvavit and several liqueurs are also made with caraway. A carminative, a tisane made from the seeds is used as a remedy for colic, loss of appetite and digestive disorders and to dispel worms. Caraway seed oil is also used as a fragrance component in soaps, lotions, and perfumes.The roots may be cooked as a root vegetable like parsnips or carrots.In one of the short stories in Dubliners by James Joyce, a character eats caraway fruits to mask the alcohol on his breath.Similar herbsCaraway thyme has a strong caraway scent and is sometimes used as a substitute for real caraway in recipes.External linksCaraway — Gernot Katzer's Spice Pages.How to grow CarawayHistory of CarawayCategory:Carum Category:Medicinal plants Category:Spices Category:Root vegetables Category:Arabic words and phrasesals:Kümmel ar:كروياء az:Zirə (bitki) bg:Ким cs:Kmín (koření) da:Kommen de:Kümmel es:Carum carvi eo:Karvio fa:زیره سیاه fr:Carvi id:Jintan it:Carum carvi he:כרוויה תרבותית ku:ژاژ lv:Pļavas ķimene lt:Kmynas hu:Kömény nl:Karwij ja:キャラウェイ no:Karve nn:Karve pl:Kminek zwyczajny ru:Тмин sq:Qimnoni sl:Kumina fi:Kumina sv:Kummin uk:Кмин звичайний vec:Kumo zh:葛縷子
