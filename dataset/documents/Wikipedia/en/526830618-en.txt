His godfather was well-known politician Adlai Stevenson and his godmother was Eleanor Roosevelt. Dern is the father of actress Laura Dern and was formerly married to actress Diane Ladd.CareerOne of Dern's first film roles was in the Sydney Pollack picture They Shoot Horses, Don't They? in 1969. He played the enemy and killer of John Wayne's character in The Cowboys, and starred along with Jack Nicholson in The King of Marvin Gardens. Dern is generally regarded as a character actor. He has a reputation of playing unstable and villainous characters, although his best-known role may be that of Freeman Lowell, the caretaker of Earth's last forests in Silent Running (1972). Other memorable roles include Tom Buchanan in Robert Redford's The Great Gatsby; a brainwashed blimp pilot who launches a terrorist attack at the Super Bowl in 1977's Black Sunday and Capt. Bob Hyde in 1978's Coming Home, for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.His most recent effort is the independent movie The Astronaut Farmer, a recurring role on HBO's series Big Love and the monster movie SWAMP DEVIL for RHI Films New York and the Sci Fi Channel.Quotes"I'm only too proud to say that I've NEVER had ANY discipline problems with Laura (Dern, his daughter and fellow actress). In fact, I never needed to lay a hand on her, because Diane (Ladd, his wife and actress) was so much better with that stuff than I was.""I'm the only bad guy to ever kill John Wayne."The latter statement, however, is not true. Wayne's character was killed by the bartender in The Shootist and by Japanese snipers in Sands of Iwo Jima and The Fighting Seabees. The bartender, one of the snipers, and Dern are the only ones to be seen killing Wayne on film. Wayne's characters also died twice by drowning in Wake of the Red Witch and Reap the Wild Wind and once by suicide after being stabbed in The Alamo.) In one of his first films, 1967's The War Wagon, Dern was killed by Wayne.Trivia When filming "That Championship Season" in the Scranton, Pa., area, Dern, an avid runner, was often seen running in the countryside outside the city. His image remained visible around Scranton long after the filming was completed, as billboards for the mayoral campaign of his character, George Sitkowski, remained up for months, most notably down the street from the city's former train station, which at that time was dilapidated but is now considered the city's top hotel.Dern placed fourth in the 880-yard run at the 1953 Illinois state track & field championship meet for his high school, New Trier.Filmography American Cowslip (2008) ...
