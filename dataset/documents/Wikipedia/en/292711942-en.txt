  IceWM is a stacking window manager for the X Window System graphical infrastructure, written by Marko Maček. It was coded from scratch in C++ and is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. It is relatively lightweight in terms of memory and CPU usage, and comes with themes that allow it to imitate the UI of Windows 95, OS/2, Motif, and other graphical user interfaces. IceWM is meant to excel in look and feel while being lightweight and customizable.IceWM can be configured from plain text files stored in a user's home directory, making it easy to customize and copy settings. IceWM has an optional, built-in taskbar with menu, tasks display, network and CPU meters, mail check and configurable clock. Official support for GNOME and KDE menus was previously available as a separate package. In recent IceWM versions, support for them is embedded. External graphical programs for editing configuration and menu exist.The Easy mode default desktop of the Asus Eee PC uses IceWM.ReferencesExternal links Official WebsiteIceWM Control CenterIceWM Control PanelIceWM ThemesIceWM Themes on freshmeat   Category:Free X window managers Category:MS Windows-like desktops Category:Free software programmed in C++ca:IceWM cs:IceWM de:IceWM es:IceWM eu:Icewm fa:آیس‌دبلیوام fr:IceWM it:IceWM nl:IceWM ja:IceWM nn:IceWM pl:IceWM pt:IceWM ru:IceWM uk:IceWM zh:IceWM
