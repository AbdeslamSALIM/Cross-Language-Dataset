 My Own Private Idaho is a 1991 independent film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, loosely based on Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part 1.Storyas Mike Waters in My Own Private Idaho]]The story follows two friends, Mike (River Phoenix) and Scott (Keanu Reeves), as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them to Mike's hometown in Idaho and then to Italy in search of Mike's mother. Scott is based on Prince Hal, the son of the king in the Shakespearean history Henry IV. He is the son of the wealthy mayor of Portland, Oregon and claims his street behavior, which includes prostitution to male clients, is largely rebellion. Mike, however, is gay, narcoleptic and has no other means of support. The two develop a strong friendship that is tested by Scott's ambivalence to street life and his forthcoming inheritance, as well as Mike's romantic affection for his companion.HustlingThe hustling aspect of the film presents male intimacy that "flirts with the possibility that its protagonists are gay"(Lang.) Aside from this, hustling sets up an environment centered on the road already. Mike and Scott's situations differ because of Mike's particular restriction of means of support. Scott on the other hand maintains an heir position which he plans on embracing after his twenty-first birthday. Therefore motivation to go on the road is unique to each character. The lack that Mike holds leads him to take on the road to find his mother, while Scott's temporary rebellion against his father influences him. While on the road, each of the characters is faced with life changing situations and people. For Mike, the journey seems to continue endlessly, time repeats itself because he is again abandoned. The first time he was abandoned by his mother, this time his best friend Scott does so. Conversely Scott's plan to change into a good son is enabled by the finding of a wife on the road and return to his family. Both of these journeys trace recurring road movie character motives and endings that transform character identity.CastRiver Phoenix as Mike WatersKeanu Reeves as Scott FavorJames Russo as Richard WatersWilliam Richert as Bob PigeonRodney Harvey as GaryChiara Caselli as CarmelaMichael Parker as DiggerJessie Thomas as DeniseFlea as BuddGrace Zabriskie as AlenaTom Troupe as Jack FavorUdo Kier as HansProductiondirecting River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves on the set of My Own Private Idaho]]Early drafts of the screenplay were set on Hollywood Boulevard and not Portland with working titles like Blue Funk and Minions of the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, Gus Van Sant read [[John Rechy]]'s 1963 novel, ''[[City of Night]]'' and decided to change the setting to Portland.&lt;ref name= &quot;Ehrenstein, David&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The script originally consisted of two separate scenarios: the first was called ''Modern Days'' and it recounted Mike's story; a second one updated the ''Henry IV'' plays with Scott's story.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lyons, Donald&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Van Sant realized that he could blend the two stories together in the manner of the &quot;cut up&quot; technique used by writer [[William S. Burroughs]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Lyons, Donald&quot;/&gt; In essence, this method involves various story fragments and ideas mixed and matched together to form a unique story. The idea to combine the two scenarios formed in Van Sant's head after watching [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Chimes at Midnight]]''.&lt;ref name= &quot;Lyons, Donald&quot;/&gt; The director remembers, &quot;I thought that the ''Henry IV'' plays were really a street story. I also knew this fat guy named Bob, who had always reminded me of Falstaff and who was crazy about hustler boys.&quot; Van Sant got the idea for Mike's narcolepsy from a man who was a guide of sorts when the director was gathering material for the film. According to the director, he always looked like he was about to fall asleep.&lt;ref name= &quot;Bowen, Peter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The film's title is derived from the song &quot;[[Private Idaho (song)|Private Idaho]]&quot; by the [[B-52's]] that Van Sant heard while visiting the state in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name= &quot;Greenberg, Harvey&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Initially, no studio would touch the script because of its potentially controversial and off-beat subject matter. After Drugstore Cowboy received such favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest. However, they all wanted their own versions made and not Van Sant's. This frustration prompted the filmmaker to attempt the feature on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids filling out the roles. Fortunately, New Line Cinema were in the process of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a USD $2.5 million budget.Once the financial backing was secured, Van Sant faced the problem of casting the two central roles. He decided to send the script to the agents of Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, figuring that their agents would reject the script.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Reeves' agent was amenable to the project, but Phoenix's agent wouldn't even show the screenplay to the young actor.&lt;ref name= &quot;Greenberg, Harvey&quot;/&gt; Not to be deterred, Van Sant got the idea for Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida.&lt;ref name= &quot;Robb, Brian&quot;/&gt; Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville.&lt;ref name= &quot;Robb, Brian&quot;/&gt; Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on [[Lawrence Kasdan]]'s ''[[I Love You to Death]]'' and with his brother [[Joaquin Phoenix|Joaquin]] and girlfriend [[Martha Plimpton]] on [[Ron Howard]]'s ''[[Parenthood]]''. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed to play the role of Scott. However, since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.&lt;ref name= &quot;Block, Adam&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Phoenix re-wrote the camp fire scene where Mike professes his love for Scott so that it was more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. I would never do that on film. We did a little of it in Idaho and, believe me, it was hard work. Never again."What appeared at the outset to be a bright career prospect soon turned dark as River Phoenix was overly committed to becoming his character, drug-addicted street hustler Mike Waters. Almost immediately rumors started swirling back to L.A. that Phoenix and his castmates were using heroin and other drugs and partying hard throughout the nights. This approach proved dangerous given the role of Mike Waters. Eric Alan Edwards, one of the film's directors of photography remembers, "He looked like a street kid. In a very raw way he wore that role."SoundtrackNo official soundtrack album was ever released for the film.

It grossed [[USD]] $6.4 million in North America, above its estimated budget of $2.5 million.&lt;ref name= &quot;boxoffice&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Van Sant's film received largely positive reviews. It currently has an 85% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert, in his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote, "The achievement of this film is that it wants to evoke that state of drifting need, and it does. There is no mechanical plot that has to grind to a Hollywood conclusion, and no contrived test for the heroes to pass".&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Peter Travers wrote, &quot;Van Sant's cleareyed, unsentimental approach to a plot that pivots on betrayal and death is reflected in magnetic performances from Reeves and Phoenix&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Travers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Canby, in his ''[[New York Times]]'' review, praised the performances of the two lead actors: &quot;The performances, especially by the two young stars, are as surprising as they are sure. Mr. Phoenix (''[[Dogfight (film)|Dogfight]]'') and Mr. Reeves (of the two ''Bill and Ted'' comedies) are very fine in what may be the two best roles they'll find in years. Roles of this density, for young actors, do not come by that often&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Canby&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', David Ansen praised Phoenix' performance: &quot;The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you've seen him before: it's a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Ansen&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[USA Today]]'' gave ''My Own Private Idaho'' two and half stars out of four, criticizing Van Sant's film for being &quot;nothing but set pieces; tossed into a mix whose meaning is almost certainly private&quot;.&lt;ref name= &quot;Clark&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;AwardsMy Own Private Idaho received the Showtime International Critics Award at the 1991 Toronto Film Festival.&lt;/ref&gt; River Phoenix received the [[Venice_Film_Festival#Volpi_Cup_best_actor|Volpi Cup for Best Actor]] at the 1991 [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Gazette&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The actor said, in regards to winning, &quot;I don't want more awards.
