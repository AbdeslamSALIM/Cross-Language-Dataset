The GTV is a 2+2 coupé, and the Spider is a two-seater cabriolet version of the GTV. The rear seats on the GTV can be optionally deleted to increase the small boot space. The Spider has no rear seats, only a storage trunk.Known by the internal Alfa Romeo designation 916, the GTV and Spider were lauded in the automotive industry for their unique and timeless design. The pair were launched at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1995. The GTV's name placed it as the successor to the long-discontinued Alfetta GTV coupe, whereas the Spider was effectively the replacement for the then 30-year-old Giulia Spider.DesignBoth cars were designed by Pininfarina. It is a typical Italian design, with the Alfa Romeo grill with the pair of lights on each side recalling the 1750 GTV of the late 1960s and 1970s. It has a wedge shape which is in keeping with traditional Alfa Sports design. The back is "cut-off", creating a sharp, aggressive look. The car is very low slung and entering and exiting the car is very similar to that of a Ferrari: difficult. The design has been rebuked by tall drivers that the windscreen is too low. The Spider shares all of these traits with the GTV except for the cut-off back, here the rear is rounded, reminiscent of Lamborghini rear design.The Spider featured a folding soft-top with five hoop frame, which completely disappears from sight under a flush fitting cover. An electric folding mechanism is fitted on some versions. As would be expected the GTV has a much more rigid chassis, although considerable work was done to ensure that the Spider does not suffer from the traditional convertible chassis problems.In addition the stock choice of wheels and tires are considered by some to be too small for the chassis design. A stock configuration of 16 inch wheels and 205 sized tires lie too deep in the mudsills, appearing mismatched to the width of the car. A factory option of 17 inch wheels with 225 tires is an improvement, as are aftermarket 18 inch wheels with wider tires and spacers still.CharacteristicsThe Spider and GTV were based on a Fiat platform called Tipo (Italian for 'type') 2,in this case a heavily modified version with an all new multilink rear suspension which allowed passive rear steering to help reduce understeer. 1.8 16V () and 2.0 16v Twin Spark () were available along with a turbocharged 2.0 V6 that produced  or a 3.0 V6 in either 12 () or 24 valves ().The 2.0 V6, called V6 TB, was developed because of an Italian law that put an extra tax on cars with engines larger than two litres. It is basically a smaller version of the three litre V6. The turbo was added for extra power while avoiding the tax. When new the 3.0 V6 24V was the fastest production Alfa Romeo. The 3.2 V6 24V GTV  is currently fastest Stradale Alfa Romeo (introduced on the 2003 GTVs), capable of 0-60 mph in just over six seconds. Autodelta (UK) has bored out the 3.2 engine to 3.7, with supercar performance on demand (0-60 mph in less than 4.0 seconds).The 2.0 16v Twin Spark engine has the best ratio of fuel economy to performance. The last restyle of the GTV in 2003 also introduced the 2.0 JTS () engine. To save weight the bonnet was made from a composite material called KMC. At the time, it was the largest single composite mould on a production car.The 916 is uncharacteristically quiet for a sportscar. The top of the range (3.0 and 3.2 litre) versions have low engine noise which is mainly due to the three mufflers and four catalytic converters installed at the factory on the CF3 engine and upwards (2001-). Common aftermarket alterations to the exhaust system are straight pipe replacements for the mufflers and replacing the standard cats with racecats. Modifications such as these completely change the sound produced by the Arese V6 and are said by some to rival or surpass the engine note of Italian V8 engines.1998/2003 faceliftsThe Spider and GTV were revamped in 1998; the post-revamp models (Phase II) are recognisable by the addition of a chrome rim around the Alfa shield in the bonnet, color coded side skirts, and bumpers. Also, the interior was redesigned with the most noticeable difference being that the center console was now silver. A six-speed gearbox was made available as an option for the 3.0 24V. A second, more comprehensive facelift occurred in 2003, with the revamped cars (Phase III) being unveiled at that year's Geneva Motor Show. The most notable difference was the restyling of the front end to include a much deeper 147-style front grille, a frontplate-holder moving from the centre to the right and a change of interior instrumentation lighting colour from green to red.The GTV finished production in 2005 on the launch of the Brera, while the Spider lasted another year until the launch of its Brera-based successor.The 916 GTV and Spider are considered by some to be the last model line true to the Alfa Romeo heritage in terms of design and sound. The reasons given are that the successor lineup (159, Brera, Spider) have higher ride height, larger frames, and the V6 models use engines made by GM which use Alfa Romeo designed heads (and are tuned as opposed to being designed, by Alfa Romeo).
