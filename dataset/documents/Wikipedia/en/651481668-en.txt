The team has participated in rugby activities since the late 19th century with international matches being played as early as 1910.The national team has a long association with touring British Isles teams, who would regularly play matches against them in their tours of South Africa. The earliest tour being in 1910 when Zimbabwe was known as Southern Rhodesia. The side has also played New Zealand on several occasions, the first being in the late 1920s.The Zimbabwe national rugby team have competed at two World Cups. The first in 1987 and the second in 1991. Zimbabwe did not win any of their fixtures. The team are also known as the Sables.HistoryEarlyWhen the Pioneer Column arrived in Rhodesia from the Cape Province in 1890 it brought with it the country's first rugby players. The oldest clubs in the country, Queens and the Bulawayo Athletic Club, were formed in 1894 in Bulawayo and the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union was founded one year later in 1895.http://www.zimrugby.co.zw/abzru.phpThe first tour by a Rhodesian team to South Africa took place in 1898, and was composed of players from the five biggest clubs in the two major settlements of Bulawayo and Salisbury (today called Harare).RhodesiaA British Lions team played a side called Southern Rhodesia on July 30 in 1910 in Bulawayo, the British saw victory, beating the team 24 points to 11. In 1924 a British side would play another match against Rhodesia, on July 24 in Salisbury, the British won 16 to 3. On July 14 1928, Rhodesia played New Zealand, losing 8 to 44.During their 1938 tour to South Africa, the British Lions played two matches against Rhodesia. The first, taking place on July 20 saw the British win 25 to 11, three days later the British won again, 45 to 11. Both matches were played in Salisbury and Bulawayo. In late July 1949, two matches were played against New Zealand. Rhodesia won the first 10 to 8, whilst the second game was a draw 3 all.The 1955 tour of South Africa by the British Lions, had two fixtures against Rhodesia. The first on July 27 in Kitwe was won by the Lions, 27 to 14. The Lions won 16 to 12 in Salisbury in the following game.In 1960, New Zealand again returned to play a match on July 2, Rhodesia losing 14 to 29. The 1962 tour of South Africa by the British Lions had Rhodesia as the opening fixture on the tour. The opening game of the Lions tour saw the visitors win in Bulawayo, beating Rhodesia 38 to 9 on May 26. The next tour, in 1964, the Lions won in Salisbury, beating the side 32 to 6. In 1973 Rhodesia played a one-off match against Italy, winning 42 to 4. In 1970 Rhodesia played New Zealand on July 27, losing 14 to 27. In 1974, the Lions were back at Salisbury where they defeated Rhodesia 42 to 6. The coming decades of the 1960s and 1970s saw a number of home-grown players considered good enough to be selected for South Africa.http://www.zimrugby.co.zw/abzru.php Rhodesia’s rugby playing strength reached its peak in the early to mid 1970s seasons when the country possessed 49 clubs, putting together 102 teams.http://www.zimrugby.co.zw/abzru.phpZimbabweIn 1980 the Rhodesia Rugby Football Union was renamed the Zimbabwe Rugby Union. They played their first game as Zimbabwe on July 7, 1981 against Kenya, winning 34 to 24. In 1987 they were invited to participate in the World Cup that year. Zimbabwe lost all three of its pool matches.During the 1990s the Zimbabwe national team played regularly against Namibia as well as playing against the Ivory Coast and Morocco on a few occasions. In 1991 the team was again competing at the World Cup. Placed in pool B amongst sides Ireland, Scotland and Japan, but failed to win any games.In June 2005, Zimbabwe started on the road to the 2007 World Cup, defeating Senegal 21 to 15 in the Africa round 1B: Pool A. But lost their second match against Cote D'Ivoire. Zimbabwe had a disappointing 2006 Africa Cup campaign, finished third in their group with Madagascar and Zambia.ExodusZimbabwe has produced many world-class rugby players over the years. Despite limited facilities and coaching, the country has been competitive up to high school grade. However, there is little incentive for most players to play beyond high school level, and consequently the club rugby pool is very diluted. There is little to chose from at national level and this has been the reason for Zimbabwe's rugby downfall.As with many other sports, over the years numerous young Zimbabwean rugby talents have defected to play for other nations, mainly South Africa but also Australia, Scotland and other European countries. This trend has continued with players being attracted abroad by better playing and coaching facilities, as well as being pushed by the ever-declining economic climate in their country of origin.The exodus includes some big names, the likes of Ray Mordt, Gary Teichmann, Adrian Garvey, Bobby Skinstad, Tonderai Chavanga and Kennedy Tsimba (all to South Africa), David Pocock (to Australia), Scott Gray and Paul Johnstone (to Scotland) and Andy Marinos (to Wales), to name but a few. The latest block of exiles sees Tendai Mtawarira and Brian Mujati being lured to play for the Springboks. Many others are playing at top levels in New Zealand, South Africa, Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and across Europe. Had all these talents been nurtured back home Zimbabwe could well be playing at World Cups and competing in the top rugby tier.All hope has not been lost however with a number of rising stars being educated outside the country in the last few years. They have all represented their school, Michaelhouse, at the highest age group level and are likely to go on and receive provincial accolades in the coming months. Their talent has not gone unnoticed and they are still eligible for National call up after the age of 18. Zimbabwe has already let speedsters such as Takudzwa Ngwnya and Tonderai Chavanga go and are not likely to make the same mistake with Dumisani Mabhena. Keep an eye out for these stars as they may be the individuals responsible for the revival and restoration of Zimbabwean rugby to its former glory and competitiveness on a world stage.RecordTheir Test match record against all nations, updated to 26 September 2007, is as follows:Rugbydata.com - International Rugby Union Statistics - Statistics for Zimbabwe - Teams PlayedNationGamesWonLostDrawnPercentage of wins1100100%Barbarians1100100%422050%10100%312033.3%10100%30300%10100%972077.8%522140%321066.7%22319013.6%1100100%321033.3%40400%20200%1100100%624033.3%10100%2200100%642066.7%422050%30300%312033.3%Total913555138.5%ReferencesAbout ZRU Zimbabwe Rugby Union URL accessed February 17, 2006.Rhodesia profile RugbyData URL accessed February 17, 2006.Zimbabwe profile RugbyData URL accessed February 17, 2006.Lions timeline LionsRugby URL accessed February 18, 2006.See alsoZimbabwe Rugby UnionZimbabwe at the Rugby World CupZimbabwe national rugby union team (sevens)Africa CupExternal linksZimbabwe RugbyZimbabwe at IRBRWC 2007 Fixtures / ResultsZimbabwe and Rhodesian Rugby jerseys Category:Rugby union in Zimbabwe Category:African national rugby union teamsde:Simbabwische Rugby-Union-Nationalmannschaft es:Selección de rugby de Zimbabue fr:Équipe du Zimbabwe de rugby à XV nl:Zimbabwaans rugbyteam ja:ラグビージンバブエ代表 pl:Reprezentacja Zimbabwe w rugby mężczyzn sv:Zimbabwes herrlandslag i rugby union
