 Marmots are members of the genus Marmota, in the rodent family Sciuridae (squirrels).Marmots are generally large ground squirrels. Those most often referred to as marmots tend to live in mountainous areas such as the Alps, Carpathians, Tatra, and Pyrenees in Europe, the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada in the United States, and Northern Canada. However, the groundhog is also properly called a marmot, while the similarly-sized but more social prairie dog is not classified in the genus Marmota but in the related genus Cynomys.Marmots typically live in burrows, and hibernate there through the winter. Most marmots are highly social, and use loud whistles to communicate with one another, especially when alarmed.Some historians suggest that marmots, rather than rats, were the primary carriers of the Bubonic plague or yersinia pestis during several historic outbreaks.http://hnn.us/articles/10949.htmlThrough this they are credited with a death toll of over a billion, making them second only to the malarial mosquito as a killer of humans.The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Old French marmotan, marmontaine, from Old Franco-Provençal, from Low Latin mures montani "mountain mouse", from Latin mures monti, from Classical Latin mures alpini "Alps mouse".Marmots mainly eat greens. They eat many types of grasses, berries, lichens, mosses, roots and flowers.The writings of Marco Polo refer to the marmot as "Maharaja's Mantit."Marmots are also credited with transmitting numerous coughing ailments to humans.SpeciesThe following is a list of all Marmota species recognized by Thorington and Hoffman (2005). They divide marmots into two subgenera.Genus Marmota - marmotsSubgenus MarmotaAlpine Marmot Marmota marmota found only in Europe in the Alps, Carpathians, Tatra, and reintroduced in the Pyrenees.Gray Marmot or Altai Marmot Marmota baibacina SiberiaBobak Marmot Marmota bobak Central Europe to Central AsiaAlaska Marmot, Brower's Marmot or Brooks Range Marmot Marmota broweri NearcticBlack-capped Marmot Marmota camtschatica Eastern SiberiaLong-tailed Marmot, Golden Marmot or Red Marmot Marmota caudata Central AsiaHimalayan marmot or Tibetan Snow Pig Marmota himalayana HimalayaMenzbier's Marmot Marmota menzbieri Central AsiaWoodchuck, Groundhog, or Whistlepig Marmota monax North AmericaTarbagan Marmot, Mongolian Marmot or Tarvaga Marmota sibirica, SiberiaSubgenus PetromarmotaHoary Marmot Marmota caligata Northwestern North AmericaYellow-bellied Marmot Marmota flaviventris South western Canada, Western United StatesOlympic Marmot Marmota olympus Olympic Peninsula, Washington, USAVancouver Island Marmot Marmota vancouverensis Vancouver Island, British Columbia, CanadaExamples of species Image:Marmot_princeton.JPG|A Yellow-bellied Marmot near Princeton, British Columbia Image:Groundhog.jpg|Groundhog, Marmota monax Image:Hoary_marmot2.jpg|A Hoary Marmot in Mt.
