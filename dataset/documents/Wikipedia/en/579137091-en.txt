Flag ratio: 2:3]] The flag of Mali is a tricolor with three equal vertical stripes. From the hoist,(or the place where the flagpole meets the flag) the colours are green, gold, and red, the pan-African colors.The current flag was adopted on March 1, 1961. The original flag was adopted on April 4, 1959, when Mali joined the Mali Federation. This flag was the same, except the golden stripe had a human stick figure, a kanaga, in black, with arms raised to the sky. The figure was removed because of Islamic aniconism, the belief against making pictures of the human figure. (Mali is about 90% Muslim.) The flag adopted in 1959 for the Confederation was an imitation of the flag of Ghana, but following the style of the French Tricolore. It was changed with a black emblem known as a kanaga, a stylized human figure. The colors were intended to reflect a unity with other African nations. After the two countries split up in 1960, the flag was kept for use in Mali until March 1, 1961, when the black/white berber figure was dropped.References  Category:National symbols of Mali Mali af:Vlag van Mali ast:Bandera de Malí bs:Zastava Malija ca:Bandera de Mali cs:Vlajka Mali da:Malis flag de:Flagge Malis et:Mali lipp el:Σημαία του Μάλι es:Bandera de Malí fr:Drapeau du Mali hr:Zastava Malija bpy:মালির ফিরালহান id:Bendera Mali it:Bandiera del Mali he:דגל מאלי sw:Bendera ya Mali lt:Malio vėliava hu:Mali zászlaja nl:Vlag van Mali ja:マリの国旗 no:Malis flagg pl:Flaga Mali pt:Bandeira do Mali ru:Флаг Мали simple:Flag of Mali sk:Vlajka Mali sr:Застава Малија sh:Zastava Malija fi:Malin lippu sv:Malis flagga th:ธงชาติมาลี zh:马里国旗
