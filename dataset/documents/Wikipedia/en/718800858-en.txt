  Wilhelm Heinrich Walter Baade (March 24 1893–June 25 1960) was a German astronomer who emigrated to the USA in 1931.BiographyAlong with Fritz Zwicky, he proposed that supernovae could create neutron stars.He took advantage of wartime blackout conditions during World War II, which reduced light pollution at Mount Wilson Observatory, to resolve stars in the center of the Andromeda galaxy for the first time, which led him to define distinct "populations" for stars (Population I and Population II).He discovered that there are two types of Cepheid variable stars, together with Fritz Zwicky identified supernovae as a new category of astronomical objects (W. Baade, F. Zwicky, 1934, "On Super-Novae". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 254-259.) and proposed the existence of neutron stars. He also identified the optical counterparts of various radio sources.He discovered 10 asteroids, including notably 944 Hidalgo (long orbital period) and the Apollo-class asteroid 1566 Icarus (whose perihelion is closer than that of Mercury) and the Amor asteroid 1036 Ganymed.HonorsAwardsGold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society (1954)Bruce Medal (1955)Henry Norris Russell Lectureship of the American Astronomical Society (1958)Named after himAsteroid 1501 BaadeBaade crater on the MoonVallis Baade, a vallis (valley) on the MoonOne of the two Magellan telescopesBaade's Window, an area relatively free of dust near the Galactic Center in SagittariusThe asteroid 966 MuschiFurther readingExternal linksBruce Medal pageAwarding of Bruce MedalAwarding of RAS gold medalObituaries[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/AN.../0285//0000286.000.html AN 285 (1960) 286] (one sentence, in German)[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/JRASC/0055//0000113.000.html JRASC 55 (1961) 113][http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/MitAG/0014//0000005.000.html MitAG 14 (1961) 5][http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/Obs../0080//0000166.000.html Obs 80 (1960) 166] (one sentence)[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/PASP./0072//0000434.000.html PASP 72 (1960) 434] (one paragraph)[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/QJRAS/0002//0000118.000.html QJRAS 2 (1961) 118]Category:1893 births Category:1960 deaths Category:German astronomers Category:German immigrants to the United States Category:German-American scientists Category:Asteroid discoverersca:Walter Baade cs:Walter Baade de:Walter Baade et:Walter Baade es:Walter Baade fr:Walter Baade gl:Walter Baade it:Walter Baade ka:ვოლტერ ბაადე lb:Walter Baade nl:Walter Baade ja:ウォルター・バーデ pl:Walter Baade ru:Бааде, Вальтер sk:Wilhelm Heinrich Walter Baade sl:Walter Baade fi:Walter Baade sv:Walter Baade uk:Бааде Вальтер zh:沃尔特·巴德
