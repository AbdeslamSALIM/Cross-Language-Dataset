 The Tasman Sea is the large body of water between Australia and New Zealand, some 2000 kilometres (1250 miles) across. It is a south-western segment of the South Pacific Ocean. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.The Tasman Sea is deemed by the International Hydrographic Organisation to include the waters to the east of the Australian states New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. The northern state of Queensland neighbours the Coral Sea, and the boundary between New South Wales and Queensland is also used as the boundary between the two seas.The Tasman Sea had a mid-ocean ridge about 85-55 million years ago as Australia and Zealandia broke apart during the breakup of supercontinent Gondwana.The Tasman Sea features a number of mid-sea island groups, quite apart from coastal islands located near the Australian and New Zealand mainlands:Lord Howe Island and its subsidiary islandsBall's PyramidNorfolk Island, in the extreme north of the Tasman Sea, on the border with the Coral SeaThese island groups are each Australian possessions.The Tasman Sea is nicknamed The Ditch, eg crossing the ditch means going to Australia from New Zealand or vice versa.See alsoCrossing the DitchAxis naval activity in New Zealand watersShipwrecks in the Tasman SeaCategory:Landforms of Australia Category:Coastline of New Zealand Category:Marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean Category:Seasbg:Тасманово море ca:Mar de Tasmània cy:Môr Tasman de:Tasmanische See et:Tasmani meri el:Θάλασσα της Τασμανίας es:Mar de Tasmania fr:Mer de Tasman gl:Mar de Tasmania ko:태즈먼 해 hr:Tasmanovo more id:Laut Tasman it:Mar di Tasman he:ים טסמן lv:Tasmāna jūra lt:Tasmano jūra mk:Тасманово Море nl:Tasmanzee ja:タスマン海 no:Tasmanhavet nn:Tasmanhavet nds:Tasmansee pl:Morze Tasmana pt:Mar da Tasmânia ru:Тасманово море sk:Tasmanovo more sr:Тасманово море fi:Tasmaninmeri sv:Tasmanhavet tr:Tazman Denizi uk:Тасманове море zh:塔斯曼海
