The manga ended prematurely in Japan with 32 volumes in total. The anime concluded its run with a total of 64 episodes.The Shaman King series started in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump in Japan, eventually leading to the creation of an anime series, which was directed by Seiji Mizushima, co-produced by TV Tokyo, Nihon Ad Systems and Xebec and aired on TV Tokyo. This is a Shōnen anime. In North America, the manga was initially printed in Viz Media's Shonen Jump, but stopped as of the September 2007 issue, choosing instead to release one volume every two months.A shaman is someone who connects this world and the spirit world. In Shaman King, shamans team up with ghosts and spirits to achieve their goals. The greatest dreams of a shaman is to become the Shaman King, who is able to contact the Great Spirit (the spirit that every soul will eventually go back to) in order to be the savior of the world. Various magical and religious terms are spread through out the story but they merge into something explainable by the time the main plot arrives.The series spans 285 manga chapters and 32 volumes, and ended with a short "extra story", known as the Funbari no Uta. Many fans of the series abbreviate its name to "Mankin". The Shaman King trading card game is available in Japan and North America.MangaPlotManta Oyamada, a studious yet shrimpy middle-school student from Tokyo, attempted a shortcut one night through the graveyard to get home after a late night of cram school. While traveling through it, he encounters Yoh Asakura and his "companions": a graveyard filled with ghosts. Yoh reveals himself to be a shaman, a medium between the worlds of the living and the dead. As a shaman, Yoh also demonstrates his ability to possess himself with ghosts to assist him where needed, particularly becoming fond of a former samurai known as Amidamaru. Over the first few chapters, Yoh and Manta become best friends while Yoh uses his shamanic abilities to help them out through various normal tasks.Yoh soon encounters Tao Ren, a Chinese shaman who uses his own ghost on a quest to destroy humanity as well as prepare for an upcoming Shaman Tournament to be held in Tokyo. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the picture and prescribes a brutal training regimen, in order to prepare Yoh for the tournament. The tournament is held once every 500 years and is a battle between competing shaman to choose a winner, who will be known as the Shaman King. This winner will gain the ability to reshape the world as he or she chooses, to make his or her dream come true. Thus begins the plot that will lead Yoh on a journey that will lead him to many friends and adventures.Through a series of events and also through participation in the Shaman Tournament, Yoh meets and befriends numerous characters and changes their lives through friendship and authentic concern, which seems to be a pervasive theme throughout the series. He also must face his ultimate destiny, connected to one of the most powerful participants in the Shaman Fight who desires to win the tournament and use his prize to annihilate all of humanity for destroying the world, leaving only a world of shamans such as himself.EndingThe story of Shaman King originally ends in a controversial, incomplete manner: in the midst of a gauntlet fighting against the guardians of Shaman Fight winner Hao Asakura, Yoh and his squad are forced to stop what they were doing and instead "take a break", allowing them to sleep to prepare for the final battle with Hao. The original final page is viewed as Manta's dream, which features Hao as a princess with Yoh and his friends on their way to rescue "her". The reason for that is because Anna was speaking to Manta as if Hao was the person in need of rescue. The page contains the words "Owari" ("The End") and next to that, in front of Horohoro's sword, is a mandarin orange, also called "mikan" which is can also mean "incomplete" in Japanese. This is followed up by another chapter which advances the plot slightly, but still does not complete the story.Follow upThe side story Funbari no Uta, which lasts for five chapters, is set six years after the end of the manga series features Hana Asakura and his journey with his uncle Ryu to gather up the 5 elemental warriors: Horo Horo, Tao Ren, Lyserg Diethel, Chocolove McDaniel, and Yoh Asakura. While nearly all main characters are present, Manta Oyamada does not appear. At the very end, two figures can be seen: a woman in a cloak (who is Anna) and a man with long hair who can be either Yoh or Hao. Takei later revealed that the man walking with Anna was neither Yoh nor Hao, but a fusion of the two.A side story known as Mappa-Douji was also released, which shows Hao's childhood in his original life. It shows his situation after his mother was burned to death by humans and his first spirit friend from his childhood and how he gets his mind reading ability and advanced shamanic abilities like Oversoul.Another side titled Relax was released, which showed Hao gathering followers for the tournament years before it started.Re-release and conclusionAt Jump Festa 2008, a flier handed out at the event announced that in a Kanzenban reprint of the entire series. The Japanese publisher Shueisha has officially announced that Shaman King would return in March 2008 as Shaman King Kanzen-Ban, or Perfect Edition. This release will reprint the entire series in 27 volumes complete with new clear image overlays on the covers while concluding with the never-before-published "true ending." The first six volumes of the manga have been released in Japan and is now being released every two months with the final volume expected to be released in Spring of 2009. Mankin Trad - Shaman King Kang Zeng BangU.S. manga editsVIZ Media began editing the lips of Chocolove, an African-American character. The lips are reduced in size to avoid a Blackface stereotype.The language in reprints of early volumes was revised to remove profanity.AnimeThe Shaman King anime was licensed in 2001 by 4Kids Entertainment for American television broadcasting and aired in its entirety, beginning in September 2003 on the Fox Box (which would later become 4Kids TV), and concluding in September 2005. The English dub also airs on YTV in Canada. Shaman King currently airs in the United Kingdom on Jetix UK at 11:30am-12:30am GMT every day. Oddly, while the English dub of Shaman King is being aired in many countries across the globe, it has not been aired in The United States since the final episode aired on September 3rd, 2005. It is currently unknown if or when 4Kids will air or distribute Shaman King in the U.S. again.The anime of Shaman King starts off with the same sequence of events as the manga for roughly half of the series and then gradually deviates into its own plot. Horohoro is introduced prematurely (Yoh meets him before they fight in the preliminary rounds) and Hao's first appearance is much later (In the manga, he can be seen hidden among other contestants). As is the usual case for anime based on manga, the anime series is much more toned down. Many of the characters that die in the manga are kept alive in the anime. The anime shows these characters recovering from their injuries (or not sustaining any at all) and eventually agreeing with Yoh and his friends ideologically. The anime does show Yoh and Hao's final battle and implies that all of the friends that Yoh has made on his journey (most of these are the characters that have died in the manga) donated their spiritual energy to help him win. However, it is still unclear whether Hao was defeated once and for all or where his soul has gone.4Kids did the English adaptation to the Shaman King anime. Unlike most of the 4Kids dub adaptations such as those of Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magical Doremi, and Mew Mew Power, which have their country settings changed from Japan to America, the setting of the country in the 4Kids dub is still in Japan. However, Shaman King was still partially Americanized, and a lot of Japanese characters are digitally changed to English or airbrushed out and replaced with meaningless symbols. Even Chinese characters are digitally erased out. But unlike other 4Kids' adaptations, aspects of Japanese and Chinese culture are kept, such as foods and symbols.Episode ListEp#Official English Title/Original Title Translated to EnglishOriginal
