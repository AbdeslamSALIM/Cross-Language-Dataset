Magnus Nilsson, Mogens Nielsen, or Magnus the Strong (born c. 1106 – died June 4 1134 in the battle of Fotevik), was a Scandinavian ruler and Danish duke who reigned c. 1125-c.1130 in southern parts of Sweden ("Gothenland").His father was king Niels I of Denmark and mother Margaret Fredkulla, the second or eldest daughter of Inge I of Sweden.Magnus was married with Rikissa, daughter of Boleslaw III of Poland.He claimed the throne of Sweden, when his mother's first cousin Inge II died in 1125, as he was the eldest grandson of Inge I. The Geats (Götes) accepted him king, but the Swedes vetoed him (even according to the Westrogothic law, it was the Swedes who had the right to elect and depose a king). According to Saxo Grammaticus was the legally elected king Ragnvald Knaphövde murdered by Magnus' supporters who then won the realm ("imperium"). Magnus is however not mentioned as king in the law of Västergötland or any other list of regents and he was probably ousted from Sweden, by Sverker I of Sweden.In 1130 Magnus I of Gothenland backed Boleslaw III of Poland in conquering Rügen. Polish forces delivered by Danish fleet compelled Ranis to recognize Polish rule over the island.Edmund Kosiarz, Wojny na Bałtyku X-XIX w., Gdańsk 1978, p. 38.Later he took part in the Danish civil wars, trying to help his father king Niels and to establish himself as heir and future king there, and he died in 1134 during the battle of Fotevik in Scania where his father was decisively defeated. His father died later the same year.Magnus' widow Rikissa returned to east where she was married to Valadar of Miensk, a Rurikid ruler of Viking origins. Rikissa later returned to Sweden and married thirdly king Sverker I, Magnus' rival and defeater.Magnus' son, Canute V contested the Danish throne with his cousin, Svend III.His legitimate descent went extinct with the murder of Knud V in 1157. Knud's illegitimate son Valdemar, archbishop of Bremen, bishop of Schleswig, died in 1236, after which there are no records of any surviving descent from king Magnus.References          Category:1100s births Category:1134 deaths Category:Kings of the Geats Category:Swedish monarchsda:Magnus den Stærke de:Magnus (Schweden) es:Magnus Nilsson de Dinamarca fr:Magnus Ier de Suède it:Magnus I di Gothenland lv:Magnuss Stiprais hu:I.
