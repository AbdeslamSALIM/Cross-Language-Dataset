 The Gospel of Luke (Gk. Κατά Λουκάν Ευαγγέλιον ) is a synoptic Gospel, and is the third and longest of the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament. The text narrates the life of Jesus of Nazareth, with particular interest concerning his birth, ministry, death, and resurrection. It ends with an account of the ascension.The author is characteristically concerned with social ethics, the poor, women, and other oppressed groups.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. Certain popular stories on these themes, such as the prodigal son and the good Samaritan, are found only in this gospel. This gospel also has a special emphasis on prayer, the activity of the Holy Spirit, and joyfulness.Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 105. D. Guthrie stated, “it is full of superb stories and leaves the reader with a deep impression of the personality and teachings of Jesus."Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 102.The introductory dedication to Theophilus,  states that "many have undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word", and that the author, "after investigating everything carefully from the very first"translation from Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 116-117. has decided to compose an orderly account "so that Theophilus may know the certainty of the things has been taught". Thus the author intended to write a historical accountN. B. Stonehouse, The Witness of Luke to Christ (1951), pp. 24-45; H. J. Cadbury, The Beginnings of Christianity II, 1922, pp. 489-510; R. Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (Eerdmans, 2006). bringing out the theological significance of the history.Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 107. The author's purpose was to portray Christianity as divine, respectable, law-abiding, and international.Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985. Scholarship is in wide agreement that the author of Luke also wrote the Acts of the Apostles.Udo Schnelle, The History and Theology of the New Testament Writings, p. 259.Content   Formal introductionDedication to Theophilus (1:1-4)Jesus' birth and boyhoodZacharias the Priest (1:5-25)Annunciation (1:26–45)Magnificat (1:46–56)John the Baptist (1:57–80; 3:1–20; 7:18-35; 9:7–9)Benedictus (1:68-79)Census of Quirinius (2:1-5)Nativity of Jesus (2:6–7)Adoration of the Shepherds (2:8–20)Circumcision in the Temple (2:21–40)Nunc dimittis (2:29-32)Teaching in the Temple at 12 (2:41-52)Jesus' baptism and temptationBaptism of Jesus (3:21–22)Genealogy of Jesus (3:23–38)Temptation of Jesus (4:1–13) Jesus' ministry in GalileeGood News (4:14–15)Rejection in Nazareth (4:16–30)Capernaum (4:31-41)Galilee preaching tour (4:42–44)Calling Simon, James, John (5:1–11)Leper and Paralytic (5:12-26)Recruiting the tax collector (5:27–32)Question about fasting (5:33–39)Sabbath observance (6:1–11)Commission of the Twelve (6:12–16; 9:1–6)Sermon on the Plain (6:17–49)Healing many (7:1-17)A woman anointed Jesus (7:36–50)Women companions of Jesus (8:1–3)Parable of the Sower (8:4-8,11–17)Purpose of parables (8:9-10)Salt and Light (8:16–18; 11:33; 14:34–35)Rebuking wind and waves (8:22–25)Demon named Legion (8:26–39)Synagogue leader's daughter (8:40-56)Feeding of the 5000 (9:10–17)Peter's confession (9:18–20)Son of Man (9:21–25, 44–45, 57-58; 18:31–34)Return of the Son of Man (9:26-27)Transfiguration of Jesus (9:28–36)Disciples' exorcism failure (9:37-43)The First must be Last (9:46-48)Those not against are for (9:49–50) Jesus' teaching on the journey to JerusalemOn the road to Jerusalem (9:51)Samaritan rejection (9:52–56)Let the dead bury the dead (9:59-60)Don't look back (9:61-62)Commission of the Seventy (10:1-24)Cursing Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum (10:13-15)Praising the Father (10:21-24)Great Commandment (10:25-28)Parable of the Good Samaritan (10:29–37)Visiting Martha and Mary (10:38-42)Lord's Prayer (11:1–4)The Friend at Night (11:5–13)Jesus and Beelzebul (11:14–22,8:19–21)Those not with me are against me (11:23)Return of the unclean spirit (11:24–26)Those who hear the word and keep it (11:27-28)Sign of Jonah (11:29–32)Eye and Light (11:34-36)Cursing Pharisees and Lawyers (11:37-54)Veiled and Unveiled (12:1-3)Whom to fear (12:4-7)Unforgivable sin (12:8-12)Disputed inheritance (12:13-15)Parables of the Rich Fool and Birds (12:16-32)Sell your possessions (12:33-34)Parable of the Faithful Servant (12:35–48)Not Peace, but a Sword (12:49–53; 14:25–27)Knowing the times (12:54-56)Settle with your accuser (12:57-59)Repent or perish (13:1-5)Parable of the barren fig tree (13:6-9)Healing a woman on the Sabbath (13:10-17)Parables of Mustard seed and Leaven (13:18–21)The Narrow Gate (13:22–30)Lament over Jerusalem (13:31-35)Healing the man with dropsy (14:1-6)Parables of the Guests, Wedding Feast, Tower and War, Lost sheep, Lost money, Lost son, Unjust steward (14:7–16:9)God and Mammon (16:13)Not one stroke of a letter (16:16-17)Teaching about divorce (16:18)Lazarus and Dives (16:19-31)Curse those who set traps (17:1-6)The Master and Servant (17:7-10)Cleansing ten lepers (17:11-19)The Coming Kingdom of God (17:20-37)Parables of the Unjust judge, Pharisee and Publican (18:1-14)Little children blessed (18:15-17)Rich man's salvation (18:18-30)Blind Bartimaeus (18:35–43)Zacchaeus (19:1-10)Parable of the Talents (19:11–27) Jesus' Jerusalem conflicts, crucifixion, and resurrectionEntering Jerusalem (19:28–44)Temple incident (19:45–20:8)Parable of the vineyard (20:9–19)Render unto Caesar (20:20–26)Resurrection of the dead (20:27–40)Messiah, the son of David?

However, this hypothesis is also consistent with the author's declaration that Luke is written after widely investigating eyewitnesses and other accounts. A single author may have intentionally drawn upon Mark as part of this investigation.IntroductionLuke is the only gospel with a formal introduction, in which the author explains his methodology and purpose. It states that many others have already "undertaken to set down an orderly account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed on to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word."translation from Richard Bauckham, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses (Cambridge: Eerdmans, 2006), pp. 116-117. The author adds that he too wishes to compose an orderly account for Theophilus, so that Theophilus "may know the certainty of the things has been taught".Birth narratives and genealogyLike Matthew, Luke recounts a royal genealogy and a virgin birth for Jesus. Unlike Matthew, who traces Jesus' birth back through the line of David to Abraham in order to appeal to his Jewish audience, in Luke the evangelist traces Jesus' lineage back to Adam, indicating a universal sense of salvation. Unique to Luke is John the Baptist's birth story, the census and travel to Bethlehem, the birth in a manger, and a story from Jesus' boyhood.Miracles and parablesLuke emphasizes Jesus' miracles, recounting 20, four of which are unique. Like Matthew, it includes the Sermon on the Mount and other important sayings. More than a dozen of Jesus' most memorable parables are unique to Luke, including the Good Samaritan the Corrupt Steward and the Parable of the Prodigal Son.Role of womenMore than the other gospels, Luke focuses on women as playing important roles among Jesus' followers, such as Mary Magdalene, Martha, and Mary of Bethany. The Gospel of Luke is the only Gospel which contains the Annunciation of the Birth of Jesus to Mary his mother (1:26-38).Trials and crucifixionLuke emphasizes that Jesus had committed no crime against Rome, as confirmed by Herod, Pilate, and the thief crucified with Jesus. In Luke's Passion narrative Jesus prays that God forgive those who crucify him and his assurance to a crucified thief that they will be together in Paradise. See also Responsibility for the death of Jesus.Resurrection appearancesLuke's accounts differ from those in Mark and Matthew. Luke tells the story of two disciples on the road to Emmaus, and (as in John) Jesus appears to the Eleven and demonstrates that he is flesh and blood, not a spirit. Jesus' commission (the Great Commission) that the Eleven carry his message to all the nations affirms Christianity as a universal religion. The account of Jesus' ascent at the end of Luke is apparently an addition subsequent to the original redaction.CompositionLike the rest of the New Testament, the gospel was written in Greek. Like Mark (but unlike Matthew), the intended audience is Gentile, and it assures readers that Christianity is an international religion, not an exclusively Jewish sect. Several cities have been proposed as its place of origin with no consensus. Harris, Stephen L., Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.SourcesMost scholars hold the two-source hypothesis as most probable, which argues that the author used the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical Q document in addition to unique material, as sources for the gospel. This would be consistent with the author's declaration that he has drawn upon a wide-ranging investigation of all sources and witnesses, and the author's statement that many others had already written gospel accounts before Luke, of which the author was aware. The author of Luke is usually agreed to be more faithful to the wording and order of the Q material than was the author of Matthew.John P. Meier, A Marginal Jew Volume II, Doubleday, 1994. p. 159: "This example would fit in with the general observation that critics make: Luke seems to have preserved the original order and wording of Q more often than Matthew. While such a sweeping 'rule' does not hold true in all cases and much always be tested in the individual instance, it seems to be valid here." As an alternative to the two-source hypothesis, a few scholars hold to the traditional view that Luke is based on Matthew. The two major hypotheses that hold this position are the Griesbach hypothesis and the Augustinian hypothesis. Martin Hengel has made the more controversial argument that Luke also made use of Matthew.Martin Hengel. 2000. The Four Gospels and the One Gospel of Jesus Christ: An Investigation of the Collection and Origin of the Canonical Gospels. Trans. J. Bowden. London and Harrisburg: SCM and Trinity Press International. Pp. 169-207.Authorillustration of Luke the Evangelist.]] Early tradition, witnessed by the Muratorian Canon, Irenaeus (c. 170), Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian, held that the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles were both written by Luke, a companion of Paul.Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), pp. 37-40. The oldest manuscript of the gospel (ca. 200) carries the attribution “the Gospel according to Luke”.Gospel of Luke at EarlyChristianWritings.com However, there is probably a bit of a mistake here. According to my sources, P75 does not include the start of the gospel, rather it includes the end, where an attribution to Luke is found. Early Christian testimony concerning the gospel's authorship is in full agreement, although "some scholars attach little importance to it".Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 114. The Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles were written by the same author Horrell, DG, An Introduction to the study of Paul, T&T Clark, 2006, 2nd Ed.,p.7; cf. W. L. Knox, The Acts of the Apostles (1948), p. 2-15 for detailed arguments that still stand. The most direct evidence comes from the prefaces of each book. Both prefaces are addressed to Theophilus, possibly although not certainly the author's patron, and the preface of Acts explicitly references "my former book" about the life of Jesus. Furthermore, there are linguistic and theological similarities between the two works, suggesting that they have a common author.on linguistics, see A. Kenny, A stylometric Study of the New Testament (1986). Both books also contain common interests.F. F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles (1952), p2. Linguistic and theological agreements and cross-references between the books indicate that they are from the same author.Udo Schnelle. The History and Theology of the New Testament Writings, p. 259. Those biblical scholars who consider the two books a single, two-volume work often refer to both together as Luke-Acts.E.g., C. Kavin Rowe, "History, Hermeneutics and the Unity of Luke-Acts," JSNT 28 (2005): 131-157, raising questions about the literary unity of Luke-Acts. It should be noted that Acts of the Apostles (1:1-2)says, "In my former book, Theophilus, I wrote about all that Jesus began to do and teach until the day He was taken up to heaven, after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles He had chosen."(NIV)The text is internally anonymous. One of the two oldest surviving manuscripts P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt; (circa 200), has the attribution According to Luke Image of Papyrus 75 showing the end of Luke's Gospel and the beginning of John's Gospel, separated by the words Κατά Λουκαν, (Kata Loukan) = "According to Luke".. The other P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; which 'is probably to be dated earlier than P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt; ...'Gregory, A. (2003) The Reception of Luke and Acts in the Period Before Irenaeus, Mohr Siebeck, ISBN 3161480864 p.28 has no such (surviving) attribution. Tradition holds that the text was written by Luke the companion of Paul (named in Colossians ) but scholars are divided on this issue. Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), says the traditional view is “widely held as the view which most satisfactorily explains all the data.” p. 119, whereas R. E. Brown says opinion on the issue is "evenly divided" Given this, the internal evidence of the Acts of the Apostles concerning its author pertains to the authorship of the Gospel. This evidence, especially passages in the narrative where the first person plural is used, points to the author being a companion of Paul.M. A. Siotis, ‘Luke the Evangelist as St. Paul’s Collaborator’, in Neues Testament Gesichichte, pp. 105-111. As D. Guthrie put it, of the known companions of Paul, Luke is “as good as any… and since this is the traditional ascription there seems no reason to conjecture any other.”Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 117. There is further evidence from the Pauline Epistles.analyzed in detail in Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), pp. 117-118. Paul described Luke as “the beloved physician”, and some scholars have seen evidence of medical terminology used in both the Gospel and Acts,e.g. W. K. Hobart, The Medical Language of St. Luke (1882); A. Harnack, Lukas der Arzt (1906) though others dispute this argument.The traditional view of Lukan authorship is “widely held as the view which most satisfactorily explains all the data.”Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 119. The list of scholars maintaining authorship by Luke the physician is lengthy, and represents scholars from a wide range of theological opinion.To list just some: I. H. Marshall, Acts (1980), pp. 44-45; F. F. Bruce, The Acts of the Apostles (1952), pp. 1-6; C. S. C. Williams, The Acts of the Apostles, in Black’s New Testament Commentary (1957); W.

Blaiklock, The Acts of the Apostles, in Tyndale New Testament Commentary (1959), W. Grundmann, Das Evangelium nach Lukas, p. 39. But there is no consensus, and the current opinion concerning Lukan authorship has been described as ‘about evenly divided’. on who the author was.DateSome scholars place the date c'' 80-90.Meier, John P., [[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|''A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus]]. Doubleday, 1991, v. 1, pp. 43 The terminus ad quem, or latest possible date, for Luke is bound by the earliest papyri manuscripts that contains portions of Luke (late 2nd/early 3rd century)P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt;, P69, P75, and P111 and the mid to late 2nd century writings that quote or reference Luke. The work is reflected in the Didache, the Gnostic writings of Basilides and Valentinus, the apologetics of the Church Father Justin Martyr, and was used by Marcion.Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), pp. 126-126. Donald Guthrie claims that the Gospel was likely widely known before the end of the first century, and was fully recognized by the early part of the second,Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 125. while Helmut Koester states that aside from Marcion, "there is no certain evidence for its usage," prior to ca. 150.Helmut Koester. Ancient Christian Gospels. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International, 1999. p. 334Between 37 AD and 70 ADArguments for a date between 37 AD and 61 AD for the GospelA. Harnack, The Date of Acts and the Synoptic Gospels (1911), p. 90; J. A. T. Robinson, Redating the New Testament, pp. 86-92; I. H. Marshall, Luke, p. 35; A. J. Mattill Jr., ‘The Date and Purpose of Luke-Acts: Rackham reconsidered, in Catholic Biblical Quarterly 40 (1978), pp. 335-350. note that Luke is addressed to "Most Excellent Theophilus," almost certainly a reference to the Roman-imposed High Priest of Israel between 37 AD and 41 AD, Theophilus ben Ananus. This reference would date the original copy of Luke (now long since lost) to within 4 to 8 years after the death of Jesus.Moreover, the writer states that it is written from eyewitness accounts of Jesus and an investigation "from the very beginning," indicating that it was written while eyewitnesses of Jesus' life, ministry, death, and resurrection were still living, and certainly before they were scattered by the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 68-70 AD. The author's reference to investigation "from the very beginning" suggests that the writer himself claims to have been a witness of these events, curious about Jesus, from the very start.The internal contents strikingly make no mention of the destruction of the Jewish temple by the Roman Empire in 68 to 70 AD, despite mentioning prominently Jesus' prophecy that the temple would be destroyed. Luke 21:5-30. This prophecy, providing no detail of how or by whom the temple would be destroyed, is presented as perplexing the hearers. Who will destroy the temple is not mentioned.Indeed, Mark -- which scholars believe formed a basis for Luke -- clearly indicates that the hearers believed that Jesus was saying that God or Jesus Himself would supernaturally destroy the temple: Mark 15:28-29 "Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, come down from the cross and save yourself!" There is no indication in Luke of an awareness that the temple would be destroyed by the Romans, rather than by the hand of God. This lingering mystery about the prophesy indicates it had not yet taken place when Luke was written. A later writer would have taken the opportunity to emphasize that Jesus' prophesy had come true.Scholars conjecture that Luke collected much of his unique material during the imprisonment of Paul in Caesarea, when Luke attended to him.Donald Guthrie, New Testament Introduction (Leicester, England: Apollos, 1990), p. 131. Paul mentions Luke, in passing, several times as travelling with Paul.After 70Many contemporary scholars regard Mark as a source used by Luke (see Markan Priority).Helmut Koester. Ancient Christian Gospels. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International, 1999. p. 336 If it is true that Mark was written around the destruction of the Temple of Jerusalem, around 70, they theorize that Luke would not have been written before 70. This view also believes that Luke's prediction of the destruction of the temple could not be a result of Jesus miraculously predicting the future but must have been written with knowledge of these events after the fact. They believe that the discussion in Luke 21:5-30 is specific enough (more specific than Mark's or Matthew's) that a date after 70 seems necessary, if disputed."Matthew, Gospel acc. to St." Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 S. Brown agrees that that the references to the Jerusalem temple's destruction are seen as evidence of a post-70 date. Brown, Schuyler. The origins of Christianity: a historical introduction to the New Testament. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 24 These scholars have suggested dates for Luke from 75 to 100. Support for a later date comes from a number of reasons. The universalization of the message of Luke is believed to reflect a theology that took time to develop. Differences of chronology, "style", and theology suggest that the author of Luke-Acts was not familiar with Paul's distinctive theology but instead was writing a decade or more after his death, by which point significant harmonization between different traditions within Early Christianity had occurred.Brown, Schuyler. The origins of Christianity: a historical introduction to the New Testament. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 29 Furthermore, Luke-Acts has views on christology, eschatology, and soteriology that are similar to the those found in Pastoral epistles, which are often seen as pseudonymous and of a later date than the undisputed Pauline Epistles.Brown, Schuyler. The origins of Christianity: a historical introduction to the New Testament. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. p. 27Marcion circa 144, appears to have used this gospel, but he called it the Gospel of the Lord.1911 Encyclopedia Britannica: Marcion: "The distinctive teaching of Marcion originated in a comparison of the Old Testament with the gospel of Christ and the theology of the apostle Paul. ... This he did by setting aside the spurious gospels, purging the real gospel (the Gospel of Luke) from supposed judaizing interpolations, and restoring the true text ...Second centuryThe second-century heretic Marcion used a version of Luke as his only gospel. Those who would date Luke later argue that it was written in response to Marcion (see Gospel of Marcion).John Knox (not the same as John Knox) in Marcion and the New Testament was the first to propose in 1942 that Marcion's Gospel may have preceded Luke's Gospel and Acts, echoing Marcion's own claims. Some recent scholars have agreed. In this case, Luke's gospel was not finished. There are two possibilities: Either Marcion and Luke both based their gospels on an earlier, common source, or the Gospel of Luke was based on Marcion's gospel. For an example of evidence that may support this view, compare  to ; some scholars question whether Marcion deleted 5:39 from his Gospel or whether it was added later to counteract a Marcionist interpretation of 5:36-38. See also New Wine into Old Wineskins.Audience and authorial intentLike Mark (but unlike Matthew), the intended audience is Gentile, and it assures readers that Christianity is an international religion, not an exclusively Jewish sect. Luke portrays his subject in a positive light regarding Roman authorities. For example, the Jews are said to be responsible for Jesus' crucifixion, with Pontius Pilate finding no wrong in him.The consensus is that Luke was written by a Greek or Syrian for gentile or non-Jewish Christians. The Gospel is addressed to the author's patron, Theophilus, which in Greek simply means friend of GodStrong's G2321 or (be)loved by God or loving GodBauer lexicon, 2nd edition, 1958, page 358, and may not be a name but a generic term for a Christian. The Gospel is clearly directed at Christians, or at those who already knew about Early Christianity, rather than a general audience, since the ascription goes on to state that the Gospel was written "so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught" ().==Manuscripts==  The earliest manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke are three extensive papyrus fragments dating from the late 2nd century or early 3rd century. P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is probably the earliestGregory (2003) p.27+30, dating from the late 2nd centuryP4 contains Lk 1:58-59, 62-2:1,6-7; 3:8-4:2,29-32,34-35; 5:3-8; 5:30-6:16. P&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt; dates from the late 2nd century/early 3rd centuryP75 contains Lk 3:18-4:2+; 4:34-5:10; 5:37-18:18+; 22:4-24:53 and John 1:1-11:45, 48-57; 12:3-13:10; 14:8-15:10Complete List of Greek NT Papyri. Finally P&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; (mid-3rd century) contains extensive portions of all four Gospels. In addition to these major early papyri there are 6 other papyri (P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,P&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;,P&lt;sup&gt;42&lt;/sup&gt;,P&lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;,P&lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt; and P&lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;) dating from between the 3rd-8th century which also have small portions of Luke's GospelList of New Testament papyriWillker Last Update: 09.06.2006. The early copies, as well as the earliest copies of Acts, date after the Gospel was separated from Acts.Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus are 4th-century codices of the Greek bible that are the oldest manuscripts that contain Luke. Codex Bezae is a 5th- or 6th-century Western text-type manuscript that contains Luke in Greek and Latin versions on facing pages. This text-type appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points. Verses  are omitted only in Codex Bezae and a handful of Old Latin manuscripts. Nearly all other manuscripts including Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus and Church Fathers contain the "longer" reading of Luke 22:19 and 20. Verse 22:20, which is very similar to , provides the only gospel support for the doctrine of the New Covenant. Verses  are found in Western text-type. But they are omitted by a diverse number of ancient witnesses and are generally marked as such in modern translations. See Bruce M. Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament for details.Relationship with other gospelsAccording to Farrar, "Out of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself. In many instances all three use identical language." Mark is widely considered a principal direct source, and Martin Hengel has made the more controversial argument that Luke also made use of Matthew.Martin Hengel. 2000. The Four Gospels and the One Gospel of Jesus Christ: An Investigation of the Collection and Origin of the Canonical Gospels. Trans. J. Bowden. London and Harrisburg: SCM and Trinity Press International. Pp. 169-207.There are 17 parables peculiar to this Gospel. Luke also attributes to Jesus seven miracles which are not present in Matthew or Mark. The synoptic Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel are numbered at 100, then when compared this result is obtained: Mark has 7 peculiarities, 93 coincidences. Matthew 42 peculiarities, 58 coincidences. Luke 59 peculiarities, 41 coincidences. That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke describe the same events in similar language. Luke's style is more polished than that of Matthew and Mark with fewer Hebrew idioms. He uses a few Latin words (Luke ; ; ; ; and ), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except sikera, an exciting drink of the nature of wine but not made of grapes (from Heb. shakar, "he is intoxicated"; Lev ), perhaps palm wine. According to Walter Bauer's Greek English Lexicon of the NT, in Aramaic (שכרא) it means barley beer, from the Akkadian shikaru. This Gospel contains 28 distinct references to the Old Testament.Many words and phrases are common to the Gospel of Luke and the Letters of Paul; compare:Luke  with Colossians 4:6Luke  with 1 Corinthians 2:4Luke  with 2 Corinthians 1:3Luke  with Romans 2:19Luke  with 2 Corinthians 10:8Luke  with 1 Corinthians 10:27Luke  with Titus 1:15Luke  with 2 Thessalonians 1:11Luke  with Ephesians 6:18Luke  with 1 Corinthians 11:23–29Luke  with 1 Corinthians 15:5Luke's writing styleThe main characteristic of this Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is expressed in the motto, "Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil" (Acts ; cf. with Luke ). Luke wrote for the "Hellenistic world".Greek Most scholars believe that the Gospel of Luke was written originally in Greek. The first four verses of Luke are in more formal and refined Greek, which would be meant to be familiar to the elite citizens of the Greco-Roman era. Then the language changes into a style of Greek which is very similar to the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible). Then the language makes its final change toward the end into the common form of 1st-century Greek (called "koine"). Popular opinion among scholars is to see these variations in writings as the Lukan author's ability to write in different literary styles.Attention to womenCompared to the other canonical gospels, Luke devotes significantly more attention to women. The Gospel of Luke features more female characters, features a female prophet (), and details the experience of pregnancy ().Prominent discussion is given to the lives of Elizabeth and of Mary, the mother of Jesus (ch. ).Disputed versesTextual critics have found variations among early manuscripts and have used principles of textual criticism to tentatively identify which versions are original. Bart D. Ehrman cites two cases where proto-orthodox Christians most likely altered the text in order to prevent its being used to support heretical beliefs.Bart D. Ehrman. Misquoting Jesus.When Jesus is baptized, many early witnesses attest that Luke's gospel had the Father say to Jesus, "This day I have begotten you." In orthodox texts (and thus in most modern Bibles), this text is replaced by the text from Mark. Ehrman concludes that the original text was changed because it had adoptionist overtones.When Jesus prays in the garden of Gethsemane, the text refers to his being comforted by an angel and sweating drops like blood (verses 43-44 in ). These two verses disrupt the literary structure of the scene (the chiasmus), they are not found in all the early manuscripts, and they are the only place in Luke where Jesus is seen to be in agony. Ehrman concludes that they were inserted in order to counter doceticism, the belief that Jesus, as divine, only seemed to suffer. While probably not original to the text, these verses reflect first-century tradition.May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger.
