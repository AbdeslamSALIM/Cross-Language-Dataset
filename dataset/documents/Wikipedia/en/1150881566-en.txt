He spent much of his childhood at the Spanish court in Madrid. When his brother prince Filippo Emanuele died, he became legitimate heir to the duchy and received the loyalty swore of the court at Racconigi on 21 January 1607.After a crisis with relationships with Spain, he was married to Henry IV of France's daughter Christine Marie.  Victor Amadeus became Duke of Savoy after his father's death in 1630. Charles Emmanuel's policies had brought a great instability in the relationships with both France and Spain, and troops were needed to defend the Duchy. As money was lacking to recruit mercenaries or train indigenous soldiers, Victor Amadeus signed a peace treaty with Spain. With the Treaty of Cherasco, Savoy was given back Pinerolo, although, according to a secret point of the agreement, that important stronghold was to remain with France in exchange for Geneve.Subsequently, under the direction of Cardinal Richelieu, Victor Amadeus attempted to create an anti-Spanish league in Italy. In 1637 he crushed a Spanish army at battle of Mombaldone.On 25 September of that year, Victor Amadeus fell ill after a dinner offered by the Duke of Créqui. Carried to Turin, he died here on 7 October.Ancestors+'Victor Amadeus I's ancestors in three generations'Victor Amadeus I, Duke of SavoyFather:Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of SavoyPaternal Grandfather:Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of SavoyPaternal Great-Grandfather:Charles III, Duke of SavoyPaternal Great-grandmother:Infanta Beatriz, Duchess of SavoyPaternal Grandmother:Margaret of France, Duchess of BerryPaternal Great-Grandfather:Francis I of FrancePaternal Great-Grandmother:Claude of FranceMother:Catherine Michelle of SpainMaternal Grandfather:Philip II of SpainMaternal Great-Grandfather:Charles V, Holy Roman EmperorMaternal Great-Grandmother:Isabella of PortugalMaternal Grandmother:Elisabeth of ValoisMaternal Great-grandfather:Henry II of FranceMaternal Great-Grandmother:Catherine de' MediciMarriage and issueHe married Christine Marie of France (1606-1663), Regent of the Duchy from 1637 to 1663 and a daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici.
