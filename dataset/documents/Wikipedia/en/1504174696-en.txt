At the age of sixteen she was chosen as the future wife of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the heir of Queen Victoria. They married eighteen months later. As Princess of Wales from 1863 to 1901, the longest anyone has ever held that title, she won the hearts of the British people and became immensely popular; her style of dress and bearing were copied by fashion-conscious women. Although she was largely excluded from wielding any political power, she unsuccessfully attempted to sway the opinion of ministers and her family to favour her relations who reigned in Greece and Denmark. Her public duties were restricted to uncontroversial involvement in charitable work.On the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, Albert Edward became King-Emperor as Edward VII, with Alexandra as Queen-Empress Consort. From Edward's death in 1910 until her own death, she was the Queen Mother, being a queen and the mother of the reigning monarch, George V of the United Kingdom, though she was more generally styled Her Majesty Queen Alexandra. She greatly distrusted her nephew, William II of Germany, and supported her son during World War I, in which Britain and its allies defeated Germany.Early lifePrincess Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia, or "Alix", as she was known within the family, was born at the Yellow Palace, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, right next to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen. Her father was Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse-Cassel.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh (ed.) (1977). Burke's Royal Families of the World, Volume 1. (London: Burke's Peerage). ISBN 0-220-66222-3. pp.69–70 Although she was of royal blood,Her mother and father were both great-grandchildren of King Frederick V of Denmark and great-great-grandchildren of King George II of Great Britain. her family lived a comparatively normal life. They did not possess great wealth; her father's income from an army commission was about £800 per year and their house was a rent-free grace and favour property.Duff, pp.16–17 Occasionally, Hans Christian Andersen was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime.Duff, p.18In 1848, King Christian VIII of Denmark died and his only son, Frederick ascended the throne. Frederick was childless, had been through two unsuccessful marriages, and was assumed to be infertile. A succession crisis arose as Frederick ruled in both Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein, and the succession rules of each were different. In Holstein, the Salic law prevented inheritance through the female line, whereas no such restrictions applied in Denmark. Holstein, being predominantly German, proclaimed independence and called in the aid of Prussia. In 1852, the great powers called a conference in London to discuss the Danish succession. An uneasy peace was agreed, which included the provision that Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg would be Frederick's heir in all his dominions and the prior claims of others (who included Christian's own mother-in-law, brother-in-law and wife) were surrendered.Battiscombe, p.8Maclagan, Michael; Louda, Jiří (1999). Lines of Succession (London: Little, Brown). ISBN 0-85605-469-1. p.49Prince Christian was given the title Prince of Denmark and his family moved into a new official residence, Bernstorff Palace. Although the family's status had risen, there was no or little increase in their income and they did not participate in court life at Copenhagen as they refused to meet Frederick's third wife and former mistress, Louise Rasmussen, who had an illegitimate child by a previous lover.Duff, pp.19–20 Alexandra shared a draughty attic bedroom with her sister, Dagmar, made her own clothes and waited at table along with her sisters.Priestley, p.17 At Bernstorff, Alexandra grew into a young woman; she was taught English by the English chaplain at Copenhagen and was confirmed in Christiansborg Palace.Duff, p.21 Alexandra was devout throughout her life, and followed High Church beliefs.Battiscombe, pp.125 and 176Marriage and familyQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband, Prince Albert, were already concerned with finding a bride for their son and heir, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales. They enlisted the aid of their daughter, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, in seeking a suitable candidate. Alexandra was not their first choice, since the Danes were at loggerheads with the Prussians over the Schleswig-Holstein Question and most of the British royal family's relations were German. Eventually, after rejecting other possibilities, they settled on her as "the only one to be chosen".Prince Albert quoted in Duff, p.31On 24 September 1861, Crown Princess Victoria introduced her brother Albert Edward to Alexandra at Speyer, but it was not until almost a year later on 9 September 1862 (after his affair with Nellie Clifden and the death of his father) that Albert Edward proposed to Alexandra at the Royal Castle of Laeken, the home of his uncle, King Leopold I of Belgium.Battiscombe, pp.27–37; Bentley-Cranch, p.44 and Duff, p.43(1864, National Maritime Museum)]]A few months later, Alexandra travelled from Denmark to the United Kingdom aboard the [[HMY Victoria and Albert II|HMY Victoria and Albert II]] for her marriage and arrived in Gravesend, Kent on 7 March 1863.[http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp05859&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit The Landing of HRH The Princess Alexandra at Gravesend, 7th March 1863], National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved on 7 August 2008 Sir Arthur Sullivan composed music for her arrival and Alfred Tennyson, the Poet Laureate, wrote an ode in Alexandra's honour:The couple were married on 10 March 1863 at St George's Chapel, Windsor by Thomas Longley, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Her bridesmaids were The Ladies Diana Beauclerk, Victoria Montagu-Douglas-Scott, Victoria Howard, Elma Bruce, Agneta Yorke, Emily Villiers, Eleanor Hare and Feodora Wellesley. The choice of venue was criticised in the press (as it was outside London large public crowds would not be able to view the spectacle), by prospective guests (it was awkward to get to and, as the venue was small, some people who had expected invitations were not invited) and the Danes (as only Alexandra's closest relations were invited). The court was still in mourning for Prince Albert, so ladies were restricted to wearing grey, lilac or mauve.Duff, pp.48–50 The couple were seen off on their honeymoon at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight by the schoolboys of neighbouring Eton College, including Lord Randolph Churchill.Duff, p.60By the end of the following year, Alexandra's father had ascended the throne of Denmark, her brother George had become King of the Hellenes, her sister Dagmar was engaged to the Tsarevitch of Russia,He died within a few months of the engagement and she married his brother, Alexander, instead. and Alexandra had given birth to her first child. Her father's accession gave rise to further conflict over the fate of Schleswig-Holstein. The German Confederation successfully invaded Denmark, reducing the area of Denmark by two-fifths. To the great irritation of Queen Victoria and the Crown Princess of Prussia, Alexandra and Albert Edward supported the Danish side in the war. The Prussian conquest of former Danish lands heightened Alexandra's profound dislike of the Germans, a feeling which stayed with her for the rest of her life. (Subscription required)Alexandra's first child, Albert Victor, was born two months premature in early 1864. Alexandra was devoted to her children: "She was in her glory when she could run up to the nursery, put on a flannel apron, wash the children herself and see them asleep in their little beds."Mrs. Blackburn, the head nurse, quoted in Duff, p.115 Albert Edward and Alexandra had six children in total: Albert Victor, George, Louise, Victoria, Maud, and John.In public Alexandra was dignified and charming, and in private affectionate and jolly.Battiscombe, pp.127, 222–223 She enjoyed many social activities, including dancing and ice-skating, and was an expert horsewoman and tandem driver.Duff, p.143 Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to behave much as before, which led to some friction between the Queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Germans and the Queen's partiality towards them. All of Alexandra's children were born prematurely. During the birth of her third child in 1867, the added complication of a bout of rheumatic fever threatened Alexandra's life, leaving her with a permanent limp.Battiscombe, pp.82–86 and Duff, pp.73 and 81Princess of WalesAlbert Edward and Alexandra visited Ireland in April 1868. After her illness the previous year, she had only just begun to walk again without the aid of two walking sticks, and was already pregnant with her fourth child.Battiscombe, p.94 They undertook a six-month tour taking in Austria, Egypt and Greece over 1868–9, which included visits to her brother, King George I of Greece, the Crimean battlefields and, for her only, the harem of the Khedive Ismail. In Turkey she became the first woman to sit down to dinner with the Sultan (Abdülâziz).Duff, pp.93–100Albert Edward and Alexandra made Sandringham House their preferred residence. Biographers agree that their marriage was in many ways a happy one, however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife as much attention as she would have liked, and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation.Duff, p.111 and Philip Magnus quoted in Battiscombe, pp.109–110 This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift.Battiscombe, p.110 Nevertheless, throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, among them the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Most of these were with the full knowledge of Alexandra, who later invited Alice Keppel to visit the King as he lay dying.Battiscombe, p.271 and Priestley, p.18 and 180 Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.Battiscombe, pp.100–101An increasing degree of deafness, caused by hereditary otosclerosis, led to Alexandra's social isolation; she spent more time at home with her children and pets.Battiscombe, p.88 and Duff, p.82 Her sixth and final pregnancy ended in tragedy when her infant son died after only a day of life. Despite Alexandra's pleas for privacy, Queen Victoria insisted on announcing a period of court mourning, which led to unsympathetic elements of the press to describe the birth as "a wretched abortion" and the funeral arrangements as "sickening mummery".Duff, p.85(centre) and eldest daughter, Princess Louise (left)]]For eight months over 1875–6, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain on a tour of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The Prince had planned an all-male group and intended to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the Prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by his wife that she was going to leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the Queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The Prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.Battiscombe, pp.132–135Alexandra spent the spring of 1877 in Greece recuperating from a period of ill health and visiting her brother King George of the Hellenes.Battiscombe, p.136 During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), Alexandra was clearly partial against Turkey and towards Russia, where her sister was married to the Tsarevitch, and she lobbied for a revision of the border between Greece and Turkey in favour of the Greeks.Battiscombe, pp.150–152 Alexandra and her two sons spent the next three years largely parted from each other's company as the boys were sent on a worldwide cruise as part of their naval and general education. The farewell was very tearful and, as shown by her regular letters, she missed them dreadfully.Battiscombe, pp.155–156 In 1881, Alexandra and Albert Edward travelled to Saint Petersburg after the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, both to represent Britain and so that Alexandra could provide comfort to her sister, who was now the Tsarina.Battiscombe, pp.157–160 and Duff, p.131Alexandra undertook many public duties; in the words of Queen Victoria, "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals in my place&nbsp;... she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty."Queen Victoria quoted in Duff, p.146 She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met.Battiscombe, pp.257–258 and Duff, pp.148–151 Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously,Battiscombe, p.166 but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She, and her husband, were booed by a crowd of two or three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, and the British press still portrayed the visit in a positive light, describing the crowds as "enthusiastic".Daily Telegraph quoted in Battiscombe, p.168 As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College, Dublin.Battiscombe, p.167The death of her eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1892 was a serious blow to the tender-hearted Alexandra, and his room and possessions were kept exactly as he had left them, much as those of Prince Albert were left after his death in 1861.Battiscombe, pp.189–193, 197 and Duff, p.184 She said, "I have buried my angel and with him my happiness."Alexandra quoted in Duff, p.186 Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted.Battiscombe, pp.141–142 In 1894, her brother-in-law, Alexander III of Russia, died and her nephew, Nicholas II of Russia became Tsar. Alexandra's widowed sister, Dagmar, leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra slept, prayed and stayed beside her sister for the next two weeks until Alexander's burial.Battiscombe, p.205 and Duff, pp.196–197Queen Alexandra[[Image:Alexandra.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexandra was an enthusiastic amateur photographer.Battiscombe, p.204 Queen Alexandra's Christmas gift book, frontispiece shown above, contained royal photographs and was published to raise money for charities.]] Queen ConsortWith the death of her mother-in-law, Queen Victoria, in 1901, Alexandra became queen-empress consort to the new king. Just two months later, her surviving son George and daughter-in-law Mary of Teck, left on an extensive tour of the empire, leaving their young children in the care of Alexandra and Edward, who doted on their grandchildren. On George's return, preparations for the coronation of Edward and Alexandra were well in hand. Just a few days before the scheduled coronation in June 1902, however, Edward became seriously ill with appendicitis. Alexandra deputised for him at a military parade, and attended the Royal Ascot races without him, in an attempt to prevent public alarm.Battiscombe, pp.243–244 Eventually, the coronation had to be postponed and Edward had an operation to drain the infected appendix. After his recovery, Alexandra and Edward were crowned together in August: he by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, and she by the Archbishop of York, William Dalrymple Maclagan.Battiscombe, p.249Despite now being queen, Alexandra's duties changed little, and she kept many of the same retainers. Alexandra's Woman of the Bedchamber, Charlotte Knollys, served Alexandra loyally for many years. On 10 December 1903, Charlotte, the daughter of Sir William Knollys, woke to find her bedroom full of smoke. She roused Alexandra and shepherded her to safety. In the words of Grand Duchess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, "We must give credit to old Charlotte for really saving Alexandra's life."Battiscombe, p.253Alexandra again looked after her grandchildren when George and Mary went on a second tour, this time to British India, over the winter of 1905–6.Battiscombe, p.258 Her father, King Christian IX of Denmark, died that January. Eager to retain their family links, to both each other and to Denmark, in 1907 Alexandra and her sister Dagmar purchased a villa north of Copenhagen, Hvidøre, as a private getaway.Battiscombe, p.262 and Duff, pp.239–240Biographers have asserted that Alexandra was denied access to the King's briefing papers and excluded from some of the King's foreign tours to prevent her meddling in diplomatic matters.Duff, pp.225–227 She was deeply distrustful of Germans, and invariably opposed anything that favoured German expansion or interests. For example, in 1890 Alexandra wrote a memorandum, distributed to senior British ministers and military personnel, warning against the planned exchange of the British North Sea island of Heligoland for the German colony of Zanzibar, pointing out Heligoland's strategic significance and that it could be used either by Germany to launch an attack, or by Britain to contain German aggression.Battiscombe, pp.176–179 Despite this, the exchange went ahead anyway. The Germans fortified the island and, in the words of Robert Ensor and as Alexandra had predicted, it "became the keystone of Germany's maritime position for offence as well as for defence".Ensor, p.194 The Frankfurter Zeitung was outspoken in its condemnation of Alexandra and her sister, Dagmar, Dowager Empress of Russia, saying that the pair were "the centre of the international anti-German conspiracy".Quoted in Duff, p.234 She despised and distrusted her nephew, William II of Germany, calling him in 1900 "inwardly our enemy".Duff, pp.207 and 239In 1910, Alexandra became the first Queen Consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a remarkable departure from precedent, for two hours she sat in the Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to reform the role of the House of Lords, was debated.Battiscombe, p.269 Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill.Battiscombe, p.278 Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe.Duff, pp.249–250 She told Frederick Ponsonby, "I feel as if I had been turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all."Ponsonby's memoirs quoted in Duff, p.251 Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham.Battiscombe, p.274 and Windsor, p.77 The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported the King's decision to help force the bill through Parliament at the Prime Minister's request but against the wishes of the House of Lords when the reforming party won elections to the House of Commons.Battiscombe, pp.277–278Queen MotherShe did not attend her son's coronation in 1911 but otherwise continued the public side of her life, devoting time to her charitable causes, which included Alexandra Rose Day, where artificial roses made by the disabled were sold in aid of hospitals by women volunteers.Duff, pp.251–257 and 260The Alexandra Rose Day fund still exists; its patron is Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy, Alexandra's great-granddaughter. During the First World War, the custom of hanging the banners of foreign princes invested with Britain's highest order of knighthood, the Order of the Garter, in St. George's Chapel, Windsor, came under criticism, as the German members of the Order were fighting against Britain. Alexandra joined calls to "have down those hateful German banners".Alexandra to King George V, quoted in Battiscombe, p.285 Driven by public opinion, but against his own wishes, the King had the banners removed but to Alexandra's dismay he had down not only "those vile Prussian banners" but also those of her relations who were, in her opinion, "simply soldiers or vassals under that brutal German Emperor's orders". On 17 September 1916, she was at Sandringham during a Zeppelin air raid,Battiscombe, pp.291–292 but far worse was to befall the royalty of Europe. In Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was overthrown and he, his wife and children were killed by revolutionaries. The Dowager Empress, Dagmar, was rescued from Russia in 1919 by [[HMS Marlborough (1912)|HMS Marlborough]] and brought to England where she lived for some time with her sister, Alexandra.Duff, pp.285–286Alexandra retained a youthful appearance into her senior years,e.g. Mary Gladstone and Lord Carrington, quoted in Battiscombe, p.206; Margot Asquith, quoted in Battiscombe, pp.216–217; Jackie Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher quoted in Battiscombe, p.232 but during the war her age caught up with her.Alexandra herself and Queen Mary quoted by Battiscombe, p.296 She took to wearing elaborate veils and heavy makeup, which was described by gossipy women as having her face "enamelled". She made no more trips abroad, and suffered increasing ill-health. In 1920, a blood vessel in her eye burst, leaving her partially blind temporarily.Battiscombe, p.299 Towards the end of her life, her memory and speech became impaired.Battiscombe, pp.301–302 She died on 20 November 1925 at Sandringham after suffering a heart attack and was buried in an elaborate tomb next to her husband in St.George's Chapel at Windsor.Eilers, Marlene A. - Queen Victoria's Descendants, p.171LegacyThe Queen Alexandra Memorial by Alfred Gilbert was unveiled on 8 June 1932 (Alexandra Rose Day) at Marlborough Gate, London.Dorment, Richard (January 1980).

In the words of her grandson, Edward VIII (later the Duke of Windsor), "Her generosity was a source of embarrassment to her financial advisers. Whenever she received a letter soliciting money, a cheque would be sent by the next post, regardless of the authenticity of the mendicant and without having the case investigated."Windsor, pp.85–86 Though she was not always extravagant (she had her old stockings darned for re-use and her old dresses were recycled as furniture covers),Battiscombe, p.203 she would dismiss protests about her heavy spending with a wave of a hand or by claiming that she had not heard.Battiscombe, p.293She hid a small scar on her neck, which was likely the result of a childhood operation,Baron Stockmar, who was a doctor, quoted in Duff, p.37 by wearing choker necklaces and high necklines, setting fashions which were adopted for fifty years.Battiscombe, pp.24–25 Alexandra's effect on fashion was so profound that society ladies even copied her limping gait, after her serious illness in 1867 left her with a stiff leg.Battiscombe, p.92 She used predominantly the London fashion houses; her favourite was Redfern's, but she shopped occasionally at Doucet and Fromont of Paris.Battiscombe, p.203Queen Alexandra has been portrayed in three British television productions: by Deborah Grant and Helen Ryan in Edward the Seventh, by Maggie Smith in All the King's Men, and by Bibi Andersson in The Lost Prince.Titles, styles, honours and arms Titles and styles1 December 1844 – 31 July 1853: Her Serene Highness Princess Alexandra of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg31 July 1853 – 21 December 1858: Her Highness Princess Alexandra of Denmark21 December 1858 – 10 March 1863: Her Royal Highness Princess Alexandra of Denmark10 March 1863 – 22 January 1901: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales22 January 1901 – 6 May 1910: Her Majesty The Queen (Her Imperial Majesty The Empress of India)6 May 1910 – 20 November 1925: Her Majesty Queen AlexandraHonoursIn 1901, she became the first woman to be made a Lady of the Garter since 1495.Duff, pp.215–216ArmsQueen Alexandra's arms were the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom impaled with the arms of her father, Christian IX of Denmark.See, for example, the cover of BattiscombeAncestors  See alsoCrown of Queen AlexandraNotesReferencesExternal links Alexandra Rose Day official site   |-    |-   |-    |-  |-        Category:British royal consorts Category:Companions of the Order of the Crown of India Category:Dames Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire Category:Danish princesses Category:English and British princesses Category:House of Glücksburg Category:House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Category:Indian empresses Category:Issue of Christian IX of Denmark Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Ladies of Justice of the Order of St John Category:Ladies of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert Category:Members of the Royal Red Cross Category:Princesses of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg Category:Princesses of Wales Category:Queen mothersbs:Aleksandra od Danske bg:Александра Датска ca:Alexandra de Dinamarca cy:Alexandra o Ddenmarc da:Alexandra af Danmark de:Alexandra von Dänemark et:Alexandra (Suurbritannia) es:Alejandra de Dinamarca fr:Alexandra de Danemark ko:덴마크의 알렉산드라 is:Alexandra Bretadrottning it:Alessandra di Danimarca he:אלכסנדרה, נסיכת דנמרק hu:Alexandra brit királyné nl:Alexandra van Denemarken ja:アレクサンドラ・オブ・デンマーク no:Alexandra av Storbritannia pl:Aleksandra (żona Edwarda VII) pt:Alexandra da Dinamarca ro:Alexandra a Danemarcei ru:Александра Датская sv:Alexandra av Danmark th:เจ้าหญิงอเล็กซานดราแห่งเดนมาร์ก
