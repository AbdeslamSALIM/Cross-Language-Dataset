Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) is a multi-national airline for Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and the leading carrier in the Scandinavian countries, based in Stockholm, Sweden and owned by SAS AB. It is a founding member of the Star Alliance. It is also the founder of Air Greenland, Linjeflyg, Spanair, Thai Airways International, and the former charter airline Scanair. SAS operates out of three primary hubs, Copenhagen Airport, Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. In 2006 Scandinavian Airlines had 25 million passengers and the SAS Group had 38.6 million passengers.HistoryThe airline was founded on August 1, 1946, when Det Danske Luftfartselskab A/S, Svensk Interkontinental Lufttrafik AB, and Det Norske Luftfartselskap AS (the flag carriers of Denmark, Sweden and Norway) formed a partnership to handle intercontinental traffic to Scandinaviahttp://www.sas.dk/da/Om-SAS-Danmark2/Historie/?vst=true. Operations started on September 17, 1946. The companies coordinated European operations in 1948 and finally merged to form the SAS Consortium in 1951. When established, the airline was divided between SAS Danmark (28.6%), SAS Norge (28.6%) and SAS Sverige (42.8%), all owned 50% by private investors and 50% by their governments. In 1954, SAS became the first airline in the world to operate a trans-polar route. It was from Copenhagen to Los Angeles, stopping in Søndre Strømfjord in Greenland, and it became popular with Hollywood celebrities and production people when travelling to Europe. The route was a publicity coup for the airline, which became well known as a result. Thanks to a price structure which allowed free transit to other European destinations these trans polar routes were enormously popular with American tourists in the 1950s. It would later operate trans-polar routes to East Asia, over Greenland and Alaska, since Siberia and China were not allowed to be flown-over at that time.In 1957, SAS was the first airline to offer "round the world service over the North Pole" via the North Pole shortcut, Copenhagen-Anchorage-Tokyo. SAS entered the jet age in 1959 when the first jet aircraft, the Caravelle, entered service. In 1971, SAS put its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet into service.SAS gradually acquired control of the domestic markets in all three countries by acquiring full or partial control of local airlines, including Braathens and Widerøe in Norway, Linjeflyg and Skyways Express in Sweden and Cimber Air in Denmark. In 1989, SAS acquired 18.4% of Texas Air Corporation, parent company of Continental Airlines, in a bid to form a global alliance. This stake was later sold. During the 1990s, SAS also bought a 20% stake in British Midland which, along with Lufthansa, own 49.9% of the carrier. SAS bought 95% of Spanair, the second largest airline in Spain as well as Air Greenland. There are plans to dispose of all of these holdings. SAS plans to sell Spanair and its stake in the British carrier bmi International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;In May 1997, SAS formed the global Star Alliance network with Air Canada, Lufthansa, Thai Airways International and United Airlines. Four years earlier, SAS unsuccessfully attempted to merge with KLM, Austrian, and the defunct carrier, Swissair, in a project called Alcazar. Talks Collapse On European Airline Merger International Herald Tribune&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; This failure led to the departure the following year of CEO Jan Carlzon, who was credited for the financial turnaround of the company starting in 1981 and who envisioned SAS ownership of multiple airlines worldwide. The ownership structure of SAS was changed in June 2001, with a holding company being created in which the holdings of the governments changed to: Sweden (21.4%), Norway (14.3%) and Denmark (14.3%) and the remaining 50% publicly held and traded on the stock market. SAS employs 9147 staff.In 2004, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) was divided into 4 different companies SAS Scandinavian Airlines Sverige AB, SAS Scandinavian Airlines Danmark AS, SAS Braathens AS and SAS Scandinavian International AS. SAS Braathens was rebranded SAS Scandinavian Airlines Norge AS in 2007.AwardsSAS has numerous awards collected, including Airline of the year and best international bonus promotion.

All 32 on board were killed.On January 19, 1960, a Caravelle III, OY-KRB crashed near Ankara, Turkey. All 42 on board were killed.On January 13, 1969, a DC-8-62, LN-MOO, hit the water while approaching Los Angeles. 15 of the 45 on board were killed.On April 19, 1970 a DC-8-62, SE-DBE, experienced an uncontained engine fire during takeoff from Rome. Aircraft burned out, but all on board managed to evacuate safely.On January 30, 1973, a DC-9-21, LN-RLM SAS flight 370, Oslo-Alta via Tromsø, was cleared for takeoff from runway 24. The takeoff run was normal and the DC-9 rotated at VR (125 knots). At that moment the stall warning system activated. Although the speed had increased to , the pilot decided to abort the takeoff. The remaining 1100 m however was not enough to bring the aircraft to a halt, the reversers did not deploy completely and the aircraft overran the runway and onto the ice covered Oslofjord. All passengers and crew evacuated before the plane broke through the ice and sank 20 minutes later. The decision to abort the take-off in spite of the high speed was due to the fact, that the flight crew had received outdated (by several hours) runway data, giving much better braking coefficients than the actual ones.On February 28, 1984, SAS Flight 901, DC-10, LN-RKB departed Oslo (GEN) for a flight to New York JFK. The aircraft touched down 1440 m past the runway 4R threshold. The crew steered the plane to the right side off the runway to avoid approach lights. The DC-10 ended up in shallow water. All on board the plane were uninjured.On December 27, 1991, SAS flight 751, a MD-81, OY-KHO "Dana Viking" crash landed at Gottröra, Sweden. In the initial climb both engines ingested ice breaking loose from the wings, which had not been properly deiced before departure. The ice damaged the compressor blades causing compressor stall. The stall caused repeated engine surges that destroyed both engines, leaving the aircraft with no propulsion. The aircraft landed in a field and broke in three parts. No fire broke out and all aboard the plane survived. Captain Stefan G. Rasmussen was later decorated by the Danish Queen for his performance. This incident was mentioned on The History Channel's True Action Adventures episode "Against All Odds" which first aired in the United States on April 2, 1997.The Linate Airport disaster, involving the highest number of SAS passenger fatalities, occurred on October 8 2001 in Milan, Italy, when an MD-87, SAS flight SK686, SE-DMA collided with a small Cessna jet during take-off. All 104 pax and 6 crew aboard SK686 were killed, along with 4 people on the Cessna and another 4 people on the ground. Italian authorities established that the cause of the accident was a misunderstanding between air traffic controllers and the Cessna jet, and that the SAS crew had no role in causing the accident. Another factor was the fact that the ground movement radar was inoperative at the time of the accident.On September 9 2007, a de Havilland Canada Dash 8-400 (Q400), SAS flight SK1209 with 69 passengers and 4 crew members was on flight to Aalborg Airport when problems with the main landing gear were identified. The pilots were forced to make an emergency landing at Aalborg Airport. After landing the right gear collapsed and the plane toppled to the right and turned around and ended on a field and the right engine caught fire. The fire was immediately extinguished. There were no severe injuries.On September 12 2007, a Dash 8-400 (Q400), SAS flight SK2748 with 48 passengers and 4 crew members was on flight to Palanga, Lithuania when problems with the main landing gear were identified. The pilots were forced to make an emergency landing at Vilnius Airport (better suited for an emergency landing). After landing the right gear collapsed. There were no severe injuries. This accident, along with the Aalborg accident just days earlier, caused all SAS Dash 8-400 planes to be grounded until the beginning of October  SAS CLEARS TROUBLED PLANE FOR TAKEOFF.On October 27 2007, a Dash 8-400 (Q400), SAS flight SK2867 from Bergen, Norway with 40 passengers and 4 crew members was on flight to Copenhagen, Denmark when problems with the main landing gear were identified. The pilots were forced to land the aircraft with port side landing gear up. There were no severe injuries. The aircraft in question was one of six examples that had been cleared to fly just a month before, following the grounding of the entire Scandinavian Airlines Dash 8-400 fleet due to similar issues with landing gear. The entire fleet was grounded again following the incident. It was subsequently announced that the entire fleet would be retired with immediate effect.
