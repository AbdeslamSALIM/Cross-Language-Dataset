In 2000, Dr. Kroemer, along with Zhores I. Alferov, was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics "for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and opto-electronics".He worked in a number of research laboratories in Germany and the United States and taught electrical engineering at the University of Colorado from 1968 to 1976. He joined the UCSB faculty in 1976, focusing its semiconductor research program on the emerging compound semiconductor technology rather than on mainstream silicon technology.Kroemer, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, has always preferred to work on problems that are ahead of mainstream technology. In the 1950s, he invented the drift transistor and was the first to point out that advantages could be gained in various semiconductor devices by incorporating heterojunctions into the devices. Most notably, in 1963 he proposed the concept of the double-heterostructure laser, the central concept in the field of semiconductor lasers. Kroemer became an early pioneer in molecular beam epitaxy, concentrating on applying the technology to untried new materials.Along with Charles Kittel he co-authored the popular textbook Thermal Physics, first published in 1980, and still used today.External linksNot Just Blue SkyNobelprize.org pagePersonal Homepage USCBFreeview video Interview with Herbert Kroemer by the Vega Science TrustU.S. Patent 5067828 Transferred electron effective mass modulator (Herbert Kroemer)U.S. Patent 5013683 Method for growing tilted superlattices (Herbert Kroemer)[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/16/20748/00960370.pdf Herb’s Bipolar Transistors IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES, VOL. 48, NO. 11, NOVEMBER 2001] PDFInfluence of Mobility and Lifetime Variations on Drift-Field Effects in Silicon-Junction Devices PDFHeterostructure Bipolar Transistors and Integrated Circuits PDF Category:Members of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Engineering educators Category:University of Göttingen alumni Category:German Nobel laureates Category:German physicists Category:IEEE Medal of Honor recipients Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:Semiconductor physicists Category:University of California, Santa Barbara faculty Category:University of Colorado facultybg:Херберт Крьомер ca:Herbert Kroemer de:Herbert Kroemer es:Herbert Kroemer fr:Herbert Kroemer id:Herbert Kroemer it:Herbert Kroemer ht:Herbert Kroemer ku:Herbert Kroemer nl:Herbert Kroemer ja:ハーバート・クレーマー pl:Herbert Kroemer pt:Herbert Kroemer ro:Herbert Kroemer ru:Крёмер, Герберт sl:Herbert Kroemer fi:Herbert Kroemer sv:Herbert Kroemer zh:赫伯特·克勒默
