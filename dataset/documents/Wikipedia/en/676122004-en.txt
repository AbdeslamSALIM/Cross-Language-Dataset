The highest point in the county is Knockmealdown, at 794m. It also has many rivers, including Ireland's third longest river, the River Suir (184 km); and Ireland's fourth longest river, the Munster Blackwater (168km). There are over 30 beaches along Waterford's volcanic coast line. The county is one of the few in Ireland with a Gaeltacht, an area with native Irish speaking people.The DéiseCounty Waterford is known locally as "The Decies" (). Some time between the 4th and 8th centuries, a tribe of native Gaelic people called the Déisi were driven from the southern parts of the country, conquering and settling here. The ancient principality of the Déise is today roughly coterminous with the current Roman Catholic Diocese of Waterford and Lismore. The Deise has a rich history from megalithic tombs and ogham stones, to Vikings, to remnants of English occupancy, including the Gaulstown dolmen, Reginalds Tower and the Ballysaggartmore Towers respectively.PeopleThe people that live in the Déise today are known to thrive on Irish traditions such as hurling and eating blaas (a type of floury bread roll, unique to the region).BaroniesThe westernmost of the baronies of county Waterford are "Decies within Drum" and "Decies without Drum", separated by the Drum-Fineen hills.
