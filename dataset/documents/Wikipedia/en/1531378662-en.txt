However, his involvement angered Rangers manager Alex McLeish as it forced him to miss the start of the Scottish league season. As a result Moore was stripped of the club captaincy and was forced to the fringes of the team and was sold to Borussia Mönchengladbach in January 2005 where he teamed up with former Rangers manager Dick Advocaat. Over his two spells with the Ibrox club, Moore made 250 appearances and scored 17 goals.When Advocaat was sacked after a short time in charge, Moore left the Borussia Mönchengladbach after a falling out with club management.On July 30 2005 he signed a two year deal at Newcastle United to play for the first time in the English Premiership.Moore made his competitive Newcastle debut on March 22 2006 against Chelsea in the FA Cup Quarter-Finals, becoming the first Australian to play for Newcastle. His actual first game came at home to Yeading in which he scored one of five goals. Injuries ruined Moore's Newcastle career, and he only made 8 premiership appearances in the 2005-06 season. Moore was then injured in November 2006 and was ruled out for several months. He returned but struggled to get back into the team, with Peter Ramage, Steven Taylor, and Titus Bramble keeping him out. After Titus Bramble's dip in form, Moore returned to the first team. Moore made 17 premiership appearances in the 2006-07 season.On 16 May 2007 it was announced that Moore's contract would not be renewed, and he was released by the club. He made 31 appearances for Newcastle but never scored.Queensland RoarIt was rumoured on July 25 2007 that Moore had signed with  in his native home state of Queensland, Australia, to become the Roar's marquee signing for the 2007/2008 Hyundai A-League Season and the 2008-2009 season.This was confirmed with an announcement by Queensland and Moore on July 25 2007 with Moore signing to be Queensland's marquee player for 2 years.Moore's career with the Roar did not start well. He was sent off in the 69th minute in the first game of the season against Adelaide United for a second yellow card. Although Queensland were trailing at the time 2-1 came back to level the score at 2-2 and hold on for a draw. He scored his first goal for the Roar in their round four clash with Perth Glory. Queensland went of to win 3-0.International careerMoore represented the Socceroos in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. He scored a penalty kick against Croatia in the 39th minute of the game, enabling Australia to progress to the second round. As of 2008, he has made 40 appearances for Australia, scoring three goals. Moore announced his international retirement on February 6 2008 after Australia's 3-0 win over Qatar in their first FIFA World Cup Qualifier at Telstra Dome. Craig has recently put his hand up for International call ups in September 2008. On 1 October 2008, Australian coach Pim Verbeek announced that Moore was part of the 35 man squad for the upcoming World Cup Qualifiers.Career statisticsCraig Moore&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;   |- |1993-94||rowspan="6"|Rangers||rowspan="5"|Premier Division||1||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1994-95||21||2|||||||||||||||| |- |1995-96||11||1|||||||||||||||| |- |1996-97||23||1|||||||||||||||| |- |1997-98||10||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1998-99||Premier League||8||1||||||||||||||||  |- |1998-99||Crystal Palace||First Division||23||3||||||||||||||||  |- |1999-00||rowspan="6"|Rangers||rowspan="6"|Premier League||22||1|||||||||||||||| |- |2000-01||5||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2001-02||18||3|||||||||||||||| |- |2002-03||35||3|||||||||||||||| |- |2003-04||17||2|||||||||||||||| |- |2004-05||3||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2004-05||Borussia Mönchengladbach||Bundesliga||13||1||||||||||||||||  |- |2005-06||rowspan="2"|Newcastle United||rowspan="2"|Premier League||8||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2006-07||17||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2007-08||rowspan="2"|Queensland Roar||rowspan="2"|A-League||18||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2008-09|||||||||||||||||||| 174||14|||||||||||||||| 48||3|||||||||||||||| 13||1|||||||||||||||| 18||0|||||||||||||||| 253||18|||||||||||||||| |HonoursWith Rangers FC: SPL Championship: 1993–1994, 1994–1995, 1995–1996, 1996–1997, 1999–2000, 2002–2003 Scottish Cup: 1995–1996, 1999–2000, 2001–2002, 2002–2003 Scottish League Cup: 1993–1994, 1996–1997, 2001–2002, 2002–2003Personal Honours:Queensland Roar Gary Wilkins Medal: 2007-2008Queensland Roar Player's Player of the Year: 2007-2008ReferencesExternal linksQueensland Roar profileOz Football profile   Category:People from Sydney Category:People from New South Wales Category:Australians of Irish descent Category:Australian soccer players Category:Australia international footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Australia Category:Footballers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:2001 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2005 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:Rangers F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Borussia Mönchengladbach players Category:Newcastle United F.C. players Category:Queensland Roar players Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Premier League players Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:A-League players Category:First Bundesliga footballers Category:Australian expatriate soccer playersar:كريغ موور de:Craig Moore es:Craig Moore fr:Craig Moore id:Craig Moore it:Craig Moore lt:Craig Moore hu:Craig Moore nl:Craig Moore ja:クレイグ・ムーア no:Craig Moore pl:Craig Moore pt:Craig Moore fi:Craig Moore sv:Craig Moore
