One of her most influential positions was Chef de protocole for Secretary General Boutros-Ghali at the United Nations in New York.From 1995 until 2000 she served as Staatssekretärin in two governments led by Social Democrats Franz Vranitzky and Viktor Klima. When Wolfgang Schüssel became Chancellor of Austria early in 2000 he made Ferrero-Waldner his Minister for Foreign Affairs, a position she held until October 2004, when she was succeeded by Ursula Plassnik.After the G8-Summit in Genoa (July 2001), Ferrero-Waldner was criticized by members of the Publixtheatre Caravan for allegedly not helping them after they had been arrested by Italian police.In January 2004 it was announced that Ferrero-Waldner would run for Federal President to succeed Thomas Klestil in July 2004. Her candidature was supported by the Austrian People's Party; her only opponent was Heinz Fischer. However, she lost the election on April 25.In late July 2004 Ferrero-Waldner was nominated the successor of Franz Fischler as Austria's European Commissioner. She took office on November 22. Her portfolio is Foreign Affairs and European Neighbourhood Policy.As the EU's External Affairs Commissioner, Ms. Ferrero-Waldner is credited with being the key diplomat in the July 24, 2007 release of 5 Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor imprisoned by Libya. They had been held more than 8 years on charges of purposefully infecting children with HIV, and have continued to profess their innocence. The commissioner made many trips to Libya and met with the prisoners regularly.

However, their marriage ended in divorce. In 1993 Waldner married Francisco Ferrero Campos, a lecturer in Spanish and Latin American literature at the University of Vienna.After her previous marriage had finally been annulled Ferrero-Waldner married her husband again in church in December 2003. Although the wedding was a private ceremony, the news was immediately leaked to the press. This, some of Ferrero-Waldner's critics claimed, was done intentionally to attract potential voters as the Austrian Federal President is directly elected and Austria is a predominantly Roman Catholic country rooted in tradition. The couple do not have any children.Ferrero-Waldner's determinedly friendly smile has earned her the nickname Ferrero-Küsschen ("Ferrero Kiss"), after a sweet similar to Ferrero Rocher, produced by Ferrero for the Austrian, German and Swiss markets.ReferencesExternal linksOfficial website of EU Commissioner Ferrero-WaldnerBorn between Salzburg and Braunau am Inn        Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Austrian diplomats Category:Austrian women in politics Category:Austrian Roman Catholics Category:Foreign ministers of Austria Category:European Commissioners Category:Austrian European Commissioners Category:People from Salzburgbg:Бенита Фереро-Валднер ca:Benita Ferrero-Waldner cs:Benita Ferrero-Waldner de:Benita Ferrero-Waldner et:Benita Ferrero-Waldner es:Benita Ferrero-Waldner eo:Benita Ferrero-Waldner fr:Benita Ferrero-Waldner nl:Benita Ferrero-Waldner no:Benita Ferrero-Waldner pl:Benita Ferrero-Waldner pt:Benita Ferrero-Waldner fi:Benita Ferrero-Waldner
