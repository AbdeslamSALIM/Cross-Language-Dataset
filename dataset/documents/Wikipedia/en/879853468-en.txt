Logo and uniforms  Except for color changes, the Chargers have basically used the logo of an arc-shaped lightning bolt since the team debuted in 1960. During its period in the AFL, the club also used a shield logo that featured a horsehead, a lightning bolt, and the word "Chargers".From 1960 to 1973, the colors consisted of either Electric blue ("sky" or "powder" blue, but technically called Collegiate blue) or white jerseys, both with gold lightning bolts on the shoulders. The helmets were white and had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966.In 1974, the sky blue was changed to dark royal blue. The helmet was also changed to dark blue and the players' numbers were removed. From 1978 through 1983, the Chargers wore their white jerseys at home, coinciding with the hiring of coach Don Coryell, but Coryell switched the Chargers to their blue jerseys at home starting in 1984. With the exception of the 1991 season and other sporadic home games since, San Diego wears its blue jerseys at home.In 1985, the Chargers started using navy blue and returned to wearing white pants. The team's uniform design was next revamped in 1988. It featured an even darker shade of navy blue. The lightning bolts on the jerseys and helmets were white with gold trim. In 1990, the team started to wear navy pants with their white jerseys. From 1988 through '91, the club displayed stripes down the pants rather than lightning bolts. The Chargers went with all-white combinations in 1997 and 2001, only to have the blue pants make a comeback. On October 27, 2003, the Chargers wore their navy pants with their navy jersey for a Monday Night Football game versus the Miami Dolphins that was played at Sun Devil Stadium, then the home of the Arizona Cardinals, due to wildfires in southern California. This remains the only game in which the Chargers have worn the all-dark combination.From the late 1980's to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during preseason games and dark for regular season games. In 2001, the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for preseason games and white uniforms in September home games due to the heat before switching back to dark in October. Since 2002, the Chargers have used the early-1960s uniform design as alternate jerseys, which many football fans (both of the Chargers and of other teams) wish to bring back full-time. Right now, the team will continue to use a variation of them (see below) as an alternate jersey.On March 9, 2007, the Chargers unveiled on their web site their first uniform redesign since 1988. The team formally unveiled this new uniform set, which will mix old and new styles, in a private team-only event on March 14. Navy blue remains the primary color on the home jersey, but the familiar lightning bolt was reverted to yellow, but now with navy and Collegiate (powder) blue trim, the latter color a nod to the 1960s uniforms and has been moved to the sides of the shoulders from the top, and includes a new numbering font and word mark in white with yellow and light blue trim. The pants also will have a redesigned lightning bolt in yellow with light blue trim on a navy stripe. Additionally, the team pays tribute to other uniform features from their history by wearing a metallic white helmet with a navy face mask with the newly revamped bolt in yellow with navy, white and light blue trim and white pants. The road white jerseys with navy pants and alternate light blue jerseys to be worn with white pants have also been redesigned with the new scheme.Season-by-season recordsPlayers of noteCurrent rosterPro Football Hall of FamersLance AlworthFred DeanDan FoutsSid GillmanCharlie JoinerDeacon JonesJohn MackeyRon MixJohnny UnitasKellen WinslowRetired numbers14 Dan Fouts, Quarterback, 1973-8719 Lance Alworth, Wide receiver, 1962-1970Chargers Hall of FameThe Chargers have a team Hall of Fame with the following members:56 Emil Karas, Linebacker, 1960-66, inducted 197655 Frank Buncom, Linebacker, 1962-68, inducted 197653 Bob Laraba, Linebacker, 1960-61, inducted 197638 Jacque MacKinnon, Running back, 1961-69, inducted 197619 Lance Alworth, Wide receiver, 1962-70, inducted 197774 Ron Mix, Offensive tackle, 1960-69, inducted 197823 Paul Lowe, Running back, 1960-68, inducted 1979Barron Hilton, team founder-owner, 1960-66, inducted 198022 Keith Lincoln, Running back, 1961-68, inducted 198077 Ernie Ladd, Defensive tackle, 1961-65, inducted 198178 Walt Sweeney, Guard, 1963-69, inducted 198121 John Hadl, Quarterback, 1962-72, inducted 198350 Chuck Allen, Linebacker, 1961-69, inducted 198427 Gary Garrison, Wide receiver, 1966-76, inducted 1985Sid Gillman, head coach, 1961-69 & 1971, inducted 198586 Earl Faison, Defensive end, 1961-66, inducted 198614 Dan Fouts, Quarterback, 1973-87, inducted 199318 Charlie Joiner, Wide receiver, 1976-86, inducted 1993Don Coryell, head coach, 1978-86, inducted 199445 Speedy Duncan, Cornerback, 1964-70, inducted 199570 Russ Washington, Offensive tackle, 1968-82, inducted 199580 Kellen Winslow, Tight end, 1979-87, inducted 1995George Pernicano, team executive, since 1961, inducted 19966 Rolf Benirschke, Kicker, 1978-87, inducted 199722 Gill Byrd, Cornerback 1983-92, inducted 199879 Gary &quot;Big Hands&quot; Johnson, Defensive tackle, 1975-84, inducted 199963 Doug Wilkerson, Guard, 1971-84, inducted 200089 Wes Chandler, Wide receiver, 1981-87, inducted 200112 Stan Humphries, Quarterback, 1992-97, inducted 2002Bobby Ross, head coach, 1992-96, inducted 200274 Louie Kelcher, Defensive tackle, 1975-83, inducted 200362 Don Macek, Center, 1976-89, inducted 200467 Ed White, Guard, 1978-85, inducted 2004Alworth, Mix, Hadl, Joiner, Coryell, Gillman, Garrison, Fouts, White, Winslow, Faison, Benirschke, Lincoln, Washington, Humphries, Ladd and Wilkerson are also members of the "San Diego Hall of Champions", which is open to athletes from the San Diego area as well as those who played for San Diego-based professional and collegiate teams.Other Players that made a major impact in the NFLGary Anderson - Running BackDarren Bennett - PunterDavid Boston - Wide ReceiverDrew Brees - QuarterbackStan Brock - Offensive LineWillie Buchanon - CornerbackMarion Butts - Running BackJohn Carney - KickerDarren Carrington - SafetyCurtis Conway - Wide ReceiverRodney Culver - Running BackFred Dean - Defensive EndTim Dwight - Wide ReceiverDonnie Edwards - LinebackerMiller FarrDoug Flutie - QuarterbackMike Fuller - SafetyDennis Gibson - LinebackerDarrien Gordon - CornerbackJim Harbaugh - QuarterbackRonnie Harmon - Running BackJames HarrisRodney Harrison - SafetyJohn Jefferson - Wide ReceiverJack Kemp - QuarterbackLinden KingWoodrow LowePaul MaguireTony Martin - Wide ReceiverNatrone Means - Running BackEric Metcalf - Return Specialist/Wide ReceiverChuck Muncie - Running BackLeslie O'Neal - Defensive EndDickie PostGary Plummer - LinebackerAlfred Pupunu - Tight EndRick Redman - linebackerStanley Richard - SafetySean Salisbury - QuarterbackJunior Seau - LinebackerBilly ShieldsBilly Ray Smith - LinebackerMarcellus Wiley - Defensive EndDon WoodsErnie Wright - Offensive LineWilbur YoungCoaches of noteHead coachesSid Gillman (1960-1969)Charlie Waller (1969-1970)Harland Svare (1971-1973)Ron Waller (1973)Tommy Prothro (1974-1978)Don Coryell (1978-1986)Al Saunders (1986-1988)Dan Henning (1989-1991)Bobby Ross (1992-1996)Kevin Gilbride (1997-1998)June Jones (interim) (1998)Mike Riley (1999-2001)Marty Schottenheimer (2002-2006)Norv Turner (2007-Present)Current staffRadio and televisionThe Chargers' flagship station is KIOZ 105.3FM, commonly known as "Rock 1053." Josh Lewin and Hank Bauer comprise the broadcast team. Past Chargers radio broadcasters have included Tom Kelly, Lee &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Hamilton, Dan Rowe and Ted Leitner. Most preseason games are televised on KFMB in San Diego and KCBS in Los Angeles. The announcers were Ron Pitts and Billy Ray Smith.Since the Los Angeles market is within the Chargers' 75-mile radius (which prohibits broadcasts of Charger games on national radio during the regular season), the Chargers Radio Network has a secondary flagship station for Los Angeles: KLAC AM-570, in Los Angeles and Orange County. The previous Los Angeles flagship was KSPN AM-710 and before that, KMPC AM-1540 for several years.Dennis Packer, the public address announcer of all USC football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, serves as the P.A. announcer of all Charger home games at Qualcomm Stadium.Notes and referencesExternal linksSan Diego Chargers official web siteSan Diego Chargers Jersey EvolutionSan Diego Chargers Fan Blog &amp; Forum    Category:San Diego Chargers Category:Sports clubs established in 1960 Category:American Football League Category:National Football League teams Category:Sports in San Diego, Californiada:San Diego Chargers de:San Diego Chargers es:San Diego Chargers fr:Chargers de San Diego hi:सैन डिएगो चारजर्स id:San Diego Chargers it:San Diego Chargers he:סאן דייגו צ'רג'רס hu:San Diego Chargers nl:San Diego Chargers ja:サンディエゴ・チャージャーズ pl:San Diego Chargers pt:San Diego Chargers ru:Сан-Диего Чарджерс simple:San Diego Chargers fi:San Diego Chargers sv:San Diego Chargers uk:Сан-Дієго Чарджерс zh:圣地牙哥电光
