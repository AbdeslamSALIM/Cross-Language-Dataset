 The Philokalia (Gk. φιλοκαλείν "Love of the Beautiful") is a collection of texts by masters of the Eastern Orthodox, hesychast tradition, writing from the fourth to the fifteenth centuries on the disciplines of Christian prayer and a life dedicated to God. The work was compiled by St. Nikodemos of the Holy Mountain and St. Makarios of Corinth.In the introduction of Palmer, Sherrard, and Ware's translation of the collection into English, Philokalia is defined as, "love of the beautiful, the exalted, the excellent, understood as the transcendent source of life and the revelation of Truth." The original authors were mostly monks, whose striving for purification of the heart and spiritual perfection are recurring themes in the Philokalia.Although these works were widely known before their initial publication in the Greek language in 1782, they have since been published in this collection in many languages, including a seven-volume translation into Russian (Dobrotolyubie) by St. Theophan the Recluse in the nineteenth century. Other than the Bible, and a handful of writings by early Christian Fathers, the Philokalia is by far the most influential and widely admired example of Eastern Orthodox piety in print today. It is featured prominently in another much shorter well-known book called The Way of a Pilgrim, in which a Russian traveler learns to pray from various people he meets on his travels and by reading the Philokalia.Texts of the PhilokaliaSaint Isaiah the SolitaryOn Guarding the Intellect: Twenty-Seven TextsEvagrios the SolitaryOutline Teaching on Asceticism and Stillness in the Solitary LifeTexts on Discrimination in respect of Passions and ThoughtsExtracts from the Texts on WatchfulnessOn Prayer: 153 TextsSaint John CassianOn the Eight VicesOn the Holy Fathers of Sketis and on DiscriminationSaint Mark the AsceticOn the Spiritual Law: 200 TextsOn Those who Think that They are Made Righteous by Works: 226 TextsLetter to Nicolas the SolitarySaint Hesychios the PriestOn Watchfulness and HolinessSaint Neilos the AsceticAscetic DiscourseSaint Diadochos of PhotikiOn Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination: 100 TextsSaint John of KarpathosFor the Encouragement of the Monks in India who had Written to Him: 100 TextsAscetic Discourse Sent at the Request of the Same Monks in IndiaSaint Theodoros the Great AsceticA Century of Spiritual TextsTheoretikonSaint Maximus the ConfessorFour Hundred Texts on Love (Foreword to Elpidios the Presbyter)Two Hundred Texts on Theology and the Incarnate Dispensation of the Son of God, Written for ThalassiosVarious Texts on Theology, the Divine Economy, and Virtue and ViceOn the Lord's PrayerThalassios the LibyanOn Love, Self Control, and Life in accordance with the Intellect (written for Paul the Presbyter)Saint John of DamascusOn the Virtues and the VicesA Discourse on Abba PhilemonDiscourseSaint TheognostosOn the Practice of the Virtues, Contemplation and the PriesthoodSaint Philotheos of SinaiForty Texts on WatchfulnessIlias the PresbyterA Gnomic AnthologyTheoretikonTheophanis the Monk (Theophan the Monk)The Ladder of Divine GracesSaint Peter of Damascus (Peter Damascene)Book I: A Treasury of Divine KnowledgeBook II: Twenty-Four DiscoursesSaint Symeon Metaphrastes: Paraphrases of the Homilies of Saint Macarius of EgyptI.
