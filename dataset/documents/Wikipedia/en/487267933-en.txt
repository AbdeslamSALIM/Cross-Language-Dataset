The dollar (ISO 4217 code: SBD) is the currency of the Solomon Islands since 1977. It is normally abbreviated with the dollar sign "$" or, alternatively "SI$" to distinguish it from other dollar-denominated currencies. It is subdivided into 100 cents.HistoryThe Solomon Islands dollar was introduced in 1977, replacing the Australian dollar at par, following independence. Until 1979, the two dollars remained equal. After a period of five months pegged at SI$1.05 = AU$1, the currency floated. Over the next 28 years, and especially during the civil war of 2000-2003, inflation has taken its toll, with the Solomon Islands dollar now equal to 15 Australian cents.CoinsIn 1977, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 cents and 1 dollar. The cent coins were all the same sizes and compositions as the corresponding Australian coins, with the 1 dollar an equilaterally curved heptagonal coin minted in cupro-nickel. In 1985, bronze-plated steel replaced bronze in the 1 and 2 cents, with nickel-clad steel replacing cupro-nickel in the 10 and 20 cents in 1990. 1990 also saw the introduction of 50 cents coins, which were dodecagonal and minted in cupro-nickel. The 1 and 2 cents were last minted in 1987 and no longer circulate.All the coins of the Solomon Islands bear the portrait of the country's head of state, Queen Elizabeth II.BanknotesIn 1977, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 2, 5 and 10 dollars, with 20 dollars notes added in 1981. 50 dollars notes were introduced in 1986, followed by 100 dollars in 2006.. A polymer two dollar banknote was issued in 2001 to replace the cotton fibre issue, but the banknote was reverted back to cotton in the 2006 series.See alsoEconomy of the Solomon IslandsReferences External links Category:Economy of the Solomon Islandsast:Dólar de les Islles Salomón be-x-old:Даляр саламонавых выспаў ca:Dòlar de les illes Salomó de:Salomonen-Dollar el:Δολάριο Νήσων Σολομώντα es:Dólar de las Islas Salomón fr:Dollar des îles Salomon ko:솔로몬 제도 달러 bpy:সলোমন আইসল্যান্ডস ডলার it:Dollaro delle Salomone he:דולר איי שלמה lt:Saliamono salų doleris hu:Salamon-szigeteki dollár nl:Salomon-dollar pl:Dolar Wysp Salomona ru:Доллар Соломоновых Островов sv:Salomondollar tg:Долари Ҷазираҳои Соломон zh:所罗门群岛元
