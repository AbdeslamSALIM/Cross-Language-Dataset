 Foz do Iguaçu () is the 4th largest city of Paraná state, Brazil and the 11th largest of the Brazil's Southern region, with a population of 309,000 habitants . It is located approximately 650&nbsp;km (400&nbsp;mi) west of Curitiba, Parana's capital city. The inhabitants of the city are known as iguaçuenses. It is situated at .Economy[[Image:Cataratas027.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Iguaçu falls.]]  ]] The city is one of the most visited by tourists in Brazil. Most tourists are Brazilians and Argentinians, but Americans, British, Germans, Italians, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese and Chinese tourists are also numerous. The city has about 100 hotels and inns. The main attractions are:The Iguassu Falls, (with a flow capacity equal to three Niagara Falls). Part of the falls are in the Brazilian side, others (including the "Garganta do Diabo" (Devil's Throat in Portuguese), the tallest of the falls, 97&nbsp;m,  high) are in the Argentinian side.Parque Nacional do Iguaçu (Iguazu National Park), in both Brazil and Argentina, where the falls are. It is protected by the IBAMA.Itaipu Dam, the largest generator of hydro-electric power in the world, in the Parana river, between Brazil and Paraguay.The Tríplice Fronteira (Triple Frontier) location where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet. Each side has its own Marco (landmark).The Omar Ibn Al-Khattab mosque, the largest outside Middle East.The Bird Park (Parque das Aves), with a reasonably big collection of wild birds, and the "Bosque Guarani", the city's zoo.The Itaipu Dam produces about 20% of Brazil's electricity needs, and employs (directly and indirectly) about 5000 Iguaçuenses.Many people who live in the city work in its neighbor, Ciudad del Este. All trade between Brazil and Paraguay uses the Friendship Bridge (called Ponte da Amizade in Brazil). There is another bridge, the Fraternity Bridge (Ponte da Fraternidade, or Ponte Tancredo Neves, in Brazil), which connects Foz do Iguaçu with its Argentinian neighbor, Puerto Iguazú. The Fraternity Bridge, however, is far less important than the Friendship Bridge. Recently, the Friendship Bridge has faced problems such as traffic congestion as well as protests and blockades.The city is strategically positioned, seeing its position in Mercosul, and it is expected that its importance will increase following the formation of the SACN (South Community of Nations).Foz do Iguaçu has few industries apart from electrical energy generation; mostly, basic textiles. Because of the importance of tourism, domestic and international crises can affect the city's economy through reducing tourist numbers and by bringing fewer consumers to Ciudad del Este (a duty-free city where Brazilians import cheaper goods from Paraguay).HistoryIn 1549, a Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca, found the falls while trailing down the river. Very impressed, he named them "Quedas de Santa Maria". But later the name changed to Quedas del Iguazu, this name is a native name from the Guarani Indians who once lived there.Until 1860, it was in Paraguayan territory, but given its defeat in the War of the Triple Alliance, and big loses of territory to the winners, the falls passed to Brazilian control in the north side and Argentinian control in the south side.The region was almost uninhabited, there was only a military colony until 1897, with the creation of a postal office in the region. Given the little attention of the political authorities, the region was very predated by foreigners, mainly Argentinians.In 1910, the colony's status was upgraded to the position of "vila" (town or village), named "Vila Iguazu", and, in 1914, to city. At that time, the city was known as Foz do Iguassu.In 1916, Alberto Santos-Dumont visited the region and, impressed with the beauties of the region, suggested more attention of the government to the area and asked for the appropriation of the land where currently is the Parque do Iguaçu (Iguazu Park). Until 1917, this region had an owner, Jezus Val. The state appropriated the land in the next year, and, in 1939, the Parque Nacional do Iguaçu was created.In 1945, an agreement between the Brazilian Academy of Letters and the Academy of Lisbon changed the city name to Foz do Iguaçu.The city experienced a big economical boom in the 1960s to the late 1980s, first with the construction of the Friendship Bridge, concluded in 1965, and the Itaipu Dam, finished in the beginning of the 1990s. However, the city suffered with the world economy's recession, that resulted in fewer tourists and fewer consumers of Ciudad del Este's imported goods.In 2004, the city's economy started again to grow up, after a long time of recession.On October 19, 2005, a proposal was made to adjust the city name to: Foz do Iguassu. The proposal was approved in a first debate and then rejected in a second debate, at the Town Hall (Câmara Municipal), by four votes for and eight against. The bill was initiated by city councillor Djalma Pastorello, of the PSDB. The purpose of the adjustment to the city name was to return the spelling to the original form, as at the foundation of the city in 1914. The change occurred due language reforms of 1945, which changed the orthography of Brazilian Portuguese; however, existing proper names were not obliged to change. Another reason for the proposed adjustment back to the original was that 146 of the 198 member countries of the United Nations do not have the "ç" character in their alphabets. The adjustment would therefore rationalise any search for the city in search engines, since Foz do Iguaçu's claim to fame world wide is due almost entirely to the falls, which are known as the Iguassu Falls. Djalma Pastorello felt that tourism to the city of Foz do Iguaçu would be improved greatly by a clarification of its association with the now-famous Iguassu Falls. However, he estimates that 70% of the city's population were against the name change because the local media anticipated the change and presented it in a distorted way, so that locals were unable to see that the intention was to benefit the population.PopulationThe city has a population of 309,000 inhabitants, whilst the Triplice Fronteira (Tri Frontier) region (Ciudad del Este, Hernandarias, Puerto Iguazú and the rural areas included within those municipalities) has a total of 820,000. The city is very heterogeneous, with many immigrant communities, such as: Arabs, Chinese, Germans, Italians, Lebanese, Paraguayans, Argentines, Palestinians, French, Swedes, Portuguese and Ukrainians.The city has the second largest Chinese community in Brazil (approx. 55,000, and second only to São Paulo), and the third largest Islamic community (approx. 80,000, after São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).The city is predominantly Roman Catholic, Protestant and Spiritist, but a relatively large minority of Muslims and Buddhists are represented in the city as well. The city itself has a large mosque (the largest outside the Middle East) and a Buddhist temple (the largest in Brazil).Fenartec is an annual event held in the city's convention centre commemorating the city's multicultural diversity, usually in May.ClimateThe climate of Foz do Iguaçu is sub-tropical, with two distinctive seasons; one humid and hot in the summer and another, dry and cool, in the winter. The city's annual average temperature is 23.8°C (74.8°F), but can be as high as 47°C (117°F) in the summer (highest) or as low as -5°C (23°F) in the winter (lowest). The average in the summer is 26.5°C (79.7°F)and in the winter 15.4°C (59.6°F).The climate of the city is generally hot or warm throughout the year, due to the relatively low altitude (standing only 173&nbsp;m, , above sea level).Generally, the city is sunny during the year, but rain is fairly common during the spring and in the summer. The weather of the city, however, changes very constantly, because the region where the city stands is the zone where frequently three fronts meet. As consequence, it is not uncommon to see temperatures as high as 35°C (95°F) and in the summer as low as 8°C (46°F) in the city and, frequently, thunderstorms.TransportFoz do Iguaçu is connected to the east by the BR-277, to Paranaguá, and also to the east by the Friendship Bridge to Ciudad del Este, and to the south to Puerto Iguazú by the Fraternity Bridge. Both the BR-277 and the Friendship Bridge are very busy roads, linking Paraguay to the Paranaguá's seaport.The city has an international airport, the Foz do Iguaçu International Airport(IGU), which served around 600,000 passengers in 2003.Public TransportThe city does not operate its own municipal transport networks, but instead licenses four private bus companies to operate services on its behalf. The bus fares are set by the municipality for all four companies. In 2003, the city initiated an integrated city fare and created a hub near the city centre. Now, most of the bus routes pass through this hub and passengers pay a standard fare within the city zone, which enables them to transfer routes, even when these may be operated by another company. The transport network extends to certain distant areas, such as the city's airport and the Iguazu Park, but not between the city and its neighbor Ciudad del Este, nor with Puerto Iguazú, which are serviced by other companies. These routes are not part of the integrated network, a situation reflected by higher fares.Informal TransportationEvery day, hundreds of vans act as commuter vehicles for people whose earnings are based in the informal economy (mainly smuggling). This worsens the traffic problems in the Friendship Bridge, where they act, and are claimed to increase the deficits of Brazilian commerce with smuggling and crime rates near the bridge.Avenida Brasil (Brazil Avenue)Since Foz do Iguaçu's foundation, Brazil Avenue is the city's main road. While during its early years the street was primarily the military headquarters' location (now they are just in the right beginning of the Avenue), nowadays the street is a very active place where many retail stores are located. It is located at the downtown of the city and it is 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) long (of which 3&nbsp;km, , is arterial road).As of 2004, the prefecture of the city decided that a major revitalization of "Avenida Brasil" (Brazil Avenue) was needed. Attracting many consumers from many different areas of the city and even from its neighbours Ciudad del Este and Puerto Iguazú, the avenue, wide enough only to support two cars side-by-side, is frequently used during business days, and even more in important holidays (Christmas, Children's day, Easter, Mother's day, with many cars competing for a parking space.The revitalization proposals asks for removal of parking space, giving major attention to pedestrians. Also, the avenue would be wide enough only to support one car side-by-side. The project started at the end of 2004, and by 2006 was concluded. The avenue does not have a bus route, by municipal order.Social Care &amp; ProblemsHealth and education are two extremes in the city. Recently, in a survey, citizens declared that public education and transport (particular companies, although heavily subsidized) as the strongest points of the city. Citizens gave emphasis to the effort that the prefecture is doing in transportation and daycare.Foz do Iguaçu has a Human Development Index of approximately ~0.890 (high).EducationThe city has a literacy rate of 95.5%, with most children attending public or private schools. Public education has been a priority of the municipality of the city and the government of the state of Paraná; however, most middle and high classes families, kept in sending their children in particular schools.The city has six colleges,Cesufoz, UDC, Uniamérica, Unifoz, Unioeste and Anglo-Americano Faculdades., approximately 30 private schools and approximately 120 public schools (including daycare and kindergarten schools).HealthAs most Brazilian cities, health care in Foz is either public or private. While the private system provides the city's middle and elite classes with a rather good, modern and reliable health care, the public system is completely efficient and sufficient to suit the demand of the lower income or very poor classes (which compose 40% of the city's population).SanitationSanepar is responsible for water treatment, distribution and sewage. 98% of the population has access to clean water, and 90% to public sanitary services (sewer and/or garbage collection). Most of the sanitary problems in the city are over.Crime &amp; UnemploymentBecause of economic depression and Real exchange-rate depreciation in recent years, unemployment is about 15% and criminality rates are high. Approximately 20% of the population is living in poverty, a lot of them in slums along the Paraná River. Crime rate is very low in the downtown core and in other areas of tourist interest. Figures for 2006 show Foz do Iguaçu recording 326 intentional homicides, a rate of 106 per 100,000 inhabitants.The Brazilian Federal Police has increased its operations in the region for the last few decades, although its staff did not meet the local needs. This led to a moderate reduction of 45% in smuggled goods value between 1999 and 2004. Some locals blame the stronger law enforcement by the crisis and economic decline of the city. Meanwhile, Brazilian commercial laws have always allowed importing as long as the taxes were properly paid.In 2004 and 2005, the Friendship Bridge was blocked several times by smugglers and their suppliers, in protest against the Brazilian government's enforcement in area.See alsoCiudad del EstePuerto IguazúIguazu FallsItaipu DamReferencesExternal links Official site of the city.
