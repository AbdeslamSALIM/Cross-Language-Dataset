It was launched in 2003 to fill a gap in Volkswagen's model lineup, below the Sharan large MPV. The vehicle was originally delivered in five- or seven-seat versions, but the five seat version is no longer available in some markets. It can be considered an extended version of the Golf Plus, since their front ends are similar in size, while the Touran's rear overhang is  longer (and therefore a seven-seater, while the Golf Plus is a five-seater). In some regions, such as Japan, the car is called Golf Touran.Of interest, a Hulk-inspired Touran was featured in The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift, driven by Bow Wow's character, Twinkie.The name 'Touran' derives from the combination of 'Tour' and 'Sharan', the bigger MPV by VW.
