The race debuted in 1933 and has evolved in timing, duration and sponsorship. With the Dauphiné Libéré, it is a proving ground for the Tour de France. Like the Tour de France and the Dauphiné Libéré, the Tour de Suisse offers mountain climbs and at least one [time trial. Several winners of the Tour de France have also won the Tour de Suisse, including Eddy Merckx, Lance Armstrong and Jan Ullrich. In 2005 the organizers moved the race to earlier in June.
