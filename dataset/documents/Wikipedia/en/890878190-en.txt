The Rio-Niterói Bridge is a Box girder bridge that connects the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Niterói in Brazil.Construction began symbolically on August 23, 1968, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in their first and thus far only visit to Brazil. Actual work begun in January, 1969, and it opened on March 4, 1974.Its official name is "President Costa e Silva Bridge", in honor of the Brazilian president who ordered its construction. "Rio-Niterói" started as a descriptive nickname that soon became better known than the official name. Today, hardly anyone refers to it by its official name..The bridge was done by a pool of brazilians construction firms. It is 13,290 m (8.25 miles) long - 8,836 m (5.49 miles) over water and the bridge's central span is 72 m (236.22 feet) high in order to allow passage to the hundreds of ships that enter and leave the bay every month. It carries a daily traffic load of approximately 140,000 vehicles, which pay a toll only when entering Niterói of R$3.50 (as of August 2007), about US$2.04 or €1.32. It has 18 access points and eight overpasses.Officially it is part of federal highway BR-101.Since June 1, 1995, it has been under the management of Ponte S.A., under a 20-year concession.External linksOfficial website with live feed from the bridge's surveillance cameras: Ponte S.A. homepageSatellite picture by Google MapsPhoto Gallery driving over the bridgeCategory:Bridges in Brazil Category:Bridges completed in 1974 Category:Toll bridgesde:Rio-Niterói-Brücke es:Puente Río-Niterói fr:Pont Rio-Niterói he:גשר ריו-ניטרוי nl:Rio-Niteróibrug pl:Most Rio-Niterói pt:Ponte Rio-Niterói
