 Rhythmbox is an audio player that plays and helps organize digital music. Originally inspired by Apple's iTunes, it is free software, designed to work well under the GNOME Desktop using the GStreamer media framework. It is currently under active development.FeaturesRhythmbox offers a growing number of features, including:Music playbackPlayback from a variety of digital music sources is supported. The most common playback is music stored locally as files on the computer (the 'Library'). Rhythmbox supports playing streamed Internet radio and podcasts as well. The Replay Gain standard is supported.Searching and sorting of music in the library is supported. Playlists may be created to group and order music. Users may also create 'smart playlists,' ones that are automatically updated (like a database query) based on a customized rule of selection criteria rather than an arbitrary list of tracks. Music may be played back in shuffle (random) mode or repeat mode.Track ratings are supported and used by the shuffle mode algorithm to play higher-rated tracks more often.Music importingAudio CD ripping (requires the optional Sound Juicer package)Comprehensive audio format support through GStreameriPod support (experimental)Audio CD burningSince the 0.9 release, Rhythmbox can create audio CDs from playlists.Album Cover displaySince the 0.9.5 release, Rhythmbox can display cover art of the currently playing album.
