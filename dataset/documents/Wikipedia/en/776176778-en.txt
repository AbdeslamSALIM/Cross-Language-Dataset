Daman and Diu (Gujarati: દમણ અને દિવ, Marathi: दमण आणि दीव, Portuguese: Damão e Diu) is a union territory in India.For over 450 years, these coastal enclaves on the Arabian Sea coast were part of Portuguese India, along with Goa and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Goa, Daman, and Diu were incorporated into the Republic of India on December 19, 1961, by military conquest; Portugal did not recognize the Indian annexation of these territories until 1974. Goa, Daman, and Diu were administered as part of a single union territory until 1987, when Goa was granted statehood, leaving Daman and Diu as a separate union territory; each enclave constitutes one of the union territory's two districts.Gujarati and, to a much lesser extent, Marathi are the officialThe Goa, Daman and Diu Official Language Act, 1987 and main languagesTourism of India: Daman and Diu Daman &amp; Diu. The use of Portuguese goes on declining because it is no longer official nor taught at school, though a number of elder people can still understand it, some even preferring it for discourse at home. In addition to standard Portuguese, there are two also shrinking Portuguese-based creole languages in Daman (known as Língua da Casa, "Home Language") and Diu (Língua dos Velhos, "Elders' Language"). English is increasingly accepted for official purposes. ]]DistrictsDiuDaman District, alltogether an area of 50 sq&amp;nbsp;mi or 130 km².It should be noted that Daman refers only to the city, which lies in the larger Daman District.EconomyDaman and Diu's gross state domestic product for 2004 is estimated at $156 million in current prices.See alsoDaman OnlineBattle of DiuDamaniaInvasion of GoaExternal linksDaman Administration's Official WebsiteDaman Online WebsiteDiu Tourism's Official WebsiteDaman and Diu at wikitravelCommissioner Linguistic Minorities; 42nd Report; July 2003 to June 2004Notes    Category:Former Portuguese colonies Category:Daman and Diubn:দমন ও দিউ zh-min-nan:Daman kap Diu ca:Daman i Diu cs:Daman a Diu da:Daman og Diu de:Daman und Diu dv:ދަމަން އާއި ދީވު et:Daman ja Diu es:Damán y Diu eo:Damano kaj Diuo fr:Daman et Diu gu:દમણ અને દીવ hi:दमन और दीव bpy:দমন বারো দিউ id:Daman dan Diu it:Daman e Diu he:דאמאן ודיו kn:ದಮನ್ ಮತ್ತು ದಿಯು ka:დამანი და დიუ ml:ദമന്‍, ദിയു nl:Daman en Diu ja:ダマン・ディーウ連邦直轄地域 no:Daman og Diu nn:Daman og Diu pl:Daman i Diu pt:Damão e Diu ru:Даман и Диу simple:Daman and Diu sk:Daman a Diú sr:Даман и Диу sh:Daman i Diu fi:Daman ja Diu sv:Daman and Diu ta:தமன் தியூ te:డామన్ డయ్యు zh:达曼-第乌
