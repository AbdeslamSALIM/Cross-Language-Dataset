Enschedé | printer_website = www.joh-enschede.nl The guilder () is the currency of the Netherlands Antilles. It is subdivided into 100 cents (Dutch plural form: centen).NamingIn the local language of Aruba, Bonaire and Curaçao, Papiamentu, the guilder is called a "florin"Ratzlaff, Betty. Papiamentu/Ingles Dikshonario, second print, pg. 81, ISBN 99904-0-030-X. The ISO-4217 code, ANG, is derived from Netherlands Antilles Guilder, while the currency symbol, NAFl, is derived from Netherlands Antilles florin.HistoryIn the 18th century, the Dutch guilder circulated in the Netherlands Antilles. This was supplemented in 1794 by an issue of coins specific for the Dutch holdings in the West Indies. At this time, the guilder was subdivided into 20 stuiver.Between 1799 and 1828, the reaal circulated on the islands, with 1 reaal = 6 stuiver or 3⅓ reaal = 1 guilder. The Dutch guilder was reintroduced in 1828, now subdivided into 100 cents. When currency began once more to be issued specifically for use in the Netherlands Antilles, it was issued in the name of Curaçao, with the first banknotes and coins, denominated in the Dutch currency, introduced in 1892 and 1900, respectively. The name "Netherlands Antilles" (Nederlandse Antillen) was introduced in 1952.In 1940, following the German occupation of the Netherlands, the link to the Dutch currency was broken, with a peg to the U.S. dollar of 1.88585 guilders = 1 dollar established. The peg was adjusted to 1.79 guilders = 1 dollar in 1971.In 1986, Aruba gained a "status aparte" and thereby left the Netherlands Antilles. Shortly after that, Aruba began to issue its own currency, the Aruban florin, which replaced the Netherlands Antillean guilder at par.CoinsIn 1794, silver coins were issued for use in the Dutch West Indies in denominations of 2 stuiver, ¼, 1 and 3 guilders. After the reintroduction of the Dutch guilder in 1828, some 1 guilder coins were cut into quarters and stamped with a "C" in 1838 to produced ¼ guilder coins.In 1900 and 1901, silver  and ¼ guilder coins were introduced which circulated alongside Dutch coins. Following the separation of the Netherlands Antillean currency from the Dutch, a bronze 1 cent coin was introduced in 1942, followed by a cupro-nickel 5-cent coin in 1943. Bronze 2½ cent and silver 1 and 2½ guilders were introduced in 1944.From 1952, the name "Nederlandse Antillen" appeared on the coins. In 1970, nickel replaced silver, although the 2½ guilder coin was not reintroduced until 1978. Aluminium 1 and 2½ cents were introduced in 1979. In 1989, aluminium 5 cent, nickel-bonded-steel 10, 25 and 50 cents, and aureate-steel 1 and 2½ guilders were introduced. Aureate-steel 5 guilder coins followed in 1998.BanknotesIn 1892, the Curaçaosche Bank introduced notes in denominations of 25 and 50 cents, 1 and 2½ guilders. This was the only issue of the cent denominations. Notes for 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 guilders followed in 1900. The 1 and 2½ guilder notes were suspended after 1920 but reintroduced by the government in 1942 as muntbiljet.From 1954, the name "Nederlandse Antillen" appeared on the reverse of the notes of the Curaçaosche Bank and, from 1955, the muntbiljet (2½ guilders only) was issued in the name of the Nederlandse Antillen. In 1962, the bank's name was changed to the Bank van de Nederlandse Antillen. In 1970, a final issue of muntbiljet was made in denominations of both 1 and 2½ guilders. The 500 guilder note was not issued after 1962.See alsoEconomy of the Netherlands AntillesCentral banks and currencies of the CaribbeanReferences External links Category:Fixed exchange rate Category:Economy of the Netherlands Antillesca:Florí de les Antilles Neerlandeses cs:Gulden Nizozemských Antil de:Antillen-Gulden es:Florín antillano neerlandés fr:Florin des Antilles néerlandaises fy:Antiljaanske gûne hr:Nizozemskoantilski gulden it:Fiorino delle Antille olandesi lt:Olandijos Antilų guldenas hu:Holland antillákbeli forint nl:Antilliaanse gulden no:Antilliansk gylden pl:Gulden antylski sv:Antiller Gulden zh:荷屬安的列斯盾
