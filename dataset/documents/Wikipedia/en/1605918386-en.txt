The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic or the Ukrainian SSR was one of the 15 constituent republics that made up the former Soviet Union from its formation in 1917 to its abolishment in 1991.NameThe first Bolshevik republic declared in December 1917 was called the Soviet Republic of Ukraine (Respublyka Rad Ukrayiny).The third Bolshevik republic of December 1919 was known as the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic. Its Ukrainian initials were УРСС (URSS).In 1936, the republic's name was changed again, along with the names of all other Soviet republics, transposing the second and third words. It would be known from 1936–91 as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, abbreviated Ukrainian SSR, UkrSSR, or UkSSR.The official names in Ukrainian and Russian were:HistoryAfter the break-up of the Russian Empire, several factions sought to create an independent Ukrainian state, alternately co-operating and struggling against each other. Ukrainian Bolsheviks and Mensheviks first participated in the formation of the Ukrainian National Republic (UNR), which initially declared autonomy in 1917, and then independence in 1918.and the consolidation of USSR.

Warfare ensued against the UNR, and a series of alliances and conflicts with anarchists and neo-haydamak bands. The Ukrainian Bolsheviks fared poorly at first, being pushed out of Ukraine altogether, and having the government dissolved for two interludes lasting several months (being reformed on November 20, 1918, and December 21, 1919). Eventually, with the support of the Red Army and local Anarchists, the Ukrainian SSR ended up controlling much of Ukrainian territory after the Polish-Soviet Peace of Riga.On December 30, 1922, along with the Russian, Byelorussian, and Transcaucasian republics, the Ukrainian SSR was one of the founding members of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). In September 1939 the territory of the Ukrainian SSR was expanded to include West Ukraine, formerly under Polish rule. In 1945 the Transcarpathia region, formerly under Czechoslovakian administration was added as well,In 1932 the government inflicted one of the largest national catastrophes in modern history of the Ukrainian nation. A man-made famine known as the Holodomor caused a direct loss of human life estimated between 2.6 and 3.5 million, while numbers as high as 10 million are sometimes cited in the media.Laura Sheeter, &quot;Ukraine remembers famine horror&quot;, BBC News, November 24, 2007The Ukrainian SSR was also the site of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, when a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant melted down and exploded, subjecting countless multitudes to radiological effects.After World War II some amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were accepted, which allowed it to act as a separate subject of international law in some cases and to a certain extent, remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time. In particular, these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the United Nations (UN) together with the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR. In reality this simply meant giving the Soviet Union extra seats (and votes) in the UN, since the Ukrainian SSR had no independent voice in international affairs. The Ukrainian SSR was renamed Ukraine on August 24, 1991. It declared its intention of leaving the Soviet Union the same day, and on December 25, 1991 became fully independent following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.:The unbreakable union of the workers, peasants and intelligentsia is the social base of the USSR]]Leaders of the Ukrainian SSRTerms of the leaders of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, and de facto leaders of the republic: Georgy Pyatakov, 1918Stanislav Kosior, 1919–1920Dmitry Manuilsky, 1921–1923Emmanuil Kviring, 1923–1925Lazar Kaganovich, 1925–1928Stanislav Kosior, 1928–1938Nikita Khrushchev, 1938–1947Lazar Kaganovich, 1947Nikita Khrushchev, 1947–1949Leonid Melnikov, 1949–1953Alexei Kirichenko, 1953–1957Nikolai Podgorny, 1957–1963Petro Shelest, 1963–1972Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, 1972–1989Vladimir Ivashko, 1989–1990Stanislav Gurenko, 1990–1991Administrative divisionsThe administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR changed numerous times throughout its 74-year history. The most common administrative division was the oblast (province) of which there were 25 upon the UkSSR's abolishment in 1991. Most of the UkSSR's oblasts still exist to this day as part of independent Ukraine while one changed its status to an autonomopus republic. (see map).Upon the Ukrainian SSR's formation to 1934, the republic's capital was the city of Kharkiv (Rus. Kharkov) located in the east of the republic. In 1934, the capital was moved from Kharkiv to Kiev (Ukr. Kyiv), which remains the capital of Ukraine today.Other administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR included the two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics which existed during different time periods. The Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic existed from 1924-1940 until it was upgraded to that of a constituent Soviet republic in 1940.The other ASSR was the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic which was formed in 1991 from the former Crimean Oblast, which was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR from the Russian SFSR in 1954. After Ukrainian independence, the Crimean ASSR was renamed the Crimean Autonomous Republic.OblastsReferencesExternal linksCategory:Soviet Republics Category:History of Ukraine Category:Ukrainian Revolution Category:Russian-speaking countries and territories Category:Ukrainian-speaking countries and territories‎ Category:Holodomor Category:Victims of Soviet repressionsaz:Ukrayna Sovet Sosialist Respublikası br:RSS Ukrania bg:Украинска съветска социалистическа република ca:República Socialista Soviètica d'Ucraïna cs:Ukrajinská sovětská socialistická republika cy:Gweriniaeth Sofietaidd yr Wcráin de:Ukrainische SSR et:Ukraina NSV es:República Socialista Soviética de Ucrania eo:Ukraina soveta socialisma respubliko fr:République socialiste soviétique d'Ukraine gv:Pobblaght Hoveidjagh Hoshiallagh ny h-Ookraan gl:República Socialista Soviética de Ucraína ko:우크라이나 소비에트 사회주의 공화국 id:RSS Ukraina it:RSS Ucraina lt:Ukrainos TSR hu:Ukrán Szovjet Szocialista Köztársaság mk:Украинска ССР nl:Oekraïense Socialistische Sovjetrepubliek ja:ウクライナ・ソビエト社会主義共和国 no:Den ukrainske sosialistiske sovjetrepublikk pl:Ukraińska Socjalistyczna Republika Radziecka pt:República Socialista Soviética da Ucrânia ro:Republica Sovietică Socialistă Ucrainiană ru:Украинская Советская Социалистическая Республика sk:Ukrajinská sovietska socialistická republika sr:Украјинска Совјетска Социјалистичка Република fi:Ukrainan sosialistinen neuvostotasavalta sv:Ukrainska SSR vi:Cộng hòa Xã hội Chủ nghĩa Xô viết Ukraina tr:Ukrayna Sovyet Sosyalist Cumhuriyeti uk:Українська Радянська Соціалістична Республіка zh:乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国
