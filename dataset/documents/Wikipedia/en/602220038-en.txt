Casagrande was a professional cyclist between 1992 and 2005.BiographyHe is a proven performer in the Grand Tours and the major one-day races. He wore the leader’s jersey into the penultimate stage of the 2000 Giro d'Italia, but faltered badly and wound up 2nd to fellow Italian Stefano Garzelli. Casagrande did, however, win the King of the Mountains competition and its Maglia verde (or green jersey) in the race.In major one-day races, he has won the Clásica de San Sebastián in 1998 and 1999, followed by the 2000 editions of the La Flèche Wallonne and Subida a Urkiola. Also in 1999, he placed 4th in the World Cycling Championships Road Race behind Óscar Freire, Marcus Zberg, and Jean-Cyril Robin.In his early career, Casagrande won the 1996 Tirreno-Adriatico and Vuelta al País Vasco &mdash; both one-week stage races.Casagrande also scored victories at the 2001 and 2002 Giro del Trentino and the 2002 Settimana Ciclistica Internazionale Coppi-Bartali.Casagrande is one of the most consistent performers in the past few years and has been in the final stages of numerous races. Lacking a strong sprint, however, has kept Casagrande from more victories.Palmarés52 career victories including: Major winsClásica de San Sebastián (1998, 1999)La Flèche Wallonne (2000)Tour de Suisse (1999)Giro del Trentino (2001, 2002)Tirreno-Adriatico (1996)Vuelta al País Vasco (1996)Tour of Tuscany (1994)Tour of Emilia (1994)Milan-Turin (1994)Tour of the Apennines (1995)Coppa Agostoni (2001, 2003)Tour de Suisse (2003)1 stage winGiro d'Italia2 stage winsMaglia verde King of the Mountains12 days in Maglia rosaRunner-upGiro d'Italia (2000)Giro di Lombardia (2000)Clásica de San Sebastián (2001)Giro del Lazio (1999)HEW Cyclassics (2000)Giro del Veneto (1999, 2000)Tour of Emilia (2001, 2004)See alsoList of doping cases in cyclingList of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences Category:1970 births Category:People from Florence Category:Living people Category:Italian cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Italy Category:Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:Doping cases in cyclingca:Francesco Casagrande da:Francesco Casagrande de:Francesco Casagrande es:Francesco Casagrande fr:Francesco Casagrande it:Francesco Casagrande nl:Francesco Casagrande no:Francesco Casagrande pl:Francesco Casagrande fi:Francesco Casagrande sv:Francesco Casagrande vec:Francesco Casagrande
