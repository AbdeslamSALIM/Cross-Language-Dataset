The Oaths of Strasbourg (Modern French: les serments de Strasbourg, Modern German: die Straßburger Eide, Latin Sacramenta Argentariae) is the name by which we know the pledges of allegiance taken in 842 at Strasbourg by Louis the German, son of Louis the Pious and ruler of the eastern Frankish kingdom, and by his brother Charles the Bald, ruler of the western Frankish kingdom. As well as their allegiance to each other, Louis and Charles pledged their opposition to the Emperor, their elder brother Lothair.According to our chief source for the meeting, Nithard's De dissensionibus filiorum Ludovici pii (On the Dissensions of the Sons of Louis the Pious), each king swore the oath not in Latin but in the vernacular of the other's kingdom, in front of the assembled armies, which then made their pledge in their own language. One version is in a variety of old Gallo-Romance, the ancestor of Old French; it is one of the first textsLe Serment de Strasbourg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; we have written in a Romance language clearly distinct from Latin. The other version is in Old High German.While linguists are interested in the texts of the oaths themselves, historians have long used this passage to illustrate the theory that, by 842, Carolingian society had begun to split into separate proto-countries with different languages and customs. In recent years, however, another theory has come to the fore: the Frankish Kingdom comprised several regna (loosely translated as kingdoms) that had always maintained different customs and dialects. In support of this theory is the fact that both Charlemagne and Louis the Pious sent their sons to be raised in the regna they were meant to inherit as their primary territory, in order to guarantee the support of the people by being familiar with them and their customs.Nithard's work is preserved in a single manuscript from the 10th or 11th century (Cod. Lat. 9768 in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris), and text of the oaths is on folios 12b2-13b1.The textThe full text with English translationColour-coding:Below, the text in Latin is marked in red; the Romance text in blue; the Old High German text in green.
