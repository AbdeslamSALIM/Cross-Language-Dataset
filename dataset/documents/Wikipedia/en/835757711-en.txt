Tamm, also of the Soviet Union. He received the award for his work in explaining the phenomenon of Cherenkov radiation.Frank graduated from the Moscow State University in 1930. In 1934 Cherenkov discovered that light is emitted by charged particles traveling at very high speeds through water. Frank and Tamm provided the theoretical explanation of this effect, which occurs when the particles travel through an optically transparent medium at speeds greater than the speed of light in that medium. This discovery resulted in the development of new methods for detecting and measuring the velocity of high-speed nuclear particles and became of great importance for research in nuclear physics.Frank's work also included collaboration with Cherenkov and Tamm in research on electron radiation. Frank also specialized in the study of gamma rays and neutron beams. He became head of the department of physics at the Moscow State University in 1944 and was made a member of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. in 1946.External linksIlya Mikhaylovich Frank &amp;ndash; Source and photo Category:1908 births Category:1990 deaths Category:Experimental physicists Category:Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:Nobel laureates in Physics Category:Russian Nobel laureates Category:Russian physicists bn:ইলিয়া ফ্রাংক bg:Иля Франк ca:Ilià Frank de:Ilja Michailowitsch Frank es:Iliá Frank eo:Ilja Frank fr:Ilja Frank gl:Ilya Frank id:Ilya Frank it:Il'ja Michajlovič Frank he:איליה פרנק sw:Ilya Frank ht:Ilya Frank nl:Ilja Frank ja:イリヤ・フランク pl:Ilja Frank pt:Illia Mikhailovich Frank ro:Ilia Frank ru:Франк, Илья Михайлович sl:Ilja Mihajlovič Frank fi:Ilja Frank zh:伊利亚·弗兰克
