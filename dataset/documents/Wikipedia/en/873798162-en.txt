  "My Way" is a song with lyrics written by Paul Anka and popularized by Frank Sinatra. The melody is a French song "Comme d'habitude" composed by Claude François and Jacques Revaux. Anka's English lyrics are unrelated to the original French by Claude François and Gilles Thibaut.ThemesThe lyrics of "My Way" tell the story of a man who is nearing death. As he reflects on his life, he has no regrets for how he lived his life, saying that, until the end, he did things his way.OriginPaul Anka heard the original 1967 French pop song, Comme d'habitude performed by Claude Francois with music by Jacques Revaux and lyrics by Gilles Thibault, while on holiday in the south of France. He flew to Paris to negotiate the rights to the song.http://music.guardian.co.uk/vinylword/story/0,,2129407,00.html How Sinatra did it My Way - via a French pop star and a Canadian lounge act In a 2007 interview, he said: "I thought it was a shitty record, but there was something in it." He acquired publishing rights at no costPaul Anka, &quot;With Paul Anka, 'Rock Swings'&quot;, interviewed on Fresh Air, WHYY, 8 August, 2005 and, two years later, had a dinner in Florida with Frank Sinatra and "a couple of Mob guys" at which Sinatra said he was "quitting the business. I'm sick of it, I'm getting the hell out". Back in New York, Anka re-wrote the original French song for Sinatra, subtly altering the melodic structure and changing the lyrics: "At one o'clock in the morning, I sat down at an old IBM electric typewriter and said, 'If Frank were writing this, what would he say?' And I started, metaphorically, 'And now the end is near.' I read a lot of periodicals, and I noticed everything was 'my this' and 'my that'. We were in the 'me generation' and Frank became the guy for me to use to say that. I used words I would never use: 'I ate it up and spit it out.' But that's the way he talked. I used to be around steam rooms with the Rat Pack guys - they liked to talk like Mob guys, even though they would have been scared of their own shadows." Anka finished the song at 5am. "I called Frank up in Nevada - he was at Caesar's Palace - and said, 'I've got something really special for you.'?" Anka claimed: "When my record company caught wind of it, they were very pissed that I didn't keep it for myself. I said, 'Hey, I can write it, but I'm not the guy to sing it.' It was for Frank, no one else."Frank Sinatra versionReleased on Frank Sinatra's 1969 album My Way, "My Way" was at first a modest hit for Sinatra in the United States, reaching number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart in spring and early summer 1969. However it fared better on the Adult Contemporary chart, reaching number 2.In the United Kingdom, "My Way" was a more immediate hit, reaching number 5 on the UK Singles Chart in Spring 1969 and becoming the year's best-selling single there. Remarkably, the Sinatra "My Way" then re-entered the singles chart six more times during 1970 and 1971, achieving placements between numbers 18 and 39. In all this "My Way" holds the UK Singles Chart record for most total weeks on the chart (124wks), across all these runs.Even beyond chart performance, Sinatra's recording of "My Way" had staying power, and soon became the signature song for the latter stage of his career, even though according to his daughter Tina, "he always thought that song was self-serving and self-indulgent."Sinatra 'loathed' My Way – An article on BBC News It was the closing number on his 1974 concert document The Main Event - Live and is also featured as the penultimate song on his Live from Las Vegas 1986 performance. A DVD of a 1978 Vegas performance of it is included in the Sinatra: Vegas collection.Sinatra also duetted the song with two performers in the last years before his death: Luciano Pavarotti (released on the album Sinatra 80th: Live In Concert) and Willie Nelson (recorded for the Duets series in the mid-1990s but not released until 2005 in the Collector's Edition Set). Both recordings use the same Sinatra vocal and instrumental track.On his 1998 album, A Body of Work, Anka uses Sinatra's original vocal track from 1969 to duet with him on a cover of the song as a tribute to Sinatra, who died that year. The arrangement on the Anka track is completely different from Sinatra's original.Dorothy Squires versionIn the midst of Sinatra's multiple runs on the UK Singles Chart, Welsh singer Dorothy Squires also released a rendition of "My Way", released in Summer 1970. Her recording reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, and itself re-entered the chart twice more during that year.Elvis Presley versionElvis Presley began performing the song in concert during the mid-1970s, in spite of suggestions by Paul Anka, who told him it was not a song that would suit him. Nevertheless, on January 13 and 14 of 1973, Presley sang the song during his satellite show "Aloha from Hawaii", beamed live and on deferred basis ( for European audiences, who also saw it in prime time), to 43 countries via INTELSAT, the first and only time that a single entertainer faced such a worldwide audience. In the continental US, the show was carried by NBC, and shown in primetime on 14 April, thus achieving very high ratings and eventually helping the show reach a worldwide viewership of over 1 billion.On October 3, 1977, several weeks after his death, his live recording of "My Way" (recorded for the "Elvis In Concert" CBS-TV special on June 21, 1977) was released as a single. In the U.S., it reached number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 pop singles chart, number 6 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, and the following year reached number 2 on the Billboard Country singles chart but went all the way to number 1 on the rival Cash Box Country Singles chart. In the UK, it reached number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.Sid Vicious versionSex Pistols' bassist Sid Vicious did a punk rock version of the song. This version, in which a large body of the words were changed and the arrangement was sped up, charted at #7 in the UK in 1978.Interviewed in 2007, Paul Anka said he had been "somewhat destabilised by the Sex Pistols' version. It was kind of curious, but I felt he (Sid Vicious) was sincere about it." Vicious did not know all the lyrics to the song when it was recorded, so he improvised several lyrics. Vicious' reference to a "prat who wears hats" was an insult directed at Vicious' friend John Lydon, who was fond of wearing different kinds of hats he would pick up at rummage sales.An edited version of the Sid Vicious cover is played during the closing credits of the movie Goodfellas.In the album released in conjunction with the second NANA (anime) movie, singer and actress Mika Nakashima did a cover of Sid Vicious' version of the song with what sounds like an audience singing background vocals.Other versionsNina Simone had success with her re-arranged version of the song, released on 1971's Here Comes the Sun, which was more upbeat and melodic, and included a syncopated rhythm highlighted by the addition of conga drums. It became a staple of her live concerts.Brook Benton hit the pop, R&B, and easy listening charts with a recording of the song in 1970.Greta Keller always included the song during her last decade performing and did a duet with Rod McKuen singing the song at Lincoln Center in New York City and in Vienna.U2 regularly performed a snippet of "My Way" at the end of their song "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" during their 1992-1993 Zoo TV Tour.Broadway luminary Patti LuPone performs this song as part of her one-woman show Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda."My Way" is a favorite of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Minuteman Marching Band, which often concludes its performances with the song.Runner up Raymond Quinn from the UK TV series X Factor covered 'My Way' for his album 'Ray Quinn'Bobby Solo does a recording of the song in Italian called "La Mia Strade".Popular Ukrainian rock band Okean Elzy performed the song (the only one of the set in English) during their symphony-accompanied renaissance tour.A black metal version of the song has been performed by the French band Mütiilation on the album 'From the Entrails to the Dirt'.Robbie Williams sang My Way in his concert at the Royal Albert Hall in October 10, 2001. This version of the song was recorded and released in the DVD Live At The AlbertAlternate versionsWhen David Bowie was asked to write English lyrics to "Comme d'habitude" in 1968, the song he came up with was "Even a Fool Learns to Love." However, Paul Anka bought the rights to the original French version, and Bowie's version was never released.
