| subdivs = South BucksChilternWycombeAylesbury ValeMilton Keynes (Unitary) Buckinghamshire (abbreviated Bucks) is a ceremonial and non-metropolitan home county in South East England. The county town is Aylesbury and the largest town in ceremonial Buckinghamshire is Milton Keynes.The area under the control of Buckinghamshire County Council, or shire county, is divided into four districts - Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks and Wycombe. The Borough of Milton Keynes is a unitary authority and forms part of the county for various functions such as Lord Lieutenant but does not come under county council control. The ceremonial county, the area including Milton Keynes borough, borders Greater London, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.History The name Buckinghamshire is Anglo-Saxon in origin and means The district (scire) of Bucca's home. Bucca's home refers to Buckingham in the north of the county, and is named after an Anglo-Saxon landowner. The county has been so named since about the 12th century; however, the county itself has existed since it was a subdivision of the kingdom of Mercia (585&ndash;919).The history of the area, though, predates the Anglo-Saxon period and the county has a rich history starting from the Celtic and Roman periods, though the Anglo-Saxons perhaps had the greatest impact on Buckinghamshire: the geography of the rural county is largely as it was in the Anglo-Saxon period. Later Buckinghamshire became an important political arena, with King Henry VIII intervening in local politics in the 16th century and just a century later the English Civil War was reputedly started by John Hampden in mid-BucksBiography of John Hampden.Historically, the biggest change to the county came in the 19th century, when a combination of cholera and famine hit the rural county, forcing many to migrate to larger towns to find work. Not only did this alter the local economical picture, it meant a lot of land was going cheap at a time when the rich were more mobile and leafy Bucks became a popular rural idyll: an image it still has today. Buckinghamshire is a popular home for London commuters, leading to greater local affluence; however some pockets of relative deprivation remain.Report on deprivation from Wycombe District Council, showing some areas among top 20% of national deprivation figuresGeographyThe county can be split into two sections geographically. The south leads from the River Thames up the gentle slopes of the Chiltern Hills to the more abrupt slopes on the northern side leading to the Vale of Aylesbury, a large flat expanse of land, which includes the path of the River Great Ouse.WaterwaysRiversThe county includes two of the three longest rivers in England. The River Thames forms the southern boundary with Berkshire, which has crept over the border at Eton and Slough meaning the river is no longer the sole boundary between the two counties. The River Great Ouse begins just outside the county in Northamptonshire and flows east through Buckingham, Milton Keynes and Olney.CanalsThe main branch of the grand Union Canal flows through the county as does its arms to Slough, Aylesbury, Wendover (disused) and Buckingham (disused). The canal has been incorporated into Milton Keynes.LandscapeAt  above sea level, the two highest points are Coombe Hill near Wendover, and Haddington Hill in Wendover Woods, Buckinghamshire, near Wendover where a stone marks the summit.Ceremonial countyThe ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire consists of the area administered by Milton Keynes Borough Council as well as that administered by Buckinhamshire County Council. The ceremonial county has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff. Currently the Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire is Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher and the High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire is Amanda Nicholson. The Custos rotulorum has been combined with the duties of Lord Lieutenant since 1702.+ Buckinghamshire DistrictsDistrictMain TownsPopulation (2006 estimate)Population (2007 estimate)AreaPopulation Density (2007)url= http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/bcc/content/index.jsp?contentid=491076174 |title=Population ProjectionsAylesbury ValeAylesbury, Buckingham172,000174,100902.75 km²193/km²213,000WycombeMarlow]]161,300161,400324.57 km²497/km²165,000Chiltern]]'''Amersham, Chesham90,30090,800196.35 km²462/km²89,000South BucksBurnham]]63,70064,300141.28 km²455/km²63,800TOTAL Non-MetropolitanN/A487,300490,6001565 km²313/km²530,800Milton Keynes (borough)Milton Keynes, Newport Pagnell224,800228,400308.63 km²740/km²323,146TOTAL CeremonialN/A712,100719,0001874 km²384/km²853,946Population figures for 2006 from the Office for National Statistics http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=9666&amp;More=Y as are figures for 2007 estimates http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/Mid_2007_UK_England_&amp;_Wales_Scotland_and_Northern_Ireland%20_21_08_08.zip See List of English districts by population for a full list of every English district.As can be seen from the table, the Vale of Aylesbury and borough of Milton Keynes have been identified as growth areas, with a population surge of almost 50,000 people in Aylesbury Vale between 2006 and 2026 and 100,000 people in Milton Keynes within twenty years. The population of Milton Keynes is expected to reach almost 350,000 by 2031.PoliticsBuckinghamshire County Council]] The county council was founded in 1889 with its base in new municipal buildings in Walton Street, Aylesbury (which are still there). In Buckinghamshire, local administration is run on a two-tier system where public services are split between the county council and a series of district councils.In the 1960s the council moved into new premises: a 15-storey tower block in the centre of Aylesbury (pictured) designed by architect Thomas Pooley. Said to be one of the most unpopular and disliked buildings in Buckinghamshire, it is now a Grade II listed building.In 1997 the northernmost part of Buckinghamshire in Milton Keynes Borough separated to form a unitary authority; however for ceremonial and some other purposes Milton Keynes is still considered to be part of Buckinghamshire.Buckinghamshire County Council is a large employer within the County and provides a great variety of services, including education (schools, adult education and youth services), social services, highways, libraries, County Archives and Record Office, County Museum and Roald Dahl Children's Gallery in Aylesbury, consumer services and some aspects of waste disposal and planning.Coat of arms The coat of arms of Buckinghamshire County Council features a white swan in chains. This dates back to the Anglo-Saxon period, when swans were bred in Buckinghamshire for the king's pleasure. That the swan is in chains illustrates that the swan is bound to the monarch, an ancient law that still applies to wild swans in the UK today. The arms were first borne at the Battle of Agincourt by the Duke of Buckingham.Above the swan is a gold band, in the centre of which is Whiteleaf Cross, representing the many ancient landmarks of the county. The shield is surmounted by a beech tree, representing the Chiltern Forest that once covered almost half the county. Either side of the shield are a buck, for Buckingham, and a swan, the county symbol.The motto of the shield says Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum. This is Latin and means 'no stepping back'.The flag of Buckinghamshire, which flies outside County Hall in Aylesbury, comprises red and black halves with a white swan. The flag takes the county emblem which is on the county shield.DemographicsToday Buckinghamshire is ethnically diverse, particularly in the larger towns. At the end of the 19th century some Welsh drover families settled in north Bucks and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, a large number of Londoners in Milton Keynes. Aylesbury has a sizeable Italian population, and Amersham has a large Polish community dating from World War Two. Amersham is twinned with Krynica in Poland. High Wycombe is the most ethnically diverse town in the county, with large Asian and Afro-Caribbean populations. There is also a Polish and Eastern European community.EconomyBuckinghamshire has a modern service-based economy and is part of the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire NUTS-2 region, which was the seventh richest subregion in the European Union in 2002[http://europa.eu.int/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=STAT/05/13&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=en&amp;guiLanguage=en Regional GDP per capita in the EU25 GDP per capita in 2002 ranged from 32% of the EU25 average in Lubelskie to 315% in Inner London] The southern part of the county is a prosperous section of the London commuter belt. The county has fertile agricultural lands, with many landed estates, especially those of the Rothschild banking family of England in the 19th century (see Rothschild properties in Buckinghamshire). Manufacturing industries include furniture-making (traditionally centred at High Wycombe), pharmaceuticals and agricultural processing.This is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Buckinghamshire at current basic prices published by the Office for National Statistics with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling (except GVA index).Office of National Statistics (pp.240-253)YearRegional Gross Value AddedComponents may not sum to totals due to roundingAgricultureincludes hunting and forestryIndustryincludes energy and constructionServicesincludes financial intermediation services indirectly measuredGVA index per personUK average index base = 10019956,008601,7464,20111820008,389451,8636,48112520039,171501,7937,328118In a recent nationwide survey, Buckinghamshire had the highest quality of life in the country, having the highest life expectancy and best education results.Places of interest  The county is also home to the world famous Pinewood Studios.TransportRoadsBuckinghamshire (including Milton Keynes) is served by four motorways, although two are on its borders:M40 motorway - cuts through the south of the county serving towns such as High Wycombe and BeaconsfieldM1 motorway - serves Milton Keynes in the northM25 motorway - passes into Bucks but has only one junction (J16-interchange for the M40)M4 motorway - passes through the very south of the county with only J7 in BucksAlso the A41(M) comes into Buckinghamshire from the east to Aston Clinton.Four important A roads also enter the county (from north to south):A5 - serves Milton KeynesA41 - cuts through the centre of the county, serving AylesburyA40 - parallels M40 through south Bucks and continues to central LondonA4 - serves Taplow in the very southRoad travel east–west is good in the county because of the commuter routes leaving London for the rest of the country. There are no major roads that run directly between the south and north of the county (e.g. between High Wycombe and Milton Keynes).RailBuckinghamshire has several lines running through it, serving many parts of the county. The main train operator in Buckinghamshire is Chiltern Railways which run trains on the Chiltern Main Line and London to Aylesbury Line. Towns served by Chiltern include Aylesbury, High Wycombe, Beaconsfield, Gerrards Cross, and Amersham. Their headquarters is at Aylesbury. Virgin Trains and London Midland provide trains on the West Coast Main Line which runs to the north east of the county serving the town of Milton Keynes. London Underground's Metropolitan Line also serves towns in the south east of the county calling at Amersham and Chesham. There are proposals for a new rail service along the disused Varsity Line which runs right across the north of the county.Settlements+ Largest Towns in Ceremonial Buckinghamshire (2001 census)Townurl=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/ssdataset.asp?vlnk=8271&amp;Pos=2&amp;ColRank=1&amp;Rank=224 |title=KS01 Usual resident population: Census 2001, Key Statistics for urban areas |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=2008-06-18DistrictNotesMilton Keynes184,506Milton Keynes (borough)Unitary Authority since 1997.
