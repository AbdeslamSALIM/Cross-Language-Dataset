As of 1999 he lived in both Monaco and Jyväskylä, married, with two children. Mäkinen is one of the most successful WRC drivers of all time, ranking first in championships (4), tied with Juha Kankkunen and Sébastien Loeb, and fifth in wins (24).He is a four-time World Rally Champion, a series he first won, and then successfully defended, continuously throughout 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, on all occasions driving the Ralliart Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. He also aided Mitsubishi to the 1998 world constructors' title as well as winning the 2000 Race of Champions. Mäkinen's navigators include compatriots Seppo Harjanne and Risto Mannisenmäki, the former retiring from alongside Mäkinen having previously served 1985 champion, and fellow 'Flying Finn', Peugeot's Timo Salonen.CareerMäkinen won the Group N Finnish Rally Championship driving a Lancia Delta HF 4WD in 1988. Mäkinen's first world rally win came on the 1994 1000 Lakes Rally (now Neste Rally Finland), in a Ford Escort RS Cosworth. Mäkinen proved a late developer by the standards of some in rallying circles, only nabbing his first full-time manufacturer seat in a Group A formula Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution Evolution alongside former Group A rally champion Swede Kenneth Eriksson, in 1995 - but success was to prove spontaneous thereafter.A cultured Safari Rally win in 1996 proved the platform on which to build a dominant championship lead, which he consolidated by taking the title in Australia, away from runner-up, Subaru's Colin McRae - a long-time rival. He proceeded to win every drivers' title for Mitsubishi from 1996 to 1999. The Mitsubishi team, with the Finn and young Briton Richard Burns among its driver personnel, also won its sole manufacturers' championship in 1998, while late that same year, the licensed Tommi Mäkinen Rally video game was also released. In 2000, despite opening his campaign with victory on the January Monte Carlo Rally, Mäkinen finally relinquished his grasp on the title, being beaten in the standings by new title holder and fellow Finn, Marcus Grönholm. That year Mitsubishi produced a 'Tommi Mäkinen edition' of the road version of the Lancer Evolution VI to commemorate his previous title successes. This car had a different front bumper than the regular Evolution VI, while some models also featured a red and white paint job to closely resemble Mäkinen's rally car. ..]] Mäkinen remained with Mitsubishi until the end of the 2001 season, having finished third in that year's standings behind Burns and McRae, by now respectively drivers for Subaru and Ford - but not before the inauspicious introduction of team's first ever World Rally Car on the San Remo Rally. Mäkinen and team-mate Freddy Loix struggled with the car before the Finn's crash on the mountainside roads of the following round in Corsica was responsible for breaking co-driver Mannisenmäki's back and in doing so, virtually end his top-line career. The Finn was forced to fare with substitute co-drivers for the remaining events in Australia and Great Britain, the latter of which he retired from, helping Burns to claim the championship.A move to the Prodrive-run Subaru World Rally Team for 2002 as replacement for Burns (who had chosen to drive a works Peugeot 206 WRC alongside Gronholm for his title defence) yielded one more, final career victory, on the 2002 Monte Carlo Rally where a technical infringement committed by on-the-road winner, and emerging talent, Sébastien Loeb, allowed Mäkinen to upstage the Frenchman. But his form then took a dive and he was not to add again to his tally of world titles.He retired from the sport at the end of the 2003 season with third place on that year's Rally Great Britain.WRC victories 44th 1000 Lakes Rally | 1994 | Seppo Harjanne | Ford Escort RS Cosworth |- | 2 |  45th International Swedish Rally | 1996 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 3 |- | 3 |  44th Safari Rally Kenya | 1996 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 3 |- | 4 |  16º Rally Argentina | 1996 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 3 |- | 5 |  46th Neste 1000 Lakes Rally | 1996 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 3 |- | 6 |  9th API Rally Australia | 1996 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 3 |- | 7 |  30º TAP Rallye de Portugal | 1997 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 4 |- | 8 |  33º Rallye Catalunya-Costa Brava (Rallye de España) | 1997 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 4 |- | 9 |  17º Rally Argentina | 1997 | Seppo Harjanne | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 4 |- | 10 |  47th Neste Rally Finland | 1997 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 4 |- | 11 |  47th International Swedish Rally | 1998 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 4 |- | 12 |  18º Rally Argentina | 1998 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 5 |- | 13 |  48th Neste Rally Finland | 1998 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 5 |- | 14 |  40º Rallye Sanremo - Rallye d'Italia | 1998 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 5 |- | 15 |  11th API Rally Australia | 1998 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 5 |- | 16 |  67ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo | 1999 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 17 |  48th International Swedish Rally | 1999 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 18 |  29th Rally New Zealand | 1999 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 19 |  41º Rallye Sanremo - Rallye d'Italia | 1999 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 20 |  68ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo | 2000 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 21 |  69ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo | 2001 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 22 |  35º TAP Rallye de Portugal | 2001 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 23 |  49th Safari Rally Kenya | 2001 | Risto Mannisenmäki | Mitsubishi Lancer Evo 6 |- | 24 |  70ème Rallye Automobile de Monte-Carlo | 2002 | Kaj Lindström | Subaru Impreza WRC |WRC resultsYearEntrantCar1234567891011121314WDCPoints1987]]Tommi MäkinenLancia Delta HF 4WDMON]]SWE]]POR]]KEN]]FRA]]GRC]]USA]]NZL]]ARG]]FINRetCIV]]ITA]]GBR]]-01988Tommi MäkkinenLancia Delta HF 4WDMON]]SWE]]POR]]KEN]]FRA]]GRC]]USA]]NZL]]ARG]]FINRetCIV]]ITA]]-0Mu-Uutiset 4 Rombi CorseLancia Delta IntegraleGBRRet1989]]Tommi MäkkinenLancia Delta IntegraleSWERetMON]]POR]]KEN]]FRA]]GRC]]NZL]]ARG]]FINRetAUS]]ITA]]CIV]]GBR]]-01990]]Pro Sport Rally TeamMitsubishi Galant VR-4MON]]POR]]KEN]]FRA]]GRC]]NZL6ARG]]FIN11AUS7ITA13CIV]]GBRRet24th101991Promoracing FinlandFord Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4MON]]SWE1331st8Tommi MäkinenPORRetKEN]]FRA]]GRC]]Promoracing FinlandMitsubishi Galant VR-4NZLRetARG]]Mazda Rally Team EuropeMazda 323 GTXFIN5AUS]]ITA]]CIV]]ESP]]GBRRet1992]]Nissan Motorsports EuropeNissan Sunny GTI-RMON9SWE]]PORRetKEN]]FRA]]GRC]]NZL]]ARG]]FINRetAUS]]ITA]]CIV]]ESP]]GBR840th51993]]AstraLancia Delta HF IntegraleMON]]SWE4POR]]KEN]]FRA]]GRE6ARG]]NZL]]FIN4AUS]]ITA]]ESP]]GBR]]10th261994Nissan F2Nissan Sunny GTI]]MON]]PORRetKEN]]FRA]]GRE]]ARG]]NZL]]GBR910th22Ford Motor Co]]Ford Escort RS CosworthFIN1Mitsubishi Ralliart]]Mitsubishi Lancer Evo II]]ITARet1995Mitsubishi RalliartMitsubishi Lancer Evo II]]MON4SWE25th38Mitsubishi Lancer Evo III]]POR]]FRA8NZLRetAUS4ESPRetGBRRet1996]]Mitsubishi Ralliart]]Mitsubishi Lancer Evo III]]SWE1KEN1IDNRetGRE2ARG1FIN1AUS1ITARetESP51st1231997]]Mitsubishi Ralliart]]Mitsubishi Lancer Evo IV]]MON3SWE3KENRetPOR1ESP1FRARetARG1GRE3NZLRetFIN1IDNRetITA3AUS2GBR61st631998Mitsubishi RalliartMitsubishi Lancer Evo IV]]MONRetSWE1KENRetPORRet1st58Mitsubishi Lancer Evo V]]ESP3FRARetARG1GRERetNZL3FIN1ITA1AUS1GBRRet1999]]Marlboro Mitsubishi Ralliart]]Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI]]MON1SWE1KENDSQPOR5ESP3FRA6ARG4GRE3NZL1FINRetCHNRetITA1AUS3GBRRet1st622000]]Marlboro Mitsubishi Ralliart]]Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI]]MON1SWE2KENRetPORRetESP4ARG3GRERetNZLRetFIN4CYP5FRARetITA3AUSDSQGBR35th362001Marlboro Mitsubishi RalliartMitsubishi Lancer Evo 6.5]]MON1SWERetPOR1ESP3ARG4CYPRetGRE4KEN1FINRetNZL83rd41Mitsubishi Lancer Evo WRC]]ITARetFRARetAUS6GBRRet2002555 Subaru World Rally TeamSubaru Impreza WRC2001]]MON1SWERet8th22Subaru Impreza WRC2002]]FRARetESPRetCYP3ARGRetGRERetKENRetFIN6GER7ITARetNZL3AUSDSQGBR42003]]555 Subaru World Rally Team]]Subaru Impreza WRC2003]]MONRetSWE2TUR8NZL7ARGRetGRE5CYPRetGERRetFIN6AUS6ITA10FRA7ESP8GBR38th30ReferencesExternal linksTommi Mäkinen Racing Ltd.
