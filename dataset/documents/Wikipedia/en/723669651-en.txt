Illustration by Halfdan Egedius]]Magnus I (1024 - October 25, 1047) was the King of Norway from 1035 to 1047 and the King of Denmark from 1042 to 1047. He was the illegitimate son of King Olaf Haraldsson, also known as Saint Olaf, by his concubine Alvhild. He is known by the cognomen, the Good or the Noble.In the period from 1028 to 1035, he was forced to leave Norway, yet, after the death of Knut the Great, he was called back by the noblemen, tired of living under Danish rule, to be King of Norway. After the death of Harthacanute, he was also made King of Denmark, despite rival claims had by Knut the Great's nephew Svend Estridsen. There was great turmoil south of the Danish border, where in 1043 Magnus won an important victory at Lyrskov Hede over the Wends who had invaded Denmark. It was a great victory and legends about the battle say that 15,000 Wends fell in a single day. The Norwegians swore they could hear the St Olaf's cathedral bell at Trondheim before the battle which they took to mean that Olaf himself was watching over his son and his army.Hvitfeldt, Arild. Danmarks Riges KrønikeSvend Estridsen did not lightly give up his claim to the Danish crown, and numerous conflicts with Magnus followed. A settlement was eventually agreed to, which made Svend Earl of Denmark. Magnus had trouble in Norway also. There, his uncle, Harald Hardråde, was a strong threat to the throne of his nephew. In 1046, Magnus was obliged to share the reign of his kingdom with him. In 1047, Svend Estridsen was driven out of Denmark by the Norwegians, with the assistance of the Swedish king Anund Jacob. Svend could not muster enough support, but had to flee to the province of Scania. Magnus died the same year, in Zealand. On his deathbed, he is said to have made Svend his heir in Denmark, and Harald Hardråde his heir in Norway. This was disputed by Harald, who did not approve of Svein being the king of Denmark, Svein was therefore not allowed to rule Denmark in peace until 1062, when Harald started to set his mind on other lands to conquer. Magnus was buried with his father in Nidaros.St. Olav's direct line ceased its reign with the death of Magnus. It returned to the throne again in 1280, when Eric II, who through his mother descended from Magnus' legitimate sister, succeeded as king. Magnus' own daughter was in a marriage with a Norwegian nobleman, and the one descendant wed to the Earl of Orkney, through which lineage Magnus' descendant James VI of Scotland became King of England.See alsoList of Norwegian monarchsList of Danish monarchsNotesSourcesTranslated from the article in the Danish Wikipedia             Category:Danish monarchs Category:Norwegian monarchs Category:Fairhair dynasty Category:Viking Age monarchs Category:Medieval child rulers Category:1024 births Category:1047 deaths Category:Burials at Nidaros Cathedral, Trondheimda:Magnus den Gode de:Magnus I.
