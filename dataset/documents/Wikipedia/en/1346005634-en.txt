   Konar at USAID |area = |population_density = |timezone = UTC+4:30 |free_type = Main language |free = Pashto   Kunar () is one of the thirty-four provinces of Afghanistan, located in the northeastern part of the country and on the border with Pakistan's Bajaur Agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. It borders three Afghan provinces, Nurestan to the north-west, Laghman to the west, and Nangarhar to the south. Its capital is Asadabad.Geography and ethnic makeupKunar is a tiny and sparsely populated province embedded in the Hindu Kush mountain range, and as such is heavily mountainous and forested.Pashtuns makes up the vast majority of the province and maintain a very strong tribal identity, some even going so far as to identify the province, and the eastern edge of Afghanistan in general, as "Pashtunistan." These Pashtun locals pronounce the name as Kunar or کونر.Military activity]] During both the Soviet occupation, and the more recent conflicts involving U.S., Afghan and NATO forces, Kunar has been a favoured spot of insurgent groups. Its impenetrable terrain, extensive cave networks and border with the semi-autonomous Pakistani Northwest Frontier Province provides several advantages for militant groups. The province is informally known as "Enemy Central" by American troops.Like many of the mountainous eastern provinces of Afghanistan, the groups involved in armed conflict vary greatly in strength and purpose. Native Taliban forces mingle with foreign Al-Qaeda fighters, while mujahadeen militias, such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, continue to operate as they did in the chaotic post-Soviet years. Another strong militia in the region is the Hezbi Islami faction of the late Mulavi Younas Khalis, who had his headquarters in neighbouring Nurestan Province.Compounding the problems of the province is an extensive criminal trade in smuggled lumber and other natural resources. This criminal activity is often organized along tribal lines, and has led to intense deforestation in some areas.Kunar Ambush   |combatant2= Taliban  al-Qaeda The Kunar Ambush was a small gun battle between allied forces and Islamic rebel groups. The combatants were German, Dutch, French and Danish forces fighting under European Union command; British, Canadian, Norwegian and Belgian forces under NATO command; and Filipino soldiers under UN command; and Taliban and al-Qaeda forces. Hunt for Bin LadenOsama bin Laden has often been rumoured to be in the province, or close by. In an intensive military operation in summer 2005, called Operation Red Wing, American forces undertook a massive hunt for bin Laden and other senior Al-Qaeda leaders. While attempting to rescue four stranded Navy SEALS during the operation, 19 American Forces were killed when their CH-47 Chinook helicopter was shot down, representing the single biggest loss of American forces since their invasion of the country.DistrictsAsadabadBar KunarChapa DaraChawkayDangamDara-I-PechGhaziabadKhas KunarMarawaraNarang Wa BadilNariNurgalShaygal Wa ShiltanSirkanayWata PurPoliticsAssadullah Wafa was the former governor of the province (replaced in Aug 2006).Asadabad hosts both an American Provincial Reconstruction Team office and a UNAMA development office.ReferencesCategory:Provinces of Afghanistan Category:Kunar Provincear:ولاية كنر ast:Konar de:Kunar et:Konarhā provints es:Provincia de Kunar fa:ولایت کنر fr:Kounar ko:쿠나르 주 it:Konar nl:Kunar ja:クナル州 no:Konar (provins) ps:د کنړ ولايت pl:Kunar pt:Konar (província) ru:Кунар sv:Konar (provins) tg:Вилояти Кунар tr:Kunar zh:库纳尔省
