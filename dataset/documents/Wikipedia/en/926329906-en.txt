can be used to measure resistance in ohms. It can also be used to measure capacitance, voltage, current, and other electrical characteristics.]]s. Their resistance, in ohms, is marked using a color code.]]The ohm (symbol: Ω) is the SI unit of electrical impedance or, in the direct current case, electrical resistance, named after Georg Ohm.DefinitionThe ohm is defined as the electric resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1 volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.BIPM SI Brochure: Appendix 1, p. 144\Omega = \dfrac = \dfrac^2 \cdot \mbox^ \cdot \mbox^2In many cases the resistance of a conductor in ohms is approximately constant within a certain range of voltages, temperatures, and other parameters; one speaks of linear resistors. In other cases resistance varies (e.g., thermistors).The most commonly used multiples and submultiples in electrical and electronic usage are the milliohm, ohm, kilohm, and megohm.ConversionsThe SI unit of electrical conductance is the siemens, formerly known as the mho (ohm written backwards); it is the reciprocal of resistance in ohms.Power as a function of resistanceThe power dissipated by a linear resistor may be calculated from its resistance, and voltage or current. The formula is a combination of Ohm's law and Joule's law:P==where P is the power in watts, R the resistance in ohms, V the voltage across the resistor, and I the current through it.This formula is not applicable to devices whose resistance varies with current.References and notesSee alsoOhm's lawResistorResistivityabohmSiemens (unit)External linksScanned books of Georg Simon Ohm at the library of the University of Applied Sciences NuernbergOfficial SI brochureNIST Special Publication 811History of the ohm at sizes.comCategory:SI derived units Category:Units of electrical resistancear:أوم ast:Ohmiu be:Ом (адзінка вымярэння) be-x-old:Ом bs:Om br:Ohm ca:Ohm cs:Ohm da:Ohm de:Ohm el:Ωμ (μονάδα μέτρησης) es:Ohmio eo:Omo eu:Ohm fa:اهم fr:Ohm (unité) gl:Ohm ko:옴 (단위) hi:ओह्म hr:Om id:Ohm is:Óm it:Ohm he:אוהם ka:ომი (ფიზიკა) lv:Oms li:Ohm (eenheid) nl:Ohm (eenheid) ja:オーム no:Ohm nn:Ohm pl:Om (jednostka) pt:Ohm ro:Ohm ru:Ом sk:Ohm (jednotka) sl:Om sr:Ом (јединица) fi:Ohmi sv:Ohm th:โอห์ม vi:Ohm tr:Ohm uk:Ом zh:歐姆
