After the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Montenegro and Serbia competed from 1994 to 2002 under the name of Yugoslavia, before it changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro.The scope of this article covers only the national team Yugoslavia until 1992 and the end of SFR Yugoslavia. For the team representing FR Yugoslavia, see Serbia and Montenegro national football team.The first one was in the kingdom that existed between the two world wars. The Football Federation of what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was founded in Zagreb in 1919 (and admitted into FIFA), and the national team played its first international game in Antwerp in 1920. In 1929, the country was renamed to Yugoslavia and the football association became Fudbalski Savez Jugoslavije and moved its headquarters to Belgrade. The national team participated in the Football World Cup 1930 and shared the third/fourth place with the U.S. team. The tournament was boycotted by Croatian players due to the moving of the association's headquarters to Belgrade.Фудбалски Савез Србије - HISTORY&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The federation and football overall was disrupted by World War II. After the war, a socialist federation was formed and the football federation reconstituted. It was one of the founding members of the UEFA and it organized the 1976 European Championship played in Belgrade and Zagreb. The national team participated in eight World Cups, four Euros, and even won Olympic Games football tournament in the 1960 (they also finished second three times and third once).Dragan Džajić holds the record for the most national team caps at 85, between 1964 to 1979. The best scorer is Stjepan Bobek with 38 goals, between 1946 and 1956.The under-21 team won the inaugural UEFA U-21 Championship in 1978.The Yugoslav under-20 team won the FIFA World Youth Championship 1987. The same generation probably would have been even more successful if it had not been for the Yugoslav wars. The Yugoslav team split up and the remaining team of the FRY was banned from competing at Euro 92. They had finished top of their qualifying group, but were unable to play in the competition due to Yugoslavia's political problems. Their place was taken by Denmark, who went on to win the competition.The national team of Serbia and Montenegro continued under the name Yugoslavia until that country was renamed in 2003. FIFA considers the national team of Serbia to be the successor of Yugoslavia.For the later official football teams, see:Bosnia and Herzegovina national football teamCroatia national football teamSerbia national football teamSlovenia national football teamRepublic of Macedonia national football teamMontenegro national football teamWorld Cup record1930 - Semifinals (no 3rd place match)1934 - Did not qualify1938 - Did not qualify1950 - Round 11954 - Quarterfinals1958 - Quarterfinals1962 - Fourth place1966 - Did not qualify1970 - Did not qualify1974 - Round 21978 - Did not qualify1982 - Round 11986 - Did not qualify1990 - Quarterfinals1994 - 2006  Competed as  (federal republic) and  now compete as  and European Championship recordYearRoundGPWD*LGSGAFrance 1960Final210112Spain|1939 1964Did not Qualify------Italy 1968Final311123Belgium 1972Did not Qualify------ 1976Fourth Place200247Italy 1980Did not Qualify------France 1984Round 13003210West Germany 1988Did not Qualify------Sweden 1992Qualified***Total4/910217922*Denotes draws include knockout matches decided on penalty kicks.**Gold background color indicates that the tournament was won.
