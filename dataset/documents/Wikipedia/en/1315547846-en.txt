After being left out of the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, he earned a recall under new coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.Club careerHe began his career with Vitória de Guimarães in 1995/96 and spent two further seasons there before moving to second division FC Felgueiras on loan. In 1998/99 Meira played 33 league games as Felgueiras narrowly missed out on promotion, finishing fifth, before returning to Guimarães for another fine season in which he scored his first goals in league football. In 2000 SL Benfica paid €4m (plus a player) for him in summer 2000 and the defender did not disappoint, earning the club captaincy and bolstering his reputation to the point that VfB Stuttgart paid €7.5m for his skills in January 2002.   Stuttgart's general manager, Rolf Rüssmann, described the player as a "trophy" signing.  In 2002/03 season VfB Stuttgart coach Felix Magath fielded Fernando Meira in 31 Bundesliga matches, and only a suspension prevented him from featuring in all 34 as the club finished second to clinch a place in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League. He missed two UEFA Cup matches, including the home defeat by Celtic FC. In 2006 he became team captain of VfB Stuttgart. In 2006-07 they won the Bundesliga trophy, making it the first time the team won it in 15 years and the first domestic league title for Meira.On 20 July 2008, at the end of the 2007/2008 season, VfB Stuttgart removed Meira of the team captaincy and announced their intention to sell the player.  Shortly afterwards, on 22 July 2008, Meira signed a four year contract with Turkish club Galatasaray.   International careerMeira made his international debut in 2000 but failed to secure a regular position until the 2006 World Cup. The defender played in all of Portugal's seven games in the tournament, finishing fourth overall.   The player continued to be a regular fixture in the UEFA Euro 2008 tournament in Austria and Switzerland, appearing in all of Portugal's group stage games. However he did not feature in their quarter final match against Germany. Portugal lost the game and Germany went on to the final of the tournament.HonoursGalatasarayTurkish Super Cup: 1 (2008)Stuttgart[[Bundesliga (football)|'Bundesliga']]'''Winner: 2006-07Runner-up: 2002-03[[DFB-Pokal|'DFB Pokal']]Runner-Up: 2006-07PortugalFIFA World Cup:4th place: 2006ReferencesExternal linksMeira's Official homepage  Profile at galatasaray.org  Profile at TFF.org Profile at transfermarkt.de    Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Portugal international footballers Category:Vitória SC players Category:S.L.
