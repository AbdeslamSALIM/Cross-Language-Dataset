 The spiny rats are a group of hystricognath rodents in the family Echimyidae. They are distributed from central Central America through much of South America. They were also found in the West Indies until the 1800s. Some authorities consider the nutria from southern and central South America to be a part of this family.CharacteristicsIn general form, most spiny rats resemble rats, although they are more closely related to guinea pigs and chinchillas. Most species have stiff pointed hairs, or spines, that allow for protection.Many echimyids can break off their tails when attacked. This action confuses predators long enough for the animal to escape. Unlike lizards, however, the tail of spiny rats does not regenerate. This technique can obviously be used only once in each individual's lifetime.Most spiny rats are rare and poorly known, but a few are extremely abundant. Terrestrial, arboreal, and fossorial members of this family exist. In general, the arboreal forms are most rat-like in appearance, whilst the burrowing species are more gopher-like, with stocky bodies and short tails. Most species do not do well in conditions of high heat and aridity and are restricted to regions with an abundant source of water. They are almost exclusively herbivorous.The Thin-spined Porcupine, Chaetomys subspinosus, is often included in the Echimyidae due to similarities in the premolar.GeneraFamily Echimyidae - spiny rats†''Cercomys''†''Maruchito''†''Paulacoutomys''†''Willidewu''Subfamily †Adelphomyinae†''Adelphomys''†''Deseadomys''†''Paradelphomys''†''Stichomys''†''Xylechimys''Subfamily DactylomyinaeDactylomys - coro-corosKannabateomys - Rato de TaquaraOlallamysSubfamily †Heteropsomyinae - extinct West Indian echimyids†''Boromys''†''Brotomys''†''Heteropsomys''†''Puertoricomys''Subfamily Eumysopinae†''Acarechimys''†''Chasichimys''†''Eumysops''Hoplomys Armored ratLonchothrixMesomys†''Palaeoechimys''†''Pampamys''†''Pattersomys''†''Protacaremys''†''Protadelphomys''†''Sallamys''Proechimys - spiny ratsThrichomys - PunaréTrinomysTribe EuryzygomatomyiniCarterodonClyomysEuryzygomatomys - GuiaraSubfamily EchimyinaeCallistomysDiplomysEchimys - arboreal spiny ratsIsothrix - torosMakalataPattonomysPhyllomysSantamartamysReferencesEmmons, L.H. 2005.
