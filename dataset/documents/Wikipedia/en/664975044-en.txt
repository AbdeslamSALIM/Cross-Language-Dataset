They are members of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). They play their home games at the American Airlines Center. Prior to 1993, the team was known as the Minnesota North Stars.Franchise history1967-1993: Minnesota Years The Minnesota North Stars began play in 1967 as part of the NHL's six-team expansion. Home games were played at the newly-constructed Metropolitan Sports Center (the "Met Center") in Bloomington, Minnesota. Initially successful both on the ice and at the gate, the North Stars fell victim to financial problems after several poor seasons in the mid-1970s.In 1978, the North Stars were purchased by the owners of the Cleveland Barons (formerly the California Golden Seals), the Gund brothers, George III and Gordon, and the NHL permitted the two failing franchises to merge. The merged team retained the name Minnesota North Stars, but assumed the Barons’ place in the Adams Division. The merger brought with it a number of talented players, and the North Stars were revived, making the Stanley Cup Finals in 1981, where they lost in five games to the New York Islanders. However, by the early 1990s, declining attendance and the inability to secure a new downtown revenue-generating arena led ownership to request permission to move the team to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1990. The NHL rejected the request, and instead agreed to award an expansion franchise, the San Jose Sharks, to the Gund brothers. The North Stars were sold to a group of investors that were originally looking to place a team in San Jose, although one of the group's members, Norman Green, would eventually gain control of the team. In the following season, Minnesota made it to the Stanley Cup Finals, only to lose to the Pittsburgh Penguins.1993: Relocation to DallasIn 1993, amid further attendance woes and bitter personal controversy, Green obtained permission to move the team to the Reunion Arena in Dallas, Texas, where they were renamed the Stars. The NHL, to quell the controversy, promised the fans of Minnesota a return in the future with a new franchise; that promise was fulfilled in 2000 when Minnesota was awarded the Minnesota Wild as an expansion franchise.In the 1994 playoffs the Stars lost to the Cinderella-story Vancouver Canucks. Green would later sell the team to Tom Hicks.In 1999 the Stars won the franchise's first Stanley Cup, versus the Buffalo Sabres in six games. Dallas returned to the Cup Finals in 2000, but would lose to the New Jersey Devils. For 2001-02, the team moved to a new arena, the American Airlines Center.Despite initial reservations about the move to Texas, the Stars have enjoyed success both on and off the ice. On top of their 1999 Cup, they have won two Presidents' Trophies as the team with the best overall regular-season record. Dallas has also won seven division titles and two Western Conference titles in the past ten seasons. In the last ten years the Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, and New Jersey Devils have had the most points.2006 - current seasonThe Stars made a number of changes during summer 2006. Former Stars goalkeeper Andy Moog was promoted to Assistant General Manager for Player Development (he kept his job as goaltending coach), and former player Ulf Dahlen was hired as an assistant coach.The Stars allowed center Jason Arnott, defenseman Willie Mitchell and goaltender Johan Hedberg to leave as free agents. Forward Niko Kapanen was traded to the Atlanta Thrashers and the remaining two years on right-winger Bill Guerin's contract were bought out.The Stars received Patrik Stefan and Jaroslav Modry in the Atlanta trade, and signed Eric Lindros, Jeff Halpern, Matthew Barnaby and Darryl Sydor as free agents. Young goaltender Mike Smith was promoted to the NHL to serve as Marty Turco's backup.On September 29, 2006, Brenden Morrow was announced as new team captain, taking the "C" from Mike Modano, who had served in the role since 2003. Modano is the last major Minnesota North Star still with the club.During the season, center Mike Ribeiro, winger Ladislav Nagy and defenseman Mattias Norstrom were added through three separate trades. Young players Joel Lundqvist, Krys Barch, Nicklas Grossman, Chris Conner all saw significant ice time while other players were out of the lineup with injuries.On January 24, 2007, the 55th National Hockey League All-Star Game was held at the American Airlines Center. Defenceman Philippe Boucher and goaltender Marty Turco would represent the Stars as part of the Western Conference All-Star roster.On March 13, 2007, Mike Modano scored his 500th career NHL goal, making him only the 39th player and 2nd American to ever reach 500 goals. On March 17, 2007, Modano scored his 502nd and 503rd NHL goals, breaking the record for an American-born player previously held by Joe Mullen.The Stars qualified for the playoffs as the #6 seed in the Western conference and squared off against the Vancouver Canucks in the first round of the playoffs. Goalkeeper Marty Turco pitched three shutout wins -- in games 2, 5 and 6 -- but the Stars' offense failed to capitalize and they lost the series 4 games to 3. This was the third season in a row that the Stars lost in the first round.Due to little improvement in the offseason, and a bad start to the season, General Manager Doug Armstrong was fired. He was replaced by asst. GM Les Jackson and former Stars player Brett Hull. The two still share the title as Co-General Mangers of the Stars. The Stars finished #5 during the 07-08 season. On April 25, 2008, in Round 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Stars eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Anaheim Ducks, in six games. On May 4, 2008, the Stars finished off the San Jose Sharks in six games, to advance to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the eventual champions Detroit Red Wings four games to two.Team informationJerseysThe team since its inception has used the Stars logo jersey on both home and away jerseys. For 2007, as part of the league-wide changeover to the Rbk Edge jerseys, the Stars changed their jerseys. The home jersey simply states 'Dallas' on the chest, with the primary logo relocated to the shoulders and the player number on the chest. The color of the home jersey has also changed from green to black. The alternate logo remains on the shoulders of the away jerseys.ArenaThe Stars played in 17,001 capacity Reunion Arena from their relocation in 1993, until the club moved to the 18,500 capacity American Airlines Center in 2001. It has become tradition that the fans in attendance shout "stars" during the phrasing of the word as the National Anthem is sung. At games, as part of the entertainment, a Kahlenberg KDT-123 fog horn sounds after every goal. The "Dallas Stars Fight Song", recorded by Fort Worth natives Pantera, is played when the Stars hit the ice after every intermission.BroadcastersRalph Strangis play-by-play Daryl Reaugh color analystSeason-by-season recordThis is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Stars.
