 .]]A dark nebula is a type of interstellar cloud that is so dense that it obscures the light from the background emission or reflection nebula (e.g., the Horsehead Nebula) or that it blocks out background stars (e.g., the Coalsack Nebula).The extinction of the light is caused by interstellar dust grains located in the coldest, densest parts of larger molecular clouds. Clusters and large complexes of dark nebulae are associated with Giant Molecular Clouds. Isolated small dark nebulae are called Bok globules.The form of such dark clouds is very irregular: they have no clearly defined outer boundaries and sometimes take on convoluted serpentine shapes. The largest dark nebulae are visible to the naked eye, appearing as dark patches against the brighter background of the Milky Way.In the inner regions of dark nebulae important events take place, such as the formation of stars and masers.See alsoList of dark nebulae* Category:Nebulaede:Dunkelwolke es:Nebulosa oscura fr:Nébuleuse obscure ko:암흑 성운 it:Nebulosa oscura lt:Tamsusis debesis nl:Absorptienevel ja:暗黒星雲 nn:Mørk tåke pl:Ciemna mgławica pt:Nebulosa escura ro:Nebuloasă obscură sk:Tmavá hmlovina fi:Pimeä sumu zh:暗星雲
