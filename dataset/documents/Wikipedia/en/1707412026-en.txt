It has football, basketball and volleyball teams.HistoryFootball TeamApollon F.C. was founded in Limassol on April 14th, 1954. The Club was accepted into the second division on October 16th, 1955 after its membership application had been approved by the Cyprus Football Association (C.F.A).In its first year Apollon suffered 8 defeats in 8 matches the second division. Just before the next season (1956-57) a crisis erupted in AEL, a first division team based in Limassol, and as a result, most of the players left AEL and joined Apollon. After this, Apollon won the regional group in the second division and subsequently the play-offs to then be promoted to the first division. This took place in 1957 and ever since Apollon has been competing in the first division. Things were not easy however for the newly promoted club. Apollon couldn't reach a satisfactory position in the rankings and was struggling in the middle of the table for many years. But in the mid-60's things changed.In 1965 Apollon reached the Cup Final. A year later, Apollon was in the Final again, won the Cup, and triumphantly took the trophy back to Limassol. Apollon managed to maintain its Cup title in 1967. After celebrating these titles, Apollon had to wait another 15 years to start making history once again. In 1982 Apollon reached the Cup Final once again, and that marked the beginning of a new era. In the last 15 years Apollon won the league title three times (1991, 1994, 2006), and was the runner-up four times (1984, 1989, 1993, 1996). Since then Apollon won the Cup another 5 times (1966, 1967, 1986, 1992, 2001), and was the Cup finalist four times (1987, 1993, 1995, 1998).Last season, 2005-06 Apollon won the league title undefeated and earned a club record of 64 points. Apollon had 19 wins and 7 draws in 26 matches and this went down in Cypriot Football history due to fact that it was the fourth team in the Cyprus Championship that won the title unbeaten. *Apollon was the only undefeated team in Europe, running an unbeaten streak since March 12th, 2005 (30 games).Volleyball teamFounded member of Cyprus Volleyball Federation, the women's team participated in three Championship finals (1999, 2001, 2003) and in five Cup finals (1992, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2003) but lost all of them by AEL Limassol. In 2003, the team lost both Championship and Cup finals by AEL again, however since AEL won the double, they participated in the Super Cup and on September 23, 2003 they won their first trophy, the Super Cup in their own Stadium by beating AEL Limassol 3-0.Supporters Apollon is among the most popular football teams in Cyprus.
