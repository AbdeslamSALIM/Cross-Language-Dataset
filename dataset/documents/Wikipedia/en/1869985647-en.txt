 pcupdate = [[May 23]] [[2008]] Julio Ricardo Cruz (born October 10 1974 in Santiago del Estero) is an Argentine footballer who plays for Italian side Internazionale.Club careerA physical and tall forward at , Cruz started his football career with Banfield in 1993. He moved to Argentine team River Plate in 1996. In 1997, he moved to Europe again, being signed by Dutch team Feyenoord, and showing a great potential in terms of scoring proficiency. He then moved in 2000 to Serie A team Bologna. After having experienced some difficulties adapting to Italian football, Cruz successfully showed his potential.In 2003, Cruz left Bologna and signed for Italian giants Internazionale.   With the nerazzurri, Cruz rarely played regularly in the first team, finding some playing time usually just when the leading strikers were unavailable, and often being used as a substitute, thus scoring 12 league goals in his first two seasons with Internazionale. He scored his first goal for Internazionale in the 3-0 victory over Arsenal at Highbury on 17 September 2003 in the Champions League. Despite the little playing time given to him, he has always performed well. In the Champions League game against Porto on 1 November 2005, he scored twice in half an hour after being sent in to replace striker Adriano, turning a goal deficit into a victory with Inter winning 2-1, and in the reverse fixture scored a free kick that got a goal back for inter against milan at the score 2-1, but inter were unable to capitalize.In the winter of 2005, rumours linked him to Roma and other clubs because his contract was running out, but in February 2006 the contract was extended to the summer of 2008, ending the rumours.   He ended the season as the surprise top scorer for Internazionale with 21 goals, including 15 league goals, and the second goal in the return match for the final of the 2006 Coppa Italia that Inter won 3-1 against Roma.He has often been given the captains armband when the senior players are rested.Despite being injured at the start of the 2006&ndash;07 season, he has made an impressive comeback, scoring three goals for Inter in the Champions League as well as vital goals in the league campaign.On 11 March 2007, Cruz scored the equalizer for Inter in the Milan derby just eleven seconds after coming on as a sub for Hernán Crespo, a derby which Inter would later go on to win, with his setting up Zlatan Ibrahimović for the winning goal. This season is turning out to be a good one for Cruz, following up on the success of last year and regularly featuring in the score sheets, keeping up with the other strikers despite being injured twice in the season, and his ability to score vital goals. He is currently averaging a very impressive record of scoring a goal every 109 minutes in the current season.On 7 September 2007, due to the departure of Álvaro Recoba and the uncertainty surrounding the future of Adriano, Cruz signed another contract which will keep him with the nerazzurri until 2009. The extended contract will see Cruz compete with countryman Crespo, for second choice striker. He again scored in the Milan derby in December 2007 with the equalizer, Inter went on to win the game 2-1. On the 24 September he again scored for Inter Milan against Lecce which Inter won 1-0, ending speculation Jose Mourinho didn't want him.International careerWith the Argentina national football team, Cruz has played 18 matches, scoring three times. He played in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, coming on as a late substitute in the matches against the Netherlands and Germany. He scored the opening penalty in the penalty shoot-outs but couldn't help Argentina progress into the semi finals.NicknameHis nickname, "the gardener", "El Jardinero" in Spanish, was given to him at an early age in Argentina. He was working as a gardener for local team Banfield, cutting the grass and looking after the pitch, and when coach Oscar López was missing a player one day for a practise match, he was called over to make up the numbers. On noticing his talent, Banfield signed him. Since then Julio has always been known as El Jardinero. In recent years however, he has earned a new nickname, Poncherello, used during the famous radio football matches commentaries, on Interchannel. Due to his hair cut he was called "Poncherello", as in Frank Poncherello, Erik Estradas character from the American Series CHiPs.Career statisticstitle=Julio Cruz | publisher=ESPNsoccernet | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/stats?id=11803&amp;cc=5739 | accessdate=2007-12-03 ClubSeasonDomestic LeagueDomestic CupsEuropean gamesCounts for appearances and goals at the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Cup and UEFA Intertoto Cup.TotalAppGoalsAppGoalsAppGoalsAppGoalsBanfield1993&ndash;9450----501994&ndash;95266----2661995&ndash;063210----32101996&ndash;0710----10Total6416----6416River Plate1996&ndash;972917----2917Total2917----2917Feyenoord1997&ndash;982714--6333171998&ndash;992915--2031151999&ndash;003015--8338182000&ndash;01----1010Total8644--17610350Bologna2000&amp;ndash;01277--102872001&amp;ndash;02331022--35122002&amp;ndash;03281010613511Total882732719830Internazionale2003&amp;ndash;042174310135112004&amp;ndash;0518562823292005&amp;ndash;063115826445212006&amp;ndash;07147424322122007&amp;ndash;08281333423318Total11247239321216768Career Totals36614826115619461182Updated 27 August 2008Honours    Club River PlateArgentine Primera Apertura 1996Argentine Primera: Clausura 1997 FeyenoordEredivisie: 1999Johan Cruijff-schaal: 1999 InternazionaleSerie A: 2005-2006, 2006-2007,2007-08.Coppa Italia: 2005, 2006Italian Super Cup: 2005, 2006, 2008ReferencesExternal linksFootballDatabase provides Julio Cruz's profile and statsStatistics at Guardian Stats CentreCareer details at National Football TeamsThe JULIO CRUZ's Un Official SiteMySpace profile unofficial of Julio Cruz  Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentina international footballers Category:Football (soccer) strikers Category:Banfield footballers Category:River Plate footballers Category:Feyenoord Rotterdam players Category:F.C.
