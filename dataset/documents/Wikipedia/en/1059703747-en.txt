Greenland is not a member of FIFA nor of any continental confederation and therefore is not eligible to enter the World Cup or other sanctioned tournaments. Most of the matches they have played have been against the Faroe Islands and Iceland, but neither of the two consider those games full internationals. It has also played Tibet, since neither are FIFA members.Greenland is a member of the International Island Games Association and has taken part in Football at the Island Games. Since October 13, 2005 it is a provisional member of the NF-Board and since March 25, 2006 it is full-member.The team was once trained by experienced manager Sepp Piontek.Also, most Greenlander players are eligible to play for Denmark, since Greenland is officially part of the country.FIFA's recent approval of FieldTurf may allow Greenland to create FIFA-standard playing pitches and apply to play full internationals. They would join either UEFA (due to links with Denmark), or CONCACAF (geographically, Greenland is part of North America).FIFI Wild cup participationGreenland has participated in the 2006 FIFI Wild Cup.
