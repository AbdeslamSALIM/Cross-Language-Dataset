The Chinese remainder theorem is a result about congruences in number theory and its generalizations in abstract algebra.Theorem statementThe original form of the theorem, contained in a third-century AD book Sun Zi suanjing (孙子算经 The Mathematical Classic by Sun Zi) by Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu and later republished in a 1247 book by Qin Jiushao, the Shushu Jiuzhang (數書九章 Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections) is a statement about simultaneous congruences (see modular arithmetic).Suppose n''1, ''n2, …, n''''k are positive integers which are pairwise coprime. Then, for any given integers a''1,''a2, …, a''''k, there exists an integer x solving the system of simultaneous congruences\beginx &amp;\equiv a_1 \pmod \\
x &amp;\equiv a_2 \pmod \\
  &amp;\vdots \\
x &amp;\equiv a_k \pmod\endFurthermore, all solutions x'' to this system are congruent modulo the product ''N = n''1''n2…''n''k.Hence x \equiv y \pmod for all 1\leq i \leq k, if and only if x \equiv y \pmod.Sometimes, the simultaneous congruences can be solved even if the ni's are not pairwise coprime. A solution x exists if and only if:a_i \equiv a_j \pmod \qquad \mboxi\mboxj . \,\! All solutions x'' are then congruent modulo the least common multiple of the ''ni.Versions of the Chinese remainder theorem were also known to Brahmagupta (7th century), and appear in Fibonacci's Liber Abaci (1202).A constructive algorithm to find the solutionThis algorithm only treats the situations where the n_i's are coprime. The method of successive substitution can often yield solutions to simultaneous congruences, even when the moduli are not pairwise coprime.Suppose, as above, that a solution is needed to the system of congruences:x \equiv a_i \pmod \quad\mathrm\; i = 1, \ldots, k.Again, to begin, the product  N=n_1n_2\ldots n_k is defined. Then a solution x can be found as follows.For each i&nbsp;the integers n_i and N/n_i are coprime. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm we can therefore find integers r_i and s_i such that r_in_i + s_iN/n_i = 1. Then, choosing the label e_i=s_iN/n_i, the above expression becomes: r_i n_i + e_i = 1 \,\! Consider e_i. The above equation guarantees that its remainder, when divided by n_i, must be 1. On the other hand, since it is formed as s_iN/n_i, the presence of N guarantees that it's evenly divisible by any n_j so long as j\ne i.e_i \equiv 1 \pmod \quad \mathrm \quad e_i \equiv 0 \pmod \quad \mathrm ~ i \ne jBecause of this, combined with the multiplication rules allowed in congruences, one solution to the system of simultaneous congruences is: x = \sum_^k a_i e_i.\! For example, consider the problem of finding an integer x such thatx \equiv 2 \pmod, \,\! x \equiv 3 \pmod, \,\! x \equiv 1 \pmod. \,\! Using the extended Euclidean algorithm for 3 and 4&times;5 = 20, we find (−13) &times; 3 + 2 &times; 20 = 1, i.e. e''1 = 40. Using the Euclidean algorithm for 4 and 3&times;5 = 15, we get (−11) &times; 4 + 3 &times; 15 = 1. Hence, ''e2 = 45. Finally, using the Euclidean algorithm for 5 and 3&times;4 = 12, we get 5 &times; 5 + (−2) &times; 12 = 1, meaning e''3 = −24. A solution ''x is therefore 2 &times; 40 + 3 &times; 45 + 1 &times; (−24) = 191. All other solutions are congruent to 191 modulo 60, (3 &times; 4 &times; 5 = 60) which means that they are all congruent to 11 modulo 60.NOTE: There are multiple implementations of the extended Euclidean algorithm which will yield different sets of e_1, e_2, and e_3. These sets however will produce the same solution i.e. 11 modulo 60.Statement for principal ideal domainsFor a principal ideal domain R'' the Chinese remainder theorem takes the following form: If ''u1, ..., uk are elements of R'' which are pairwise coprime, and ''u denotes the product u''1...''uk, then the quotient ring R/uR and the product ring R/u1R'' × ⋯ × ''R/ukR are isomorphic via the isomorphismf : R/uR \rightarrow R/u_1R \times \cdots \timesR/u_k R such thatf(x +uR) = (x + u_1R, \ldots , x +u_kR) \quad\mbox x\in R. This isomorphism is unique; the inverse isomorphism can be constructed as follows. For each i'', the elements ''ui and u/ui are coprime, and therefore there exist elements r'' and ''s in R withr u_i + s u/u_i = 1. \,\!Set ei = s u/ui. Then the inverse of f is the mapg : R/u_1R \times \cdots \times R/u_kR\rightarrow R/uR such thatg(a_1+u_1R,\ldots ,a_k+u_kR)=\left( \sum_^k a_i e_i \right) + uR \quad\mboxa_1,\ldots,a_k\in R. Note that this statement is a straightforward generalization of the above theorem about integer congruences: the ring Z of integers is a principal ideal domain, the surjectivity of the map f shows that every system of congruences of the formx \equiv a_i \pmod \quad\mathrm\; i = 1, \ldots, kcan be solved for x'', and the injectivity of the map ''f shows that all the solutions x'' are congruent modulo ''u.Statement for general ringsThe general form of the Chinese remainder theorem, which implies all the statements given above, can be formulated for commutative rings and ideals. If R'' is a commutative ring and ''I1, ..., Ik are two-sided ideals of R'' which are pairwise coprime (meaning that ''Ii + Ij = R'' whenever ''i ≠ j''), then the product ''I of these ideals is equal to their intersection, and the quotient ring R/I is isomorphic to the product ring R''/''I1 x R''/''I2 x ... x R''/''Ik via the isomorphismf : R/I \rightarrow R/I_1 \times \cdots \times R/I_k such thatf(x + I) = (x +I_1, \ldots , x+I_k) \quad\mbox x\in R.ApplicationsIn the RSA algorithm calculations are made modulo n, where n is a product of two large prime numbers p and q. 1024-, 2048- or 4096-bit integers n are commonly used, making calculations in \Bbb/n\Bbb very time-consuming. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, however, these calculations can be done in the isomorphic ring \Bbb/p\Bbb \oplus \Bbb/q\Bbb instead. Since p and q are normally of about the same size, that is about \sqrt, calculations in the latter representation are much faster. Note that RSA algorithm implementations using this isomorphism are more susceptible to fault injection attacks.The Chinese Remainder Theorem may also be used to construct an elegant Gödel numbering for sequences, which is needed to prove Gödel's incompleteness theorems.Non-commutative caseThe Chinese remainder theorem does not hold in the non-commutative case. Consider the ring R of non-commutative real polynomials in x and y. Let I be the principal two-sided ideal generated by x and J the principal two-sided ideal generated by xy+1. Then I+J=R but I\cap J \neq IJ.Proof:Observe that I is formed by all polynomials with an x in every term and that every polynomial in J vanishes under the substitution y=-1/x. Consider the polynomial p=(xy+1)x. Clearly p\in I\cap J. Define a term in R as an element of the multiplicative monoid of R generated by x and y. Define the degree of a term as the usual degree of the term after the substitution y=x. On the other hand, suppose q\in J. Observe that a term in q of maximum degree depends on y otherwise q under the substitution y=-1/x can not vanish. The same happens then for an element q\in IJ. Observe that the last y, from left to right, in a term of maximum degree in an element of IJ is preceded by more than one x. (We are counting here all the preceding xs. e.g. in x^2yxyx^5 the last y is preceded by 3 xs.) This proves that (xy+1)x\notin IJ since that last y in a term of maximum degree (xyx) is preceded by only one x. Hence I\cap J\neq IJ.On the other hand, it is true in general that I+J = R implies I \cap J = IJ + JI. To see this, note that  I \cap J = (I \cap J) (I+J) \subset IJ + JI, while the opposite inclusion is obvious. Also, we have in general that, provided I_1, \ldots, I_m are pairwise coprime two-sided ideals in R, the natural mapR / (I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \ldots \cap I_m) \rightarrow R/I_1 \oplus R/I_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus R/I_mis an isomorphism. Note that I_1 \cap I_2 \cap \ldots \cap I_m can be replaced by a sum over all orderings of I_1, \ldots, I_m of their product (or just a sum over enough orderings, using inductively that I \cap J = IJ + JI for coprime ideals I, J).See alsoCovering systemResidue number systemHasse principleReferencesDonald Knuth.
