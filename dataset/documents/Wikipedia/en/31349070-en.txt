 '', also known as the Spiny dye-murex]]  [[Image:Tyrian-Purple-2D-skeletal.png|thumb|right|200px|The chemical structure of 6,6′-dibromoindigo, the main component of Tyrian Purple]]  of 6,6′-dibromoindigo, based on the crystal structure]]Tyrian purple (Greek: , porphyra, Latin: purpura), also known as royal purple, imperial purple or imperial dye, is a purple-red dye which was first produced by the ancient Phoenicians in the city of Tyre.Tyrian purple was expensive: the fourth-century BC historian Theopompus reported, "Purple for dyes fetched its weight in silver at Colophon" in Asia Minor.Theopompus, cited by Athenaeus (12:526) around 200 BC; according to Gulick, Charles Barton 1941. Athenaeus, The Deipnosophists. Cambridge: Harvard University Press.CollectionThe dye substance occurs naturally, but must be harvested by humans. It consists of a fresh mucous secretion from the hypobranchial gland of a medium-sized predatory sea snail, the marine gastropod Murex brandaris, currently known as Haustellum brandaris (Linnaeus, 1758). This species is commonly called the spiny dye-murex, and it is a species in the family Muricidae, the murex or rock shells. The current range for this species is the "central and western Mediterranean" Radwin, G. E. and A. D'Attilio, 1986. Murex shells of the world. An illustrated guide to the Muricidae, p93, Stanford University Press, Stanford, California, USA, 284pp incl 192 figs. & 32 pls.In Biblical Hebrew, which like Phoenician is a dialect of Canaanite, the Tyrian purple-red dye extracted from the Murex brandaris is known as shani שָׁנִי ʃɔni, but usually translated as 'scarlet'. Another dye extracted from a related sea snail, Hexaplex trunculus, could produce a purple-blue color called argaman אַרְגָּמָן argɔmɔn (translated 'purple') when processed in shade, or a sky-blue indigo color, called tekhelet תְּכֵלֶת‎ təxelɛθ (translated 'indigo') when processed in sunlight (see Photochemistry).Many other species worldwide within the family Muricidae, for example Plicopurpura pansa (Gould, 1853), from the tropical eastern Pacific, and Plicopurpura patula (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Caribbean zone of the western Atlantic, can also produce a similar substance (which turns into an enduring purple dye when exposed to sunlight) and this ability has sometimes also been historically exploited by local inhabitants in the areas where these snails occur. (Some other predatory gastropods, such as some wentletraps in the family Epitoniidae, seem to also produce a similar substance, although this has not been studied or exploited commercially.)In nature the snails use the secretion as part of their predatory behaviour and as an antimicrobial lining on egg masses.Because of research by Benkendorff et al., the Tyrian purple precursor tyrindoleninone is being investigated as a potential antimicrobial agent with uses against multidrug resistant bacteria. The snail also secretes this substance when it is poked or physically attacked by humans. Therefore the dye can be collected either by "milking" the snails, which is more labor intensive but is a renewable resource, or by collecting and then crushing the snails completely, which is destructive.Royal blueAs well as Tyrian purple, the Phoenicians also made a purple-blue indigo dye, referred to as royal blue or hyacinth purple, which was made from a closely-related species of marine snail.The Phoenicians established an ancillary production facility on the Iles Purpuraires at Mogador, in Morocco.C.Michael Hogan, Mogador: Promontory Fort, The Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham, Nov 2, 2007 http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17926 The gastropod harvested at this western Moroccan dye production facility was Phyllonotus trunculus also known by the older name Murex trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758)).This second species of dye murex currently occurs on "the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa (Spain and Portugal, Morocco, and the Canary Islands" Radwin, G. E. and A. D'Attilio, 1986. Murex shells of the world.

It is believed that the intensity of the purple hue improved, rather than faded, as the dyed cloth aged. Pliny the Elder described the dyeing process of two purples in his Natural HistoryPliny the Elder, The Natural History (eds. John Bostock, H.T. Riley) Book IX. The Natural History of Fishes. Chapters 60-65. http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137&amp;query=head%3D%23483:Archaeological data from Tyre indicate that the snails were collected in large vats and left to decompose. This produced a hideous stench that was actually mentioned by ancient authors. Not much is known about the subsequent steps, and the actual ancient method for mass-producing the two murex dyes has not yet been successfully reconstructed; this special "blackish clotted blood" colour, which was prized above all others, is believed to be achieved by double-dipping the cloth, once in the indigo dye of H. trunculus and once in the purple-red dye of M. brandaris. The Roman mythographer Julius Pollux, writing in the second century BC, asserted (Onomasticon I, 45–49) that the purple dye was first discovered by Heracles, or rather, by his dog, whose mouth was stained purple from chewing on snails along the coast of the Levant. Recently, the archaeological discovery of substantial numbers of Murex shells on Crete suggests that the Minoans may have pioneered the extraction of Imperial purple centuries before the Tyrians. Dating from colocated pottery suggests the dye may have been produced during the Middle Minoan period in the 20th&ndash;18th century BC.Reese, David S. (1987).

(1994), "The Minoan Origin of Tyrian Purple," Biblical Archaeologist, 57, 46-54.The main chemical constituent of the Tyrian dye was discovered by Paul Friedländer in 1909 to be 6,6′-dibromoindigo, a substance that had previously been synthesized in 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has never been synthesized commercially.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Modern renditionTyrian purpleThe true colour of Tyrian purple, like most high chroma pigments, cannot be accurately displayed on a computer display, nor are ancient reports entirely consistent, but these swatches give an indication of the likely range in which it appeared:_________  _________This is the sRGB colour #990024, intended for viewing on an output device with a gamma of 2.2. It is a representation of RHS colour code 66A "RHS, UCL and RGB Colors, gamma = 1.4, fan 2", Azalea Society of America website http://www.azaleas.org/index.pl/rhsmacfan2.html (this gives the RGB value #b80049, which has been converted to #990024 for the sRGB gamma of 2.2), which has been equated to "Tyrian red" Buck, G. Buck Rose Website, Page 5 http://www.ag.iastate.edu/centers/cad/Eroses.html, a term which is often used as a synonym for Tyrian purple.Shades of Tyrian purple colour comparison chartModern research shows, as discussed above, that various formulations of Tyrian purple existed on a continuous spectrum within approximately the following range of colours:   Bright Tyrian Purple (Bright Imperial Purple) (Tyrian Pink) (Hex: #B80049) (RGB: 184, 0, 73)  Medium Tyrian Purple (Medium Imperial Purple) (Tyrian Red) (Hex: #990024) (RGB: 153, 0, 36)  Tyrian Purple (Imperial Purple) (Hex: #66023C) (RGB: 102, 2, 60) ReferencesSee alsoIndigo dyePurpleHexaplex trunculusExternal links
