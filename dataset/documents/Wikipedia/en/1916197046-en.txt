 .]] The Waldstadion (official name:Commerzbank-Arena) is a 52,300 seat football stadium in Frankfurt, Germany. It is the home of Eintracht Frankfurt of the Bundesliga. The Waldstadion was first opened in 1925 and during World War II it was used for political events of the Nazi Party.The stadium has been named "Commerzbank-Arena" since July 2005. But most people, especially the fans of Eintracht Frankfurt, still call it Waldstadion. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was called "FIFA WM Stadion Frankfurt" (in English, "FIFA World Cup Stadium Frankfurt"). Large modifications were made for the tournament with the stadium being nearly completely rebuilt and modernized. Now it is one of Germany's biggest stadiums and there have already been some important events in 2005, such as the finale of the Confederations Cup.One modification involved suspending a large four-sided structure over the stadium with large screens on each side for the crowds to see. On sunny days this creates a large shadow on the pitch, making it more difficult to watch matches via television because the cameras have to adjust between the light dark areas of the pitch. During the first match in the stadium of the 2006 World Cup between England and Paraguay, a goal kick from England goalkeeper Paul Robinson struck the video cube and bounced into play.During the South Korea vs Togo match the roof was closed over the stadium, despite the weather being dry and sunny, presumably to shade the whole pitch and avoid the effects of the shadow. This decision was criticised by some because it meant the stadium became very hot and humid on an already hot and humid day.2006 FIFA World CupThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.The following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:DateTime (CET)Team #1ResultTeam #2RoundSpectators10 June 200615.00England1 &ndash; 0ParaguayGroup B]]48,00013 June 200615.00South Korea2 &ndash; 1TogoGroup G]]48,00017 June 200615.00Portugal2 &ndash; 0IranGroup D]]48,00021 June 200621.00NED0 &ndash; 0ArgentinaGroup C]]48,0001 July 200621.00Brazil0 &ndash; 1FranceQuarter-finals]]48,000Other eventsFollowing musicians played shows at the Waldstadion:Céline DionBon JoviGuns N' RosesGenesisHerbert GrönemeyerMichael JacksonMadonnaMarius Müller-WesternhagenPrinceRolling StonesBruce SpringsteenSupertrampTina TurnerU2In August and September 2007, the Commerzbank-Arena temporarily served as the home ground of the newly promoted 2nd Bundesliga side SV Wehen Wiesbaden, because their new stadium, the Brita-Arena, was not ready to host matches until October. The club played four league matches in the stadium, staying undefeated as they won three times and drew once.In 2008-09 the ground is also home ground of Bornheim based club FSV Frankfurt whose actual stadium Bornheimer Hang was not proved as suitable for the 2nd Bundesliga. Ironically the Bornheimer Hang was renovated for 3rd Liga's needs and now serves as home ground for Eintracht Frankfurt's reserve team, Eintracht Frankfurt U23.The Commerzbank-Arena was also the home ground of NFL Europe's Frankfurt Galaxy, and hosted three World Bowls. It hosted its third and final World Bowl on June 23, 2007, when the Frankfurt Galaxy lost to the Hamburg Sea Devils in World Bowl XV.Following bookings for the ground have already been confirmed:Jehovah's WitnessesDalai LamaDepeche ModeExternal linksOfficial site (in German and English)          Category:FIFA World Cup stadiums Category:UEFA European championship stadiums Category:Buildings and structures in Frankfurt Category:Eintracht Frankfurt Category:Football venues in Germany Category:Retractable-roof stadiums Category:Sport in Frankfurt Category:World Bowl venuesca:Commerzbank-Arena cs:Commerzbank-Arena da:Commerzbank-Arena de:Commerzbank-Arena et:Commerzbank-Arena es:Commerzbank-Arena fa:کومرزبانک آرنا fr:Commerzbank-Arena gl:Commerzbank-Arena id:Commerzbank-Arena it:Commerzbank-Arena lt:Commerzbank-Arena mr:कॉमर्स बँक एरेना nl:Commerzbank-Arena ja:ヴァルトシュタディオン no:Commerzbank-Arena pl:Commerzbank-Arena pt:Commerzbank-Arena ru:Коммерцбанк-Арена sq:Commerzbank-Arena szl:Commerzbank-Arena sr:Комерцбанк арена fi:Commerzbank-Arena sv:Commerzbank-Arena tr:Commerzbank-Arena zh:商業銀行球場
