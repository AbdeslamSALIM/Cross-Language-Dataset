He was born in Hazebrouck, France and currently resides in Lille with his wife and young son. From 2001 until 2005 he was part of the French professional cycling team Cofidis, often as the captain on the road, and then moved to the Belgian team Quick Step-Innergetic.Vasseur turned professional with the team Novemail in 1995, and switched to the GAN team in 1996 which then became Crédit Agricole in 1997. His first professional victory is also his most famous: it was his solo 147-km breakaway by which he won stage 5 of the 1997 Tour de France. He then wore the yellow jersey as the temporary race leader for 5 days.In the 2000 and 2001 seasons he rode for the U.S. Postal team and participated in the 2000 Tour de France. However, his exclusion from the 2001 Tour de France team led to his switch to the Cofidis team. He cited personal differences with the USPS team star Lance Armstrong which was widely quoted in French cycling publications.In 2004 Vasseur was arrested in suspicion of doping offences along with several other Cofidis riders, notably including then individual time trial champion David Millar. A counter-analysis later proved negative and Vasseur's name was then cleared. Vasseur also claimed some of the evidence in his witness statement had been forged. However, Vasseur was barred from riding in the 2004 Tour de France since the investigation had not concluded by the time that the race had started.Vasseur came from a family of cyclists: his father Alain Vasseur competed in the 1970, 71 and 74 editions of the Tour de France. His father Alain also won a stage of the Tour de France after a solo breakaway.Vasseur is considered an all-rounder who can do well in a variety of races. He has raced through all of the spring classics such as Ronde van Vlaanderen and Paris-Roubaix, and has won a stage of the Dauphiné Libéré stage race.Palmares1997Tour de France stage 5Yellow Jersey 5 days20024 Jours de Dunkerque stage 5GP d'Isbergues2003Paris - Corrèze overall and stage 2Internationale Hessen-Rundfahrt overall and stage 1Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré stage 7Tour du Limousin stage 22004Tour de l'Ain stage 4Tour du Limousin stage 42006GP d'Isbergues2007Tour de France stage 10External linksFan website  Category:French cyclists Category:French Tour de France stage winners Category:1970 births Category:Living peopleda:Cédric Vasseur de:Cédric Vasseur es:Cédric Vasseur fr:Cédric Vasseur gl:Cédric Vasseur lb:Cédric Vasseur nl:Cédric Vasseur no:Cédric Vasseur pl:Cédric Vasseur fi:Cédric Vasseur vls:Cédric Vasseur
