He is known for his weekly review column (appearing in the Chicago Sun-Times since 1967, and later online)RogerEbert.com and for two television programs Sneak Previews and Siskel &amp; Ebert at the Movies, which he co-hosted for a combined 23 years with Gene Siskel. After Siskel's death in 1999, he auditioned several potential replacements, ultimately choosing Richard Roeper to fill the open chair. The program was retitled Ebert & Roeper at the Movies in 2000. Although his name remains in the title, he has not appeared on the show since mid-2006 when he suffered a medical crisis which has left him unable to speak. Roeper continued to host the show through the 2007-2008 TV season with a rotating set of guest critics, with Michael Phillips easily having the most such appearances.Ebert ended his association with the show in July 2008, after the studio indicated they wished to take the show in a new direction. He still owns the trademark phrase "Two Thumbs Up" along with the widow of Gene Siskel. Roeper had announced his decision to leave the show one day earlier.Ebert, Roger; &quot;Statement from Roger Ebert&quot; rogerebert.suntimes.com; [[July 21], 2008]Ebert's movie reviews are syndicated to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad. He has written more than 15 books, including his annual movie yearbook. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win a Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. His television programs have also been widely syndicated, and have been nominated for Emmy awards. In February 1995, a section of Chicago's Erie Street near the CBS Studios was given the honorary name Siskel & Ebert Way. Ebert was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in June 2005, the first professional film critic to receive one. Roger Ebert was named as the most influential pundit in America by Forbes Magazine, beating the likes of Bill Maher, Lou Dobbs, and Bill O'Reilly. He has honorary degrees from the University of Colorado, the American Film Institute, and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.Since 1994, he has written a Great Movies series of individual reviews of what he deems to be the most important films of all time. Since 1999, he has hosted the annual Roger Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival in Champaign, Illinois.Early lifeEbert was born in Urbana, Illinois, the son of Annabel (née Stumm) and Walter H.

However, he began his writing career with letters of comment to the science fiction fanzines of the era. In his senior year he was co-editor of his high school newspaper, The Echo.In 1958, Ebert won the Illinois High School Association state speech championship in Radio Speaking, an event that simulates radio newscasts.Roger Ebert in the IHSA list of state speech championsEbert received his undergraduate degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was editor of The Daily Illini[http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/history/781830,CST-NWS-high07.stng "Ebert Named Film Critic" Chicago Sun-Times.

He was a doctoral candidate in English at the University of Chicago. He was a Sun-Times feature reporter when the film critic position was offered to him by the Sun-Times.CareerEbert began his professional critic career in 1967, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times. In 1969, his review of Night of the Living Dead[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19670105/REVIEWS/701050301/1023 Ebert’s review of Night of the Living Dead] January 5, 1967) was published in Reader's Digest.In 1975, Ebert and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune began co-hosting a weekly film review television show, Sneak Previews, which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW. The show was picked up by PBS in 1978 for national distribution. In 1982, the critics moved to a syndicated commercial television show named At the Movies, and later, Siskel & Ebert at The Movies, where they were known for their "thumbs up/thumbs down" review summaries. When Siskel died in 1999, the producers retitled the show Roger Ebert at the Movies with rotating co-hosts. In September 2000, fellow Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co-host and the show was renamed At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper.Ebert has also done DVD audio commentaries for several films, including Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Dark City, Floating Weeds, Crumb, and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (for which Ebert also wrote the screenplay, based on a story that he co-wrote with Russ Meyer).On the day of the Academy Awards, Ebert and Roeper typically appear on the live pre-awards show, [http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=oscars&amp;id=3928258 An Evening at the Academy Awards: The Arrivals.] This airs prior to the awards ceremony show, which also features red carpet interviews and fashion commentary. They also appear on the post-awards show entitled An Evening at the Academy Awards: the Winners. Both shows are produced and aired by the American Broadcasting Company owned station in Los Angeles station KABC-TV. This show also airs on WLS-TV as well as the network's other owned stations along with being syndicated to several ABC affiliates and other broadcasters outside the country. Ebert did not appear on the 2007 show for medical reasons.Other career highlightsAs a teenager, Ebert was involved in science fiction fandom,See his autobiographical essay in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, &quot;Thought Experiments: How Propeller-Heads, BNFs, Sercon Geeks, Newbies, Recovering GAFIAtors, and Kids in the Basements Invented the World Wide Web, All Except for the Delivery System.&quot; writing articles for fanzines, including Richard A. Lupoff's ''Xero''.Ebert co-wrote the screenplay for the 1970 cult film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, directed by Russ Meyer, and likes to joke about being responsible for the poorly received film. Ebert and Meyer also made Beneath the Valley of the Ultra-Vixens, Up!, and others, and were involved in the ill-fated Sex Pistols movie Who Killed Bambi?.In 1996, he appeared in "Pitch", a documentary by acclaimed Canadian film maker, Kenny Hotz.Other appearancesIn 2003, Ebert had a cameo appearance in the film Abby Singer in which he recited the white parasol monologue from Citizen Kane.Ebert, along with colleague Gene Siskel, guest starred on an episode of the animated TV series The Critic. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants Jay as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film Sleepless in Seattle.TV.com Episode summary: The Critic - "Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice"Style of critique and personal tastesEbert has described his critical approach to films as "relative, not absolute"; he reviews a film for what he feels will be its prospective audience, yet always with at least some consideration as to its value as a whole. He awards four stars to films of the highest quality, and generally a half star to those of the lowest unless he considers the film to be "artistically inept" and/or "morally repugnant" in which case, it will receive no stars.[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19820101/REVIEWS/201010315/1023 Death Wish II review] by Roger EbertEbert has emphasized that his star ratings have little meaning if not considered in the context of the review itself. Occasionally (as in his review of Basic Instinct 2), Ebert's star rating may seem at odds with his written opinion. Ebert has acknowledged such cases, stating "I cannot recommend the movie, but ... why the hell can't I? Just because it's God-awful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? God-awful and boring, that would be a reason."[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060330/REVIEWS/60323008 Ebert's review of Basic Instinct 2] (March 21, 2006) In his review of The Manson Family, he gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that didn't count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences.[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050526/REVIEWS/50510003/1023 Ebert's review of The Longest Yard (2005 version) at rogerebert.com; May 27, 2005]Ebert has reprinted his starred reviews in movie guides. In his numerous appearances on The Howard Stern Show, he has been frequently challenged to defend his ratings. Ebert stood by his opinions with one notable exception: when Stern pointed out that Ebert had given The Godfather Part II a three-star rating, but had given The Godfather Part III three and a half stars (however he has recently added Part II to his list of "Great Movies").Ebert has occasionally accused some films of having an unwholesome political agenda, and the word "fascist" accompanied more than one of Ebert's reviews of the law-and-order films of the 1970s such as Dirty Harry. He is also suspicious of films that are passed off as art, but which he sees as merely lurid and sensational. Ebert has leveled this charge against such films as The Night Porter[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19750210/REVIEWS/502100301/1023 Ebert's review of The Night Porter at rogerebert.com; February 10, 1975] and Blue Velvet.[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19860919/REVIEWS/609190301/1023 Ebert's Review of Blue Velvet at rogerebert.com; September 19, 1986]Ebert's reviews can clash with the overall reception of movies, as evidenced by his negative review of the 1988 Bruce Willis action film Die Hard, and his positive review of 1997's Speed 2: Cruise Control. Ebert often makes heavy use of mocking sarcasm, especially when reviewing movies he considers bad. At other times he is direct, famously in his review of the 1994 Rob Reiner comedy North, which he concluded by writing that:Ebert's reviews are also often characterized by dry wit.Yamato, Jen; &quot;Meet a Critic: Roger Ebert!: RT chats with America's favorite critic.&quot;; rottentomatoes.com; [[December 19], 2007] In January 2005, when Rob Schneider insulted Los Angeles Times movie critic Patrick Goldstein, who panned his movie Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo by commenting that the critic was unqualified because he had never won the Pulitzer Prize, Ebert intervened by stating that, as a Pulitzer winner, he was qualified to review the film, and bluntly told Schneider, "Your movie sucks."[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50725001%2F1023&amp;AID1=%2F20050811%2FREVIEWS%2F50725001%2F1023&amp;AID2= Ebert's review of Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo]Ebert has been known to comment on films using his own Roman Catholic upbringing[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2005/A-Life-in-the-Movies/index.php?cp=1&amp;si=0#artanc A Life In The Movies, Carol Felsenthal, Chicago Magazine December 2005] Ebert's Catholic upbringing is noted on Page 1; His later agnosticism is noted on Page 2. as a point of reference, and has been critical of films he believes are grossly ignorant or insulting of Catholicism, such as Stigmata[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19990101/REVIEWS/901010302/1023 Ebert's review of Stigmata] (January 1, 1999) and Priest,[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950407/REVIEWS/504070308/1023 Roger Ebert.

Ebert has clarified that he does not disparage horror movies as a whole, but that he draws a distinction between films like Nosferatu and The Silence of the Lambs, which he regards as "masterpieces", and films which he feels consist of nothing more than groups of teenagers being killed off with the exception of one survivor to populate a sequel.Gurnow, Michael; &quot;Roger Ebert’s Bloody Ax: An Examination of the Film Critic’s Elitist Dismissal of the Horror Film&quot;In August 2004 Stephen King, criticizing what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films by critics, included Ebert among a number of "formerly reliable critics who seem to have gone remarkably soft &ndash; not to say softhearted and sometimes softheaded &ndash; in their old age."King, Stephen, &quot;The Four-Star Follies&quot;, August 20, 2004.

He conducted an onstage public "conversation" with Herzog at the Telluride Film Festival in 2004, after a screening of Herzog's film Invincible at the Ebert's Overlooked Film Festival. Herzog dedicated his 2008 film Encounters at the End of the World to Ebert, and Ebert responded with a heartfelt public letter of gratitude.Views on the film industryEbert is an outspoken opponent of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. He has repeatedly criticized their decisions regarding which movies are "suitable for children." For example, Whale RiderEbert's &quot;Movie Answer Man column&quot;, [[November 16], 2003] and School of Rock[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031003/REVIEWS/310030304/1023 Ebert's review of School of Rock] (October 3, 2003) were both rated PG-13 (not recommended for children under the age of thirteen), while he thought both were inoffensive enough for schoolchildren and contained positive messages for that age group. In his review of ''The Exorcist'', Ebert said it was "stupefying" that the film received a rating of "R" from the MPAA instead of an "X" (suitable only for adults). He has frequently argued that the MPAA is more likely to give an "R" rating for mild sexual content than for highly violent content. In his review of The Passion of The Christ (to which he awarded a perfect four stars), he was quoted as saying: "I said the film is the most violent I have ever seen. The MPAA's R rating is definitive proof that the organization either will never give the NC-17 rating for violence alone, or was intimidated by the subject matter. If it had been anyone other than Jesus up on that cross, I have a feeling that NC-17 would have been automatic."[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040224/REVIEWS/402240301/1023 Ebert's review of The Passion of the Christ; February 24, 2004]He also frequently laments that cinemas outside major cities are "booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes", making high-quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers.Ebert, Roger, "They got it right," Chicago Sun Times (29 January 2004)Ebert is a strong advocate for Maxivision 48, in which the movie projector runs at 48 frames per second, as compared to the usual 24 frames per second. He is opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see.Ebert's &quot;Movie Answer Man column&quot;, [[February 19], 2006]Personal life, and Jason Patric at the 2004 Savannah Film Festival]]Since the 1970s, Ebert has worked for the University of Chicago as a guest lecturer, teaching a night class on film.

In February of that year, surgeons at Northwestern Memorial Hospital were able to successfully remove the cancer with clean margins. He later underwent surgery in 2003 for cancer in his salivary gland and in December 2003, he underwent a four-week course of radiation treatment as a follow-up to the surgery on his salivary gland, which altered his voice slightly. As he battled the illness, Ebert continued to be a dedicated critic of film, not missing a single opening while undergoing treatment.He underwent further surgery June 16, 2006, just two days before his 64th birthday, to remove cancer near his right jaw and a section of jaw bone.Email from Roger, [[August 17], 2006], posted on his websiteOn July 1, Ebert was hospitalized in serious condition after his carotid artery burst near the surgery site and he "came within a breath of death".Ebert's words in his review of Sicko, June 29, 2007 He later learned that the burst was likely a side effect of his treatment, which involved neutron beam radiation. He was subsequently kept bed-ridden to prevent further damage to the scarred vessels in his neck while he slowly recovered from multiple surgeries and the rigorous treatment regimen. At one point, his status was so precarious that Ebert had a tracheostomy done on his neck to reduce the effort of breathing while he recovered.Ebert taped enough TV programs with his co-host Richard Roeper to keep him on the air for a few weeks. However, his extended convalescence has necessitated a series of "guest critics" to co-host with Roeper, including Jay Leno (a good friend to both Ebert and Roeper), Kevin Smith, John Ridley, Toni Senecal, Christy Lemire, Michael Phillips, Aisha Tyler, Fred Willard, Anne Thompson, A.O. Scott, Mario Van Peebles, George Pennacchio, Brad Silberling, and John Mellencamp. As of April 2008, most recent episodes have featured either Michael Phillips or A.O. Scott as co-host.An update from Ebert on October 11, 2006 confirmed his bleeding problems had been resolved.

Ebert saw the flowers as a kind gesture and publicly thanked Schneider, and said that Schneider may have made a bad film, but he was not a bad man. Ebert also expressed hope that Schneider would make a film that Ebert would find wonderful.Ebert, Roger; &quot;A bouquet arrives&quot;; rogerebert.suntimes.com; [[May 7], 2007]After a three-month absence, the first movie he reviewed was The Queen. Ebert made his first public appearance since the summer of 2006 at Ebertfest on April 25, 2007. He was unable to speak but communicated through his wife, Chaz, through the use of written notes. His opening words to the crowd of devout fans at the festival were a reference to the film he co-wrote with Russ Meyer, Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: "It's my happening and it freaks me out." Most fans and journalists believed the remark to be a reference to the dramatic rise in popularity of Ebertfest over the past few years. Others believed the line to be a subtle reference to how, instead of acting as a critic, he had actually become the protagonist, to the degree where it 'freaked' him out — a sardonic and endearing reference typical of Ebert's writing style and spoken commentary.In an interview with WLS-TV in Chicago, he said, "I was told photos of me in this condition would attract the gossip papers — so what?" When asked by the Sun-Times in an April 23 article about his decision to return to the limelight, Ebert remarked, "We spend too much time hiding illness."Ebert, Roger; &quot;It wouldn't be Ebertfest without Roger&quot; April 23, 2007Fans at his website have remarked his public appearances have been inspirational to cancer victims and survivors around the country.Article and Video report with Full Interview from WLS-TV, Chicago, April 25 He will need reconstructive surgery on his jaw, a relatively dangerous procedure in light of the damage to the vessels already seen when his artery burst during earlier treatment.On the road to recoveryEbert returned to reviewing on May 18, 2007, when three of his reviews (including Shrek the Third) were published by the Chicago Sun-Times as well as his website, a role that his editor had shouldered during the critic's illness. Thereafter he slowly worked back up to his previous output of 5-6 reviews a week plus a "Great Movies" review. He also resumed his "Answer Man" column.In a July 21, 2007 commentary on a rebuttal to Clive Barker, he revealed that he had lost the ability to speak, but not to write. He recently posted reviews of the 2006 film Casino Royale and the 2007 films Zodiac and Ratatouille with a note that he was in the process of going back and reviewing some of the movies that were released during his absence.[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/REVIEWS/708230308 Ebert's review of Zodiac] (August 24, 2007) He attended the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, while awaiting surgery that was hoped to restore his voice.&quot;Ebert weighs in on TIFF&quot;, TheStar.com, 2007-09-05Currently, he talks using a computerized voice system.

A Modest Proposal to End the Junk Mail Plague not to purchase anything offered through email spam. The pledge is worded by Ebert as follows:Under no circumstances will I ever purchase anything offered to me as the result of an unsolicited e-mail message. Nor will I forward chain letters, petitions, mass mailings, or virus warnings to large numbers of others. This is my contribution to the survival of the online community. Ebert coined the term during a panel at the University of Colorado at Boulder's Conference on World Affairs in 1996. He wrote the text which appears above and encouraged everyone to take the pledge. It was subsequently published in the December 1996 issue of Yahoo! Internet Life magazine in Ebert's column titled "Enough! A Modest Proposal to End the Junk Mail Plague."The Boulder Pledge has become one of the basic principles of the anti-spam community in an attempt to make e-mail spam less profitable.BibliographyEach year, Ebert publishes Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook, a book containing all his movie reviews from the last three years, as well as essays and other writings.
