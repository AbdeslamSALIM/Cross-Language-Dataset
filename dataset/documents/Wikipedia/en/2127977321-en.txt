It would be the band's first studio album released with Ronnie Wood as the replacement for Mick Taylor. Ron Wood had played 12-string acoustic guitar on the track "It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)" of the 1974 Rolling Stones album It's Only Rock 'n' Roll and appears on half of the Black and Blue album tracks (mostly backing vocals) with Wayne Perkins and Harvey Mandel playing guitar on the remaining titles.HistoryThe Rolling Stones returned to Munich, Germany - the recording site of their previously released It's Only Rock 'n' Roll - in December 1974 and began the recording of their new album at Musicland Studios, with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards - as The Glimmer Twins - producing again. With a view to releasing it in time for the summer 1975 Tour of the Americas, the band broke for the holidays and returned in January in Rotterdam, Netherlands to continue working - all the while auditioning new guitarists as they recorded. Among the hopefuls were Jeff Beck, Rory Gallagher, Harvey Mandel, Wayne Perkins, Peter Frampton and Ronnie Wood (although only Mandel's, Perkins' and Wood's guitar work would appear on the finished album). With much work to follow, it was decided to delay the album for the following year and release the Made in the Shade compilation instead. "Cherry Oh Baby" (which was a cover version of an early reggae song) would be the only song from the upcoming album sporadically played on the Americas tour.Following the conclusion of the tour, The Rolling Stones went to Montreux, Switzerland in October for some overdub work, returning to Musicland Studios in Munich in December to perform similar work. After some final touch-ups, Black and Blue was completed in New York City in February 1976.Stylistically, Black and Blue - so named for its black music influences - embraces funk with "Hot Stuff"; reggae with their cover of "Cherry Oh Baby"; and jazz with "Melody", featuring the talents of Billy Preston - a heavy contributor to the album. Musical and thematic styles were merged on the seven-minute "Memory Motel", with both Jagger and Richards contributing lead vocals to a love song embedded within a life-on-the-road tale.Released in April 1976 - with "Fool to Cry", a worldwide Top 10 hit, as its lead single - Black and Blue reached #2 in the UK and spent an interrupted four week spell at #1 in the US, going platinum there. Critical view was polarized, with some finding its emphasis on jamming a reflection of the perceived weak songwriting, while others consider it an undervalued gem. Lester Bangs panned the album (and the band) in Creem, saying “the heat's off, because it's all over, they really don't matter anymore or stand for anything” and “This is the first meaningless Rolling Stones album”. Creem Vol. 8 Number 2 July 1976 "State of the Art: Bland on Bland"Bill Wyman released a version of "Melody" with his Rhythm Kings, and claimed the song was written by Preston.The album was promoted with a controversial billboard on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood that depicted the model Anita Russell, bruised and bound (by Mick Jagger&quot;Anita Russell: Stones&quot;) under the phrase "I'm Black and Blue from the Rolling Stones — and I love it!" The billboard was removed after protests by the feminist group Women Against Violence Against Women, although it earned the band widespread press coverage.Child, Lee.
