 Hotel Rwanda is a historical drama film about the hotelier Paul Rusesabagina (played by Don Cheadle) during the Rwandan Genocide. Directed by Irish filmmaker Terry George, it was co-produced in 2004 by US, British, Italian, and South African companies, and the first ever co-production between the rival independent film studios Lions Gate Films and United Artists. It was filmed mostly in South Africa, with some second unit filming in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. &lt;/ref&gt;Hotel Rwanda has been called an African Schindler's List. Ten years before the film was released, some of the worst atrocities in human history took place in the small country of Rwanda — and in an era of high-speed communication and round the clock news, the events went almost unnoticed by the rest of the world. In only three months, almost a million people were slaughtered. Faced with these unspeakable actions, an ordinary hotel manager summons enormous courage to save the lives of his family and more than a thousand other refugees by granting them shelter in the besieged Hôtel des Mille Collines.PlotThe film Hotel Rwanda, set in 1994, is based on the Rwandan genocide, in which over 800,000 people, mainly Tutsi, were killed by extremist Hutu militias.  In the film, tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples lead to a civil war in which the Tutsis are massacred because of their elevated status that rose from their past allegiance with European colonists. Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), the manager of Sabena Hôtel des Mille Collines, is Hutu but his wife, Tatiana (Sophie Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage makes him a traitor to Hutu extremists, most prominently George Rutaganda, a friendly supplier to the hotel who also is the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal anti-Tutsi militia. He unsuccessfully pressures Paul into joining the group at the beginning of the film.Upon the eve of the genocide, Paul’s neighbors and family look to him for leadership, and with his cunning and bribes he is just barely able to rescue them from the armed Hutu mobs who are determined to wipe out all Tutsi. After bargaining with a Rwandan Army officer for the safety of his friends and family, Paul brings them to his hotel. More refugees flood into the hotel as the United Nations's refugee camp becomes either too dangerous or too crowded to be safe. The hotel also becomes overcrowded, and Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, and maintain the appearance of a functioning high-class hotel.The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interhamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. This indifference from the UN continues despite Oliver's tired attempts to protect the Tutsi refugees, and his angry disdain for the Western powers who do not care for Rwanda.As the Interhamwe besiege the hotel, the terrible stress takes its toll on Paul and his family. The UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, but are turned back after being stopped by rioting Hutu mobs and the Interhamwe. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul speaks to the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Fana Mokoena) and attempts to blackmail him with threats of being tried as a war criminal. Bizimungu reluctantly agrees and they return to the hotel, only to find it under attack.Bizimungu's troops finally bring an end to the chaos as Paul frantically looks for his wife and family, thinking they had killed themselves like Paul told them to if Rutaganda's men invaded the hotel. After a terrifying ordeal, Paul finds them hiding in the bathroom. The family and the hotel refugees finally leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy, and they travel through retreating masses of homeless Hutu refugees and Interhamwe militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines. In the final scene, Paul finds his two young nieces whose parents' fates are unknown, and takes them along with his family out of the country.CastDon Cheadle as Paul RusesabaginaSophie Okonedo as Tatiana RusesabaginaNick Nolte as Colonel Oliver (based on Roméo Dallaire).Fana Mokoena as General Augustin BizimunguCara Seymour as Madame Pat ArcherJoaquin Phoenix as journalist Jack DaglishJean Reno as Sabena Airlines President Mr. TillensDesmond Dube as DubeHakeem Kae-Kazim as George RutagandaReleaseThe film opened in limited release.
