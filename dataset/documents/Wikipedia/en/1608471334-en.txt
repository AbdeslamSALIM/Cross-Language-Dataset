Gdov () is a town in Pskov Oblast, Russia, situated on the river Gdovka, just two kilometers from its outflow into Lake Peipus. Population: Gdov was founded in the 14th century, as an outpost guarding the city of Pskov. Between 1431 and 1434, Pskovians built a fortress there, the remains of which can be seen to this very day. The town was attacked on numerous occasions by Swedes and Poles (e.g., during the Russo–Swedish War (1590–1595) and Ingrian War), but was finally returned to Russia in 1617.In 1780, Gdov formally acquired the status of a town; its coat of arms was granted on May 28, 1781. Between 1874 and 1912 Gdov issued stamps for the Zemstvo post. The first stamp, worth two kopecks, appeared on April 16, 1874. Stamp production ceased, however, with the coming of World War I. On May 1919, the Northern Army, under General Rodzianko, captured Gdov, along with Pskov and Yamburg.In 1944, the Wehrmacht deliberately destroyed Gdov's churches, which have been ranked among the loveliest specimens of Pskovian medieval architecture. The town's historic monuments have been partly restored after the World War II.An active military base, Smuravyevo, was located northeast of the town.Notable peopleHieromartyr Benjamin, bishop of GdovArchbishop Dimitry of Gdov (also Demetrius) (arrested in 1929, at the age of 75; later shot in 1938 after eight years of solitary confinement in the Yaroslavl prison)ReferencesExternal linksEnglish guideDetailed archiectural history  Category:Cities and towns in Pskov Oblast Category:Settlements established in the 14th centuryar:غدوف be:Горад Гдоў de:Gdow et:Oudova es:Gdov eo:Gdov fr:Gdov hr:Gdov it:Gdov lt:Gdovas nl:Gdov no:Gdov pl:Gdow pt:Gdov ru:Гдов sr:Гдов fi:Outova tg:Гдов zh:格多夫
