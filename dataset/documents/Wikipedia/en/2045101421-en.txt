It debuted on ABC as a midseason replacement for Boston Legal on March 27, 2005, immediately following Desperate Housewives.The title of the show is inspired by the classic medical textbook Gray's Anatomy. The series revolves around Dr. Meredith Grey, played by Ellen Pompeo, who began the show as a surgical intern at Seattle Grace Hospital in .On February 11, 2008, ABC renewed Grey’s Anatomy for the 2008-09 television season.ABC Announces Scripted Show Renewals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; However, there is a possibility that the production of Season 5 of Grey’s Anatomy will be affected by the upcoming Screen Actors Guild strike.TV Networks Brace for Potential Actors Strike, Yahoo!, June 19, 2008Cast and charactersThe characters of the series include a group of surgical interns and the various physicians who serve as mentors to the interns in their professional and personal lives. The show's producers used a "blind-casting" technique, resulting in a racially diverse cast. All roles for Grey’s Anatomy are cast without the characters' race being pre-specified, in keeping with creator Shonda Rhimes' vision of diversity.'Grey’s Anatomy' Goes Colorblind, The New York Times, May 8, 2005Towards the end of the third season, candidacy for the position of Chief Resident among the residents became a prominent subject, for Dr. Callie Torres and especially for Dr. Miranda Bailey.

The first season was shortened by the network to nine episodes instead of 14. (The original season finale was "Bring the Pain.").Meredith Grey, the daughter of the once-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, becomes an intern at the Seattle Grace Hospital. She meets fellow interns Cristina Yang, Isobel "Izzie" Stevens, and George O'Malley who would be her closest friends during the intern program. Other characters include Dr. Miranda Bailey, nicknamed "Nazi" due to her "tough love" capability; Alex Karev, an intern who is not very popular with the others (especially Izzie); and renowned surgeons Dr. Derek Shepherd and Dr. Preston Burke. The chief of surgery is Richard Webber, who was once more than close friends with Meredith's mother.The season chronicles the first few months of the internship program and the day-to-day life of a surgical intern. Recurring plots include Meredith's battle to keep her mother's Alzheimer's disease a secret and her relationship with Dr. Shepherd. Others include George's infatuation with Meredith and a power struggle between Dr. Burke and Dr. Shepherd in the hospital. The season's end introduces Kate Walsh as Dr. Addison Montgomery-Shepherd, Derek's estranged wife.

The first season had originally contained 14 episodes, representing ABC's original midseason order for the show. However, it was decided to end the season early because ABC executives wished for the show's first season to end with ABC's Desperate Housewives (which had the timeslot before Grey’s Anatomy for the first two seasons).Rather than condensing or throwing out plotlines, Grey’s Anatomy producers chose to end the first season with the ninth episode and save the following episodes for the second season. Episodes 10-14 were then held and broadcast as the first five episodes of Season 2. ABC ordered 22 episodes in addition to the five being carried over, bringing the total number of episodes for the second season to 27. Bring the Pain, which aired as the series' 14th episode, has been cited in series creator Shonda Rhimes' blog as having been originally intended as the first season finale.Grey Matter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The second season focuses on Meredith and Derek's relationship, which came to an abrupt halt when it was revealed that Derek is married to surgeon Addison Montgomery. Izzie and Alex embark on a relationship of their own (although cut short when Izzie falls for heart patient Denny Duquette), as do Cristina Yang and Preston Burke. Doctor Bailey becomes pregnant, and more is revealed about her personal life. On some of the weeks airing after its highly-watched February 5, 2006 post-Super Bowl episode, the program attracted more viewers than its lead-in, Desperate Housewives.Once the second season ended on May 15, 2006, the show had two previously recurring actors, Sarah Ramirez (Callie Torres) and Eric Dane (Mark Sloan), join the regular cast. The series' opening credit sequence was also dropped by the last half of the second season, replaced by a title card displayed at the end of the first act and credits displayed over the opening of the second act of each episode.Season Three: 2006-2007 Nielsen Ranking (2006-07 U.S. TV season; based on average total viewers per episode): #4 (22.3 million viewers) [[Image:Greys-anatomy-3-cast.JPG|thumb|250px|The season 3 cast of Grey’s Anatomy]]On May 16, 2006, the morning following the close of the second season, ABC announced plans for a third season of Grey’s Anatomy to anchor the network's Thursday evening programming,ABC Fall 2006 Schedule, Zap2It.com, July 11, 2006 set to air at 9 p.m. ET. ABC first tested the series' potential for Thursday audiences on February 9, 2006, as it aired an encore of the Super Bowl XL-leadout episode titled "It's the End of the World." The following Thursday, February 16, 2006, the network repeated the second part of the story arc, "(As We Know It)." Both airings began at 9:30 p.m. ET, and thus positioned Grey’s Anatomy against CBS' CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and Without a Trace, Fox Network's The OC, and NBC's long-running medical drama ER. Solid performance on these nights, with the repeat airings maintaining a strong second-place finish, may have been influential in the fall scheduling decision.The move to Thursdays was viewed as a vote of confidence in the series from ABC, as well as a bid to attract more advertising dollars, since movie studios heavily advertise movies on Thursday evenings for that weekend's box office. The move was cited as one factor for competing network NBC's decision to move its own Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, originally intended to air Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET. ABC announced on July 18, 2006, that the third season would premiere on September 21, 2006.The series assumed its new Thursday slot on July 6, 2006, as part of a two-hour event featuring a repeat of the pilot episode, "A Hard Day's Night." Throughout July and August, the series aired twice weekly — once in the new Thursday time period, and once in its previous Sunday time period. Grey’s Anatomy performed strongly in the show's new timeslot in its season premiere. It was able to snatch away the #1 position from CSI: Crime Scene Investigation during the 9 p.m. hour, bringing in an impressive 25.14 million viewers throughout the hour and a strong 10.9 rating in the vital 18-49 demographic. In comparison, CSI's season premiere earned a competitive 22.04 million total viewership and a 7.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic.Media Life MagazineThe third season ended on May 17, 2007. As the season came to a close, Burke called off his wedding to Cristina at the church, Chief Webber stayed on as the Chief of Surgery, Callie was appointed Chief Resident, and George learned he failed the final intern exam. The relationship between Derek and Meredith, as well as the triangle between Callie, George, and Izzie were left unresolved.

Knight a "faggot" during an on-set altercation with Patrick Dempsey. Afterwards, Knight came out about his sexual orientation, following the attendant media speculation. While Washington denied using the word, he issued a public statement apologizing for his "unfortunate use of words."Golden GlobesThe controversy was reignited at the 2007 Golden Globe Awards, after the show won for Best Drama Series, the cast and crew appeared in the press room to answer reporters' questions. While creator Shonda Rhimes was being asked about the incident, Washington unexpectedly stepped in front of the microphone and stated: "No, I did not call T.R. a faggot." (The Hollywood Foreign Press Association placed the footage on their website.)Afterwards, in an interview with Access Hollywood, Katherine Heigl criticized Washington for revisiting the incident publicly and using the slur in the press room, and said "he needs to just not speak in public.

Washington's response, in a statement released by his publicist, was "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore." He has also spoken out about the controversy and said that "I have to clear my name. I'll start from the beginning. I'm telling everything. So here's the truth ... I used the word during a disagreement with Patrick Dempsey. I apologized for that. We shook hands and went back to work." He has also stated that it was Knight who spun the slur into a personal attack, alleging it may have been to increase his salary or storylines; Washington has also said he is considering legal action.

A list of all the songs featured in each episode, which are all selected, mixed and supervised by Alexandra Patsavas, can be found on the program's official website.http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/music?pn=mguide Patsavas similarly gained acclaim for selecting the music used for the FOX series The O.C. prior to her work with the ABC series. A second soundtrack, featuring songs from the series' second season, was released September 12, 2006.In addition to use within the series, certain songs have been become key to promotion of Grey’s Anatomy. Prior to the series debut, The Postal Service's song "Such Great Heights" was used as part of series previews aired on ABC. As the series has continued, it has been instrumental to the success of songs such as Snow Patrol’s “Chasing Cars” and The Fray’s “How to Save a Life”, both of which became top 5 hits after appearing in the show. Anna Nalick's "Breathe (2 A.M.)" also regained popularity after appearing in the "As We Know It" episode (the second of a two-part episode which premiered after Super Bowl XL).http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Anna-Nalick&lt;/ref&gt; “Chasing Cars” gained in popularity after its use late in the second season, and was used in a video of second season clips. “How to Save a Life” was the song used for the series' third season promotional music video, and all Grey’s Anatomy previews for the season. Brandi Carlile’s “The Story” and Mat Kearney’s “Breathe In, Breathe Out” have also been featured prominently.Music plays a key role in the creation of Grey’s Anatomy. Each episode of the show is uniquely named after a song. The episode titles usually have something to do with the theme or moral of the episode's storyline and this moral is reproduced by the voice-overs heard at the beginning and end of each episode. Many artists featured on Grey’s Anatomy include Adele, Beck, Tegan and Sara, Kate Havnevik, Róisín Murphy, Snow Patrol, Interpol, Maria Taylor, Mat Kearney, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, Ingrid Michaelson, Joshua Radin, The Hereafter, Jem, Brandi Carlile, Anya Marina, Duffy, Corinne Bailey Rae, Chris Garneau, Devics, KT Tunstall, Sia, and Anna Nalick.References   See alsoHouse (TV series)‎ER (TV series)External linksOfficial WebsiteGrey Matter Writers' BlogGrey’s Anatomy Wiki - created by and for the fans!Watch full episodes of Grey’s Anatomy online now (Canada)Blog de Anatomía de GreyCategory:2005 television series debuts Category:2000s American television series Category:American Broadcasting Company network shows Category:American drama television series Category:Five television programmes Category:Grey's Anatomy Category:Medical television series Category:Serial drama television series Category:Television series by Buena Vista Television Category:Television shows set in Washingtonar:غريز أناتومي ast:Anatomía de Grey bn:গ্রে'স অ্যানাটমি (টিভি সিরিজ) bg:Анатомията на Грей (сериал) ca:Grey's Anatomy cs:Chirurgové da:Greys Hvide Verden de:Grey’s Anatomy et:Grey anatoomia es:Grey's Anatomy fa:آناتومی گری (مجموعه تلویزیونی) fr:Grey's Anatomy gl:Grey's Anatomy ko:그레이 아나토미 hr:Uvod u anatomiju it:Grey's Anatomy he:האנטומיה של גריי (סדרה) hu:A Grace klinika mk:Вовед во анатомија ms:Grey's Anatomy nl:Grey's Anatomy ja:グレイズ・アナトミー 恋の解剖学 no:Grey's Anatomy nn:Grey’s Anatomy pl:Chirurdzy pt:Grey's Anatomy ro:Anatomia lui Grey ru:Анатомия Грей sk:Klinika Grace sh:Grey's Anatomy fi:Greyn anatomia sv:Grey's Anatomy th:แพทย์มือใหม่ หัวใจเกินร้อย tr:Grey's Anatomy (dizi) zh:實習醫生
