Flag ratio: 2:3]] The national flag of Yemen () was adopted on May 22, 1990, the same day that North Yemen and South Yemen unified. The pattern of red, white and black stripes was also present on the flags of North and South Yemen, symbolizing Pan-Arabism, as are the flags of Egypt, Syria, Iraq among others.According to the official description, the red stands for the bloodshed of martyrs and unity; the white for a bright future; black for the dark past.Historical flagsBefore Yemen was united into present-day Republic of Yemen, it was split into North, and South. The North used the flag on the left (the flag of the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen), from 1927 to 1962, when it became the Yemen Arab Republic. The Yemen Arab Republic used a flag similar to the present-day flag of Yemen, except with a green star in the center of the white stripe. The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen in the South used a flag with a sky-blue triangle next to the hoist, with a red star. While the blue triangle and star design was the emblem of the Yemeni Socialist Party, the overall design of the flag was apparently influenced by the flag of Cuba, following the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s (Hendrikksen, 1982).
