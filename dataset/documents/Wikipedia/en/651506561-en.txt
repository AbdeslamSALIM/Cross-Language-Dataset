Released nearly five years after the phenomenon of Thriller, the album sold over twenty-five million copies worldwide, and shipped eight million units in the US. Bad is the only album in history to feature five Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles.HistoryRecordingJackson began recording demos for the anticipated follow-up to Thriller a few months after his last performance with The Jacksons after their successful Victory Tour. Recording took place between November 1986 and July 9, 1987Bad (Special Edition), liner notes (except for "Another Part of Me" which was recorded for ''Captain EO in 1986). Jackson wrote a reported sixty songs for the new album and recorded thirty, wanting to use them all on a three-disc set. Instead his longtime producer Quincy Jones cut it down to ten tracks and a bonus song making it a single LP. The CD release contained the bonus track, "Leave Me Alone". Jackson wrote nine of the eleven tracks himself while Terry Britten (writer of Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do With It") and Graham Lyle wrote "Just Good Friends" and Siedah Garrett and Glen Ballard wrote "Man in the Mirror". Contributions from other musicians included Stevie Wonder who sung a duet with Jackson on "Just Good Friends" while Steve Stevens contributed a guitar solo for "Dirty Diana". Originally Jones wanted "Bad" to have been a duet between Jackson and Prince; but apparently, Prince told him that the song "would be a hit without (him) on it". Years later, Prince (jokingly) explained his reason for declining was over either artist singing the song's "your butt is mine" lyric. Another song, "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", was also supposed to feature a famous female singer. Reportedly Barbra Streisand, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston all turned down the duet offer. R&B singer-songwriter Siedah Garrett was picked by Quincy Jones to sing with him on the song. According to Jones, song choices were difficult. For instance: he and Jackson deliberated over two MJ compositions intended for the album. One: "Streetwalker" favoured by the artist, and Jones' choice: "Another Part of Me". Jones said the dilemma was decided by Jackson's portly manager Frank DiLeo "shaking his butt" to "Another Part of Me". Jones joked: Jackson verbally chastised DiLeo, who he nicknamed "Rubba", for it.ReceptionBy the time Jackson released this album, sales of its predecessor, Thriller, had already reached forty million, raising expectations for Bad. Bad became the first of Jackson's albums to debut at number-one on the ''Billboard'' 200 where it remained for the next six consecutive weeks. The RIAA certified Bad for having sold eight million copies in the U.S. alone.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.K, the album sold 500,000 copies in just five days and is currently certified 13x platinum, for sales of 3.9 million making it Jackson's biggest-selling album in the UK. Globally, it's Jackson's overall second best-selling recording, with 25 million copies sold.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, p. 610–611&lt;/ref&gt;Jackson set another record with this album, becoming the first - and currently, only artist to have five songs to hit number-one from one album.Michael Jackson's History in the 1980s In July 2006, it was announced by the The Official UK Charts Company that Bad was the ninth biggest selling album in British history.http://www.mirror.co.uk/northernireland/news/tm_method=full%26objectid=18104022%26siteid=94762-name_page.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It turned out to be the last collaborative effort by Jackson and Jones, as Jackson moved on to write and produce more of his own records, particularly with Teddy Riley, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Rodney Jerkins.Rolling Stone stated that "even without a milestone recording like "Billie Jean", Bad is still a better record than Thriller." The magazine further went on to say that the "filler" content in Bad - including songs such as "Speed Demon", "Dirty Diana" and "Liberian Girl" - is written by Jackson himself, making Bad "richer, sexier and better than Thriller's forgettables."In 2001, a special edition was released with three new songs and a new booklet containing lyrics and never-before-seen photos.&quot;The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, Rolling Stone (2003-11-18).Marketing During the Bad period was one of the first times Jackson used marketing to his advantage, more so than he had with Thriller. A year before Bad, Jackson used several tactics to get the media interested in his short film, Captain EO, during the recording of Bad. Jackson played a space captain in the mini-film, which was produced by George Lucas. By the time Jackson released Bad, he produced a commemorative special on his life, "The Magic Returns", which aired on CBS. At the end of the documentary, the channel debuted Jackson's "Bad", which featured then up-and-coming actor Wesley Snipes, in its mini-film version. Jackson's marketing strategy, mastered by Frank DiLeo among others, also included Jackson producing another mini-movie around the time of the Bad tour. That film, Moonwalker, included performances of songs from "Bad" including "Speed Demon", "Leave Me Alone" and "Smooth Criminal", the latter two released as sole videos at the end of the film. Jackson also used the opportunity to write about his life up until that point releasing 1988's Moonwalk. Jackson's tour for "Bad" did well grossing $125 million by the end of its tenure. Though Jackson furthered his stance as a global pop superstar, in America, he failed to match to the sales of Thriller having some in the media calling it a "disappointment" compared to Thriller.Track listingAll songs composed by Michael Jackson, unless otherwise noted.Note: There were a number of changes following the re-pressings of Bad, as compared to the original 1987 release.Michael Jackson: For The Record.
