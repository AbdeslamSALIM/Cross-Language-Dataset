 MeshID         = D007970 | Leukopenia (or leukocytopenia, or leucopenia, from Greek λευκό-white and πενία-deficiency) is a decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells (leukocytes) in the blood. As the principal function of white cells is to combat infection, a decrease in the number of these cells can place patients at increased risk for infection.In pancytopenia, the other cell types in the blood (red blood cells and platelets) are similarly affected.Neutropenia is a decrease in the number of circulating neutrophil granulocytes, the most abundant white blood cells. The terms leukopenia and neutropenia may occasionally be used interchangeably, as the neutrophil count is the most important indicator of infection risk. However, neutropenia is more properly considered a subset of leukopenia as a whole.CausesLow white cell counts are associated with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, leukemia (as malignant cells overwhelm the bone marrow), myelofibrosis and aplastic anemia (failure of white and red cell creation, along with poor platelet production). In addition, many common medications can cause leukopenia (eg. minocyclen, a commonly prescribed antibiotic).Other causes of low white blood cell count include: Influenza, systemic lupus erythematosus, typhus, malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, dengue, Rickettsial infections, enlargement of the spleen, folate deficiencies, psittacosis and sepsis. Many other causes exist, such as a deficiency in certain minerals such as copper and zinc.DiagnosisLeukopenia can be identified with a complete blood count.Medications causing leukopeniaSome medications can have an impact on the number and function of white blood cells. Medications which can cause leukopenia include clozapine, an antipsychotic medication with a rare adverse effect leading to the total absence of all granulocytes (neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils). Other medications include immunosuppressive drugs, such as sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and cyclosporine. Interferons used to treat multiple sclerosis, like Rebif, Avonex, and Betaseron, can also cause leukopenia.External linksCategory:Blood disorders  de:Leukopenie es:Leucopenia fr:Leucopénie it:Leucopenia nl:Leukopenie pl:Leukopenia pt:Leucopenia ru:Лейкопения sk:Leukopénia sl:Levkopenija sv:Leukopeni tr:Lökopeni
