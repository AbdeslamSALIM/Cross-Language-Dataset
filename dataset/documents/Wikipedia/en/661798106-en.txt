From KDE: GNU General Public License and othersKDE Licensing Policy| working_state = Current | website = desktopbsd.net DesktopBSD is a UNIX-derivative, desktop-oriented operating system based on FreeBSD. Its goal is to combine the stability of FreeBSD with the ease-of-use of KDE, which is the default graphical user interface. It is available for the IA-32 (also known as 32-bit x86) and AMD64 platforms.History and developmentDesktopBSD is essentially a customized installation of FreeBSD and is not a fork of FreeBSD. DesktopBSD is always based on FreeBSD's latest stable branch but incorporates certain customized, pre-installed software such as KDE and DesktopBSD utilities and configuration files.A common misconception about DesktopBSD is that it is intended as a rival to PC-BSD as a BSD-based desktop distribution, since they are similar in structure and goals. However, the DesktopBSD project was started approximately one year before the PC-BSD project, despite the fact that the first PC-BSD release came out before DesktopBSD's. Neither the DesktopBSD nor PC-BSD projects intend to rival each other and are completely independent projects with distinctive features and intended outcomes e.g. DesktopBSD uses ports and packages for additional software installation, whereas PC-BSD introduced PBIs.The current release is 1.6 final which was made available on January 9, 2008.FeaturesGraphical installer allowing to partition disks and create usersGraphical tool for managing, installing and updating software using FreeBSD ports systemGraphical management of network interfaces and mounting/unmounting drivesCurrent release is based on FreeBSD 6.3-PRERELEASE and KDE 3.5.8.1.6 Release includesLive-DVD feature - try the system before installing itBetter hardware support, more drivers included, e.g. nVidia driverImproved package manager user interface and performanceAutomated vulnerability check of installed softwareportsnap as the default for faster package list updatesOverview over detected hardware devices and features before the installationImproved display detection for higher resolutions and refresh ratesSupport for GRUB as a boot menu and a graphical configuration toolBoot splash image managementCompletely redesigned installer and desktop environmentConfigurable warning thresholds for battery monitorOn 25th of July 2007 DesktopBSD 1.6 Release Candidate 3 was made available on the project site There are snapshots now available for i386 and AMD64 of the current development.Logos and artworkDesktopBSD logos and artwork collection are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.0 License for AustriaDesktopBSD: Artwork Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.ReferencesSee alsoComparison of BSD operating systemsFreeBSDExternal linksDesktopBSD homepageDesktopBSD wikiDesktopBSD developer blogDesktopBSD 1.0RC3 release notesBSDNews.com article on DesktopBSDBSDLinuxGangster Review, screenshotsBSDTalk Interview with Peter Hofer (DesktopBSD developer/mp3)DesktopBSD flyer Info from AllBSD.de (pdf/English)Using DesktopBSD Dru LavigneBSD News, Search Engine, Forums and TutorialsCategory:FreeBSD bs:DesktopBSD bg:DesktopBSD de:DesktopBSD et:DesktopBSD es:DesktopBSD fr:DesktopBSD it:DesktopBSD nl:DesktopBSD ja:DesktopBSD pl:DesktopBSD pt:DesktopBSD ro:DesktopBSD ru:DesktopBSD sh:DesktopBSD
