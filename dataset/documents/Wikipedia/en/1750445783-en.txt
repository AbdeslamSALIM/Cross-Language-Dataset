Henry I of Cyprus, nicknamed the Fat, aka Henry of Lusignan or Henri I le Gros de Lusignan (May 3, 1217 – January 18, 1253 at Nicosia) was King of Cyprus from 1218 to 1253. He was the son of Hugh I of Cyprus and Alice of Champagne of Jerusalem. The 8-month-old Henry became King of Cyprus upon his father's death on January 10, 1218, with his mother acting as Regent. He was crowned at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, in 1225. This is quite speculative. He may simply have been given to overeating. His propensity to fleshy body and large waistline was apparently inherited at least from his matrilineal great-grandfather king Amalric I of Jerusalem.In historical literature, it has been said that the most interesting thing in Henry's reign was his corpulence. This apparently means a surprisingly peaceful, dull and safe period of time. Henry himself served as Regent of Jerusalem for Conrad of Hohenstaufen 1246-1253.He was married three times; his third wife, whom he married in 1250, was Plaisance of Antioch, daughter of Bohemund V of Antioch. They had a son, Hugh.On his death, Henry was succeeded by his only child, his infant son Hugh II (b. 1253). If he had not had children, his heirs were his eldest sister's sons Jean de Brienne (b. 1234) and Hugh of Brienne (b. c. 1240), as well as his younger sister's son Hugh of Antioch, the future Hugh III of Cyprus (b. c. 1235). He was buried at the Church of the Templars, at Nicosia.Wives:Alix of Montferrat (1210/1215 – Kerynia, December, 1232-May, 1233, buried at Santa Sophia, Nicosia), daughter of Marquis William VI of Montferrat, by Bertha da Clavesana, married at Limassol in May, 1229, without issueStephanie of Lampron (ca 1220/1225 – soon after April 1, 1249, buried at Santa Sophia, Nicosia), daughter of Constantine of Lampron, Regent of Armenia, by Stephanie of Barbaron, married at Nicosia in 1237/1238, without issuePlaisance of Antioch (1235 – September 22/27, 1261), daughter of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli, by Lucienne de Segni, married at Santa Sophia, Nicosia, in 1250, and had issue, an only sonReferences   Category:1217 births Category:1253 deaths Category:Medieval child rulers Category:Kings of Cyprus Category:Regents of Jerusalem     cs:Jindřich I.
