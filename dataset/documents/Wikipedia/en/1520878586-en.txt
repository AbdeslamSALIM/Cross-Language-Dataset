Dom Nuno Álvares Pereira, O. Carm. (pron. ) (July 24 1360 &ndash; April 1 1431), also spelled Nun'Álvares Pereira, was a Portuguese General of great success with a decisive role in the 1383-1385 Crisis that assured Portugal's independence from Castile. Later on, he became a mystic.Early lifeNuno Álvares Pereira was born in Quinta do Bonjardim, parish of Cernache de Bonjardim, near Sertã, central Portugal. His father was Dom Álvaro Gonçalves Pereira, Prior of Crato (Nuno had 32 siblings) and Iria Gonçalves do Carvalhal. His grandfather was Dom Gonçalo (Gonçalves) Pereira, 97th Archbishop of Braga (1326–1349) by Teresa Peres Vilarinho. He belongued to old Portuguese and Galician nobility.At age 17, he married Leonor de Alvim, daughter of João Pires de Alvim and wife Branca Pires Coelho and widow without issue of Vasco Gonçalves Barroso (himself widow without issue of Mécia Rodrigues de Vasconcelos), in Vila Nova da Rainha, near Azambuja. All of the above including him were descendants of Charlemagne and Ferdinand I of Castile.Military lifeNuno started a military career very early. He was in the army when he was only 13, in 1373, and helped stopping a Castilian invasion. However, according to his own words, his first military campaigns were no more than skirmishes on the borders of Portugal. He was an impetuous and brave young man who soon showed himself to be an excellent leader.Later on, when king Fernando I of Portugal died in 1383, with no heir besides Beatrice married to king John I of Castile, the Portuguese independence was again very fragile. Nuno was one of the first nobles to support the claim of king Fernando's brother John, Master of Aviz to the throne. True that John was a natural son of Peter I of Portugal, but, like many others, it was a better option than the loss of independence. After his first victory over the Castilians, in the Battle of Atoleiros (April 1384), João of Aviz named Nuno Álvares Pereira Protector and 2nd Constable of Portugal (Condestável do Reino), in practice supreme commander of Portugal’s armies and 3rd Count de Ourém. He was only 23 years old.  In April 1385, João of Aviz was recognized and accepted as king by the kingdom assembly (the Cortes) as John I. This strong Portuguese position for independence triggered an invasion of the country by Juan I of Castile, willing to defend his wife's rights to the throne. Nuno Álvares Pereira engaged in a pursuit against the cities loyal to the Castilians, namely in the North of the country. In August, he was the mastermind of the Portuguese victory in the Battle of Aljubarrota, after which the threat of annexation was over. After the 1383-1385 Crisis, Álvares Pereira received from John I the titles of 2nd Count of Arraiolos and 7th Count of Barcelos, which along with the previous one were the only three Countdoms existing at the time and which had been taken from Noblemen who took part for Castile. He was also made the 38th Mordomo-Mór (Major Majordomo) of the Realm.Not wanting to give the enemy room to manoeuvre, John I and his supreme general raided several Castilian towns and continued to watch out for Juan I of Castile, until his death in 1390. The final peace and the recognition from Castile came only later on October 30, 1411, with the signature of the Treaty of Ayton-Segovia.Nuno Álvares Pereira sired only one daughter by his marriage to Leonor de Alvim, Beatriz Pereira de Alvim, who was to become the wife of Afonso, Count of Barcelos (natural son of John I of Portugal) and first Duke of Braganza. Therefore, Nuno Álvares Pereira was, through the female line, the ancestor of the House of Braganza which became the Portuguese Royal House in the 17th century, ruling the Kingdom of Portugal (1640-1910), the Kingdom of Brazil (1815-1822) and the Empire of Brazil (1822-1889.Religious lifeAfter the death of his wife, he became a Carmelite (he joined the Order in 1423) at the Carmo Convent (Lisbon) which he had founded in fulfilment of a vow, and took the name of Friar Nuno of St. Mary. There he lived until his death on Easter Sunday of 1431. He was noted for his prayer, his practise of penance and his filial devotion to the Mother of God.During the last year of his life, King John I went to visit and embrace him for the last time. He wept, for he considered Nuno Álvares Pereira his closest friend, the one who had put him on the throne and saved his country's independence.Nuno Álvares Pereira's tomb was lost in the famous 1755 Lisbon earthquake. His epitaph was as follows: "Here lies that famous Nuno, the Constable, founder of the House of Bragança, excellent general, blessed monk, who during his life on earth so ardently desired the Kingdom of Heaven that after his death, he merited the eternal company of the Saints. His worldly honors were countless, but he turned his back on them. He was a great Prince, but he made himself a humble monk. He founded, built and endowed this church in which his body rests."Beatification. Canonization procedureNuno was beatified on January 23, 1918, by Pope Benedict XV. His memorial is on April 1.He had been on the point of being canonized by decree in 1940 by Pope Pius XII. According to a recent statement by the Postulator General of the Carmelite Order, his canonisation was postponed for diplomatic reasons (the Portuguese government itself raised some difficulties) and the canonisation did not materialise. Statement by the Postulator General Centrum Informationalis Totius Ordinis Carmelitorum, No. 3 – May-June 2000 (English edition) However the procedure for his canonisation is still open and active. On July 3, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI signed two decrees in Rome, promulgating the heroic virtues of Nuno and the authenticity of a miracle that had already been previosuly confirmed as such by medical and theological Commissions. By this act the Pope formally Canonized (proclaimed a Saint) Saint Friar Nuno de Santa Maria Àlvares Pereira. Only the public celebration of his canonization need be scheduled now. Saint Nuno's Feast Day has been fixed universaly in the Roman Calendar on November 6th.
