(NASA)]]A spaceport or cosmodrome is a site for launching spacecraft, by analogy with seaport for ships or airport for aircraft. In rocketry, major spaceports (such as Centre Spatial Guyanais or Cape Canaveral Air Force Station) often include more than one launch complex, each of which may have more than one launch pad. Spaceports like the Mojave Spaceport include runways for takeoff and landing of rocket-powered aircraft like SpaceShipOne. Typically a spaceport site is large enough that, should a vehicle explode, it will not endanger human lives or adjacent launch pads.Launches from near the equator in an easterly direction are preferred, as they allow maximum use of the Earth's rotational speed, and a good orientation for arriving at a geostationary orbit. The rotational boost increases the amount of mass that can be lifted to a given orbit with a given amount of fuel. For polar or Molniya orbits, these aspects do not apply. For safety, a launch from a location where the rocket range extends over water or deserted land is important.Space tourismThe space tourism industry is being targeted by spaceports in numerous locations: Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, California, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Florida, Virginia , Alaska and Wisconsin in the United States, Russia's Baikonur spaceport and possibly an Australian site to be developed for the launching of Russian spacecraft. Kiruna, Sweden is also planning to use Esrange as a spaceport http://spaceportsweden.com/sps/. Virgin Galactic is planning a spaceport in Portugal http://www.homesgofast.com/view_news/929/Future spaceportsIt is believed that future hypersonic aircraft will require a very long runway rather than a vertical launch pad. Such hypothetical spaceports will present unique challenges in noise abatement, zoning, and passenger access, with as much as a 5 mile wide corridor surrounding a 30 mile long runway. A dedicated mass transit system from the nearest public access point to the aircraft boarding area may be required.See alsoRocket launch sitePortPlesetsk CosmodromeOffice of Commercial Space TransportationList of spaceportsReferencesExternal linksMSNBC: Spaceports compete in race for businessSpaceport could be in the stars for Sheboygan The Daily CardinalHighBeam Research: Spaceflight of fancy: Lawmakers question fiscal feasibility of Southern New Mexico's proposed spaceport; supporters count on jobs.Category:Spaceportsbg:Космодрум cs:Kosmodrom da:Rumhavn de:Weltraumbahnhof es:Base espacial eo:Kosmodromo eu:Kosmodromo fr:Base de lancement id:Pelabuhan angkasa he:נמל חלל lv:Kosmodroms lt:Kosmodromas hu:Űrközpont nl:Ruimtehaven pl:Kosmodrom pt:Bases de lançamentos espaciais ru:Космодром sk:Kozmodróm fi:Laukaisukeskus sv:Rymdhamn zh:航天发射中心
