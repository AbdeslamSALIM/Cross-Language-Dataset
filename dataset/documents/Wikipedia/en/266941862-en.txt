His unique sound has made him a long sought after studio man.His appearances on over 2,500 albums make him one of the most-recorded bassists in jazz history, along with Milt Hinton, Ray Brown and Leroy Vinnegar.Carter is also an acclaimed cellist who has recorded numerous times on cello.He also has recorded a large body of classical work, and he contributed to the film score for Desperate Characters (1971).Early life and educationCarter started to play cello at the age of 10, but when his family moved to Detroit, he ran into difficulties regarding the racial stereotyping of classical musicians and instead moved to bass.Carter attended the historic Cass Technical High School where he played in the Eastman School of Music's Philharmonic Orchestra.He gained his bachelor's degree in 1959, and in 1961 a master's degree in double bass performance from the Manhattan School of Music.CareerHis first jobs as a jazz musician were with Jaki Byard and Chico Hamilton. His first records were made with Eric Dolphy (another former member of Hamilton's group) and Don Ellis, in 1960.Carter is an acclaimed cellist who has performed on record numerous times with the cello, notably his own first date as leader, Where?, with Dolphy and Mal Waldron and a date also with Dolphy called Out There with George Duvivier and Roy Haynes and Carter on cello; its advanced harmonics and concepts for 1961 were reminiscent of the then current third stream movement on cello by Carter.FameCarter came to fame via the second great Miles Davis quintet in the early 1960s, which also included Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Tony Williams.Carter joined Davis's group in 1963, appearing on the album Seven Steps to Heaven and the follow-up E.S.P., the latter being the first album to feature the full quintet. It also featured three of Carter's compositions (the only time he contributed compositions to Davis's group).He stayed with Davis's regular group until 1968 (when he was replaced by Dave Holland), and participated in a couple of studio sessions with Davis in 1969 and 1970. Although he played electric bass occasionally during this period, he has subsequently eschewed that instrument entirely, and now plays only acoustic bass.Carter was close with Davis and even revealed to an interviewer in 1966 that the famous trumpeter's favorite color was fuchsia.http://danouellette.artistshare.com/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;Carter also performed on some of Hancock, Williams and Shorter's recordings during the sixties for Blue Note Records. He was a sideman on many Blue Note recordings of the era, playing with Sam Rivers, Freddie Hubbard, Duke Pearson, Lee Morgan, McCoy Tyner, Andrew Hill and many, many others.Later lifeAfter leaving Davis, Carter was for several years a mainstay of CTI Records, making albums under his own name and also appearing on many of the label's records with a diverse range of other musicians.He appears on the alternative hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest's influential album The Low End Theory on a track called "Verses from the Abstract". He also appears as a member of the jazz combo, The Classical Jazz Quartet.Carter was Distinguished Professor Emeritus of the Music Department of The City College of New York, having taught there for twenty years, and received an honorary Doctorate from the Berklee College of Music, in Spring 2004.Ron Carter is a pipe smoker and has been featured in a few advertisements for tobacco pipes, clothing lines, and basses.Ron Carter appears in the advertisements for a Tully's chilled coffee beverage in Japan.DiscographyAs a leaderYellow & GreenPastelsAnything GoesPiccoloAll BluesBass and IStardustThe Golden StrikerOrfeuTelepathyNew York SlickBlues FarmStandard BearersJazz, My RomanceWhen Skies Are GreyFriendsHoliday In RioMr. Bow TieRon Carter Plays BachUptown ConversationCarnivalSo WhatPeg LegMeets BachSpanish BluePatraoParadeGuitar & BassA Song For YouBrandenburg ConcertoLive at The Village VanguardEight PlusDear MilesAs a sidemanHerbie Hancock - Empyrean Isles, Maiden Voyage, Speak Like A Child, V.S.O.P., Third PlaneJoe Henderson - Power To The PeopleSam Rivers - Fuchsia Swing Song, ContoursEric Dolphy - Out There (1960)Coleman Hawkins - Night Hawk (1961) with Eddie Davis and Tommy FlanaganAndrew Hill - Grass Roots, Lift Every Voice, Passing ShipsBobby Hutcherson - ComponentsWes Montgomery - So Much Guitar (1961), Tequila, California DreamingOliver Nelson - Sound PiecesMiles Davis - Quiet Nights (1962), Four and More, My Funny Valentine, Live at the Plugged Nickel, Miles Smiles, ESP, Miles In the Sky, Seven Steps To Heaven, The Sorcerer, Filles de Kilimanjaro, Water BabiesWayne Shorter - Speak No Evil (1964), The All Seeing EyeToshiko Akiyoshi - Toshiko at Top of the Gate (1968)The Rascals - "See" (1969)McCoy Tyner - The Real McCoy, Expansions, Trident, Counterpoints, Supertrios, Extensions (1970)Quincy Jones - Gula Matari (1970)Freddie Hubbard - Red Clay (1970), Empyrean Isles, First LightDonald Byrd - Electric Byrd (1970)Roberta Flack - First Take (1970), Quiet Fire ''(1971), ''Killing Me Softly (1973)Milt Jackson - Sunflower (1972)Billy Cobham - Spectrum (1973)New York Jazz Quartet - In Concert in Japan (1975)The Wiz (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (1978)Jim Hall - Alone Together (1986)Helen Merrill - Duets (1987)Harry Connick, Jr. - Harry Connick Jr. (1987)Johnny Frigo - Live from Studio A in New York City (1988)Twin Peaks (Television Series, 2nd Season) (1990)A Tribe Called Quest - The Low End Theory (1991)Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (Motion Picture Soundtrack) (1993)Austin Peralta - Maiden Voyage (2006)Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker (2001, Vertical Jazz) (deleted)The Classical Jazz Quartet Plays Bach (Vertical Jazz, 2002)The Classical Jazz Quartet Play Rachmaninov (May 16, 2006, Kind of Blue)The Classical Jazz Quartet Play Tchaikovsky (September 19, 2006)Christmas (2006)allmusic ((( Classical Jazz Quartet &gt; Discography &gt; Main Albums )))&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;''Grace Slick-"Manhole (1973)ReferencesExternal linksRon Carter Official WebsiteInterview with Ron Carter2006 Interview with Ron CarterInterview with Ron Carter (2007) Category:1937 births Category:African American musicians Category:Eastman School of Music alumni Category:Mainstream jazz double-bassists Category:Manhattan School of Music alumni Category:Third Stream double-bassists Category:Hard-bop double-bassists Category:Post-bop double-bassists Category:Orchestral jazz double-bassists Category:American jazz double-bassists Category:Living people Category:Miles Davis Category:Grammy Award winnersde:Ron Carter es:Ron Carter fr:Ron Carter it:Ron Carter he:רון קרטר nl:Ron Carter ja:ロン・カーター pl:Ron Carter pt:Ron Carter fi:Ron Carter sv:Ron Carter
