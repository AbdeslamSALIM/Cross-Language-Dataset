 Deal or No Deal is the name of several closely related television game shows, the first of which (launching the format) was produced by Dutch producer Endemol.GameplayThe general gameplay of Deal or No Deal involves a contestant, a host/presenter, a banker, and a set of numbered briefcases (or boxes), each containing a different value. The values themselves are known at the start of the game, but which case contains what value is unknown. At the start of the game, the contestant picks a case for themselves that they hope is one of the most valuable. The contestant then begins choosing the other cases one at a time for rejection and removal from play. The amount inside each selection is immediately revealed; by process of elimination, the amount revealed cannot be inside the player's chosen case. Throughout the game, after a preset number of cases have been opened, the banker offers the contestant an amount of money and/or prizes to quit the game, the offer based roughly on the amounts remaining in play and the contestant's demeanor. The player then answers the titular question:"Deal", accepting the offer presented and ending the game, or"No Deal", rejecting the offer and continuing to open casesThe process of removing cases (or boxes) and receiving offers continues until the player accepts an offer to quit, or until all offers have been rejected and all unselected cases revealed, the player then winning the value inside the case initially selected. If a player takes a deal, the game is typically continued to see how much the player could have won if they had remained in the game.The values of each of the cases is indicated by a label or card located inside it. Various versions of the show have between 20 and 26 values; some versions have only cash values, others include prizes such as a car or booby prizes. For instance, there are 26 cases in the U.S. version, containing cash values from 1 cent to $1,000,000. Alternately, the Australian version has 26 values from 50 cents to $200,000, but includes a car as one of its more valuable prizes.Since the range of possible values is known at the start of each game, how much the banker offers at any given point changes based on what values have been eliminated. To promote suspense and lengthen games, the banker's offer is usually less than the expected value dictated by probability theory, particularly early in the game.[http://www.davegentile.com/stuff/Deal_or_no_deal.html Formula for offers in the NBC online version of Deal or No Deal] from the personal website of a former physics and finance student Generally, the offers early in the game are very low relative to the values still in play, and approach (or even exceed) the average of the remaining values near the end of the game.Only a few people have ever won the top prize on any version of the show (see table below). For a contestant to win the top prize, they would have to select the case containing the top prize, and reject every offer the banker makes during the game. While the chances of a player selecting the top prize are reasonable (4-5% depending on how many amounts are in the game), the chances that a player will be able to turn down a number of inevitably large offers to win that top prize are much smaller.Worldwide, the largest active-play offer made (after adjusting for exchange rates) is €1,495,000 on Dutch version ''Miljoenenjacht'', offered on November 13, 2005. The offer was accepted, and stands as the biggest win in the history of the format, despite many versions (either occasionally or permanently) having higher top prizes.Deal or No Deal and scientific research  Deal or No Deal has attracted attention from mathematicians, statisticians, and economists as a natural decision-making experiment. A team of economists has analyzed the decisions of people appearing in European and US episodes of Deal or No Deal and found, among other things, that contestants are less risk-averse or even risk-seeking when they have seen their expected winnings tumble.&lt;/ref&gt; In their follow-up article they find that contestants behave similarly in ten different versions of the show, despite large differences in the amounts at stake; amounts appear to be evaluated in relative terms, for example in proportion to the initial average, and not in terms of their absolute monetary value.&lt;/ref&gt; The research project received a great deal of media attention, appearing on the front page of The Wall Street Journal on January 12, 2006 as well as being featured on National Public Radio in the United States on March 3, 2006.Economists Learn from Game Show 'Deal or No Deal' from the NPR website==International versions== The show has many versions that air around the world: CountryNameHostStationLanguageFirst Year AiredWebsiteAlbaniaKutia]]''Enkel DemiTV KlanAlbanian]]2004LinkArgentinaTrato Hecho]]''Julian WeichTeleféSpanish]]2004LinkArmeniaԴիլ կամ Նո Դիլ Dil kam No DilUnknownArmenia TVArmenian]]Unknownsite=http://www.armeniatv.am/deal.shtml|date=20070321131730|title=LinkAustraliaDeal or No Deal]]''Andrew O'KeefeChannel SevenEnglish]]2003LinkAustriaDeal or No Deal (Austria)Rainhard FendrichORF1German]]2005Miljoenenjacht]]''Walter GrootaersVTMDutch]]2004LinkTe Nemen of Te LatenFelice]]VijfTVDutch]]2007LinkBosnia and HerzegovinaDeal or No Deal- Uzmi ili OstaviJusuf VišnjićOBN]]Bosnian]]2008BrazilTopa ou Não TopaSilvio SantosSBT]]Portuguese]]2006LinkBulgariaСделка или не]]''Rumen LukanovNova TelevisionBulgarian]]2005LinkDeal or No Deal CanadaHowie MandelGlobal]]English]]2007LinkLe BanquierJulie SnyderTVA]]French]]2007LinkE!
