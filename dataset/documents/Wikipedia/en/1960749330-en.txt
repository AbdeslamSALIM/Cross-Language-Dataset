Kenichi Fukui (福井謙一 Fukui Ken'ichi, October 4 1918 &ndash; January 9 1998) was a Japanese chemist.Kenichi Fukui was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1981 with Roald Hoffman, for their independent investigations into the mechanisms of chemical reactions. His prize-winning work focused on the role of frontier orbitals in chemical reactions: specifically that molecules share loosely bonded electrons which occupy the frontier orbitals, that is the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO)&lt;/ref&gt;.  He was professor of physical chemistry at Kyoto University from 1951 to 1982, president of the Kyoto Institute of Technology between 1982 and 1988, and a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and honorary member of the International Academy of Science.List of books available in English''Theory of orientation and stereoselection ''(1975)An Einstein dictionary Sachi Sri Kantha ; foreword by Kenichi Fukui (1996)Frontier orbitals and reaction paths : selected papers of Kenichi Fukui(1997)The science and technology of carbon nanotubes edited by Kazuyoshi Tanaka, Tokio Yamabe, Kenichi Fukui(1999)NotesExternal linksBiographical snapshots: Kenichi Fukui, Journal of Chemical Education web site.Nobel-prize.org Category:1918 births Category:1998 deaths Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:Kyoto University faculty Category:Kyoto University alumni Category:People from Nara (city) Category:Japanese Nobel laureates Category:International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science membersar:كينيتشي فوكوي ca:Kenichi Fukui de:Fukui Ken’ichi es:Kenichi Fukui eo:Hukui Ken-iĉi fr:Ken'ichi Fukui ko:후쿠이 겐이치 id:Kenichi Fukui it:Kenichi Fukui nl:Kenichi Fukui ja:福井謙一 oc:Kenichi Fukui pl:Fukui Kenichi pt:Kenichi Fukui ro:Kenichi Fukui fi:Kenichi Fukui sv:Kenichi Fukui vi:Fukui Kenichi zh:福井谦一
