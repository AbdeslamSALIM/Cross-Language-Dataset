 In vector calculus, the Jacobian is shorthand for either the Jacobian matrix or its determinant, the Jacobian determinant.In algebraic geometry the Jacobian of a curve means the Jacobian variety: a group variety associated to the curve, in which the curve can be embedded.These concepts are all named after the mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The term "Jacobian" is normally , but sometimes also .Jacobian matrixThe Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function. If a function is differentiable at a point, its derivative is given in coordinates by the Jacobian, but a function doesn't need to be differentiable for the Jacobian to be defined, since only the partial derivatives are required to exist.Its importance lies in the fact that it represents the best linear approximation to a differentiable function near a given point. In this sense, the Jacobian is the derivative of a multivariate function. For a function of n'' variables, ''n  1, the derivative of a numerical function must be matrix-valued, or a partial derivative.Suppose F'' : '''R'n'' → '''R'm'' is a function from [[Euclidean space|Euclidean ''n-space]] to Euclidean m''-space. Such a function is given by ''m real-valued component functions, y''1(''x1,...,x''''n), ..., y''''m(x''1,...,''xn''). The partial derivatives of all these functions (if they exist) can be organized in an ''m-by-''n'' matrix, the Jacobian matrix J'' of ''F, as follows:J=\begin \dfrac & \cdots & \dfrac \\ \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \dfrac & \cdots & \dfrac \end. This matrix is also denoted by J_F(x_1,\ldots,x_n) and \frac.The i'' th row (''i = 1, ..., m'') of this matrix is the gradient of the ''ith component function y''''i: \left(\nabla y_i\right).If p''' is a point in '''Rn'' and ''F is differentiable at p', then its derivative is given by ''JF('''p). In this case, the linear map described by JF(p') is the best linear approximation of ''F near the point '''p, in the sense thatF(\mathbf) = F(\mathbf) + J_F(\mathbf)(\mathbf-\mathbf) + o(|\mathbf-\mathbf|)for x''' close to '''p and where o is the little o-notation.The Jacobian of the gradient is the Hessian matrix.ExamplesExample 1. The transformation from spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates is given by the function F'' : '''R'+ &times; [0,π) &times; [0,2π) → R3 with components: x_1 = r \sin\phi \cos\theta \, x_2 = r \sin\phi \sin\theta \, x_3 = r \cos\phi \,The Jacobian matrix for this coordinate change isJ_F(r,\phi,\theta) =\begin\dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\3pt \dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\3pt \dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\ \end=\begin \sin\phi \cos\theta & r \cos\phi \cos\theta & -r \sin\phi \sin\theta \\ \sin\phi \sin\theta & r \cos\phi \sin\theta & r \sin\phi \cos\theta \\ \cos\phi & -r \sin\phi & 0 \end. Example 2. The Jacobian matrix of the function F'' : '''R'3 → R4 with components y_1 = x_1 \,  y_2 = 5x_3 \,  y_3 = 4x_2^2 - 2x_3 \,  y_4 = x_3 \sin(x_1) \, isJ_F(x_1,x_2,x_3) =\begin\dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\3pt \dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\3pt \dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\3pt \dfrac & \dfrac & \dfrac \\ \end=\begin 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 8x_2 & -2 \\ x_3\cos(x_1) & 0 & \sin(x_1) \end. This example shows that the Jacobian need not be a square matrix.In dynamical systemsConsider a dynamical system of the form x''' = ''F(x''), with ''F : R'''n → '''Rn''. If ''F(x''0) = 0, then ''x0 is a stationary point. The behavior of the system near a stationary point can often be determined by the eigenvalues of J''''F(x''0), the Jacobian of ''F at the stationary point.D.K. Arrowsmith and C.M.

ISBN 0-412-39080-9.Jacobian determinantIf m'' = ''n, then F'' is a function from ''n-space to n''-space and the Jacobian matrix is a square matrix. We can then form its determinant, known as the '''Jacobian determinant'. The Jacobian determinant is also called the "Jacobian" in some sources.The Jacobian determinant at a given point gives important information about the behavior of F'' near that point. For instance, the continuously differentiable function ''F is invertible near a point p''' &isin; '''Rn'' if the Jacobian determinant at '''p' is non-zero. This is the inverse function theorem. Furthermore, if the Jacobian determinant at p''' is positive, then F preserves orientation near '''p; if it is negative, F'' reverses orientation. The absolute value of the Jacobian determinant at '''p' gives us the factor by which the function F'' expands or shrinks volumes near '''p'; this is why it occurs in the general substitution rule.ExampleThe Jacobian determinant of the function F'' : '''R'3 → R3 with components y_1 = 5x_2 \,  y_2 = 4x_1^2 - 2 \sin (x_2x_3) \, y_3 = x_2 x_3 \, is\begin 0 & 5 & 0 \\ 8x_1 & -2x_3\cos(x_2 x_3) & -2x_2\cos(x_2 x_3) \\ 0 & x_3 & x_2 \end=-8x_1\cdot\begin 5 & 0\\ x_3&x_2\end=-40x_1 x_2.From this we see that F'' reverses orientation near those points where ''x1 and x''2 have the same sign; the function is locally invertible everywhere except near points where ''x1 = 0 or x''2 = 0. If you start with a tiny object around the point (1,1,1) and apply ''F to that object, you will get an object set with about 40 times the volume of the original one.UsesThe Jacobian determinant is used when making a change of variables when integrating a function over its domain. To accommodate for the change of coordinates the Jacobian determinant arises as a multiplicative factor within the integral. Normally it is required that the change of coordinates is done in a manner which maintains an injectivity between the coordinates that determine the domain. The Jacobian determinant, as a result, is usually well defined.See alsoPushforward (differential)Hessian matrixReferencesExternal linksIan Craw's Undergraduate Teaching Page An easy to understand explanation of JacobiansMathworld A more technical explanation of JacobiansCategory:Multivariable calculus Category:Differential calculus Category:Generalizations of the derivative Category:Determinants Category:Matricesar:مصفوفة جاكوبي ca:Jacobià cs:Jacobiho determinant de:Jacobi-Matrix es:Jacobiano fa:ماتریس ژاکوبی fr:Matrice jacobienne it:Matrice jacobiana he:יעקוביאן nl:Jacobiaan ja:関数行列 pl:Jakobian pt:Matriz Jacobiana ru:Матрица Якоби fi:Jacobin matriisi sv:Jacobimatris vi:Ma trận Jacobi zh:雅可比矩阵
