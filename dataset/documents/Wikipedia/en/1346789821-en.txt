Retrieved March 23, 2007 other clubs have their own lists of acceptable colours, with black being the preference.TemperamentAffenpinschers have a distinct appearance that some associate with terriers. They are different from terriers, however, in that they are actually part of the pinscher-schnauzer subgroup of group 2 in the FCI classification and so often get along with other dogs and pets. They are active, adventurous, curious, and stubborn, but they are also fun-loving and playful. The breed is confident, lively, affectionate towards family members and is also very protective of them. This loyal little dog enjoys being with its family. It needs consistent, firm training because some can be quite difficult to housebreak. The training should be varied because the dog can easily become bored.Affenpinschers are somewhat territorial when it comes to their toys and food, so they are not recommended for very small children. This dog is mostly quiet but can become very excited if attacked or threatened and shows no fear toward any aggressor. It is best suited for a family who likes a show and has a sense of humor.HealthMortalityA small sample (N=21) of Affenpinschers in a UK survey had a median lifespan of 11.4 years,http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm Dog Longevity Web Site, Breed Data page.
