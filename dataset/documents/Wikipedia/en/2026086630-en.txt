Reporters Without Borders has said that a libel suit could result in a three-year prison sentence. RWB organization also called on the authorities to stop blocking Dailymotion, which has been inaccessible in Tunisia since April 1, 2007.Reporters Without Borders said: The press freedom organisation added: The suit against Mestiri was brought by Tunisian lawyer Mohammed Baccar over an article posted on September 5, 2006 accusing him of fraud and forgery. Mestiri was summoned by the deputy state prosecutor to respond to a charge of libel on March 29. Mestiri's lawyers have challenged the suit's legal basis on the grounds that Kalima's site is blocked in Tunisia and the article couldn't have been accessed there.The blocking of Dailymotion may have been prompted by the posting of a number of videos on the political situation in Tunisia, such as http://www.dailymotion.com/generationtunezine http://www.dailymotion.com/tunisietunisie http://www.dailymotion.com/c-iom13 http://www.dailymotion.com/tounishourra http://www.dailymotion.com/tunisiawatch and http://www.dailymotion.com/Saber_ch.
