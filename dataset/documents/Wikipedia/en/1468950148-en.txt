William ("Willie") Charles Renshaw (born January 3, 1861 in Leamington, Warwickshire &ndash; died August 12, 1904 in Swanage, Dorset) is one of the greatest British male tennis players of all time, and a candidate for the greatest tennis player of all time. The right-hander was known for his power and technical ability which put him well ahead of competition at the time.He won a total of fourteen Wimbledon titles. Seven of those were in singles, an all-time record he now shares with Pete Sampras. The first six were all in a row, an achievement which has also never been equalled unto this day (although the five successive wins of Björn Borg and Roger Federer are considered the 'modern' record because in Renshaw's time the reigning champion had automatic entry to the final. Since 1922 they have had to play in the main draw, making such feats considerably more difficult). In the Summer months he would compete in England and Ireland, while competing on the French Riviera during the winter months. In singles play he played brother Ernest three times in the Wimbledon final, triumphing on all three occasions. The other seven titles were in doubles, partnering with his twin brother Ernest Renshaw. Additionally, he and his brother dominated the sport for many years in a time when the only other Grand Slam was the US Open, and by custom players did not travel far. In 1983, Renshaw was elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.Grand Slam singles finalsWins (7)'''Year'''Championship'''Opponent in Final'''Score in Final1881Wimbledon]]GBR John Hartley6–0, 6–1, 6–11882Wimbledon (2)GBR Ernest Renshaw6–1, 2–6, 4–6, 6–2, 6–21883Wimbledon (3)GBR Ernest Renshaw2–6, 6–3, 6–3, 4–6, 6–31884Wimbledon (4)GBR Herbert Lawford6–0, 6–4, 9–71885Wimbledon (5)GBR Herbert Lawford7–5, 6–2, 4–6, 7–51886Wimbledon (6)GBR Herbert Lawford6–0, 5–7, 6–3, 6–41889Wimbledon (7)GBR Ernest Renshaw7–5, 6–2, 4–6, 7–5Runner-ups (1)'''Year'''Championship'''Opponent in Final'''Score in Final1890WimbledonIRE Willoughby Hamilton8–6, 2–6, 6–3, 1–6, 1–6Grand Slam record[[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]]'''Singles champion: 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1889Singles finalist: 1890'''Doubles champion: 1880, 1881, 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1889See alsoList of Grand Slam Men's Singles championsExternal linksInternational Tennis Hall of Fame profileWilliam Renshaw profile on Information Tennis Renshaw, William Category:People from Warwickshire Renshaw, Williams Renshaw, William Category:Twin people Category:Wimbledon champions Renshaw, William Renshaw, Williamde:William Renshaw es:William Renshaw fr:William Renshaw it:William Renshaw nl:William Renshaw ja:ウィリアム・レンショー pl:William Renshaw pt:William Renshaw fi:William Renshaw sv:William Renshaw
