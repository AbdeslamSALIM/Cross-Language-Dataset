He is best remembered for reaching the men's singles final at Wimbledon in 1996.FamilyMaliVai's father, William, taught himself and then his five children to play tennis. When William was the assistant dean at the State University of New York, he decided to teach underprivileged children in the area how to play tennis on the university's new courts. When the family moved to Flint, Michigan, they played on the courts at General Motors headquarters, where MaliVai's parents worked.MaliVai's younger sister, Mashona Washington, is also an accomplished professional tennis player. She was a member of the 1992 U.S. National Team. His younger brother, Mashiska, played on the men's tour after gaining 1995 All-America honors at Michigan State University, archrival of MaliVai's alma mater, the University of Michigan.
