]] An  is a term for hot springs in the Japanese language, though the term is often used describe the bathing facilities and inns around the hot springs. A volcanically active country, Japan has thousands of onsen scattered along its length and breadth. Onsen were traditionally used as public bathing places and today play a central role in directing Japanese domestic tourism.Onsen come in many types and shapes, including  and indoor baths. Baths may be either public run by a municipality or  often run as part of a hotel, ryokan or .Onsen are a central feature of Japanese tourism often found out in the countryside. They are a major tourist attraction drawing Japanese couples, families or company groups who want to get away from the hectic life of the city to relax. Japanese often talk of the virtues of This term should be carefully differentiated from the word  which refers to the benefits of physical contact, for instance, on babies by their mothers. for breaking down barriers and getting to know people in the relaxed homey atmosphere of an onsen inn.Japanese TV often features programs where the hosts visit a local onsen, interview , and try out some of the local delicacies.In March 2003, it was reported that there were 3,102 spa resorts in 2,292 municipalities in the Japan. There were also 15,400 lodging facilities, or ryokan, associated with the 6,740 public onsen. About 138 million people a year visit these facilities, according to this articleThe presence of an onsen is often indicated on signs and maps by the symbol ♨ or the kanji,  (yu, meaning "hot water"). Sometimes the simpler hiragana character ゆ (yu) is used, to be understandable to younger children.Characteristics, Wakayama Prefecture]]  (大深温泉).]] Traditionally, onsen were located outdoors, although a large number of inns have now built indoor bathing facilities as well. Onsen by definition use naturally hot water from geothermally heated springs. Onsen should be differentiated from sentō, indoor public bath houses where the baths are filled with heated tap water. Major onsen resort hotels often feature a wide variety of themed spa baths and artificial waterfalls in the bathing area .Onsen water is believed to have healing powers derived from its mineral content. A particular onsen may feature several different baths, each with water with a different mineral composition. The outdoor bath tubs are most often made from Japanese cypress, marble or granite, while indoor tubs may be made with tile, acrylic glass or stainless steel.Many bathers come for only an hour or so to soak in the waters. Food also plays an important part in the attraction of a particular inn.Because most people tend to eat their evening meal around 6 pm, the baths are often empty at this time. This can be a good time to visit the baths in relative privacy. While other services like massages may be offered, the main reason most people visit the onsen is to enjoy the baths.Traditionally, men and women bathed together at the onsen, as they did at the sentō, but single-sex bathing has steadily become the established custom since the opening of Japan to the West during the Meiji period. Mixed-sex bathing persists at some onsen in the rural areas of Japan, which usually also provide the option of separate "women-only" baths or different hours for the two sexes, although young children of either sex may be seen in both the men's and the women's baths.People often travel to onsen with work colleagues, as the relaxed and open atmosphere helps to break down some of the hierarchical stiffness inherent in Japanese work life. However, most visitors to onsen are not work groups but friends, couples and families.EtiquetteEnsuring cleanlinessAt an onsen, as at a sentō, guests are expected to wash their bodies and rinse themselves thoroughly before entering the hot water. The indoor baths have faucets with removable shower heads and stools to sit on, for showering and shampooing. Entering the onsen while still dirty or with traces of soap on the body is considered unacceptable.In very isolated onsen, where there is no possibility to use soap before entering in the bath, onsen users are expected to at least rinse their body with the water of the bath before entering it.SwimsuitsSoakers are not normally allowed to wear swimsuits in the baths. However, some modern onsen having more of a waterpark atmosphere require their guests to wear a swimming suit in their mixed baths.TowelsOnsen guests generally bring a small towel with them to use as a wash cloth. The towel can also provide a modicum of modesty when walking between the washing area and the baths. Some onsen allow one to wear the towel into the baths, while others have posted signs prohibiting this, saying that it makes it harder to clean the bath.It is sometimes against the rules to immerse or dip towels in the onsen bath water, since this can be considered unclean. In this latter case, people normally set their towels off to the side of the water when enjoying the baths, or place their folded towels on top of their heads.NoiseOnsen are generally considered a respite from the hectic pace of life and consequently they are usually fairly quiet. However, sometimes bathers will engage in conversation in this relaxed situation. There are usually prohibitions against rowdiness in the washing and bathing areas of onsen. A small amount of excess energy and splashing around is usually tolerated from children, however. TherapyThe volcanic nature provides plenty of springs. When the onsen's water contains distinctive minerals or chemicals, the onsen establishments display what type of onsen it is.Some examples of types of onsen include:In Japan, it is said onsen have various medical effects. Getting into hot water for health. The Japan Times. May 25, 2003.  Japanese people believe that a good soak in proper onsen heals aches, pains and diseases, and visit onsen to treat the illnesses, such as arthralgia, chronic skin diseases, diabetes, constipation, menstrual disorders and so on.These medical benefits have given onsen a central role in balneotherapy which is called . Onsen Therapy is a comprehensive bathing treatment conducted to maintain health, normalize dysfunctions and prevent illness.InfectionsAlthough millions of Japanese bathe in onsen every year with few noticeable side effects, there has been concern that the warm wet conditions lead to the transmission of infections.Given the popularity of Japanese hot spring bathing, it is not surprising that many of the reports of infection in the medical literature come from Japan. Some concerns include:Athlete's foot fungal infection.The Naegleria fowleri amoeba, which lives in warm waters and soils worldwide and can cause meningitis.emedicine article on naegleria[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1550-7408.2003.tb00614.x?cookieSet=1 Occurrence and Distribution of Naegleria Species in Thermal Waters in Japan, Shinji Izumiyama, Kenji Yagita, Reiko Furushima-Shimogawara, Tokiko Asakura, Tatsuya Karasudani, Takuro Endō, The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology Vol. 50 Issue s1 Page 514 July 2003] Several deaths have been attributed to this amoeba, which enters the brain through the nasal passages.[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/links/doi/10.1046/j.1440-1827.1999.00893.x Primary amebic meningoencephalitis due to Naegleria fowleri: An autopsy case in Japan, Yasuo Sugita, Teruhiko Fujii, Itsurou Hayashi, Takachika Aoki, Toshirō Yokoyama, Minoru Morimatsu, Toshihide Fukuma & Yoshiaki Takamiya, Pathology International, Volume 49 Page 468 - May 1999]Southern New Mexico web site articleAcanthamoeba, which can also spread through hot springs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.CDC description of acanthamoebaLegionella bacteria, which have been documented to spread through hot springs.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9130230&amp;dopt=Abstrac Molecular determination of infection source of a sporadic Legionella pneumonia case associated with a hot spring bath, H.

There are viruses that have been collected from even very extreme environments in hot springs. For example, viruses were found in a hot spring in Pozzuoli, Italy, living in acidic water with a pH of 1.5, and temperatures of 87&ndash;93 °C (189&ndash;199 °F). These viruses were observed to infect cells in the laboratory.[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1181580 Viral Diversity in Hot Springs of Pozzuoli, Italy, and Characterization of a Unique Archaeal Virus, Acidianus Bottle-Shaped Virus, from a New Family, the Ampullaviridae, Monika Häring, Reinhard Rachel, Xu Peng, Roger A.

This precaution limits the overall risk to bathers and the overall risk to individuals in good health is very slight. The case scenarios of herpetic and amoebic infections are remarkable not so much in that they occur, but rather that the affected persons are predominantly persons with reduced immune systems and likely skin lesions. (The herpetic infection cited above occurring on the foot of a diabetic individual is a good anecdotal representation.)Recent controversy In recent years, there has been some controversy over non-ethnic Japanese and foreigners being prohibited entry to some hot springs.This might be because of Japanese stereotypes that foreigners are unclean, rowdy and/or more prone to criminal activities. This issue was highlighted in February 2001, when Debito Arudou and two co-plaintiffs sued Yunohana Onsen in Otaru, Hokkaido, for refusing service to customers based on race. Yunohana Onsen lost the lawsuit in November 2002.Arudou visited the hot spring after having heard of its discriminatory practice. This incident is often used to make statements that Japan is strongly xenophobic, although out of the thousands of onsen that exist in Japan, only three were reported to have practised racial discrimination in recent years.Selected onsen[[Image:JapaneseMacaqueM2262.jpg|thumb|220px|This rotenburo at Jigokudani Onsen is for Japanese Macaques.]]  enjoying an open air hot spring or onsen in Nagano]] , Hyogo]] ]]  Main Hall in Matsuyama, Ehime]]Sōunkyo Onsen (ja:層雲峡温泉), HokkaidōOnneyu Onsen (ja:温根湯温泉), HokkaidōJōzankei Onsen (ja:定山渓温泉), HokkaidōNoboribetsu, HokkaidōTōyako, HokkaidōFutamata, HokkaidōYunokawa, HokkaidōNyūtō Onsen (ja:乳頭温泉郷), AkitaAsamushi Onsen (ja:浅虫温泉), AomoriSukayu, AomoriGetō Onsen (ja:夏油温泉), IwateKindaichi Onsen, IwateHanamaki, IwateNaruko, MiyagiSakunami, MiyagiZaō Onsen, YamagataAkayu, YamagataGinzan Onsen (ja:銀山温泉), Obanazawa, YamagataSabakoyu Onsen, Fukushima, the oldest community onsen in JapanSenami Onsen (ja:瀬波温泉), NiigataTsukioka Onsen (ja:月岡温泉), NiigataIwamuro, Niigata, famous for onsen since the Edo periodTsubame, NiigataYuzawa, NiigataShiobara Onsen (ja:塩原温泉郷), TochigiKinugawa Onsen, TochigiAkagi, GunmaIkaho Onsen (ja:伊香保温泉), Ikaho, GunmaKusatsu hot springs (ja:草津温泉), Gunma, one of the most famous onsen outside JapanSawatari, GunmaShima, GunmaTakaragawa, Gunma, one of the largest outdoor co-ed baths in JapanHakone, Kanagawa, famous onsen resort town near TokyoTsurumaki Onsen (ja:鶴巻温泉), KanagawaYugawara, KanagawaItō, ShizuokaAtami Onsen (ja:熱海温泉), Atami, Shizuoka, major onsen resort town near TokyoHokkawa Onsen (ja:北川温泉 (静岡県)), ShizuokaKanzanji Onsen (ja:舘山寺温泉), ShizuokaShuzenji Onsen (ja:修善寺温泉), ShizuokaSumatakyō Onsen (ja:寸又峡温泉), ShizuokaShimobe Onsen (ja:下部温泉), YamanashiJigokudani, NaganoKakeyu Onsen (ja:下鹿教湯温泉), NaganoSuwa, NaganoYudanaka Onsen (ja:湯田中渋温泉郷), NaganoGero, Gifu - famous for its free open bath on riverbank of Hida RiverHirayu Onsen (ja:平湯温泉), Takayama, GifuNagaragawa Onsen, Gifu, GifuUnazuki Onsen (ja:宇奈月温泉), Kurobe, ToyamaWakura Onsen (ja:和倉温泉), Nanao, IshikawaAwara Onsen (ja:芦原温泉), Awara, FukuiTakarazuka, HyōgoKinosaki (ja:城崎温泉), HyōgoYumura Onsen (ja:湯村温泉 (兵庫県)), (Shin'onsen), HyōgoArima Onsen (ja:有馬温泉), Kobe, Hyōgo, one of the most famous onsen outside Japan, in KobeNanki-Shirahama Onsen (ja:南紀白浜温泉), Shirahama, WakayamaNanki-Katsuura Onsen (ja:南紀勝浦温泉), Nachikatsuura, WakayamaYubara Onsen (ja:湯原温泉), Okayama, one of the largest co-ed baths at the foot of Yubara damMisasa Onsen (ja:三朝温泉), Misasa, TottoriKaike Onsen (ja:皆生温泉), Yonago, TottoriDōgo Onsen (ja:道後温泉), EhimeTara, SagaBeppu Onsen (ja:別府温泉), Beppu, Ōita, famous for its multi-coloured bathsYufuin, Oita, one of the most famous onsen outside JapanNuruyu, KumamotoKumamoto, KumamotoAso, Kumamoto, a famous Onsen area alongside Mount Aso, an active volcanoIbusuki, KagoshimaShimabara, NagasakiSee also List of hot spring in Japan, List of hot spring photographs in Japan.See alsoAshiyuBalneotherapyPublic bathingSaunaSentōTaiwanese hot springsTurkish bathReferences and notesFurther readingHotta, Anne, and Yoko Ishiguro.
