The joey is weaned at around 12 to 15 months of age and is usually independent at 18 months of age.Bass Strait subspeciesThe Bass Strait subspecies (Vombatus ursinus ursinus) is only found on Flinders Island to the north of Tasmania. Its population was estimated at 4000 in 1996 and is listed as vulnerable by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and IUCN Red List.Vombatus ursinus ursinus — Common Wombat (Bass Strait)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;References Category:Mammals of Tasmania Category:Vombatiforms Category:Mammals of South Australia Category:Mammals of New South Wales Category:Mammals of Victoria (Australia) Category:Marsupials of Australiacs:Vombat obecný de:Nacktnasenwombat es:Vombatus ursinus fr:Vombatus Ursinus it:Vombatus ursinus hu:Vombat nl:Wombat pl:Wombat tasmański sk:Vombat fi:Paljaskuonovompatti sv:Nakennosvombat
