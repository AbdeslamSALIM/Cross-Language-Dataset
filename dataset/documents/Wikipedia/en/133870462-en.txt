After years of disappearance from the Moroccan athletics scene he returned as the technical director of the Moroccan national team. He is also an analyst for Al Jazeera Sports.BackgroundBorn in Kenitra, Morocco, Saïd Aouita dominated middle distance running in the 1980s at all distances between 800 meters and 5000 meters. He was the only man at the time capable of running 800 m in sub 1:44, 1500 m in sub 3:30, 3000 m in sub 7:30, 5000 m in sub 13:00, and 10000m in sub 27:30. He raced and won against the Olympic champions Joaquim Cruz, Peter Rono, John Ngugi and Alberto Cova over their respective main distances. Between September 1983 and September 1990 he won 115 of his 119 races. The defeats were against world champion Steve Cram over 1500 m, Olympic bronze medalist Alessandro Lambruschini over 3000 m steeplechase, Olympic champions Joaquin Cruz and Paul Ereng over 800 m and world champion Yobes Ondieki over 5000 m.CareerAouita's first major international competition was the 1983 World Championships held in Helsinki where he contested the 1500 m. In the final, the pace dawdled for the first 1000 m, tactics that did not suit Aouita, and he was outkicked by the kickers, finishing third. After this experience, Aouita decided to run 5000 m at the Los Angeles Olympics. The 5000 m final was run at a very fast pace set by Antonio Leitão from Portugal, which suited Aouita much better than the tactics used in Helsinki. He stayed behind Leitão and then sprinted past him on the last lap to win.In the next season, Aouita ran two world records: at first in 5000 m (13:00.40) and then in 1500 m (3:29.46). Aouita's 1500 m world record was remarkable for its slow start. Aouita passed the first 400 m in a mediocre time of 57.0 seconds, at 800 m he was still just under 1:54 min before he accelerated dramatically. These outstanding achievements were preceded by Aouita's most bitter defeat. In a 1500 m race in Nizza Steve Cram became the first man to run under 3:30 minutes. Aouita sprinted the final 100 m of that race in 11.8 s and nearly caught Cram, but his dream of being the first man under the magic barrier was destroyed. In 1986, Aouita was the overall winner of the IAAF Grand Prix series. In 1987, Aouita broke Steve Cram's 2000 m world record with a time of 4:50.81. Only six days later, he broke his own world record for 5000 m, and in the process became the first man to break 13 minutes, finishing in 12:58.39.For the World Championships held later that year, Aouita had provisionally entered the 800 m, 1500 m, 5000 m and 10 000 m (probably to keep his opponents guessing), but eventually decided just to contest the 5000 m. In the 5000 m final, John Ngugi from Kenya set a fair pace, but by no means fast. Aouita, always in control of the race, made his move just before the bell, leading a mass sprint for the finish that he won in 13:26.44.Aouita sought new challenges for himself in the Olympic year of 1988. Instead of staying within the comparative security of 5000 m competition, the distance at which he was the reigning Olympic and World champion, he decided to concentrate his efforts on the shorter distances. At the Seoul Olympics he attempted to try the 800 m/1500 m double. Aouita easily won his heat and semi-final in the 800 m, but had his left leg heavily bandaged to protect a recently sprained hamstring. In the 800 m final, a very fast pace was set to try to nullify Aouita's fast finish. Aouita ran according to his race plan, but in the end he was outkicked by the 800 m specialists and finished third. His bronze medal made him the only man in Olympic history to win medals at both the 800 m and 5000 m. However, the race had aggravated his hamstring injury, and although he qualified for the semi-finals of the 1500 m, he withdrew before they started.In the next year, Aouita won the World Indoor Championships in 3000 m. Later, he ran his last world record, breaking Henry Rono's record in 3000 m by the time of 7:29.45. Aouita did not compete in the 1990 outdoor season, and when he returned to competition, was unable to recapture the dominance he had imposed during the 1980s. His appearance at the World Championships, in 1991 at Tokyo, was a barely noticed eleventh in the 1500 m. A few days after the 1991 World Championships he won a race in Cologne where he defeated most of the 1500 m elite except the world champion Noureddine Morceli who was absent.1992 started very promisingly for Aouita as he set a new world indoor record over 3000 m in Athens. However, the IAAF refused to ratify the record for formal reasons. In May Aouita won the Mile at the New York Games and a 1000 m race in Jena. However, due to injury problems he did not participate in the Olympic Games in Barcelona. Further comeback attempts in 1993 and 1995 failed.Coaching and journalismAfter his athletics career ended, Aouita worked with mixed success as a national distance coach in Morocco and Australia. In the latter case, he left his post as middle distance coach for Australia under a cloud, having been accused of encouraging athletes to improve their performance by taking drugs. On September 2008, Aouita became the Moroccan athletics' team`s technical director.Aouita is also an analyst for Al Jazeera Sports.Records   Steve Cram|title=Men's 1,500 m World Record Holder|years=August 23, 1985 &ndash; September 6, 1992|after= Noureddine Morceli  Henry Rono|title=Men's 3,000 m World Record Holder|years=August 20, 1989 &mdash; August 16, 1992|after= Moses Kiptanui   Carl Lewis|after= Yuriy Syedikh|years=1985   Steve Ovett|title=Men's 1,500 m Best Year Performance|years=1984 &ndash; 1985|after= Sebastian Coe  Fernando Mamede|title=Men's 5,000 m Best Year Performance|years=1984 &mdash; 1987|after= John Ngugi  Doug Padilla|title=Men's 3,000 m Best Year Performance|years=1984 &mdash; 1986|after= Dieter Baumann  Sebastian Coe|title=Men's 1,500 m Best Year Performance|years=1987|after= Steve Cram  Sydney Maree|title=Men's 3,000 m Best Year Performance|years=1989|after= Khalid Skah References and notes     Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Moroccan athletes Category:Olympic athletes of Morocco Category:Middle distance runners Category:Long-distance runners Category:Moroccan Muslims Category:Athletes at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Morocco Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Morocco Category:Former world record holdersar:سعيد عويطة de:Saïd Aouita et:Saïd Aouita es:Saïd Aouita fr:Saïd Aouita gl:Said Aouita hr:Said Aouita it:Saïd Aouita he:סעיד עוויטה nl:Saïd Aouita ja:サイド・アウィータ no:Saïd Aouita pl:Saïd Aouita fi:Sa’id Awita sv:Saïd Aouita
