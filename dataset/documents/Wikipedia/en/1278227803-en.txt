 DorlandsSuf  = 12541373 | In human anatomy or in mammals in general, the mons pubis (Latin for "pubic mound"), also known as the mons veneris (Latin, mound of Venus) or simply the mons, is the fatty tissue present in women above the pubic bone. It is anterior to the symphysis pubis.The size of the mons pubis varies with the general level of body fat. After puberty it is normally covered with pubic hair.In humans, the mons pubis divides into the labia majora (literally "larger lips") on either side of the furrow, known as the cleft of venus, that surrounds the clitoris, vaginal opening, and other structures of the vulva. The fatty tissue of the mons veneris is sensitive to estrogen, causing a distinct mound to form with the onset of puberty. This pushes the forward portion of the labia majora out and away from the pubic bone, and parallel to the ground (when standing).Additional imagesImage:Vulva anatomy.jpg|Vulva anatomy.
