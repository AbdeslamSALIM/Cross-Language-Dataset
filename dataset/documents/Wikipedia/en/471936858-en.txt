Forced to leave the area for political reasons (that part of Germany became a part of Poland) after the First World War, he studied chemistry at the University of Berlin from 1922, and later at the University of Kiel where his PhD was awarded in 1926 for work supervised by Diels.In 1930 Alder was appointed reader for chemistry at Kiel, and promoted to lecturer in 1934. In 1936 he left Kiel to join I G Farben Industrie at Leverkusen, where he worked on synthetic rubber. Then in 1940 he was appointed Professor of Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Technology at the University of Cologne and Director of the Institute of Chemistry there. Throughout this time and despite the many obstacles to original research in Europe at the time, he continued a systematic program of investigations of his particular interests in the synthesis of organic compounds. In all he published more than 151 papers in this field.Alder received several honorary degrees and other awards, most famously the 1950 Nobel Prize in Chemistry which he shared with his teacher Diels for their work on what is now known as the Diels-Alder reaction. The lunar crater Alder is named in his honour.ReferencesExternal linksNobel Prize biography Category:German chemists Category:People from the Province of Silesia Category:German Nobel laureates Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:People from Chorzów Category:University of Kiel alumni Category:University of Kiel faculty Category:Humboldt University of Berlin alumniar:كورت ألدر ca:Kurt Alder cs:Kurt Alder de:Kurt Alder es:Kurt Alder eo:Kurt Alder fr:Kurt Alder gd:Kurt Alder gl:Kurt Alder io:Kurt Alder id:Kurt Alder it:Kurt Alder sw:Kurt Alder nl:Kurt Alder ja:クルト・アルダー oc:Kurt Alder pl:Kurt Alder pt:Kurt Alder ro:Kurt Alder ru:Альдер, Курт sk:Kurt Alder fi:Kurt Alder sv:Kurt Alder zh:库尔特·阿尔德
