  Creed was an American rock band from Tallahassee, Florida that became popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The band won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the song "With Arms Wide Open" in 2001. The band broke up in 2004 after three multi-platinum albums, selling more than 30 million albums worldwide.HistoryCreed was formed in 1995 under the name Naked Toddler when Scott Stapp and guitarist Mark Tremonti, college friends at Florida State University, got together and started collaborating and writing songs. They soon added bassist Brian Marshall and drummer Scott Phillips. Brian Marshall came up with the band name "Creed", taken from the name of his former band, Mattox Creed.Once the band was complete as a four-piece in late 1995, (Scott Stapp, Mark Tremonti, Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips) the band was soon dominating the Tallahassee local music scene and was one of the only local bands playing all original music in a town where club owners wanted local bands to play cover songs. The four members had already written and collaborated three of the songs that would go on to become tracks on their chart-topping debut album My Own Prison. The songs were "One", "Sister" and "What's This Life For".They then found work at a live music bar, where they impressed promoters Jeff Hanson and Andy Levine enough to let them play at one of their bigger venues known as Floyd's Music Store on the Tennessee Street Strip in Tallahassee. Hanson and Levine liked the band so much that he convinced producer John Kurzweg to record the band.===''My Own Prison''=== Their debut album, My Own Prison, was independently released in 1997 and only cost them $6,000 to produce, and distributed to Florida radio stations. This drew the attention of several labels that agreed to see the band, only to pass. Rejected, Creed was playing a small gig when Diana Meltzer from Wind-Up Records heard the group. She had heard their independent album, and after hearing them live, signed the band to her label. After a remix to make it more radio friendly, My Own Prison was re-released by Wind-up Records across the country. The album was a surprise success, reaching the Top 40 on the Billboard Top 200, and spinning off several singles ("My Own Prison," "Torn," "What's This Life For," and "One") that topped the rock radio charts. The band's hit song "My Own Prison" was also featured as a live performance on the charity album Live in the X Lounge.''Human Clay''Their second album, Human Clay, was released in 1999 and debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at number one, based on the strength of its first single, "Higher", which spent several weeks on the top of the rock radio charts. It wasn't until early 2000 that the single crossed over onto pop radio going to the Top Ten on the Billboard Pop Chart, and Creed became a household name. The follow-up single, "With Arms Wide Open," also hit number one that fall.Meanwhile, Brian Marshall quit the band, and Brett Hestla (Virgos Merlot, Dark New Day) took over on the Human Clay tour, and subsequent tours. Around that time, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit bad-mouthed Stapp at New York's Krock 92.3 "Dysfunctional Family Picnic Concert" where they were both performing. In response to this, Scott Stapp invited Fred Durst to an open boxing match.''Weathered''In the fall of 2001, "My Sacrifice", the first single off Creed's last album Weathered, was used in a series of promotional tribute videos made by World Wrestling Entertainment. They also had "Young Grow Old," a B-side to the 1999 release Human Clay, featured as the official theme song for World Wrestling Entertainment WWE's Backlash pay-per-view event in April 2002. In early 2002, "Bullets" was released as a single, along with a costly, special effects-laden video. The song and video were possibly Creed's least successful since achieving mainstream success. However, Creed rebounded quickly, with one of the summer's biggest hits, "One Last Breath".Stapp was involved in a car accident in April 2002 and it had seemed that the tour that they had planned was not going to happen. However, Stapp recovered in time to appear in the last few shows. "Don't Stop Dancing" was a minor hit for Creed in late 2002/early 2003.Breakup and subsequent activitiesIn June 2004, Creed officially announced their break-up. Stapp began recording his debut solo album, The Great Divide with Roadrunner Records recording artist Goneblind. The other band members (including former bassist Brian Marshall) formed a new band, Alter Bridge, with Myles Kennedy. Touring bassist Brett Hestla has since joined the band Dark New Day. On November 22, 2004 Creed released a greatest hits album.Since Creed's disbanding, many fans have been waiting for a reunion. The three members currently involved in Alter Bridge have stated that Creed is solely in their past, and will not reunite any time in the future. Tremonti even went as far to say that he would only agree to a Creed reunion if it was for "world peace." Originally, Stapp was optimistic about Creed reuniting someday, yet his recent claims reflect that he too feels that Creed is in the past, and claims that the band will reunite if "hell freezes over".In 2008, Mark Tremonti, along with Alter Bridge singer Myles Kennedy appeared as guests on two separate tracks on Sevendust's album Chapter VII: Hope &amp; Sorrow.Controversies Despite the band's continual dismissals of the label, Creed is sometimes labeled a Christian rock band due to the fact that all three albums focus on questions of faith, Christianity, and eternity. The band was never signed to a contemporary Christian music label, nor did it perform in Christian music venues or get any widespread regular play on Christian radio. However, the band's namesake creed itself denotes a popular Christian theological concept, of absolute individual belief, usually monotheistic. Also, themes within their musical titles such as "Human Clay", "My Sacrifice", "My Own Prison", "With Arms Wide Open", and "One Last Breath" contain allusion to Christian theology, however it hasn't been confirmed that the songs were meant to be Christian songs.Creed was sued in 2003 by four concert goers who claimed Scott Stapp "was so intoxicated and/or medicated that he was unable to sing the lyrics of a single Creed song" at a December 29, 2002 concert in Chicago. The lawsuit was later dismissed and the concert goers who filed the suit were mocked in a Daily Show segment conducted by Rob Corddry.Collaboration with World Wrestling EntertainmentFor many years, Creed collaborated with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) by allowing many of their songs to be played for promotions (such as a song being the soundtrack for a pay per view). In 2001, when WWE began airing videos highlighting many different wrestlers' careers as well as video highlights of the rigors of the road for wrestlers, a Creed song was almost always the background music; "My Sacrifice" being the most-used song. Even following the breakup of Creed, Scott Stapp and Alter Bridge have both contributed music to WWE.Band membersFormer membersScott Stapp – lead vocals (1995–2004)Mark Tremonti – guitars, backing vocals (1995–2004); bass guitar on Weathered (2001 — all tracks)Scott Phillips – drums, percussion, keyboards (1995–2004)Brian Marshall – bass guitar (1995–2000)Touring membersBrett Hestla – bass guitar (2000–2004)Brian Brasher – guitars (1995)Session membersJohn Kurzweg – keyboards on My Own Prison (1997 — multiple tracks)Aimee Stapp – backing vocals on Weathered (2001 — track "Don't Stop Dancing")Robby Krieger – guitars on Stoned Immaculate: The Music of the Doors (2000 — track "Riders on the Storm")Jamie Muhoberac – keyboards on Stoned Immaculate: The Music of the Doors (2000 — track "Riders on the Storm")DiscographyAlbumsAlbum informationRIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by CreedMy Own PrisonAlbum informationRIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by CreedHuman ClayAlbum informationRIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by CreedWeatheredAlbum informationRIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by CreedGreatest HitsSinglesYearTitleChart positionsCreed: Artist Chart History (singles)Creed: Bubbling Under Hot 100 SinglesAlbumUS Hot 100US Modern RockUS Mainstream RockUK Singles Chart1997My Own Prison]]"-#7#2-My Own Prison1997"What's This Life For"-#10#1-My Own Prison1998Torn]]"--#3-My Own Prison1999One]]"#70#2#2-My Own Prison1999Higher]]"#7#1#1#47Human Clay2000"With Arms Wide Open"#1#2#1#13Human Clay2000What If]]"#102#15#3-Human Clay2000Are You Ready?]]"#125#37#4-Human Clay2001"Riders On The Storm"--#28-2001Higher]]" (re-issue)---#64Human Clay2001"My Sacrifice"#4#2#1#18Weathered2002Bullets]]"-#27#11-Weathered2002Hide]]"----Weathered2002"One Last Breath"#6#17#5-Weathered2002Bullets]]"---#47Weathered2002"Don't Stop Dancing"----Weathered2002Weathered]]"-#30#7-WeatheredReferencesMilestonesAlbum salesAll three studio albums released went multi-platinum.My Own Prison went 6× platinum in the US.Human Clay went 11× platinum in the US.Weathered went 6× platinum in the US.The Greatest Hits went platinum in the US.My Own Prison, Human Clay, and Weathered are on the list of the top 100 selling albums of all time in the US. http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100Creed has sold 30 million albums worldwideIn mediaThe song "What If" and "Is This the End" (Creed songs) appeared in the Scream 3 soundtrackThe song "Higher" was played in the theatrical trailers for Titan A.E., but the song did not appear either in the movie or on the soundtrackThe song "What's This Life For" was in the Halloween H20: 20 Years Later soundtrackThe song "Who's Got My Back?" appeared in the video game NHL 2003The song "Higher" was in the movie The SkullsThe song "Bound & Tied" was featured in the Dragon Ball Z Movie Return of Cooler and also appeared on the soundtrack for the movie "Dead Man On Campus"Creed and Robby Krieger did a song "Roadhouse Blues" for the Woodstock 1999 (album)The song "Wrong Way" was in the End of Days soundtrackThe song "One Last Breath" appeared in the movie See No EvilThe song "Pity For A Dime" was in Jailbait!The song "Stand Here With Me" featured in the video game Project Gotham Racing 4The song "My Own Prison" appeared in the movie A Man ApartThe song "Bullets" was featured in the video game MechAssault 2: Lone WolfThe song "What If was sang by Chris Daughtry in Season 5 of American IdolThe song "My Sacrifice" was used by WWE in video segments for various superstarsThe song "My Sacrifice" was played at the 2002 Olympic GamesThe song "I'm Eighteen" was a cover of Alice Cooper's first hit and appeared in the movie The FacultyRecords and accomplishmentsThe song "Higher" topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock charts for 18 weeks, a record.Their album Weathered debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts and stayed there for eight weeks, a record which they share with The Beatles.The video for "With Arms Wide Open" was declared the 92nd greatest video ever by VH1.The song "With Arms Wide Open" was declared the 4th greatest power ballad ever by VH1.AwardsBillboard 'Rock Artist of the Year' (1998)Billboard 'Rock Artist of the Year' (1999)Billboard 'Rock Artist of the Year' (2000)Mawn Bawnd of All Time -
