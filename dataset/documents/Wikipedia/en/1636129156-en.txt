Nye, who served as governor of the Nevada Territory and later as a U.S. Senator from the state. The first county seat was Ione in 1864, followed by Belmont in 1867, and finally by Tonopah in 1905.The county's first boom came in the early 20th century, when Rhyolite and Tonopah, as well as Goldfield in nearby Esmeralda County were all experiencing mining booms. In 1906, Goldfield had 30,000 residents, Tonopah had nearly 10,000 people, and Rhyolite peaked at about 10,000. All of those cities were linked by the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad.

By 1910, the population had plummeted to about 7,500 Nye County, NV Population by Decades&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; before sinking to near 3,000 in the middle of the century. It wasn't until development at the test site that the population stabilized, and dramatic growth didn't occur until the 1990s, when Pahrump became a bedroom community for Las Vegas.From time to time, there have been discussions of moving the county seat south to Pahrump, or splitting off the southern portion of the county, but neither of these ideas appears to have sufficient support at the county or state government level.http://www.viewnews.com/2001/VIEW-Jan-09-Tue-2001/pahrump/15162935.html View Newspapers: Resident proposes new county formationGeographyAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 18,159&nbsp;square miles (47,031&nbsp;km²). 18,147&nbsp;square miles (47,000&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 12&nbsp;square miles (31&nbsp;km²) of it (0.07%) is water.Nye County is located in south central Nevada, and, given its nuclear history, some find it interesting that its shape can be seen as a skewed mushroom cloud.
