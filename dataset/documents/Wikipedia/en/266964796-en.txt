At the last legislative elections on June 25, 2005, it received 21.83% of the popular vote and 53 out of 240 seats, a significant decrease.The last political surveys (January 2007) showed that the party has fallen to third place in the opinion polls, after the Bulgarian Socialist Party and the newly-formed Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria.See alsoLiberalismContributions to liberal theoryLiberalism worldwideList of liberal partiesLiberal democracyLiberalism and radicalism in BulgariaExternal linksNational Movement Simeon II official site   Category:Liberal parties Category:Political parties in Bulgaria Category:ELDR member partiesbg:Национално движение стабилност и възход de:Nationale Bewegung Simeon der Zweite es:Movimiento Nacional Simeón II fr:Mouvement national pour la stabilité et le progrès it:Movimento Nazionale per la Stabilità ed il Progresso hu:Második Szimeon Nemzeti Mozgalom nl:Nationale Beweging Simeon II pl:Narodowy Ruch na rzecz Stabilności i Postępu ru:Национальное движение «Симеон Второй» sv:Nationella rörelsen Simeon II
