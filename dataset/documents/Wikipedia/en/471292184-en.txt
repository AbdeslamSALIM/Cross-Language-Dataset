La Nouvelle Revue Française (NRF, or The New French Review in English) is a literary magazine founded in 1909 by André Gide. In 1911, Gaston Gallimard became editor of the revue, which led to the founding of the publishing house, Éditions Gallimard.Established writers such as Paul Bourget and Anatole France contributed to the magazine from its early days. The magazine's influence grew until, during the between-war period, it became the leading literary journal, occupying a unique role in French culture. The first published works by André Malraux and Jean-Paul Sartre were in the pages of the Revue.After liberation, the magazine was forbidden for collaborationism, but reopened in 1953. The Revue was a monthly for many years, but is currently a quarterly.Directors1908–1914: André GideInterruption due to war1919–1925: Jacques Rivière1925–1940: Jean Paulhan1940–1945: Pierre Drieu La RochelleForbidden for collaborationism1946–1968: Jean Paulhan1968–1977: Marcel Arland1977–1987: Georges Lambrichs1987–1996: Jacques Réda1996–1999: Bertrand Visage1999–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: Michel BraudeauExternal linksCatalogReferencesAnna-Louise Milne, The Extreme In-Between: Jean Paulhan's Place in the Twentieth Century (Oxford: Legenda, 2006) Category:French literary magazines Category:Publications established in 1909de:Nouvelle Revue Française es:La Nouvelle Revue Française fr:La Nouvelle Revue française it:Nouvelle Revue Française nl:Nouvelle Revue française ja:新フランス評論 no:Nouvelle Revue Française pl:Nouvelle Revue Française
