As a goalkeeper, he was one of the team's most influential players in their UEFA Cup campaign in 2003, in a run that would only stop in the competition's semifinals.He then went on to play for Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he backstopped the team to the finals of the 2005 UEFA Cup, where they lost 3-1 at home to PFC CSKA Moscow.In 9 July, 2007, Ricardo was linked with a transfer to La Liga side Real Betis. On July 11, he signed a four-year contract with the club, a signing which would cost Betis €3,000,000. His league debut took place against Recreativo de Huelva on 26 August. Having started the league campaign as first-choice, he eventually lost the position to former Betis trainee Casto, but would regain his status for two of the last three matches, as the side from Andalusia avoided relegation.International careerRicardo made his international debut in 2001 against the Republic of Ireland, taking the place of Vítor Baía, who was recovering from a serious knee injury. However, he would be his backup in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.Euro 2004In the quarterfinals of Euro 2004 against England, Ricardo was one of Portugal's heroes in their win on penalties. With a 5-5 tie, he first saved the shot of Darius Vassell, after taking his gloves off, and then scored the deciding penalty to send Portugal to the semifinals.Nevertheless, Ricardo did not manage to help his team avoid the loss to Greece in the final match. Ricardo misjudged a corner when coming for the ball, only for Angelos Charisteas to head the only goal of the game, in a shock final defeat.2006 World CupIn the group stage, Ricardo kept two clean sheets and was only beaten once, by Mexico's Francisco Fonseca, as Portugal won all three matches. The national side once again knocked out England in the quarter-finals of a major tournament on penalties, as he saved from Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, in a 3-1 shootout win after a 0-0 draw with extra time, becoming the first keeper to save thrice in a shoot-out. Carragher did beat Ricardo but since his kick was made before the referee blew the whistle, the Englishman had to retry the spot kick which was then saved.In the third-place match against hosts Germany, Ricardo allowed three goals, two by Bastian Schweinsteiger, and an own goal by Portugal's Petit, which was also off of Schweinsteiger's shot. He was named to the tournament All-Star team, as one of the three best goalkeepers.Euro 2008Despite some criticism, Ricardo remained the main goalkeeper of the qualifying campaign. Portugal struggled initially but did qualify for Euro 2008, in Switzerland and Austria, and he played all of the side's matches, as Portugal was eliminated by Germany 3-2 in the quarterfinals, where he misjudged in two box exits, allowing two headers.Euro 2008: German power leaves Portugal in despairCareer statisticsFootballdatabase.com profile and stats   |- |1995-96||rowspan="8"|Boavista||rowspan="8"|Portuguese League||0||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1996-97||16||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1997-98||34||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1998-99||5||0|||||||||||||||| |- |1999-00||9||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2000-01||28||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2001-02||29||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2002-03||33||1|||||||||||||||| |- |2003-04||rowspan="4"|Sporting Portugal||rowspan="4"|Portuguese League||34||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2004-05||33||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2005-06||30||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2006-07||28||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2007-08||rowspan="2"|Real Betis||rowspan="2"|Spanish League||28||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2008-09|||||||||||||||||||| 279||1|||||||||||||||| 28||0|||||||||||||||| 307||1|||||||||||||||| |ReferencesExternal linksStats and profile at zerozero.pt     Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Football (soccer) goalkeepers Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Portuguese Liga footballers Category:Boavista players Category:Sporting Clube de Portugal footballers Category:La Liga footballers Category:Real Betis footballers Category:Portuguese expatriate footballers Category:Portugal international footballers Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players'''ar:ريكاردو باريرا ca:Ricardo Pereira cs:Ricardo Pereira de:Ricardo Pereira et:Ricardo Pereira es:Ricardo Pereira eo:Ricardo Soares Pereira fr:Ricardo Pereira id:Ricardo Pereira it:Ricardo Pereira lt:Ricardo Pereira hu:Ricardo Soares mr:रिकार्डो परेरा nl:Ricardo Pereira ja:リカルド・ペレイラ no:Ricardo Pereira uz:Ricardo Pereira pl:Ricardo (portugalski piłkarz) pt:Ricardo Alexandre Martins Soares Pereira ru:Перейра, Рикарду sr:Рикардо Переира fi:Ricardo Pereira tr:Ricardo Pereira zh:里卡多·佩雷拉
