After meeting at her birthday party, she and Australian singer Ben Lee dated for almost six years, their relationship ending in 2003. Beginning in 2004, she dated her Stage Beauty and Princess Mononoke co-star Billy Crudup, which generated negative publicity due to rumors that their relationship caused the end of Crudup's relationship to then-pregnant Mary-Louise Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; Both denied that they were involved prior to the end of Crudup's relationship with Parker. Danes' relationship with Crudup ended in December 2006, amid rumors of an affair by Danes with [[Hugh Dancy]], her co-star in ''[[Evening (film)|Evening]]''. Danes confirmed on the [[June 27]], [[2007]] episode of ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' that she is dating Dancy.  Additionally, she has dated Andrew Dorff, actor [[Stephen Dorff]]'s younger brother, and [[Matt Damon]].ControversyIn 1998, just after the filming of Brokedown Palace in Manila, she was quoted in Vogue as saying that Manila was a "ghastly and weird city." She further remarked in Premiere that the city "smelled of cockroaches, with rats all over and that there is no sewerage system and the people do not have anything &mdash; no arms, no legs, no eyes." Kim Atienza, son of then-Mayor of Manila, Lito Atienza, responded to the comments by saying that, "those are irresponsible, bigoted and sweeping statements that we cannot accept." Her films were subsequently banned from being screened in the Philippines. Joseph Estrada, then-President of the Philippines, condemned her publicly, and she was declared persona non grata. Shortly after the incident, Danes issued an apology in Entertainment Weekly to the City of Manila.FilmographyFilmYearFilmRoleNotes1990Dreams of Love1994Little Women]]''Beth March1995How to Make an American QuiltYoung Glady Jo ClearyHome for the Holidays]]''Kitt Larson1996I Love You, I Love You NotDaisy/Young NanaRomeo + JulietJuliet CapuletTo Gillian on Her 37th BirthdayRachel Lewis1997Princess MononokeSan(voice)U TurnJennyThe Rainmaker]]''Kelly Riker1998Les Misérables]]''CosettePolish WeddingHala1999The Mod Squad]]''Julie BarnesBrokedown PalaceAlice Marano2002Igby Goes DownSookie SappersteinThe Hours]]''Julia Vaughn2003It's All About LoveElenaThe Rage In Placid LakeGirl at SeminarTerminator 3: Rise of the MachinesKate Brewster2004Stage BeautyMaria2005ShopgirlMirabelle ButtersfieldThe Family StoneJulie Morton2007Evening]]''Young AnnStardust]]''YvaineThe Flock]]''Allison2009Me and Orson WellesSonja JonesTelevisionMy So-Called Life (25 August 1994–26 January 1995) - Angela ChaseCommercialsThe Boyfriend Trousers (Gap) (2007) - GirlfriendMusic videosSoul Asylum - Just Like Anyone (1995) - Unnamed AngelGuest appearancesLaw &amp; Order (1992) - Tracy BrandtLifestories: Families in Crisis (1994) - Katie LeiterThe Jon Stewart Show (1994) - HerselfLate Show with David Letterman (1995) - HerselfThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1997) - HerselfThe Rosie O'Donnell Show (1997) - HerselfSaturday Night Live (1997) - HerselfLate Show with David Letterman (1998) - HerselfThe Charlie Rose Show (1999) - HerselfFanatic (1999) - HerselfThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1999) - HerselfLate Night with Conan O'Brien (1999) - HerselfHBO First Look (2003) - HerselfElectric Playground (2003) - HerselfTinseltown TV (2003) - HerselfLive with Regis and Kelly (2004) - HerselfThe Charlie Rose Show (2004) - HerselfSunday Morning Shootout (2004) - HerselfLate Night with Conan O'Brien (2004) - HerselfCorazon de...
