As a consequence Camillus grew up neglected. Camillus joined the Venetian army while still only a youth. After his regiment was disbanded in 1574 Camillus worked in a hospital for incurables, however his aggressive nature and excessive gambling led to his dismissal. He later rejoined the Venetian army and fought in the war against the Turks in 1569. After the war he later returned to the hospital in Rome from which he had been dismissed, he became a nurse and later director of the hospital.Camillus established the Order of Clerks Regular Ministers to the Sick, better known as Camillians. His experience in wars led him to establish a group of health care workers who would assist soldiers on the battlefield. The red cross on their cassock remains a symbol of the order today. Members also devoted themselves to the plague-stricken. Camillus was so distressed at how hopeless plague cases were treated during his time, that he formed the "Brothers of the Happy Death," for plague victims. It was for the efforts of the Brothers and his alleged supernatural healings that the people of Rome credited Camillus with ridding the city of a certain plague and, for a time, Camillus became known as the "Patron Saint of Rome".In 1594 Camillus also led his friars to Milan where they attended to the sick of the Ca' Granda, the main hospital of the city. A memorial tablet in the main courtyard of the Ca' Granda commemorates his presence there.Throughout his life Camillus' ailments caused him suffering, but he allowed no one to wait on him and would crawl to visit the sick when unable to stand and walk. It is said that Camillus possessed the gifts of healing and prophecy.St Camillus was beatified by Pope Benedict XIV in the year 1742, and later canonized by him four years later in 1746.VenerationPopularly, Camillus is the patron saint of nurses, and against gambling. His mortal remains are located in the altar in the Church of Mary Magdalene, Rome, Italy, along with several of his relics. Also on display is the cross which allegedly spoke to Camillus, and asked him, "Why are you afraid? Do you not realise that this is not your work but mine?" which has become the motto associated with St. Camillus, as well as healthcare workers who follow his charism.St Camillus' feast day was originally inserted in the Roman Calendar in 1762 for celebration on 18 July, since 14 July, the day of his death, was at that time taken up with the feast of Saint Bonaventure. It was then given the rank of Double, changed in 1962 to that of "Third-Class Feast"General Roman Calendar of 1962 and in 1969 to that of an obligatory "Memorial", when it was also moved to the anniversary of his death, 14 July.See alsoThe IncorruptiblesReferencesExternal linksWebsite of the Camillian orderFounder Statue in St Peter's Basilica[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03217b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Camillus de Lellis] Category:1550 births Category:1614 deaths Category:Italian nurses Category:Italian saints Category:Italian Christian monkscs:Kamil de Lellis de:Kamillus von Lellis es:Camilo de Lellis fr:Camille de Lellis it:Camillo de Lellis nl:Camillus de Lellis nap:San Camillo de Lellis pl:Kamil de Lellis pt:SÃ£o Camilo de Lellis ro:Camillo de Lellis sv:Camillo de Lellis
