He was signed for Chelsea from the youth system of German club Union Berlin in 2001 by then Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri. He is often referred to as "The Unstoppable Force", "The Friendly One" or "The Berlin Wall".Club careerHuth made his debut for Chelsea at the age of 17 in the last game of the 2001-02 season, coming on as a sub at the half-time in a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa. From 2001 to 2005, Huth was very much a fringe player at Chelsea, serving as an understudy to John Terry, Marcel Desailly, and William Gallas.When the 2005-06 season started, Huth's chances of becoming a first choice player at Chelsea in the near future seemed limited as there were three world class central defenders ahead of him in the Chelsea squad. Terry, Gallas, and Portuguese international centre-back Ricardo Carvalho (who had replaced Desailly) were the preferred central defenders for Chelsea manager José Mourinho, who had succeeded Ranieri in the summer of 2004. Mourinho did, however, reject a bid for Huth from leading German club Bayern Munich in the summer of 2005.On 13 July, 2006, a proposed transfer to Middlesbrough was scuppered when Huth failed a medical. Middlesbrough continued to track Huth and on August 31 that year Middlesbrough chief executive Keith Lamb stated that he expected to sign him that day, reportedly for £6,000,000 on a 5-year contract. After much speculation that the transfer may not go through as a result of William Gallas' departure, and with Chelsea heavily involved in the transfer of Ashley Cole from Arsenal, there was speculation and also a bit of a mystery if the final paperwork would be signed in time for the transfer deadline. Eventually the transfer was confirmed.In an interview after his unveiling, Huth admitted he was nervous about the deal not being completed, after it was revealed Peter Kenyon had not signed Chelsea's end of the deal.After injury trouble and a therefore disappointing first season, he made an impressive return to the first team in a Premier League away match against Portsmouth on December 29, 2007. He was nominated Man of the Match by the Middlesbrough website.After the departure of Jonathan Woodgate to Tottenham Huth looks set to form a formidable central defensive partnership with the 'Redcar rock' David Wheater. On February 3, Huth scored against Newcastle United to earn a point against Kevin Keegan's team.International careerHuth is a viable option in dead-ball situations due to the tremendous power with which he can kick the ball. From a young age, Huth was already a member of the German national team. He also played at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. Together with Per Mertesacker, he was the first-choice central defenders for Germany at the 2005 Confederations Cup.On 29 June 2005, he scored his first goal for Germany in a 4-3 extra-time win against Mexico during the third-place play-off at the 2005 Confederations Cup. He has scored 2 goals in 17 games for Germany, as of June 2006. His second goal for Germany came in a 4-1 defeat to Italy in a friendly game played in Florence in March 2006.On the 20th March Huth was recalled to the German National team for the first time since the 2006 World Cup in a friendly against Switzerland because of his recent club form. He was later ruled out after suffering from a foot injury.HonoursFA Premier League: 2005, 2006Third placeConfederations Cup: 2005World Cup: 2006TriviaDuring the 2005 Confederations Cup German fans began chanting "Huuuuuuuuuuuuuth" (done as a low, rumbling sound) whenever Huth successfully resolved a situation - in later games, the chant started almost as soon as Huth came near the ball, to his own amusement. The chant originated from Huth's days at Chelsea.This chanting has carried on at Middlesbrough, much to the delight of the supporters and Huth himself. He is proud of his loyal supporters that have followed his career, and has stated so on the Middlesbrough F.C website.His training ground nickname is 'The Friendly One'.External linksCareer stats at Fussballdaten.de Huth Admitting Nerves Over Boro DealBoro Sign HuthHuth Transfer Complication    Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:2005 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:German expatriate footballers Category:German expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:German footballers Category:Germany international footballers Category:Germany under-21 international footballers Category:Middlesbrough F.C. players Category:People from Berlin Category:Premier League playersar:روبرت هوث de:Robert Huth es:Robert Huth eo:Robert Huth fr:Robert Huth id:Robert Huth it:Robert Huth lt:Robert Huth nl:Robert Huth ja:ロベルト・フート no:Robert Huth pl:Robert Huth pt:Robert Huth ru:Хут, Роберт sl:Robert Huth fi:Robert Huth sv:Robert Huth tr:Robert Huth zh:罗伯特·胡特
