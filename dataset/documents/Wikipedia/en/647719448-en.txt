He is well known for his poor disciplinary record and rough tackles, which have earned him a reputation as "being something of an uncompromising hardman"; he currently holds the record for the greatest number of red cards received in Serie A. However, he has also been described as "skillful on the ball and calm under pressure", and a "wonderfully talented and intelligent footballer". His international reputation is one of a man who was "fearsome, immovable and essential, in a back line that conquered Italy and Europe."BiographyMontero was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, into a footballing family; his father is former Uruguay international Julio Montero. As a child, Paolo had to maintain good grades at school, otherwise his father would not allow to him to attend football practice. As a professional, Montero played for Peñarol and Atalanta prior to joining Juventus in 1996. It was here that he achieved great success with the club, winning four scudetti with the Turin club, which he left in 2005; Montero was believed to have been Zinedine Zidane's best friend during the pair's time together at Juventus.After his tenure at Juventus, he moved to Argentinian club San Lorenzo. His time at San Lorenzo was short lived however, as he constantly missed games due to injuries. Montero also captained his country in their bid to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in an intercontinental playoff against Australia, the country the Uruguayans defeated on route to qualify for the 2002 tournament four years before. Sadly for Montero, he limped off with a hamstring injury during the second game in Sydney, and Australia qualified for the World Cup winning 4-2 on penalties. After the defeat, Montero immediately announced his international retirement, saying "what happened today was such a pity as this group of players deserved to be at the World Cup finals."In 2006, offers came in from clubs such as Olympiakos; however, Paolo chose to go to his personal childhood club (and where he began his career), Uruguayan Peñarol.RetirementPaolo Montero reportedly retired in late May after attending a team training session in order to say goodbye to his teammates. His current squad are trying to persuade him to come back to football, with teammate Ruben Capria saying that "it's a tough blow to lose our captain".
