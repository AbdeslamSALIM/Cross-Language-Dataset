Even though the club is based in Foxborough, the club represents all of New England. The club is owned by Robert Kraft, who also owns the New England Patriots of the NFL. The name "Revolution" refers to the New England region's involvement in the American Revolution. The team colors are navy blue and red.The Revs currently play their home matches at Gillette Stadium. The club played their home games at the adjacent and now-demolished Foxboro Stadium, during the 1996 through 2001 seasons. The Revs hold the distinction of being the first MLS team to have every league game in its history televised . Currently, the games are called by Revolution broadcasting executive Brad Feldman and analyst Greg Lalas (former Tampa Bay Mutiny defender and younger brother of Alexi Lalas).HistoryUntil their 3-2 victory over FC Dallas in the 2007 US Open Cup, the Revs had never won a major American trophy in their 13 year history. They were one of three teams in MLS that date back further than 2005 to have not won one of the three major titles in American soccer (MLS Cup, US Open Cup, and the MLS Supporter's Shield). They came close five times, reaching the US Open Cup final in 2001 and the MLS Cup finals in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007; coincidentally losing their US Open Cup final, and the MLS Cup in 2002 and 2005, to the Los Angeles Galaxy, and losing the MLS Cup in 2006 and 2007, to the Galaxy's former rival, the relocated Houston Dynamo.Their 2002 MLS Cup appearance granted them a spot in the 2003 CONCACAF Champions Cup, but lost their first matchup 5:3 on aggregate after playing two games on the road to LD Alajuelense. The Revolution again faced LD Alajuelense of Costa Rica in the home and away 2006 CONCACAF Champions' Cup. The "home" game was played February 22 2006 in Bermuda despite some fans feeling that playing at Gillette Stadium in the adverse conditions of winter in New England could have been advantageous. The Revs failed to advance, as they drew 0&ndash;0 in Bermuda and lost 0&ndash;1 in Costa Rica.New England had the chance to win their first MLS championship, in MLS Cup 2006, against the Houston Dynamo, but ultimately suffered the same fate as their two previous attempts in 2002 and 2005; the Revs, after Taylor Twellman scored in the second overtime, allowed a game-tying header, from Dynamo Brian Ching, that sent the game to penalty kicks, where New England lost, 4-3. The 2007 MLS Cup was a rematch from the previous year, though the result was the same as Houston defeated New England 2-1. It was New England's fourth loss in the MLS Cup in a six year span.Their main rivals are largely considered to be Red Bull New York, although in recent years the Revolution have built rivalries with fellow Eastern Conference teams DC United and Chicago Fire, and the MLS champions Houston Dynamo. The club's supporter's clubs are called the Midnight Riders and Rev Army. The name 'Midnight Riders' is in honor of the famous rides of Paul Revere and William Dawes, who announced the departure of British troops from Boston to Concord at the beginning of the American Revolution. The Midnight Riders and Rev Army occupy the north stand of the stadium, which they have nicknamed "The Fort". The Fort is a general admission section and draws its name from the revolutionary theme which runs through the team and independent supporters' associations.July 2008 incident aboard aircraftOn July 18, 2008, Revolution players and staff were on American Airlines Flight 725, a Boeing 757 with 151 passengers and seven crew on board, flying from Boston to Los Angeles. The team was en route to play Chivas USA as part of the 2008 SuperLiga tournament. During the flight, team staff helped to subdue an unruly passenger who had undressed and was attempting to open the plane's emergency exit during the flight. The plane was diverted to Oklahoma City, where the passenger was removed by FBI personnel.Sources: Revolution heroes nab unruly plane passenger - BostonHerald.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The Associated Press: FBI: Soccer team members help subdue man on flight&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Television and radio As of 2007, Revs matches are televised locally primarily on WSBK-TV - with several matches on CSN New England - except for nationally televised matches on ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, and FOX Soccer Channel.

Bids have gone out to local towns around New England to see where the Revs could have a stadium built.On August 2, 2007, the Boston Herald published an article stating that the city of Somerville and Revolution officials have held "preliminary discussions" about building a 20,000 to 25,000 seat stadium on a 100 acre site off of Innerbelt Road near Interstate 93, and could cost anywhere between $50 and $200 million based on other similar Soccer Specific Stadiums built by Major League Soccer teams.General managersBrian O'Donovan (1995&ndash;2000)Todd Smith (2001&ndash;2002)Craig Tornberg (2003&mdash;)Year-by-yearYearReg.
