The museum is dedicated to arts, crafts, and history. It has a large collection of paintings from the Dutch Golden Age and a substantial collection of Asian art.FoundationThe museum was founded in 1800 in The Hague to exhibit the collections of the Dutch stadtholders. It was inspired by French example. By then it was known as the National Art Gallery (Dutch: Nationale Kunst-Gallerij). In 1808 the museum moved to Amsterdam on the orders of king Louis Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon Bonaparte. The paintings owned by that city, such as The Night Watch by Rembrandt, became part of the collection.Cuypers' buildingIn 1863 there was a design contest for a new building for the Rijksmuseum, but none of the submissions was considered to be of sufficient quality. Pierre Cuypers also participated in the contest and his submission reached the second place. In 1876 a new contest was held and this time Pierre Cuypers won. The design was a combination of gothic and renaissance elements. The construction began on October 1, 1876. On both the inside and the outside, the building was richly decorated with references to Dutch art history. Another contest was held for these decorations. The winners were B. van Hove and J.F. Vermeylen for the sculptures, G. Sturm for the tile tableaus and painting and W.F. Dixon for the stained glass. The museum was opened at its new location on July 13, 1885.&lt;/ref&gt;The front of the museum is located at the Stadhouderskade, but on the other side it has a prominent position on the Museumplein, nowadays among the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, and the Concertgebouw.[[Image:X PICT0073.jpg|thumb|Rembrandt's The Night Watch in the Philips wing]]In 1890 a fragment building was added to the Rijksmuseum. This building was made out of fragments of demolished buildings that together give an overview of the Dutch history of architecture. In 1906 the hall for the The Night Watch was rebuilt. In the interior more changes were made, between the 1920s and 1950s most multi-coloured wall decorations were painted over. In the 1960s exposition rooms and several floors were built into the two courtyards. The building had some minor renovations and restorations in 1984, 1995–1996 and 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 until 2010&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (or as late as 2013) the Rijksmuseum will be [[Building restoration|restored]] and [[renovation|renovated]] based on a design by Spanish architects [[Antonio Cruz (architect)|Antonio Cruz]] and [[Antonio Ortiz (architect)|Antonio Ortiz]]. Many of the old interior decorations will be restored and the floors in the courtyards will be removed. During the restoration and renovation process only a few paintings from the permanent collection are on display in an exhibition called ''The Masterpieces'' in the already renovated fragment building, nowadays called the [[Philips]] wing.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;LibraryThe Rijksmuseum Research Library is part of the Rijksmuseum, and is the largest public art history research library in The Netherlands.CollectionThe paintings collection includes works by artists Jacob van Ruysdael, Frans Hals, Johannes Vermeer and Rembrandt and Rembrandt's pupils.Rembrandt[[Image:The Nightwatch by Rembrandt.jpg|thumb|Rembrandts The Night Watch (1642)]]The Paintings in the collection by Rembrandt van Rijn:The Night WatchThe Sampling OfficialsThe Jewish BrideThe Anatomical Lesson of Dr. DeymanPeter Denying ChristSaskia with a VeilPortrait of Titus in a Monk HabitSelf Portrait as the Apostle PaulTobias, Anna and the GoatJohannes Vermeer[[Image:Vermeer - The Milkmaid.jpg|thumb|Vermeer's The Milkmaid (1658–1660)]]Paintings in the collection by Johannes Vermeer:The MilkmaidThe Love LetterWoman in Blue Reading a LetterThe Little StreetFrans Hals[[Image:Frans Hals 056.jpg|thumb|Hals' Portrait of a Young Couple]] Paintings in the collection by Frans Hals:Portrait of a Young CoupleThe Company of Reynier RealThe Jolly DrinkerPortrait of Lucas De ClercqPortrait of Nicolaes HasselaerPortrait of a ManJan SteenPaintings in the collection by Jan Steen.''The Feast of Saint NicholasThe Drunken PairThe ToiletAdolf en Catharina CroeserArent Oostwaard and his wifeReferences "Rijksmuseum overhaul now facing 2013 finish" in The International Herald Tribune.
