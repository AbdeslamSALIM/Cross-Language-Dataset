The inaugural event (1935) saw 50 entrants face a 3,411 km (2,119 mi.) course over only 14 stages, averaging over 240km (149 mi.) per stage. It was inspired by the success of the Tours in France and Italy, and the boost they brought to the circulations of their sponsoring newspapers (L'Auto and La Gazzetta dello Sport respectively); Juan Pujol of the daily Informaciones instigated the race to increase his circulation.It was formerly held in the spring, but since 1995 the race has been run in September. The course includes two individual time trials. The finish of the Vuelta is traditionally the Spanish capital, Madrid.In 1999, for the first time, the course crossed the Alto de El Angliru in Asturias, which climbs 1,573 meters (5,160 feet) over 12.9 km (8 mi.) with grades as steep as 23.6 percent (at Cueña les Cabres) making it one of the steepest in Europe. Credit for the discovery of this climb and its addition to the Vuelta goes to Miguel Prieto.The overall leader wears the 'Jersey de Oro' (a Golden Jersey)&mdash;the Spanish counterpart to the yellow jersey of the Tour de France. Other jerseys honour the best climber (King of the Mountains) and the best sprinter (points competition) [awarded a blue with yellow fish jersey that is sponsored by Spain's fishing and marine industry]. Usually there are other cycling jerseys awarded, such as for points leaders in the "Metas Volantes" (intermediate sprints) and for the combination category (a point system that honours the best rider in combined totals for best overall, points and mountains classification).The record for most wins is held jointly by Switzerland's Tony Rominger, who won three consecutive Vueltas in 1992, 1993 and 1994; and Roberto Heras of Spain, winner in 2000, 2003 and 2004. Heras also won the 2005 event, but was disqualified for a doping offense. Spaniards have dominated, winning 28 of the 63 runnings of the Vuelta. France, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Colombia, Ireland (Sean Kelly in 1988), Russia and most recently Kazakhstan have also had first place finishers.2004 event The 2004 Vuelta a España was won by Roberto Heras. Halfway through the 2004 Vuelta, it appeared it would become an easy win for Heras, but in the last week his fellow countryman Santiago Pérez won two heavy mountain stages, thus becoming an important rival. Eventually Heras won with only 30 seconds advantage on Pérez. Francisco Mancebo, also from Spain took third. The first non-Spaniard was Stefano Garzelli from Italy in 11th. The points jersey was won by Erik Zabel from Germany, the mountain jersey was won by Félix Cárdenas from Colombia and the combination jersey was won by Roberto Heras. Kelme was the winner of the team ranking. Alessandro Petacchi, an Italian sprinter won four stages, but he didn't finish the Vuelta. Pérez Fernández won three stages.2005 event The 2005 Vuelta was won originally by Roberto Heras becoming the first four-time winner. Two months after the end of the race, Vuelta officials announced Roberto tested positive for the banned "blood-boosting" drug EPO. The positive tests were from urine samples taken before the start of Stage 20. He was then disqualified from the Vuelta and the victory was awarded to Denis Menchov from Russia. Menchov originally won the lead after the time trial, and did not let Heras escape until the last of the great mountain stages. At that stage, Heras had multiple strong team members leading in a breakaway, and used these to build a large lead once he managed to escape Menchov. Menchov was significantly handicapped by having a much weaker team, which was not able to help minimize the time loss to Heras.Winners of the Vuelta a EspañaVueltaYearWinnerNationalityTeam63]]2008Alberto ContadorAstana]]62]]2007Denis Menchov (2)Rabobank]]61]]2006Alexandre VinokourovAstana]]60]]2005Denis MenchovRabobank]]59]]2004Roberto Heras (3)Liberty Seguros]]58]]2003Roberto Heras (2)U.S. Postal]]57]]2002Aitor GonzálezKelme]]56]]2001Ángel CaseroFestina]]55]]2000Roberto HerasKelme]]54]]1999Jan UllrichTeam Telekom]]53]]1998Abraham OlanoTeam Banesto]]52]]1997Alex Zülle (2)Team ONCE]]51]]1996Alex ZülleTeam ONCE]]50]]1995Laurent JalabertTeam ONCE]]49]]1994Tony Rominger (3)Mapei-Clas]]48]]1993Tony Rominger (2)Clas-Cajastur47]]1992Tony RomingerClas-Cajastur46]]1991Melchor MauriTeam ONCE]]45]]1990Marco GiovannettiSeur44]]1989Pedro Delgado (2)Reynolds-Banesto]]43]]1988Seán Kelly]]Kas-Mavic]]42]]1987Luis HerreraCafé de Colombia41]]1986Álvaro PinoZor - BH40]]1985Pedro DelgadoOrbea-Gin MG]]39]]1984Éric CaritouxSkil-Reydel-SEM-Mavic]]38]]1983Bernard Hinault (2)Renault-Elf-Gitane37]]1982Marino LejarretaTeka]]36]]1981Giovanni BattaglinInoxpran35]]1980Faustino RuperezZor-Vereco34]]1979Joop ZoetemelkMiko-Mercier-Vivagel33]]1978Bernard HinaultRenault-Gitane-Campagnolo]]32]]1977Freddy MaertensFlandria-Velda-Latina]]31]]1976José PesarrodonaKas]]30]]1975Augustin TamamesSuper Ser29]]1974José Manuel Fuente (2)Kas-Kaskol]]28]]1973Eddy MerckxMolteni27]]1972José Manuel FuenteKas-Kaskol]]26]]1971Ferdinand BrackePeugeot-BP-Michelin]]25]]1970Luis OcañaBic]]24]]1969Roger PingeonPeugeot-BP-Michelin]]23]]1968Felice GimondiSalvarani22]]1967Jan Janssen]]Pelforth-Sauvage-Lejeune21]]1966Francisco GabicaKas-Kaskol]]20]]1965Rolf WolfshohlMercier-BP-Hutchinson19]]1964Raymond PoulidorMercier-BP-Hutchinson18]]1963Jacques AnquetilSt.Raphael-Gitane]]17]]1962Rudi AltigSt.Raphael-Helyett]]16]]1961Angelino SolerFaema]]15]]1960Franz De MulderGroene Leeuw14]]1959Antonio SuarezLicor 4313]]1958Jean StablinskiEssor-Leroux12]]1957Jesus LoroñoGamma11]]1956Angelo ConternoBianchi-Pirelli]]10]]1955Jean DottoVampire-d'Alessandro1951-1954 No competition held9]]1950Emilio RodriguezSangalhos1949 No competition held8]]1948Bernardo RuizPeugeot-Dunlop]]7]]1947Edouard Van DyckAlycon-Dunlop]]6]]1946Dalmacio LangaricaGalindo-Cicles Tabay5]]1945Delio Rodriguez1943 and 1944 No competition held (World War II)4]]1942Julian Berrendero (2)Informaciones3]]1941Julian Berrendero1937-1940 No competition held (Spanish Civil War)2]]1936Gustaaf Deloor (2)1]]1935Gustaaf DeloorVuelta victories by nationRankCountryWinsMost winsMost recent winner128Roberto Heras (3)Alberto Contador (2008)29Bernard Hinault (2)Laurent Jalabert (1995)37Gustaaf Deloor (2)Freddy Maertens (1977)45Tony Rominger (3)Alex Zülle (1997)54Angelo Conterno, Felice Gimondi, Giovanni Battaglin, Marco Giovannetti (1)Marco Giovannetti (1990)63Rudi Altig, Rolf Wolfshohl, Jan Ullrich (1)Jan Ullrich (1999)72Jan Janssen, Joop Zoetemelk (1)Joop Zoetemelk (1979)2Denis Menchov (2)Denis Menchov (2007)81Luis Herrera (1)Luis Herrera (1987)1Seán Kelly]] (1)Seán Kelly]] (1988)1Alexandre Vinokourov (1)Alexandre Vinokourov (2006)Vuelta a España stage winsRankNameCountryWins1Delio Rodriguez392Alessandro Petacchi193Laurent Jalabert18Rik Van Looy185Seán Kelly]]166Gerben Karstens13Freddy Maertens138Tony Rominger129Domingo Perurena11Julian Berrendero11Augustin Tamames1112Roberto Heras1013Eddy Planckaert10http://www.cyclinghalloffame.com/races/results/results_vuelta_a_espana.txtSee alsoGolden jersey statisticsExternal linksLa Vuelta (Official site in Spanish, English, and French)Cyclingfans.com : Guide to live race coverage, video and audio streamingVuelta a España prediction game at Cyclingpost2008 Vuelta a España Dashboard: links to live coverage, profiles, maps, results, photos and video   Category:Vuelta a España Category:Former UCI ProTour races Category:1935 establishments Category:Cycle races in Spainbg:Обиколка на Испания ca:Volta ciclista a Espanya cs:Vuelta a España da:Vuelta a España de:Vuelta a España es:Vuelta ciclista a España eu:Espainiako Vuelta fr:Tour d'Espagne gl:Vuelta Ciclista a España ko:벨타 아 에스파냐 io:Vuelta a España it:Vuelta a España he:וואלטה אספניה la:Circuitus Hispaniae lb:Vuelta a España hu:Vuelta Ciclista a España nl:Ronde van Spanje ja:ブエルタ・ア・エスパーニャ no:Vuelta a España pms:Gir dla Spagna pl:Vuelta a España pt:Vuelta a España ru:Вуэльта Испании simple:Vuelta Ciclista a España sk:Vuelta a España fi:Espanjan ympäriajo sv:Vuelta a España th:วูเอลตาอาเอสปันญา tr:İspanya Bisiklet Turu uk:Тур Іспанії
