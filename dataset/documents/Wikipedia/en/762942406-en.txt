 WinSCP (Windows Secure copy) is an open source SFTP and FTP client for Microsoft Windows. Its main function is secure file transfer between a local and a remote computer. Beyond this, WinSCP offers basic file manager functionality. For secure transfers, it uses Secure Shell (SSH) and supports the SCP protocol in addition to SFTP.Development of WinSCP started around May 2000 and continues. Originally it was hosted by the University of Economics in Prague, where its author worked at the time. Since July 16 2003 it is licensed under GPL and hosted on SourceForge.net.WinSCP is based on the implementation of the SSH protocol from PuTTY and FTP protocol from FileZilla.WinSCP is also available as a plugin for two file managers, FAR and Altap Salamander.WinSCP as a Remote EditorWinSCP can act transparently as a remote editor. When the user clicks on a (text) file in the remote file manager, it transfers the file to the local machine and opens it in the integrated editor, where Windows users can feel very much at home. Whenever the document is saved, the remote version is upgraded automatically.FeaturesGraphical user interfaceTranslated into several languagesIntegration with Windows (Drag-and-drop, URL, shortcut icons)All common operations with filesSupport for SFTP and SCP protocols over SSH-1 and SSH-2 and plain old FTP protocolBatch file scripting and command-line interfaceDirectory synchronization in several semi or fully automatic waysIntegrated text editorSupport for SSH password, keyboard-interactive, public key and Kerberos (GSS) authenticationIntegrates with Pageant (PuTTY authentication agent) for full support of public key authentication with SSHChoice of Windows Explorer–like or Norton Commander–like interfaces.Optionally stores session informationOptionally import session information from PuTTY sessions in the registryAble to upload files and retain associated original date/timestamps, unlike FTP clients.Portable VersionApart from standard package, standalone version exists for portable usage.
