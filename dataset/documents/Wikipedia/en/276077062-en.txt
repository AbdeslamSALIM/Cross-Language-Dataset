The current lineup of the musical group consists of four members: vocalist Otep Shamaya, guitarist Aaron Nordstrom, drummer Brian Wolff, and bassist/background vocalist &quot;Evil&quot; J. McGuire.HistoryOtep was formed in the fall of 2000 in Los Angeles,California by Otep Shamaya and &quot;Evil&quot; J. McGuire. After performing area shows, the band was noticed by Sharon Osbourne who was impressed enough to offer Otep a spot for the Ozzfest 2001 tour. During this time, the band was unsigned, but had several showcases for labels lined up. Capitol Records was intrigued by Otep and asked them to perform another showcase and soon was signed with them. The band's first record for Capitol was an EP titled Jihad. Thenceforward Otep released two albums (2002's Sevas Tra and 2004's House of Secrets). The second album, House of Secrets was produced by Greg Wells in Los Angeles at Rocket Carousel Studios. Otep performed at Ozzfest again in 2002 and 2004. Another member who played as rhythm guitarist (Melissa DeGott) joined in the beginning of 2005 and quickly departed in late 2006, because they decided as a band she was too young to be touring.In November 2006 the band began a North American tour to promote their forthcoming album The Ascension. As of May 2007, Otep announced their departure from Capitol Records Music Group. Otep Shamaya states, "We have reached an agreement with the incoming regime over at the newly formed Capitol Records Music Group and we are now, joyously, thankfully, free agents." Since then, the band supported the Static-X tour which ended June 13 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The track "March of the Martyrs" was released via Internet on the band's music player on their official MySpace page temporarily. The Ascension was released October 30, 2007. About a week before the release, samples of all the songs on The Ascension were put on otep.com for the fans.
