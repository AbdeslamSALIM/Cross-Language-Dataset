Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera is one of the Spanish occupied territories in North Africa off the Moroccan coast (Plazas de soberanía), along with the coastal cities of Ceuta and Melilla, the island of Peñón de Alhucemas and Islas Chafarinas. Vélez de la Gomera is administered from Melilla. Its tiny population is made up of military personnel only.Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera is located 119 km (72.7 mi) southeast of Ceuta, the largest Spanish territory in Africa. It was a natural island until 1934, when a huge thunderstorm washed large quantities of sand in the short channel between the island and the African continent (history of Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera on Spanish Defence ministry website, in Spanish only) . Ever since, it has been an artificial peninsula, currently connected to the Moroccan coast by an 85 m (279 ft) long sandy isthmus, the world's shortest land border. With a length of 400 meters northwest-southeast and a width of up to 100 meters, it covers about 19,000 m² or 1.9 ha or 0.019 km².In 1508 Spain launched an expedition under the command of Pedro Navarro to fight against the pirates who populated it, and who were constantly attacking and looting the coast of Southern Spain. Spain captured the Peñón, but they lost it again in 1522 after a successful Berber attack, in which the whole Spanish garrison was slaughtered. In 1564, after some failed attempts, the Spaniards reconquered it and they have retained control of it ever since, despite having been besieged on several occasions, in 1680, 1701, 1755, 1781 and 1790.In 1871 the Spanish Congress debated abandoning the Peñón, since by that time it had lost its military interest, but in the end the proposal was dropped..]]External linksAerial viewWorldStatesmen- SpainDescription of the history of Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, in Spanish onlySee alsoPlazas de soberaníaList of Spanish Colonial Wars in MoroccoSpanish Morocco  Category:Islands of Africa Category:Islands of Spain Category:Mediterranean islands Category:Plazas de soberaníaan:Peñón de Bélez d'a Gomera bg:Пеньон де Велес де ла Гомера ca:Vélez de la Gomera cs:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera de:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera et:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera es:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera fr:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera gl:Vélez de la Gomera id:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera it:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera nl:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera no:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera pl:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera pt:Ilhote de Vélez de la Gomera ro:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera sk:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera fi:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera vec:Vélez de la Gomera war:Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera
