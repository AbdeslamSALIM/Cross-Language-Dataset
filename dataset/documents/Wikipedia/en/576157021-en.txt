It has the formula CH3COCl and it belongs to the class of organic compounds called acyl halides. At room temperature and pressure, it is a clear colorless liquid. Acetyl chloride does not exist in nature, because contact with water would hydrolyze it into acetic acid and hydrogen chloride. In fact, if handled in open air it gives off white smoke owing to the hydrolysis from the moisture in the air. The smoke is actually gaseous hydrogen chloride which forms small droplets in the air with water vapour.SynthesisAcetyl chloride is synthesized by the reaction of acetic acid (CH3COO-H) with thionyl chloride (O=SCl2) under liberation of sulfur dioxide (SO2).CH3COO-H + O=SCl2 → CH3COCl + SO2 + H-ClUsesIt is a reagent for acetylation in the synthesis or derivatization of chemical compounds. Examples of acetylation reactions include acylation processes such as esterification (see below) and the Friedel-Crafts reaction).CH3COCl + HO-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-COO-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H-ClFrequently such acylations are carried out in the presence of a base such as pyridine, triethylamine, or DMAP, which as catalysts help to promote the reaction and as bases neutralize the resulting HCl.Acetylation is the introduction of an acetyl group via acylation using a reactant such as acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. An acetyl group is an acyl group having the formulaC(=O)-CH3For further information on the types of chemical reactions compounds such as acetyl chloride can undergo, see acyl halide.References External linksInternational Chemical Safety Card 0210Category:Acyl chloridesde:Essigsäurechlorid es:Cloruro de etanoilo fr:Chlorure d'éthanoyle id:Asetil klorida it:Cloruro di acetile nl:Acetylchloride ja:塩化アセチル pl:Chlorek acetylu pt:Cloreto de acetila ru:Ацетилхлорид zh:乙酰氯
