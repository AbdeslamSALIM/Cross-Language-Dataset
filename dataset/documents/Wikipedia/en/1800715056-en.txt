Ground beetles or carabids are collective terms for the beetle family Carabidae. This is a large family, with more than 40,000 species worldwide, approximately 2,000 of which are found in North America and 2,700 in Europe.Kromp (1999)Description and ecologyAlthough there is some variation in their body shape and coloring, most are shiny black or metallic and have ridged wing covers (elytra). The elytra are fused in some species, particularly large Carabinae, rendering the beetles unable to fly. The genus Mormolyce is known as violin beetles due to their peculiarly shaped elytra. All carabids except the quite primitive flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) have a groove on their foreleg tibiae bearing a comb of hairs. This is used for cleaning their antennae. However, rather than the flanged bombardier beetles never evolving this comb, it seems rather that they lost it, demonstrating that evolution does not equal progress but merely change.[[Image:Brachinus spPCCA20060328-2821B.jpg|thumb|left|A Brachinus sp. typical bombardier beetle (Brachininae: Brachinini) from North Carolina]]Defensive secretionsTypical for the ancient beetle suborder Adephaga to which they belong, they have paired pygidial glands on the lower back of the abdomen. These produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. In some, commonly known as bombardier beetles, these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion, producing a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas which can injure small mammals like shrews, and is liable to kill invertebrate predators outright. To humans, getting "bombed" by a bombardier beetle is a decidedly unpleasant experience. The "bombing" ability has evolved independently twice as it seems &ndash; in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) which are among the most ancient ground beetles, as well as in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae) which are part of a more "modern" lineage. The Anthiini, meanwhile, can mechanically squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans they are known as oogpisters ("eye-pissers"). In one of the very few known cases of a vertebrate mimicking an arthropod, juvenile Heliobolus lugubris lizards are colored similar to the aposematic oogpister beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.Huey & Pianka (1977)It is sometimes suggested that Charles Darwin found himself on the receiving end of a bombardier beetle's defences on a collecting trip in 1828,AMNH (2005) but this is based on a misreading of his autobiographyBarlow (1958): p.62; a bombardier beetles' "bombing" is already triggered by picking it up, and Darwin had been carrying the beetle in question in his closed hand for some time already when he ran afoul of its secretions. He discussed this incident and another such case in a letter to Leonard Jenyns as follows: "A Cychrus rostratus once squirted into my eye & gave me extreme pain; & I must tell you what happened to me on the banks of the Cam in my early entomological days; under a piece of bark I found two carabi (I forget which) & caught one in each hand, when lo & behold I saw a sacred Panagæus crux major; I could not bear to give up either of my Carabi, & to lose Panagæus was out of the question, so that in despair I gently seized one of the carabi between my teeth, when to my unspeakable disgust & pain the little inconsiderate beast squirted his acid down my throat & I lost both Carabi & Panagæus!"Darwin (1846)'', a tiger beetle from Japan]]EcologyCommon habitats are under the bark of trees, under logs, or among rocks or sand by the edge of ponds and rivers. Most species are carnivorous actively hunt for any invertebrate prey they can overpower. Some will run swiftly to catch their prey; tiger beetles (Cicindelinae) can sustain speeds of 8 km/h (5 mph) &ndash; in relation to their body length they are among the very fastest land animals on Earth. Unlike most Carabidae which are nocturnal, the tiger beetles are active diurnal hunters and often brightly coloured; they have large eyes and hunt by sight. Ground beetles of the species Promecognathus laevissimus are specialised predators of the Cyanide Millipede (Harpaphe haydeniana), countering the hydrogen cyanide which makes these millipedes poisonous to most carnivores.Relationship with humansAs predators of invertebrates, including many pests, most ground beetles are considered beneficial organisms. The caterpillar hunters (Calosoma) are famous for their habit of devouring insect larvae and pupae in quantity, eagerly feeding on tussock moth (Lymantriidae) caterpillars, processionary caterpillars (Thaumetopoeidae) and woolly worms (Arctiidae), which due to their urticating hairs are avoided by most insectivores. Large numbers of the Forest Caterpillar Hunter (C. sycophanta), native to Europe, were shipped to New England for biological control of the Gypsy Moth (Lymantria dispar) as early as 1905.A few species are nuisance pests. Zabrus is one of the few herbivorous ground beetle genera, and on rare occasions Zabrus tenebrioides for example occurs abundantly enough to cause some damage to grain crops. Large species, usually Carabinae, can become a nuisance if present in numbers, particularly during outdoor activities such as camping; they will void their defensive secretions when threatened and if they hide between provisions this can despoil food. Since ground beetles are generally reluctant or even unable to fly, it is usually easy to block their potential routes of entry mechanically or with a topical insecticide.(Panagaeus cruxmajor) got Charles Darwin into trouble in 1828.]] Especially in the 19th century and to a lesser extent today, their large size and conspicuous coloration as well as the odd morphology of some (e.g. the Lebiini) made many ground beetles a popular object of collection and study for professional and amateur coleopterologists. High prices were paid for rare and exotic specimens, and in the early to mid-19th century there was a veritable "beetle craze" in England. As mentioned above, Charles Darwin was an ardent collector of beetles around when he was about twenty years old, to the extent that he rather went out to hunt for rare specimens with William Darwin Fox, John Stevens Henslow and Sir Henry Thompson than to study theology as his father wanted him to do. In his autobiography he fondly recalled his experiences with Licinus and Panagaeus, and wrote: "No poet ever felt more delight at seeing his first poem published than I did at seeing in Stephen's Illustrations of British Insects the magic words, 'captured by C. Darwin, Esq.'"Barlow (1958): p.63-64Evolution and systematicsThe Adephaga are documented since the end of the Permian, about 250 million years ago (mya). Ground beetles evolved in the latter Triassic, having separated from their closest relatives by 200 mya. The family diversified throughout the Jurassic, and the more advanced lineages, such as the Harpalinae, underwent a vigorous radiation starting in the Cretaceous. The closest living relatives of the ground beetles are the false ground beetles (Trachypachidae) and the wrinkled bark beetles (Rhysodidae). They are sometimes even included in the Carabidae as subfamilies or as tribes incertae sedis, but more preferably they are united with the ground beetles in the superfamily Caraboidea.Much research has been done on elucidating the phylogeny of the ground beetles and adjusting systematics and taxonomy accordingly. While there is no completely firm consensus, a few points are generally accepted: As it seems, the ground beetles consist of a number of more basal lineages and the extremely diverse Harpalinae which contain over half the described species and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.''

For example, the system used by the Tree of Life Web Project makes little use of subfamilies, listing most tribes as incertae sedis as to subfamily.Maddison (2006) Fauna Europaea on the other hand splits the Harpalinae instead of lumping them, restricting them to what in the system use here is the tribe Harpalini.FEWS (2004)All the approaches mentioned above are legitimate as they agree with the phylogeny as far as it has been resolved. The inclusive Harpalinae presented here are used for two reasons, one scientific and one practical &ndash; first, the majority of authors presently uses this system, following the Catalogue of Palaearctic Coleoptera. Second, the MediaWiki markup cannot at present adequately represent the relationships of the ground beetle subgroups in detail if the restricted view of the Harpalinae is chosen.Basal ground beetlesCarabinae Latreille, 1802 - including Agoninae, CallistinaeAltagonumAplothorax (monotypic genus)Calosoma - including CallisthenesCarabusCychrus Fabricius, 1794HomothesFortagonumLaemostenusNotagonumCicindelinae &ndash; tiger beetles (roughly 2,100 species); sometimes included in CarabidaeCicindinaeElaphrinae Latreille, 1802Blethisa Bonelli, 1810Diacheila Motschulsky, 1844Elaphrus Fabricius, 1775HiletinaeLoricerinae Bonelli, 1810Loricera Latreille, 1802MigadopinaeNebriinae - includes Notiophilinae, often included in CarabinaeLeistus Frölich, 1799Nebria Latreille, 1802Notiophilus Dumeril, 1806Pelophila Dejean, 1821NototylinaeOmophroninae Bonelli, 1810 &ndash; round sand beetlesOmophron Latreille, 1802Paussinae Latreille, 1807 &ndash; flanged bombardier beetlesArthropterus Macleay, 1838Megalopaussus Lea, 1906Mystropomus Chaudoir, 1848PaussusSinometrius Wrase & Schmidt, 2006PromecognathinaeScaritinae Bonelli, 1810 &ndash; pedunculate ground beetlesClivina Latreille, 1802Dyschirius Bonelli, 1810Scarites Fabricius, 1775Siagoninae Bonelli, 1810Carabidae Conjunctae'' sp. from Australia (Amblytelinae: Amblytelini)]] '' (Broscinae: Broscini)]] ''(Egyptian predator beetle) from India (Harpalinae: Anthiini)]] '' (Harpalinae: Lebiini)]] '' (Trechinae: Bembidiini)]] Amblytelinae Sloane, 1898 - usually placed in the Psydrinae or Trechinae, but they seem to represent a distinct lineage related to Brachininae and Harpalinae,Maddison (1999) and in the system used here would consequently be eligible for subfamily status.Amblytelus Erichson, 1842ApotominaeApotomus Illiger, 1807Brachininae Bonelli, 1810Aptinus Bonelli, 1810 (tentatively placed here)Brachinus Weber, 1801Mastax Fischer von Waldheim, 1828Broscinae Hope, 1838  Acallistus Sharp, 1886Adotela Laporte de Castelnau, 1867Axonya Andrewes, 1923Baripus Dejean, 1828Bountya Townsend, 1971Brithysternum Macleay, 1873Broscodera Lindroth, 1961Broscodes Bolivar, 1914Broscosoma Rosenhauer, 1846Broscus Panzer, 1813Brullea Laporte de Castelnau, 1868Cascellius Curtis, 1839Cerotalis Laporte de Castelnau, 1868Chaetobroscus Semenov, 1900Chylnus Sloane, 1920Craspedonotus Schaum, 1863Creobius Guérin-Méneville, 1838Diglymma Sharp, 1886Eobroscus Kruizhanovskií, 1951Eurylychnus Bates, 1891Gnathoxys Westwood, 1842MecodemaMetaglymma Bates, 1867Microbarypus Roig-Juñent, 2000Miscodera Eschscholtz, 1830Nothobroscus Roig-Juñent & Ball, 1995Nothocascellius Roig-Juñent, 1995Oregus Putzeys, 1868Parroa Laporte de Castelnau, 1868Percolestus Sloane, 1892Percosoma Schaum, 1858Promecoderus Dejean, 1829Rawlinsius Davidson & Ball, 1998Zacotus Leconte, 1869 Harpalinae - including Chlaeniinae, Cyclosominae, Dryptinae, Lebiinae, Licininae, Mormolycinae, Odacanthinae, Oodinae, Panagaeinae, Perigoninae, Platyninae, Pseudomorphinae, Pterostichinae, Zabrinae (over 20,000 species)MelaeninaePsydrinaeMecyclothoraxTrechinae Bonelli, 1810 - including Bembidiinae, Patrobinae  Aepus Samouelle, 1819Amerizus de Chaudoir 1868 - includes GnatholymnaeumAnillinus Casey, 1918Anophthalmus Sturm, 1844Asaphidion Des Gozis, 1886Bembidion Latreille, 1802Blemus Dejean, 1821 - including LasiotrechusBroscus Panzer, 1813Cardiaderus Dejean, 1828Cillenus Leach, 1819Deltomerus Motschulsky, 1850Duvaliopsis Jeannel, 1928 (tentatively placed here)Duvalius Delarouzée, 1859Eurytrachelus Motschulsky, 1850Lymnastis Motschulsky, 1862Miscodera Eschscholtz, 1830Ocys Stephens, 1828Patrobus Dejean, 1821Perileptus Schaum, 1860Pogonus Dejean, 1821Porotachys Netolitzky, 1914 (tentatively placed here)Pseudaphaenops Winkler, 1912Rhysodes Dejean, 1821Serranillus Barr, 1996Tachyra Motschulsky, 1862Tachys Dejean, 1821Tachyta Kirby, 1837Thalassophilus Wollaston, 1854Trechoblemus Ganglbauer, 1891Trechosia Jeannel, 1926Trechus Clairville, 1806 Tribes ''incertae sedis''Amarotypini - Harpalinae?Gehringiini - Trechinae or a distinct subfamilyMetiini - Harpalinae?FootnotesReferences  (2005): Darwin - Young Naturalist, A Lifelong Passion.
