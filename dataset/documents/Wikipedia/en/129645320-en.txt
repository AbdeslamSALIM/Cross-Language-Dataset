Even at night the temperatures in summer are rather uncomfortable. In the winter, the days remain mild and sunny, but in the morning the thin air and low cloudiness cause very cold temperatures that can sometimes fall well below .HistoryThe city has a 3000 year long history, dating back to the time of the Median empire, when it was known as Ysatis (or Issatis). The present city name, however, may have been derived from Yazdegerd I, a Sassanid ruler. The city was definitely a Zoroastrian centre during Sassanid times. After the Islamic conquest of Persia, many Zoroastrians fled to Yazd from neighbouring provinces. The city remained Zoroastrian even after the conquest by paying a levy, and only gradually did Islam come to be the dominant religion in the city  Image:Ateshkadeh yazd.jpg|The Zoroastrian temple of Yazd Image:Bad Gir Yazd Dolat Abad.jpg|The windcatcher of "Dowlat-abad" in Yazd, is a fine example of desert Persian architecture. Image:Tekiyeh amir chaghmagh yazd.jpg|The medieval Takyeh Amir Chakhmagh, Yazd  Because of its remote desert location and the difficulty of approach, Yazd had remained largely immune to large battles and the destruction and ravages of war. For instance, it was a haven for those fleeing from destruction in other parts of Persia during the invasion of Genghis Khan. It was visited by Marco Polo in 1272 who remarked on the city's fine silk-weaving industry. It briefly served as the capital of the Muzaffarid Dynasty in the 14th century, and was sieged unsuccessfully in 1350&ndash;1351 by the Injuids under Shaikh Abu Ishaq. The Friday (or Congregation) Mosque, arguably the city's greatest architectural landmark, as well as other important buildings, date to this period. During the Qajar dynasty (18th Century AD) it was ruled by the Bakhtiari Khans.There is a very amazing thing about Yazd and its people who moved to the east of Yazd. In the rule of the Savafis (16. century) people from Yazd migrated to a place and called it Yazdi: This place is currently on the Iranian-Afghan border in the province of Farah, in Farah city in Afghanistan. The people of Yazdi in Farah city, in the province of Farah, are all Persians and Shi'ite (Shi'a) Muslims. They speak with an accent that is very similar to the Iranian people of Yazd. These Shi'ite-Persians in Yazdi of Farah city are forgotten.Architecture and Heritage.]]Yazd is of foremost importance as a centre of Persian architecture. Because of its climate, it has one of the largest networks of qanats in the world, and Yazdi qanat makers are considered the most skilled in Iran. To deal with the extremely hot summers, many old buildings in Yazd have magnificent windcatchers, and large underground areas. The city is also home to prime examples of yakhchals, the latter of which were used to store ice retrieved from glaciers the nearby mountains. Yazd is also one of the largest cities built almost entirely out of adobe.Yazd's heritage as a centre of Zoroastrianism is also important. There is a Tower of Silence on the outskirts, and the city itself has a Fire Temple, which holds a fire that has been kept alight continuously since 470 AD. Presently, Zoroastrians make up a significant minority of the population, around 20 - 40,000 or 5 to 10%.Historical Sites in Yazd City  Image:SaryazdStandingFacadeLR.jpg‏ |Remains of Historic Building Facade near Saryazd's southern cemetery - Saryazd.
