It generally describes a 2-door rear wheel drive mid-size car with a large, powerful V8 engine, and at an affordable price. Although opinions vary, it is generally accepted that classic muscle cars were produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&quot;Muscle Car Definition&quot; Muscle Car Club Muscle, undated, retrieved on 2008-06-16.Sherman, Don. &quot;Muscle Cars Now Worth Millions&quot; The New York Times, [[June 4], 2006,] retrieved on 2008-06-16.Classic Muscle Cars Library, How Stuff Works, undated, retrieved on 2008-06-16.&quot;Muscle Car Definition&quot; by Muscle Car Society, undated, retrieved on 2008-06-16. Muscle cars were built for street use and in some cases racing. They are distinct from sports cars and also from GTs, which are two-seat or 2+2 cars intended for high-speed touring/road racing. These are not generally considered muscle cars owing to their small size, relatively high cost and specialty nature. (The two-seater AMC AMX may or may not be an exception: one source queries whether it qualifies as a true muscle car or pony car,[http://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/amc-amx/amc-amx-history.shtml "AMC AMC History", Muscle Car Club].

Exactly what the name implies. It is a product of the American car industry adhering to the hot rodder's philosophy of taking a small car and putting a BIG engine in it ... The Muscle Car is Charles Atlas kicking sand in the face of the  weakling." Henshaw adds that the muscle car was designed for straight-line speed, and did not have the "sophisticated chassis", "engineering integrity" or "lithe appearance" of European high-performance carsHenshaw, Peter (2004): Muscle Cars, Thunder Bay Press. ISBN 1-59223-303-1Opinions vary as to whether high-performance full-size cars, compacts, and pony cars qualify as muscle cars.&lt;/ref&gt; Classic muscle cars are also defined by age and country of origin. The term "muscle car" did not enter common usage until after production of the vehicles had essentially ended, and American print media of the era commonly referred to them as "supercars".Example of the &quot;supercar&quot; term is in the article &quot;1957 Rambler Rebel&quot; by the Auto Editors of Consumer Guide, retrieved on February 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; DevelopmentEarly muscleengine]] Opinions on the origin of the muscle car vary, but the 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88, created in response to growing public interest in speed and power, is often cited as the first of the breed.

By 1964, there were Oldsmobile, Chevrolet, and Pontiac muscle cars in GM's lineup, and Buick joined them a year later. For 1964 and 1965, Ford had its  Thunderbolts, and Mopar unveiled the  Hemi engine. The Pontiac GTO was an option package that included Pontiac's  V8 engine, floor-shifted transmission with Hurst shift linkage, and special trim. In 1966 the GTO became a model in its own right. The project, spearheaded by Pontiac division president John DeLorean, technically violated GM's policy limiting its smaller cars to  displacement, but the new model proved more popular than expected and inspired GM and its competitors to produce numerous imitators. The GTO itself was a response to the Dodge Polara 500 and the Plymouth Sport Fury, which in 1962 had been shrunk to intermediates—at a time when bigger was considered better.AMC, though late entering the muscle car market, produced "an impressive array of performance cars in a relatively short time," said Motor Trend. "The first stirrings of AMC performance came in 1965, when the dramatic if ungainly Rambler Marlin fastback was introduced to battle the Ford Mustang and Plymouth Barracuda."[http://musclecars.howstuffworks.com/muscle-car-information/amc-muscle-cars.htm "AMC Muscle Cars" by the auto editors of Consumer Guide].

Although the Marlin was a flop in terms of sales and initial performance, AMC gained some muscle-car credibility in 1967, when it made both the Marlin and the "more pedestrian" Rebel available with its new ,  "Typhoon" V8. And in 1968 the company offered two legitimate muscle car contenders: the Javelin and its truncated variant, the AMX.Although the sales of true muscle cars were relatively modest by total Detroit production standards, they had value in publicity and bragging rights. Competition between manufacturers meant that buyers had the choice of ever-more powerful engines—a horsepower war that peaked in 1970, with some models offering as much as  (with this and others likely producing as much or more actual power, whatever their rating).Turn-key drag racersMuscle cars attracted young customers (and their parents) into showrooms, and they bought the standard editions of these mid-size cars. To enhance the "halo" effect of these models, the manufacturers modified some of them into turn-key drag racers.For example, Ford built 200 lightweight Ford Galaxies for drag racing in 1963. All non-essential equipment was omitted. Modifications included fiberglass panels, aluminum bumpers, traction bars, and a competition-specification  engine factory-rated at a conservative .

In response, the automobile insurance industry levied surcharges on all high-powered models, an added cost that put many muscle cars out of reach of their intended buyers. Simultaneously, efforts to combat air pollution—a problem that grew more complicated in 1973 when the OPEC oil embargo led to price controls and gasoline rationing—focused Detroit's attention on emissions control.A majority of musclecars came optioned with high-compression powerplants - some as high as 11:1. Prior to the oil embargo, 100-octane fuel was common (e.g. Shell's Hi-Test) until the passage of the Clean Air Act of 1970 where octane ratings were lowered to 91 - due in part of the removal of tetraethyl lead as a valve lubricant. Unleaded gasoline was phased in.With all these forces against it, the market for muscle cars rapidly evaporated. Horsepower began to drop in 1971 as engine compression ratios were reduced. High-performance engines like Chrysler's 426 Hemi were discontinued, and all but a handful of other performance models were discontinued or transformed into soft personal luxury cars. Some nameplates e.g. Chevrolet's SS or Oldsmobile's 442 would become sport appearance packages (known in the mid to late 1970s as the vinyl and decal option - Plymouth's Road Runner was an upscale decor package for their Volare coupes). One of the last to succumb, a car that Car and Driver dubbed "The Last of the Fast Ones", was Pontiac's Trans Am SD455 model of 1973–1974. In 1975 its performance was reduced, although it remained in production through 2002.American performance cars began to make a return in the 1980s. Owing to increases in production costs and tighter regulations governing pollution and safety, these vehicles were not designed to the formula of the traditional low-cost muscle cars. The introduction of electronic fuel injection and overdrive transmission for the remaining 1960s muscle-car survivors—the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird—helped sustain a market share for them alongside personal luxury coupes with performance packages, i.e. the Buick Regal T-Type or Grand National, Ford Thunderbird Turbo Coupe and Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS circa 1983-88.AustraliaGTS 350 V8]] Australia developed its own muscle car tradition around the same period, with the big three manufacturers Ford Australia, Holden or Holden Dealer Team (by then part of General Motors), and Chrysler Australia. The cars were specifically developed to run in the Armstrong 500 (miles) race and later the Hardie Ferodo 500 (the race's current 1,000&nbsp;kilometre format was adopted in 1973). The demise of these cars was brought about by a change in racing rules requiring that 200 examples had to be sold to the general public before the car could qualify (homologation). In 1972, the government stepped in to ban supercars from the streets after two notable cases. The first instance was a Wheels magazine journalist driving at  in a 1971 Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III XY 351.Mel Nichols- HO down the Hume Whilst the car was getting exposure in the press, the second incident occurred in George Street, Sydney, when a young male was caught driving at an estimated  through the busy street, in a 1971 Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III, drag racing a Holden Monaro GTS 350. This was known in Australia as "The Supercar Scare".Ford produced what is considered to be the first Australian muscle car in 1967, the  Windsor–powered XR Falcon. Ford continued to release faster models, culminating in the Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III of 1971, which was powered by a factory modified 351 Cleveland. Along with its GT and GTHO models, Ford, staring with the XW model in 1969, introduced a 'sporty' GS model, available across the Falcon range. The basic GS only came with a  six cylinder engine, but the  and  Windsor (replaced by the Cleveland engines for the XY), were optional. Ford's larger, more luxurious Fairlane was also available with these engines and could also be optioned with the   "Cleveland" engine.  351 V8]]Holden produced the famous Holden Monaro with , , and  Chevrolet smallblocks or  and  Holden V8s, followed by the release of four high-performance Toranas, the GTR-XU1 (1970–1973), SL/R 5000 (1974–1977), L34 (1974) and the A9X (1977).The XU1 Torana was originally fitted with a  triple carbureted 6-cylinder engine, later increased to , as opposed to the  single quad-barrel carbureted V8 in the SL/R 5000, L34, and A9X.Chrysler produced the R/T Valiant Charger from 1971 to 1973 when the R/Ts were discontinued; the dominant R/T models were the E38 and E49 with high performance  Hemi engines featuring triple Weber carburetors.Chrysler apparently considered a high-performance V8 program importing 338  V8 engines from the U.S.That high-performance project never went ahead, and the engines were subsequently fitted to the upmarket 770 model Charger. Initially this model was designated "SE" E55 340 (V8) and only available with automatic transmission; with a model change to the VJ in 1973 the engine became an option, and the performance was lessened.All Chrysler performance Chargers were discontinued in 1974 with the exhausting of high performance 265ci Hemi and 340 V8s.SE E55 340 V8]] The Australian muscle car era is considered to have ended with the release of the Australian Design Rule regarding emissions in ADR27a in 1976. An exception to this rule was the small number of factory-built Bathurst 1000 homologation specials that were constructed after 1976: they are considered to be musclecars. Examples of these homologation specials include the Torana A9X and the Bathurst Cobras.Later homologation cars were built outside of the factory, many by the Holden Dealer Team (HDT) for track and road use. Although not regarded as true muscle cars, they quickly gained an enthusiastic following. The HDT program was under Peter Brock's direction and had approval from Holden.Several highly modified high-performance road-going Commodores were produced through the early and mid 1980s. These "homologation specials" were produced to meet the Group A racing regulations. Models included the VC Group C, the VH SS Group III with a 0-100&nbsp;km/h of 6.7&nbsp;seconds,quickest HDT according to Modern Motor Magazine, January 1983 the Blue VK SS Group A and the burgundy VL SS Group A. These vehicles are all individually numbered with only 4246 Brock HDT's made and are considered to be collectors' items.The HDT Commodores are highly collectible muscle cars. Holden Dealer Team vehicles' became more collectible than ever in the wake of Brock's 2006 death.Showroom-condition HDT cars are generating prices as high as $200,000 AU.According to the Australian 5/2007 Wheels Magazine.South AfricaIn South Africa, Chevrolet placed the Z28 302 Chevrolet smallblock into a Vauxhall Viva coupe bodyshell and called it the Firenza CanAm. Basil Green produced the 302 Windsor–powered Capri Perana. In addition Australian HT and HG GTS Monaros (1969-71) were exported in CKD form and were given a new fascia and rebadged as a Chevrolet SS, which were sold until about 1973. Falcon GTs were also exported to South Africa and rebadged as Fairmont GTs. The Australian XW Falcon GT was called the 1970 Fairmont GT, and the XY Falcon GT was called the Fairmont GT. The Falcons were re-badged as Fairmonts because of to the bad reputation of the American Falcons at the time. The Fairmonts were almost the same as their Australian cousins apart from a few cosmetic differences.United KingdomV6-powered Ford Capri race car]] In the United Kingdom, the muscle car never gained a significant market, but it certainly influenced British manufacturers, with models such as the Ford Capri and Vauxhall Firenza directly inspired by American designs. Later, both Ford and Vauxhall continued the tradition of producing high performance variants of its family cars, though often these had more subtle styling than the traditional muscle car, but with some notable exceptions. The more European influenced hot hatch has largely occupied this segment of the market since the early 1980s. Arguably the first true British muscle car was the MGB GT V8.Modern muscle carsAmerica and AustraliaIn the U.S., the full-size, 4-door Chevrolet Impala SS had a short but popular production run from 1994–1996 as a high-performance limited-edition version of the Caprice equipped with a Corvette-derived 5.7 L V8 LT1 engine and other specific performance features and body styling using the options found on the Caprice 9C1 police package. The revived Impala SS was no match for the rising sport utility market; some analysts would consider GM's phasing out rear-wheel drive luxury sedans as a fatal mistake.The Impala SS nameplate was resurrected again in 2003 as a high-performance version of the standard Impala with larger and/or supercharged engines (whether the 21st century Impalas, which are front-wheel drive and have had variously V6s and V8s, can be considered muscle cars in the same vein as their earlier namesakes is debatable). General Motors discontinued its F-body pony-car models, the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird after 2002 but brought back the GTO in 2004 as a rebadged Holden Monaro imported from Australia.Sales were poor and the "new" GTO was discontinued after three years. In its first sales year it achieved only 14,000 of its 18,000 per-annum sales target. The styling was unpopular—''Car and Driver'' described the GTO as "lusty performance disguised in a phone-company fleet car"—and the already sluggish sales fell to 11,600 in 2006, its last model year.[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/pontiac32.htm “How Pontiac Works”, by the auto editors of Consumer Guide.] Retrieved on July 23 2008. However, according to an April 2008 article in Car and Driver, GM remained "undaunted" in its plan to "pull Pontiac’s performance bona fides out of mothballs using the next generation of Australian-engineered-and-built rear-drivers. The agenda includes the G8 sedan..." [http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/family_four_doors/2008_pontiac_g8_gt_road_test Robinson, Aaron.

Retrieved on July 24 2008.For 2003 and 2004 Mercury revived its old Marauder nameplate, as a modified  Mercury Grand Marquis (based on the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor). The Marauder failed to attract a market share unlike GM's Impala SS revival. In 2005 a "retro-inspired" version of the pony car Ford Mustang went on sale, which drew various design cues from Mustangs of the mid to late 1960s and early-1970s. In 2007 Ford and Shelby also re-released a new and modern version of the G.T. 500, with Super Snake and King of the Road editions following closely behind in 2008. Saleen has introduced a special edition based on the classic BOSS Mustangs of 1970 called the "PJ" after a famous Trans-Am series driver from the 1960s and 1970s, Parnelli Jones.In 2004 Chrysler introduced their LX platform, which serves as the base for a new line of rear-wheel drive, V8-powered cars (using the new Hemi engine), including a four-door version of the Dodge Charger. While purists would not consider a station wagon (the Dodge Magnum) or a four-door sedan a muscle car, the performance of the new models is the equal of many of the vintage muscle cars of legend. Dodge has also revived two "classic" model names with the Charger: Daytona and Super Bee. The first was featured in 2006 as a Dodge Charger Daytona R/T and the Super Bee joined in 2007 as the Dodge Charger Super Bee. In addition, Dodge has been developing a new performance vehicle under the Challenger badge, which borrows styling cues from its older namesake, the prototype for which made its debut at the 2006 North American International Auto Show. Chevrolet has recently unveiled their Camaro concept car as well, with plans to sell new Camaros beginning with the 2009 model year.GM's Cadillac division, which has marketed luxury cars for decades, introduced its XLR roadster in 2004 currently produced alongside the Chevrolet Corvette in its Bowling Green, Kentucky manufacturing plant. This led to the creation of the Cadillac V-series for their luxury CTS sedan, sold as the CTS-V.As with SUVs that have large-displacement engines, modern muscle cars are criticised for poor fuel efficiency. (The original muscle cars met with the same criticism in the 1960s.) However the muscle car is lighter at about  than the typical SUV, which weighs -.Modern-day musclecars are subject to the gas-guzzler tax, and the MSRP for a 2008 Shelby Mustang costs $50,000 - the same pricing territory as a Chevrolet Corvette.According to a 2006 press release, fuel economy standards forced GM to delay the Zeta platform when the Oshawa production facility had already been retooled for its production. The 2010 Chevrolet Camaro is one of GM's Zeta platform vehicles.Australian Ford and Holden are currently producing high performance vehicles. For instance, Holden has its SS and SSV Commodores and Utilities, and HSV has more powerful Holden based versions and currently producing a limited edition HSV W427 - a Commodore fitted with the 7 litre V8 from the C6 Corvette Z06. Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV) turns out similarly uprated special versions of the Ford Falcon Sedan, the major difference being Ford offer a  turbocharged 4.0 litre I6 as well as their V8s. FPV are producing the GT 4-door Falcons—both Boss V8 and turbocharged sixes; the premier Fords are currently the BOSS V8 and F6 turbocharged inline 6.Holden Special Vehicles currently produces high-performance versions of various rear-drive Holden Commodore sedans and, fitted with high performance (400 hp) V8 engines, and are perhaps one of the closest contemporary equivalents to the classic American muscle car (excluding the AWD of course)—-fast, exciting, but relatively crude automobiles (though with far more attention to handling, suspension, safety and exceptional brakes compared with the stock models).CollectibilityThe original "tire-burning" cars such as the AMC AMX, Buick Gran Sport, Dodge R/T, Ford Mustang, Oldsmobile 4-4-2, Plymouth GTX and Pontiac GTO, are "collector's items for classic car lovers."&lt;/ref&gt;Surviving muscle models are now prized, and certain models carry prices to rival some of the more highly valued European sports cars. At auction the rarest vintage 1965–1972 muscle cars can be appraised at over US$500,000 depending on model, options, condition, demand and availability. Some rare models like the 1969 Chevrolet Camaro with the ZL1 option are considered the equivalent of real estate or museum relics.Reproduction muscle-car sheet metal parts and even complete body shells are available.ModelsUnited StatesMotor Trend identified the following models as "musclecars" in 1965:1962–1965 Dodge Dart 413/426 Max Wedge/426 Hemi/Plymouth Fury 413/426 Max Wedge/426 Hemi1964–1965 Ford Thunderbolt 4271965–1969 Buick Skylark Gran Sport1965–1970 Dodge Coronet/Plymouth Belvedere 426-S1965 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS1965–1967 Oldsmobile Cutlass 442Road &amp; Track identified the following models as "musclecars" in 1965:1964–1965 Pontiac Tempest Le Mans/GTO1965–1975 Buick Riviera Gran Sport1965–1969 Buick Skylark Gran Sport1965–1970 Dodge Coronet/Plymouth Belvedere 426-S1965 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS1965–1967 Oldsmobile 442|Oldsmobile Cutlass 442Car and Driver also created a list of the 10 Best muscle cars for its January 1990 issue.
