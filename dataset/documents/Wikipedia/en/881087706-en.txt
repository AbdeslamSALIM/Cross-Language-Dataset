The club was formed in 1936 and currently plays in Italian Serie C1. Pescara has competed in 5 seasons of Serie A (1977-1978, 1979-1980, 1987-1988, 1988-1989, 1992-1993). Its last Serie A stint ended in 1993. The team's colors are white and light blue.HistoryApart from a spell in Serie B in the 1940s, Pescara had a relatively undistinguished history until promotion to Serie B in 1974. With players like Giorgio Repetto and Bruno Nobili in midfield, they managed to win promotion to Serie A in 1977 after winning a play-off, but finished in their first season in Serie A in last place. A second promotion after a play-off followed, but once more they would be relegated from the top flight and descend to C1 within two years.Nonetheless returning to Serie B after a year, Pescara would enjoy a revival after the appointment of the charismatic Giovanni Galeone in 1986. His philosophy of attacking football saw the Biancazzurri promoted to Serie A as champions for 1987, where they lasted two years with players such as Blaz Sliskovic among those starring. Galeone would return during season 1990-91 and oversaw another promotion the following year. Despite finishing bottom of Serie A for a third time, it was an attractive and entertaining side which had few problems scoring goals (thanks to midfielders Massimiliano Allegri and Ottavio Palladini) but also conceded them at an alarming rate. They were involved in a number of thrilling games like a 5-4 home defeat to Milan after being 4-2 up, and a 5-1 win over Juventus in the penultimate round (by which time they had been relegated).Defender Giacomo Dicara enjoyed three spells at the club, the first as a teenager in the late 1980s, the third ending in 2005.After relegation, Pescara remained in Serie B side throughout the 90s, narrowly missing promotion in 1999. Relegation to C1 followed in 2001, with promotion in 2003 being followed by two cancelled relegations in a row, thanks to bankruptcy and scancals affecting other clubs. As of 2005/06, the Biancazzurri have so far been a steady mid-table team.2006-07 SeasonThe 2006-07 season for the Delfini was not one to remember as the club endured three presidential and managerial changes during the season. Dante Paterna handed the reins over to Massimo Renzetti who then in turn left his post and was replaced by Max Pincione. After the miracle manager of the previous season, Maurizio Sarri, decided to leave to join Arezzo, Dante Paterna appointed Davide Ballardini. After failing to achieve a win in six games, Dante Paterna had seen enough and decided replace Ballardini with the highly regarded and experienced manager Aldo Ammazzalorso. After picking up just three points (from three draws) in nine games, Ammazzalorso also lost his job. Luigi De Rosa was the next manager to come in and became the permanent manager until the end of the sesaon. The club experienced problems both on and off the field. After losing many key players from the fantastic 2005-06 squad, Pescara couldn't re-create their great form. Depsite some good signings in the January transfer window, it still wasn't enough to save Pescara from relegation with four games to spare.Current first team squadAs of 2008-04-21                                    CoachesReferencesNotable former players Lorenzo Amoruso Stefano Borgonovo Morgan De Sanctis Dunga Julio Gutiérrez Júnior Massimo Margiotta John Sivebæk Blaž Slišković TitaSelected Former Managers Giovanni Galeone: 1986-1989; 1990-1993; 1999-2001See also: Category:Pescara Calcio players.External linksPescara's official website  Category:Pescara Calcio Category:Italian football clubs Category:Football clubs in Abruzzo Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1936 Category:Serie A clubs Category:Serie B clubs Category:Serie C1 clubs Category:Lega Pro Prima Divisione clubsde:Pescara Calcio es:Pescara Calcio fr:Pescara Calcio id:Pescara Calcio it:Pescara Calcio nl:Pescara Calcio ja:ペスカーラ・カルチョ pl:Pescara Calcio pt:Pescara Calcio sv:Pescara Calcio
