'' is a turn-based strategy game.]]A turn-based strategy (TBS) game is a strategy game (usually some type of wargame, especially a strategic-level wargame) that is turn-based. The phrase turn-based is used to distinguish such games from real-time strategy games, and as such the phrase refers almost exclusively to video games.Turn-based tacticsMain article Turn-based tacticsTurn-based tactical gameplay is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks using only the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Tactical role-playing games are a part of this genre. Examples include Silent Storm and Steel Panthers: World at War!.ExamplesMainstream PC gamesAfter a period of converting board and historic TBS games to computer games, companies began basing computer turn-based strategy games on completely original properties or concepts. The presence of a computer to calculate and arbitrate allows game complexity which is not feasible in a traditional board game.Probably the best known turn-based game is Sid Meier's Civilization, which evolved into a long series of successor games and derivatives. Other examples include:Indie PC gamesA further market trend is the rise of "Indie" TBS games (games produced by small groups, independent or only somewhat affiliated with the major elements in the computer games industry). These games often extend or refine already existing TBS strategy games. Some examples of indie-developed games include:Open-source PC gamesSince turn-based strategy games do not typically require vast amounts of art or modeling, developers willing to volunteer their time can focus on gameplay. Directories like Freshmeat provide large lists of open-source, turn-based strategy projects. Some examples of open-source games include:Battle for WesnothFreeCivFreeColFreeOrionTripleABrowser-based gamesBecause they do not require users to install files and are often free, online browser-based games are becoming very popular.
