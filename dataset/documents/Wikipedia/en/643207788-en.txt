He made four first-team appearances during 2003-04, his debut coming on September 3, 2003, in a 1-1 home draw against Sevilla FC.Moving to Levante UD in 2004, he proved himself a first division player, a trait he continued to display in the higher-ranked Real Zaragoza, whether as a starter or the first option from the bench. In 2007-08, he played all 38 matches, although the team was eventually relegated.At the beginning of the 2008-09 season, García was linked with a number of English Premier League clubs including Liverpool F.C., Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and Stoke City F.C., along with fellow team-mate Diego Milito. However, on September 1, 2008 in the very last seconds of the transfer window, after continuous rumours, he signed for Real Betis.García: &quot;Little by little we can move up in the ranks&quot; Rumours that he would leave Zaragoza had been further fuelled after the club's relegation, as he was thrown out of a side pre-season training session by manager Marcelino García Toral and was then left out of their opening day defeat against Levante.Marcelino throws Sergio García out of training session He scored his first goal for Betis on September 27, 2008, in the team's home game against Real Madrid (1-2 loss), following up on his own saved penalty.==International career== Without having being previously capped, García made the Spanish final squad of 23 for UEFA Euro 2008 (which Spain went on to win) as a replacement for Barcelona's Bojan Krkić. On May 31, 2008, he made his debut for the national side, coming on as a substitute for David Silva, in a friendly match against Peru. A week later he also appeared against United States.On June 18, García earned his first competitive cap, playing for the full 90 minutes against Greece, in Spain's third and final group D game in Euro 2008. In the 88th minute he delivered a pinpoint left-footed cross for Daniel Güiza to head home the 2-1 winner.HonoursSpain:UEFA European Championship: 2008UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship: 2002FIFA World Youth Championship: runner-up 2003ReferencesExternal linksStats at Liga de Fútbol Profesional    Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Catalan footballers Category:FC Barcelona footballers Category:La Liga footballers Category:Levante UD footballers Category:Real Zaragoza footballers Category:Spain international footballers Category:Spanish footballers Category:UEFA Euro 2008 players Category:UEFA European Football Championship-winning playersar:سيرجيو غارسيا ca:Sergio García de la Fuente de:Sergio García de la Fuente es:Sergio García de la Fuente fr:Sergio García de la Fuente it:Sergio García de la Fuente nl:Sergio García de la Fuente ja:セルヒオ・ガルシア (サッカー選手) pl:Sergio García pt:Sergio García de la Fuente sk:Sergio García fi:Sergio García de la Fuente sv:Sergio García de la Fuente
