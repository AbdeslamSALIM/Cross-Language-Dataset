 image_skyline=DuomoFeltre.jpg|image_caption=The Cathedral of Feltre.|  Feltre is a town and comune of the province of Belluno in Veneto, northern Italy. A hill town in the southern reaches of the province, it is located on the Stizzon River, about 4&nbsp;km from its junction with the Piave, and 20&nbsp;km southwest from Belluno. The Dolomites loom to the north of the town. HistoryIt was known in Roman times as Feltria and described as an oppidum by Pliny (Nat. Hist. iii, 130), who also assigned its foundation to the Alpine tribe of the Rhaetians. The city obtained the status of municipium in 49 BC.After the fall of the Western Empire, under which it had developed into a flourishing city, it became a Lombard dominion. Later in the Middle Ages, it was ruled by Ezzelino da Romano, the Camino family, by the Scaligeri of Verona from 1315 to 1337. Feltre was subsequently under Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, the da Carrara and the Visconti until 1404, when, together with Belluno, it was conquered by the Republic of Venice. In 1499 it received a new line of walls.In 1509 the center of the town was mostly destroyed during battles between the Venetians and the League of Cambrai, and later rebuilt with a characteristic 16th century style. In 1797, after the fall of Venice, it was ruled for some times by the French. After the Congress of Vienna (1814), Feltre was assigned to the Austrian Empire, to which remained until 1866.It was besieged by Austria during World War I.Notable people of Feltre include printer Panfilo Castaldi, humanist educator Vittorino da Feltre and painter Morto da Feltre.Main sightsThe Cathedral, entitled to St. Peter and St. Prosdocimus and rebuilt in Renaissance times.
