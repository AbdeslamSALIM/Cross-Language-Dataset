His father was Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine, the third son and fourth child of Grand Duke Ludwig II of Hesse and Wilhelmina of Baden. His mother was Julie Therese née Countess of Hauke.His parent's marriage was a morganatic marriage, as Julia was not considered a proper wife for a Prince, being only a Countess. As such, at the time of his birth, Henry could not take his title from his father, and was styled His Illustrious Highness Count Henry (Heinrich) Maurice of BattenbergOn 21 December 1858, Henry's mother was created Princess of Battenberg with the style Her Serene Highness. Henry inherited this style and became His Serene Highness Prince Henry of BattenbergPrince Henry received a military education and took up a commission as a lieutenant in the 1st Regiment of the Rhenish Hussars in the Prussian Army.MarriageBecause of their close relationship to the Grand Ducal House of Hesse, the Battenbergs came into close contact with various Royal and Princely families of Europe, including the British Royal House. Henry's elder brother, Prince Louis of Battenberg, had married Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine, his first cousin once-removed and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. In 1884, Prince Henry became engaged to The Princess Beatrice, the fifth daughter and the youngest child of Queen Victoria and Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Queen Victoria agreed to the marriage on the condition that the couple should make their home with her.Prince Henry and Princess Beatrice married on 25 July 1889 at St. Mildred's Church, Whippingham on the Isle of Wight. On the day of his wedding, the Queen granted Prince Henry the style [[His Royal Highness|''Royal Highness.]] to give him equal rank with his wife. This style took effect in the United Kingdom, but not Hesse and by Rhine (where the Prince was a still considered a ''Serene Highness). On the same day, a bill to naturalize Prince Henry a British subject passed the House of Lords. The couple adopted the style, Their Royal Highnesses Prince and Princess Henry of Battenberg. The Queen created her new son-in-law a Knight of the Garter and made him a member of the Privy Council. He also became a Colonel in the British Army, and afterwards Captain-General and Governor of Carisbrooke Castle and the Isle of Wight.Prince and Princess Henry of Battenberg had four children. By Royal Warrant of 13 December 1886, the Queen granted their children the style ''Highness''. This style took immediate effect in the United Kingdom though not in Hesse and by Rhine, where, as Princes and Princesses of Battenberg, they were only entitled to the style Serene Highness.Later life &amp; deathIn November 1895, Prince Henry persuaded Queen Victoria to allow him to go to West Africa to fight in the Ashanti War. He served as the military secretary to the commander-in-chief of British forces, General Sir Francis Scott. He contracted malaria when the expedition reached Prahsu, about 30 miles from Kumasi, and subsequently died aboard the cruiser [[HMS Blonde (1889)|HMS Blonde]] stationed off the coast of Sierra Leone. His body was repatriated by the cruiser [[HMS Blenheim (1890)|HMS Blenheim]] from the Canary Islands and his funeral service took place on 5 February 1896, at the same St. Mildred's Church on the Isle of Wight where he had been married. Interment followed in what became known as the Battenberg Chapel. The remains of his wife, Princess Beatrice, were placed there in August 1945 and those of his eldest son, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, in July 1961.Titles, styles, honours and armsTitles and styles5 October–21 December 1858: His Illustrious Highness Count Henry of Battenberg21 December 1858-23 July 1885: His Serene Highness Prince Henry of Battenberg23 July 1885-20 January 1896: His Royal Highness Prince Henry of BattenbergHonoursPC: Privy Counsellor, 1885KG: Knight of the Garter, 1885IssueNameBirthDeathNotesAlexander Mountbatten, Marquess of Carisbrooke]]3 November 188623 February 1960married, 1917 Irene Denison (4 July 1890-16 July 1956); had issueVictoria Eugénie, Queen of Spain]]24 October 188715 April 1969King Alfonso XIII of Spain]] (17 May 1886-28 February 1941); had issueLord Leopold Mountbatten21 May 188923 April 1922died unmarried, no issuePrince Maurice of Battenberg3 October 189127 October 1914died unmarried, no issue Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:British Army General List officers Category:British military personnel of the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War Category:Prussian Army personnel Category:Knights of the Garter Category:British people of German descent Category:1858 births Category:1896 deaths Category:Deaths from malaria Category:House of Battenberg Category:Infectious disease deaths in Sierra Leonebg:Хайнрих фон Батенберг ca:Enric de Battenberg de:Heinrich Moritz von Battenberg es:Enrique de Battenberg fr:Henri de Battenberg it:Enrico di Battenberg nl:Hendrik Maurits van Battenberg ja:ヘンリー・オブ・バッテンバーグ pl:Henryk Battenberg pt:Príncipe Heinrich de Battenberg
