He led the Brazilian national team to victory in the 2002 World Cup. He was also the head coach of the Portuguese national team between 2003 and 2008 taking them to the final of Euro 2004 and fourth place at the 2006 World Cup. He is a very experienced club manager, having coached numerous teams on three continents.Playing careerA defender regarded as more uncompromising than skilful (he was known as "wooden leg" among his contemporaries), Scolari followed in the footsteps of his father Benjamin, who was also a professional footballer. His playing career encompassed spells with Caxias, Juventude, Novo Hamburgo and CSA, and often captained his sides. It was with CSA that he won his only major title as a player - the Alagoano state championship.Managerial careerClub managementEarly careerUpon retiring as a player in 1982, he was appointed manager of CSA, winning the Alagoano state championship in his first season. After spells with Juventude (twice), Brasil de Pelotas and Al-Shabab of Saudi Arabia, he moved to unfashionable Grêmio, where he won the 1987 Gaúcho state championship.KuwaitHe then had a two year stint in charge of Kuwaiti side Al Qadisiya Kuwait, with whom he won the prestigious Kuwait Emir Cup in 1989.http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/coaches/p/lpscolari.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a brief stint as manager of the Kuwait national team, winning the 10th Gulf Cup in Kuwait. He returned to Brazil after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait during the Gulf War and coached Criciúma to the its first major national title Copa do Brasil. He returned to club management in the Middle East, managing Al-Ahli and a second spell at Al Qadisiya.http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/coaches/p/lpscolari.htm&lt;/ref&gt;GrêmioIn 1993 he returned to Grêmio, where he was criticised by the Brazilian media for playing the ugly side of the beautiful game with his players known for getting into brawls during matches. He won six titles in only three years including the Copa Libertadores in 1995http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/coaches/p/lpscolari.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which qualified them for the Intercontinental Cup, which they lost to Ajax Amsterdam on penalties.http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=31089/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The following year they won the Brazilian Championship.http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=55&amp;&amp;cc=5739&lt;/ref&gt;His team featured no real superstar and depended on workman-like players such as Paraguayan right back Francisco Arce (who he later took to Palmeiras), the tough-tackling midfielder Dinho, Paulo Nunes and centre forward Mário Jardel.http://soccernet.espn.go.com/players/manager?id=55&amp;&amp;cc=5739&lt;/ref&gt;Júbilo IwataIn 1997, Scolari became manager of J. League side Júbilo Iwata, but left after eleven games and shortly afterwards took charge of Palmeiras, one of the biggest clubs in Brazil.PalmeirasIn three years, he led Palmeiras to the Copa do Brasil, the Mercosur Cup and their first Copa Libertadores title with a win on penalties over Deportivo Cali of Colombia. They were also runners-up to Manchester United in the 1999 Intercontinental Cup. He was named South American Coach of the Year for 1999.CruzeiroIn 2000 he was appointed to manage Cruzeiro, coaching them for a year. He led Cruzeiro to its third Copa do Brasil title.International managementKuwaitScolari's first taste of international management came in 1990 when he coached the Kuwait national team. They won the Gulf Cup of Nations in 1990 beating Qatar in the final, but he was forced to leave the country when Iraq invaded during the Gulf War after which he went back to club management for a decade.BrazilIn June 2001 was appointed manager of his native Brazil, who with five matches remaining were in danger of not qualifying for the 2002 World Cup. Despite losing his first match 1-0 to Uruguay, Scolari eventually guided the team to qualification.In the build-up to the finals, Scolari famously refused to include veteran striker Romário in his squad, despite public pressure and a tearful appeal from the player himself. Brazil entered the tournament unfancied, but wins over Turkey, China, Costa Rica, Belgium, England and Turkey again took them to the final, where they beat Germany 2-0 to win their fifth FIFA World Cup title.http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jun/30/minutebyminute.worldcupfootball2002&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2002 Scolari resigned as Brazil Manager.http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E2DD123AF933A2575BC0A9649C8B63&lt;/ref&gt;PortugalScolari took over as Portugal manager in 2003 and oversaw their preparations as host nation for Euro 2004. In the finals, Portugal got through the group stages and saw off England in the quarter finals on penalties before beating the Netherlands in the semi-finals. However in the final they were beaten 1-0 by Greece.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3860105.stm&lt;/ref&gt;He managed Portugal in the 2006 World Cup in Germany where they managed to reach the semi-finals, again coming out victorious in the quarter-finals against England. But they did not reach the final due to a semi-final defeat against eventual runners-up France. Following the tournament Scolari was very heavily linked with the England managers job, but he ultimately opted to remain as Portugal coach.Scolari took Portugal to UEFA Euro 2008 and took them into the knockout stages by winning Group A before being eliminated by Germany in the Quarter Finals. During the tournament he announced that he would be joining Chelsea FC in the 2008/09 season.Return to club managementChelseaScolari took over as manager of Chelsea F.C. on July 1 2008. This was announced shortly after Portugal's Euro 2008 match against the Czech Republic on June 11 2008. With this appointment, Scolari became the first World Cup winning manager to manage in the Premier League. Many Premier League fans will relish the confrontations between Scolari and Sir Alex Ferguson and have been warned to expect "tantrums" and more importantly "triumphs".  When asked whether his decision to join Chelsea was financial he responded "Yes, that is one of the reasons". But he added "I'm 59 and I don't want to work as a coach until I'm 70. I want to retire in four or five years, so it was a financial matter but there are other things". He also said "I could offer my son the opportunity to study elsewhere. You only get this kind of opportunity once so you take it or leave it, but it was not only financial."Scolari later said that he had turned down an offer to manage Manchester City.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/chelsea/2824095/Luiz-Felipe-Scolari-I-turned-down-Manchester-City-in-favour-of-Chelsea---Football.html&lt;/ref&gt;Scolari's first match in charge of Chelsea was a friendly match against Chinese side Guangzhou Pharmaceutical; Chelsea won 4-0.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/7522225.stm&lt;/ref&gt; He made FC Barcelona midfielder Deco his first signing, for a fee of around £8 millionhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/jun/30/chelsea.barcelona?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront&lt;/ref&gt;, but was subsequently frustrated in his attempts to sign Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7593026.stm&lt;/ref&gt;Scolari's career as Chelsea manager in the Premier League got off to a good start with a 4-0 victory over 2008 FA Cup winners Portsmouth.http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2008/0817/chelsea_portsmouth.html&lt;/ref&gt;Personality Scolari is famous for his temper and for his histrionic "performance" by the field while the match is going on, reacting strongly to both the best and the worst moments of his team. A good example of his fierce temper was a September 12, 2007 qualifying match for Euro 2008 against Serbia when, at the end of the game, and after the referee had blown the whistle for a 1-1 draw, Scolari, after being slapped in the hand by the Serbian player Ivica Dragutinovic, grazed him in the face with a left hook Video of Scolari punchGoal.com - Euro 2008 - Slap Happy Scolari Hits Out At Serbian Player&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;. His character, however, is often seen as a good point, instead of a drawback, because he tries to keep the players (and himself) free of external pressures: he usually demands a lot more freedom than most coaches are allowed and is bent on exerting a somewhat discretionary power. Some critics mostly agree that his unique character was very beneficial to the Portuguese national team, which had a tradition of talented players but never won anything because of excessive intervention from the federation, the clubs and the player's agents, as well as a lack of a true "team spirit". However, his reputation as a "father" and big friend to his players is untouchable.In the 2002 FIFA World Cup he gave each of his players a copy of Sun Tzu's The Art of War, a Chinese military treatise written during the 6th century BC. He also gave the team recordings of Ivete Sangalo Festa videoclip, to enforce the Brazilian spirit and motivate the team engagement. UOL Esporte - Copa do Mundo 2002 - Últimas Notícias&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In the recent 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany he used the The Art of War again to plan his team's win against England. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/Document.aspx?id=57D9E1B8-59BD-45CA-A8D4-9D07F2C0C0FC&lt;/ref&gt;.Scolari also holds Italian citizenship, since his family emigrated from Veneto. He is said to be a fan of Grêmio and Palmeiras.He is a fan of Portugese football and has attended F.C. Porto football games on several occasions.Scolari also has a cocktail named after him. The 'Big Phil Scolari' consists of mainly dark rum and exotic fruit juices and was created by master cocktail makers Dan Sherratt and Bryn Tweedale.HonoursCentro Sportivo AlagoanoAl Qadisiya KuwaitKuwaitCriciúmaGrêmioPalmeirasCruzeiroBrazilReferencesExternal linksChelsea profile     |-              |   Category:2002 FIFA World Cup managers Category:2006 FIFA World Cup managers Category:Brazil national football team managers Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian football managers Category:Brazilians of Italian descent Category:Chelsea F.C. managers Category:Cruzeiro Esporte Clube managers Category:FIFA World Cup-winning managers Category:Football (soccer) defenders Category:Júbilo Iwata managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Japan Category:People from Rio Grande do Sul Category:Premier League managers Category:UEFA Euro 2004 managers Category:UEFA Euro 2008 managers Category:1948 births Category:Living peoplear:لويس فيليب سكولاري be:Луіс Феліпэ Скалары bg:Луиш Фелипе Сколари ca:Luiz Felipe Scolari da:Luiz Felipe Scolari de:Luiz Felipe Scolari es:Luiz Felipe Scolari eo:Luiz Felipe Scolari fr:Luiz Felipe Scolari id:Luiz Felipe Scolari it:Luiz Felipe Scolari lt:Luiz Felipe Scolari he:לואיס פליפה סקולארי hu:Luiz Felipe Scolari mr:लुइझ फेलीपे स्कोलारी nl:Luiz Felipe Scolari ja:ルイス・フェリペ・スコラーリ no:Luiz Felipe Scolari pl:Luiz Felipe Scolari pt:Luiz Felipe Scolari ru:Сколари, Луис Фелипе fi:Luiz Felipe Scolari sv:Luiz Felipe Scolari tr:Luiz Felipe Scolari zh:路易斯·菲利佩·斯科拉里
