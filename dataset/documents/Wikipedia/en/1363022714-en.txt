The city is home to one of the oldest Spanish military air bases as well as the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Also located within the city is the Cerro de los Ángeles, or Hill of the Angels, a site considered to be the geographical center of the Iberian Peninsula. The city is located 13 km south of Madrid's city center, in the south of the metro area. It is situated within a flat area of Spain's Meseta Central in the Manzanares River basin.Getafe's proximity to Madrid has propagated great industrial development during the 20th and 21st centuries. The industrialization of Getafe led to an increase in population to 159,300 (as of December 2007). Due to its industrial and social networks, the majority of residents work or study within the city, and has mitigated its transformation into a commuter town. The increase in population has led to the construction of numerous access roads, an increase in available public services, and the creation of new neighborhoods at the end of the 20th century.EtymologyDuring the the Middle Ages, a number of villages were located in the present-day area of Getafe. One of the main villages was Alarnes, which was very close to the current urban center. In 1326, the villagers united themselves into one city, situated on the royal road that linked Madrid with Toledo. This new city was called Xatafi, a name which came from the Arab word jata ("something long"). It is assumed that the name Xatafi referred to the royal road, which also served as the town's main street. The city's name evolved over time, from Xetafe to Jetafee to Jetaphe to Jetafe to Getafe.Historyof Getafe from the 19th century.]] The history of Getafe can be split into three clearly-defined eras. In the first era, which lasted from Prehistory until 1326, there existed distinct civilizations and villages in the area, though Getafe itself did not exist as a municipality. The second era lasts from the 14th century until the 20th century, during which Getafe is established as a town and develops slowly. In the third era, which began in the 20th century and continues to the present day, Getafe changes in natures from small agriculture town to a large industrial city, with a noticeable increase in commerce, industry, population, and city size.Historia de GetafeOriginsThe presence of humans in the area of Getafe dates back to the Lower Paleolithic period (before 100,000 BCE). Various stone tools, pots, and bracelets from this period have been excavated from the banks of the Manzanares River.The Romans dominated the Iberian Peninsula from the 2nd century B.C.E. until the 5th century. In the 3rd century, the Romans constructed a villa called La Torecilla, whose ruins are still visible on the banks of the Manzanares River. The area was subsequently overrun by a series of Germanic tribes, including the suebi, vandals, alans, and visigoths.The area currently encompassed by the Getafe municipal district was invaded by the Moors in the 8th century. King Alfonso VI conquered the villages of the area in 1085. In 1326, the inhabitants of the villages moved closer to the royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo, in effect creating a new village, Getafe. In that same century, the primitive hermitage of la Magdalena was built, only to be destroyed several centuries later.Modern PeriodIn 1492, famine and disease devastated in Getafe, prompting the construction of the Hospitalillo de San José in 1529. In 1549, the architect Alonso de Covarrubias began building the Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Magdalena, which has since become the Cathedral of the Diocese of Getafe. The church was built on the foundation of the old hermitage, and in 1610 a new hermitage was built on the Cerro de los Ángeles. The college of the Escuelas Pías was founded in 1737. In 1763, King Carlos III ordered the construction of a new road connecting Aranjuez to Cádiz, which passed along the foot of the Cerro de los Ángeles. Napoleanic troops occupied Getafe from 1808 to 1812. A trolley route connecting Madrid to Aranjuez, and passing through Getafe, was inaugurated in 1851.20th century and the Present[[Image:Gran-teatro-getafe.JPG|thumb|170px|Getafe's Gran Teatro (Great Theater) at the end of the 19th century.]] Electric street lights were lit for the first time in Getafe on 22 December 1897. The Getafe Air Force Base was permanently established in 1911, followed by the School of Civil Aviation two years later. King Alfonso XIII inaugurated the first monument to the Sacred Heart of Jesus on the Cerro de los Ángeles on 30 May 1919. In 1924, Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. built its first factory in the area. That same year, Juan de la Cierva's autogyro was flown for the first time from the air force base.Due to its proximity to Madrid, Getafe underwent a large industrial revolution at the beginning of the 20th century, resulting in the city's conversion from agricultural city to industrial commuter town. Industrialization also prompted a rapid boom in population, starting in the 1950s. In 1956, John Deere established a factory in Getafe, and a year later, Siemens AG followed suit. The city was forced to create the neighborhoods of San Isidro, El Bercial, Juan de la Cierva, and Las Margaritas in the 1970s in order to support these new industries.In 1961, the Canal de Isabel II began to provide water to Getafe. The first local democratic elections occurred in 1979, after the ratification of the Constitution in 1978. In 1989, the Universidad Carlos III was founded. The Sector III neighborhood was constructed between 1979 and 1988; the Getafe Norte neighborhood was built during the late 1990s. The El Bercial neighborhood is currently being expanded. In April 2003, Madrid Metro System's Line 12 opened, linking the southern cities with the capital.HeraldryThe coat of arms of Getafe is divided vertically into two equal halves that represent the two most important characteristics of the municipal district. The left half contains a heart in the center of a Latin cross, representing the Sacred Heart of Jesus -- a reference to the Cerro de los Ángeles. The right half contains a repeated pattern of airplanes representing the aeronautical tradition of the area and referencing the nearby Air Force Base. The Royal Spanish Crown tops the coat of arms, and symbolizes Getafe's loyalty to the Spanish monarchy.Famous Inhabitants.]]Some famous personages who live or have lived in Getafe are:Silverio Lanza (Madrid, 1856 - Getafe, 1912), writer.

The most popular political parties in the area, other than the PSOE, are the Peoples' Party (PP) and the United Left (IU). Getafe has always had a large working population, and left-wing groups, especially the PSOE, have traditionally been very influential.In the 2007 Spanish regional elections, the PSOE elected 13 town councillors (44.18% of the vote), PP, 11 (36.09%), and IU 3, (11.73%).Resultados de las elecciones municipales de 2007 Other political associations were not able to muster enough votes to receive representation. Local elections occur every four years, along with the autonomous election. The next elections will be held in 2011.Cabinet meetings are composed of nine councillors: seven from the PSOE and two from IUS. The Municipal Corporation is made up of 27 members, detailed previously. The cabinet is presided over by the mayor. The Getafe city council is divided into a number of different focus groups: treasury, wealth, and social security; urbanism; civil action; and management of waste disposal, cleanliness, the environment, and the home. The council holds sessions every month, in addition to frequently held special sessions, in which councillors debate various topics and problems which affect the municipality.Getafe is at the forefront of the struggle for workers rights in local industry. The most important labor unions in the city are the Workers' Commissions (CCOO) and the Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT). Both unions have branch offices in Getafe and list many local workers as members.GeographyPhysical Location[[Image:Cerro-buenavista.JPG|thumb|220px|Cerro Buenavista, or Buenavista hill, the area of highest elevation in the Getafe municipality at 704 meters (2309 ft). There is a deposit of water on the summit of the hill from the canal of Isabel II.]] Getafe is located in the southern zone of the autonomous community of Madrid, Spain, in southwestern Europe. It is physically located in the center of the Iberian Peninsula, north of the Southern Submeseta (part of the Meseta Central), in the Manzanares River basin. Its elevation is 610 - 640 meters above sea level (2000 - 2100 feet). Its coordinates are 40° 18' N 3° 43' W. The municipal district is 78.74 km2, with a perimeter of 46.5 km. The eastern-most part of the municipal district is located within the Parque Regional del Sureste, a protected forest region.DistancesDue to its central location within the Iberian Peninsula, Getafe is no more than 725.6 km from any Spanish provincial capital in mainland Spain. The following are the distances to a few major cities, the oceans which surround the Spanish coasts, and the national borders of Portugal and France. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relief. This is the area with the lowest elevation in the Getafe province (540 m; 1772 ft).]] The municipal district is mostly flat, with a minor inclination of 5% to the east and an elevation of 631 m (2070 ft) above sea level. The lowest altitude can be found to the extreme east, at the Manzanares River at 540 m (1772 ft). The highest elevation is found on the extreme west, on Buenavista, a 704 m (2310 ft) hill which sits on the border between the municipalities of Getafe and Leganés, some 12 km South of Madrid. The hilliest area, the hills of the Marañosa, is located in the Southeast and has a maximum elevation of 698 m (2290 ft). In the center of Getafe is the Cerro de los Ángeles, or hill of angels (670 m; 2198 ft). Pine forests have been planted at the feet of these hills to deter the erosion of the soil.HydrologyA number of rivers and other natural waterways pass through Getafe. 9.5 km of the Manzanares Rive passes through the eastern-most parts of the municipal district. In the South, 16.5 km of the Culebro Waterway winds its way across Getafe, and in the Southeast 2 km of the Filipinas gully descent from the hills of the Marañosa. There are two man-made canals, one on each side of the Manzanares River. These parallel canals provide water for cultivated land further from the river.The lakes of Perals are 2 km East of the Cerro de los Ángeles, and are some of the only undisturbed natural lakes left in the region. For this reason, the lakes are part of a protected area to preserve their natural state.The Culebra waterway and the Filipinas gully boast heavy water flow during the winter and little to none during the summer. In contrast, the Manzanares carries water year round. For that reason, Getafe is considered to be within the Manzanares river basin, except for a small portion in the Southeast which is part of the Jarama river basin.BordersThe city of Getafe borders the following municipal districts: to the North, Villaverde and Vallecas; to the East, Rivas Vaciamadrid; to the Southeast, San Martín de la Vega; to the South, Pinto; to the Southwest, Fuenlabrada; to the West, Leganés.NW: LeganésN: VillaverdeNE: VallecasW: LeganésGetafeE: Rivas-VaciamadridSW FuenlabradaS: PintoSE: San Martín de la VegaClimateThe climate of Getafe is continental MediterraneanValores climáticos normales de Getafe and is influenced by urban conditions. Winters are cool, with temperatures dropping below 8°C (46.4°F) during the day, and frequently below 0°C (32°F) at night. Getafe averages three to four snowfalls per year. Summers are very hot, with median temperatures above 24°C (75.2°F) in July and August, and with maximum temperatures which often reach 35°C (95°F). Daily temperatures oscillate within range of 10°C (18°F).Precipitations are regularly distributed throughout the year, excluding the dry summer months. The rainiest month is November, with 56.48 mm (2.22 in) of rainfall, and the driest month is July, with only 8.21 mm (0.323 in). Average yearly precipitation is around 445 mm (17.52 in).One of the major problems of Getafe's climate is air pollution, which increases noticeably when the wind blows South or Southeast. The average annual temperature is 14°C, with the highest temperature on record listed at 41.6°C (106.8°F) on 24 July 1994, and the lowest temperature recorded at -12°C (10.4°F) on 5 February 1963. The average relative humidity is 71%, average pressure is 1,015.8 millibars, average number of daylight hours per year is 2,811, and the winds blow predominantly from the northeast.Extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and tornadoes, never occur in Getafe thanks to its climate and geography. One common problem in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula is drought, which occurs whenever precipitation ceases during various months. + Observatory at the Getafe Air Force Base1948-1988JanuaryFebruaryMarchAprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctoberNovemberDecemberTOTAL / AVGMax. temp.

Visible are pine trees, olive trees, and extensive wheat fields.]]The native vegetation of Getafe is characteristic of the mediterranean forest biome, consisting mostly of holm and cork oaks. Native flowering plants include those of the genus Cistus and the common broom (Cytisus scoparius), though these species are not abundant. This native forest and underbrush only occupies 16% of the surface of the municipal territory, mostly in the hills of the Marañosa and further east. The shores of the Manzanares River and Culebro Waterway contain deciduous trees and reeds.Most undeveloped land is devoted to the cultivation of cereals (mostly wheat), and, to a lesser extent, to gardens in the fertile lowlands of the Manzanares river. Some areas have been reforested with stone pines (Pinus pinea) and aleppo pines (Pinus halepensis). These areas include the Cerro de los Ángeles, the Prado Acedinos, part of the hills of the Marañosa, and part of the park in the Sector III neighborhood. Common trees in the parks and streets of the city are the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum), the acacia, the elm (Ulmus minor), and the stone pine. Other less common trees include cedars, cypress, aleppo pines, plum trees, poplars, fir trees, and palm trees.A significant population of small birds live within the city proper, including sparrows and pigeons. Larger birds, rabbits, foxes, wild boars, and weasels can be found in the more easterly parts of the municipality. The world's largest population of the common kestrel can be found in the Perales del Río neighborhood.Town PlanningThe urban portions of Getafe are organized in an almost longitudinal manner, from northeast to southwest. Thus, the elongated shape of Getafe today is due primarily to the close proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which impedes city growth to the southeast. The most important streets of the city are Calle Madrid and Calle Toledo. These two roads are pedestrian through the center of Getafe, and are part of what was a royal road connecting Madrid and Toledo during the Middle Ages. Getafe has other important streets and avenues organizing its neighborhoods, such as the Avenida de España, Avenida de Los Ángeles, Avenida de las Ciudades, Avenida Juan Carlos I, and Calle Ferrocarril.The popular architectural style in Getafe is generally characterized by two story buildings with tile roofs, various small balconies on the second floor, and a bare brick façade. These types of houses can be found in the Getafe Centro neighborhood, though their numbers are decreasing as existing houses are vacated and demolished to make room for new townhouse developments. The average height of buildings in Getafe is five floors, approximately 17 meters. This peculiarity is due to the proximity of the Getafe Air Force Base, which places limits on the height of buildings. Few buildings in Getafe surpass eight stories in height.  Due to the developmental limitations imposed by the Air Force Base and the municipality borders, the city's parks and green spaces are important conservation areas. Two of the largest parks are located within the Sector III and La Alhóndiga neighborhoods. These green zones include an artificial lake and river, two pine forests, and a number of hiking trails. The parks cover an area approximately the size of Getafe Centro, and make up the western part of the urban center, separated from the east by the A-42. A series of parks of various sizes are located within the city proper. Outside of the city are two pine forests with picnic areas, fountains, and kiosks.Getafe's urban center is undergoing various expansions of its urban center. One of these is the construction and establishment of the El Bercial neighborhood. This expansion of El Bercial will quadruple the size of the neighborhood and will allow the city to expand to the northeast, linking El Bercial to the urban center. The Los Olivos industrial park is expanding eastward, while at the same time, the Perales del Río neighborhood grows westward, bringing these two neighborhoods closer together. The Área Tecnológica del Sur is being constructed in the southern parts of the municipal district, along the M-50. The Área will be an area dedicated to a number of exposition halls and areas for new industrial development.Getafe township has a number of projects underway to expand urban areas. One of these projects is expanding the Sector III neighborhood by constructing housing at the feel of Buenavista hill. Another project involves creating a residential neighborhood called Los Molinos, located east of Getafe Norte and north of the Los Ángeles industrial park. A third project calls for the construction of a university, the Universidad Politécnica de Getafe, which will include three departments and a central building.Administrative Division[[Image:Avda-españa-getafe.jpg|thumb|220px|The Avenida de España, with the Juan de la Cierva neighborhood metro station.]] Prior to the 20th century, Getafe had only one neighborhood, which encompassed the modern Getafe Centro and La Alhóndiga neighborhoods. The Perales del Río neighborhood is also one of the oldest neighborhoods in the municipality, dating from approximately the 17th century.

In addition, there exists even more digital-only media.Means of Transportation[[Image:Getafe-tren.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Train and metro station Getafe Central.]]Getafe, like most large cities, has a number of means of transportation, including highways, taxi stands, a bus system, trains, and a subway.RoadsFour highways and divided highways pass through Getafe: two beltways (A-42 and A-4) and two highways leading through Madrid (M-45 and M-50). Another two-lane road connects Getafe with Leganés, and two provincial roads lead to Perales del Río. The following is a list of major arteries:Highways:M-45, highway to Madrid. 4 km of this highway is inside Getafe, crossing it from West to East. The road marks the Northern limits of the Getafe Norte and El Bercial neighborhoods.M-50, highway to Madrid. 13.6 km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the city center West to East. The road marks the Southern limits of the Sector III neighborhood and the Northern limit of the El Culebro industrial park.Divided Highways (Autovías):A-4, the Highway of the South, previously called the N-IV. 7.25 km of this highway run through Getafe, and it crosses the center North-South. The road separates the Los Ángeles and San Marcos industrial parks from the Los Olivos industrial park and the Cerro de los Ángeles.A-42, the Toledo Highway, previously called the N-401. 6.13 km of this highway run through Getafe, and it cuts across the center in a North-South orientation. The road separates the Section III and El Bercial neighborhoods from the city center. To lessen the isolation of these neighborhoods, the local government has begun a project to create an underground passage for the A-42 as it crosses through Getafe.Other Roads:M-406, two-lane road.
