She was added to the cast of SNL in 2000. After leaving ''SNL in 2006, Fey created her own television series called 30 Rock. In the series, she portrays Liz Lemon, the head writer of TGS with Tracy Jordan, a fictional sketch comedy series. In 2008, she starred in the movie Baby Mama, alongside Amy Poehler. More recently, Fey has returned to SNL to portray/parody Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.Early lifeFey was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, the daughter of Zenobia "Jeanne" (née Xenakes),Fey revealed on Rachel Ray that her mother was born as Zenobia, but the name was changed at school to Jean/Jeanne due to difficulty of pronunciation -hence Fey's own daughter's middle name is Zenobia. a brokerage employee, and Donald Fey, a university grant proposal-writer. Fey's father is of German and Scottish ancestry and her mother Greek American.Fey was exposed to comedy early, saying: She also grew up watching SCTV and includes Catherine O'Hara as one of her role models.Fey attended Cardington Elementary School and Beverly Hills Middle School.

She graduated from Upper Darby High School in 1988.&quot;Tina Fey Gets the Last Laugh&quot;, Fox News, April 25, 2004. Accessed November 28, 2007. "Back in the late 1980s, Fey and the other "AP-class brainiac nerds," as she called her clique, used to sit together in the lunchroom at suburban Philadelphia's Upper Darby High School, making up nasty nicknames for their classmates."CareerAfter Fey graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in Drama in 1992, she moved to Chicago in order to take night classes at The Second City. Once her Second City training began, she immersed herself in the "cult of improvisation", becoming, as she described it a decade later, "one of those athletes trying to get into the Olympics. It was all about blind focus. I was so sure that I was doing exactly what I’d been put on this Earth to do, and I would have done anything to make it onto that stage. Not because of SNL, but because I wanted to devote my life to improv. I would have been perfectly happy to stay at Second City forever."By 1994, she was invited to join the cast of The Second City, where she performed in the Jeff Award-winning revue Paradigm Lost. Improvisation became an important influence on her initial understanding of what it means to be an actress, as she noted in an interview for The Believer in November 2003: While in Chicago, she also made what she later described as an "amateurish" attempt at stand-up comedy. Fey is also a veteran of The ImprovOlympic.''Saturday Night Live''With then-head-writer Adam McKay's help, Fey became a writer for NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) in 1997. By 1999, Fey was SNL's first female head writer, a milestone she downplays in light of the fact that there have not been very many head writers. As co-head writer of SNL's 25th anniversary special, Fey won a 2001 Writers Guild of America Award. She and the writing staff also won a 2002 Emmy Award for their work on the show.In September 2005, she went on maternity leave after giving birth to a daughter, Alice Zenobia Richmond. Her Weekend Update role was covered by Horatio Sanz for two episodes before her return to the show on October 22, 2005, at which time she noted:"I had to get back to work. NBC has me under contract; the baby and I only have a verbal agreement."&lt;/ref&gt;The season was her last, as she thereafter departed to develop 30 Rock.''SNL'' sketchesSome recurring sketches written by Fey include:Parodies of Live with Regis and Kelly and The ViewThe Girl with No Gaydar, cowritten by Rachel DratchThe Boston Teens, cowritten by Rachel DratchShe is also credited with:Colonel Angus, portrayed by Christopher Walken in a sketch filled with word play on the colonel's nameMom Jeans commercial"Talkin 'Bout 'Ginas" (Parody of The Vagina Monologues)"Old French Whore!"

Coyle, Jake. &quot;Tina Fey 'likely' to play Sarah Palin on 'SNL'.&quot; AP. September 13, 2008. Palin's campaign said that Palin was amused, particularly because she had once dressed up as Tina Fey for Halloween, though Palin later said she had seen the sketch without hearing the audio. John McCain's top economic advisor Carly Fiorina called the skit sexist. During the 2008 Emmy Awards, Fey said of the vice-presidential candidate (in what may be the only known political advocacy regarding the 2008 Presidential election on Fey's part), "I want to be done playing this lady November 5. So if anyone could help me be done playing this lady November 5, that would be good for me." On September 27, she reprised her role as Palin, parodying the CBS News interview with Katie Couric, who was played by Poehler. Portions of the skit were direct quotes and gestures from interviews with Couric on September 24. On October 4, she played the role of Palin at the 2008 vice-presidential debate, with Jason Sudeikis playing Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Joe Biden and Queen Latifah as moderator Gwen Ifill.

This strike affects the show in which I work. We put our pens down yesterday, and we will not write until negotiations resume."
