The car has a hand-finished fibreglass body shell atop its aluminium extrusion and bonded frame that provides a rigid platform for the suspension, while keeping weight and production costs to a minimum. The roadster is capable of speeds up to 240 km/h (150 mph). The Elise was named after "Elisa", the granddaughter of Romano Artioli who was chairman of Lotus at the time of the car's launch Lotus Elise - The Official Story - Jeremy Walton ISBN 1 902351 05 3 pages 7 & 95. Series 1 The design philosophy of Lotus is "Performance through light weight", first adopted by the founder of Lotus, Colin Chapman. The motto drives Lotus to obtain performance with lightweight cars instead of high power outputs, emphasizing driving purity and dynamics. 's Russell Chicane]] The result is a sports car that in production form in 1996 weighed in at just 720 kg (1,587 lb). For comparison, a Porsche Boxster is 74% heavier at 1,250 kg (2,756 lb).The Series 1 Elise is able to accelerate 0-60 mph in 5.8 seconds despite its relatively low power output of . Braking, cornering, and fuel consumption are also improved by the car's reduced weight.Heading the design and engineering teams that created Series 1 were Julian Thomson, then head of design at Lotus, and Richard Rackham, Lotus's chief engineer.Although high-tech, it represented affordable cost of ownership for people who love sports cars on a budget who still wanted performance and looks.Besides the "standard" higher-performance variants listed below, Lotus also released some limited edition models such as Sport 135 (1998/9) with approx 145 bhp (108 kW), Sport 160 (2000) with 150&ndash;160 bhp (112&ndash;119 kW) and Sport 190 (190 bhp / 142 kW). These were more competent on track with sports suspension, wheels and tyres, seats according to model. There were other special editions which were basically cosmetic treatments such as the 50th Anniversary Edition (green/gold) celebrating 50 years of Lotus cars, the Type 49 ("Gold Leaf" red and white two-tone), and Type 72 ("JPS" black/gold) to recall their successful Grand Prix car type numbers.111SThe original Elise, called the Series 1 was augmented by a faster edition called the 111S, named after the Lotus type-number of the Elise &mdash; M111. The 111S was introduced in early 1999 and contained a VVC Rover K-Series engine with a modified head and VVT type technology producing a declared  rather than the standard Rover 1.8 L K-series  unit, along with a closer ratio gearbox and lower ratio final drive. It also had more padding in the seats. The 111S also received some cosmetic changes including: headlamp covers, rear spoiler, cross drilled brake discs, alloy window winders and a new 6 spoke road wheel design.340R In 2000, the 340R limited edition model, based on a Series 1 Elise was introduced. This roofless car was a special edition, limited to only 340 cars being built. The name 340 refers to the 340 bhp/tonne (254 kW/tonne) power-to-weight ratio of the original prototype which had  while weighing just . The final production versions however weighed  in race trim.Exige Also in 2000, Lotus introduced the Exige &mdash; a hardtop version of the Elise with the  engine from the 340R &mdash; as well as different front and rear clams, larger wheels, and a rear wing. Many models received an upgrade to  with better driveability due to changes to ECU and cam timing.Series 2sp=uk250px|Lotus Elise Series 2]]name = Series 2manufacturer =parent_company =aka =production = 2002&ndash;presentassembly =predecessor =successor =class =body_style =layout =platform =Rover K-Series]]1.8 L Toyota 1ZZ-FE1.8 L Toyota 2ZZ-GEmanual]]6-speed manual2300|13785|11719|11117|1860|040.1|L|USgal|1related =designer =thumb|right|300px|2007 Elise Series 2 models at the Lotus Performance Driving School at Spring Mountain Motorsports Ranch.]]Announced on October 9 2000, the Series 2 Elise was a redesigned Series 1 using a slightly modified version of the Series 1 chassis and the same K-series engine with a brand new Lotus-developed ECU.The design of the body paid homage to the still-born M250 project and was the first Lotus to be designed on computer. The Series 2 Elise is built on the same production line also created for the Vauxhall VX220/Opel Speedster in a newer facility at Hethel. Both cars shared many parts, including the chassis, although they have totally different drivetrains and powerplants. The Vauxhall / Opel version ceased production in 2004.The Series 2 was also available as a 111S model, with the VVC engine technology. The 111S models were discontinued in 2005 with the demise of the K-series engines in favour of the Toyota powerplant (see below).Two more track-focussed models, the 135R and Sport 190 were available with 135bhp and 192bhp respectively. These also came with associated handling upgrades such as Lotus Sport Suspension and wider wheels with Yokohama Advan A048 tyres. In certain markets, the 135R was replaced by the "Sport 111", which was similar, apart from sporting the 156bhp VVC engine in place of the 135bhp tuned K-series.111RThis Series 2 Elise model comes in European 111R version or a version sold in North America, called the Federal Elise. It is powered by the all-aluminium 189 hp (141 kW) 1.8L DOHC Toyota engine with a Yamaha designed twin-cam head offering variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust valvetrain, a 6 speed manual Toyota gearbox. The Series 2 model is acclaimed as the best version of the Elise to date, with tremendous performance numbers, with many tests resulting in 0&ndash;60 mph (0&ndash;100 km/h) in approximately 4.9 seconds or 4.7 seconds with the Sport Package. The engine management computer is a Lotus programmed unit. A radical cam timing shift at ~6,000 rpm makes the car feel like it has two different engines.The 2005 Lotus Elise was the first to be sold commercially in the United States, in the summer of 2004. Approval for the Elise, however, required intervention by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) who provided a three-year exemption for the car, as it had failed to meet US bumper and headlight regulations. All Lotus Elise cars manufactured after January 1, 2007 include the new headlights and  bumpers, although they are hidden in the front.This model has been followed up by the 2006 Model Year Elise 111R and SportRacer models. Lotus made a limited edition (50 in the US) version of the Lotus Elise as well, called the Lotus Elise Sport.2006 models also differ from the 2005 models in a few aspects. 2006 models sport LED tail lights, drive by wire (an updated ECU), improved gas mileage, as well as more comfortable seats.For the 2007 model year Lotus there were several further minor changes made. The LOTUS lettering on the rear of the vehicle, which was previously flat stickers, was changed to raised lettering. The headlamp units were sealed. Also, in order to comply with US Federally mandated bumper restrictions, the frontal crash structure was slightly changed and rear bumperettes were added next to the license plate mount. Approximately 100 2007 model year "launch" cars were shipped to the US without these bumper changes.Also in 2007 the Elise S was released and the 111R renamed Elise R. The Elise S is the new base model with a Toyota sourced 1.8l engine replacing the previous models K series rover engine. The 1ZZ-FE engine produces 134 bhp (100 kW) at 6200 rpm (an increase over 120 bhp (89 kW) rover engine). The inclusion of airbags, ABS brakes, electric windows, and carpet in addition to the new heavier engine has increased the base weight to 860 kg (1895 lb) (approximately  higher than the previous S model).2008 ModelsFor 2008, there are several additions to the Lotus line-up. There are two versions of the Elise. Lotus will continue to provide a naturally aspirated Elise producing . The second version is the Elise SC sporting a non-intercooled supercharger producing 218hp. 0-60mph is reduced from 4.9 for the base Elise or 4.7 seconds for the Elise with Sport package to 4.4 seconds for the Elise SC. The NA Elise styling will be similar to the prior model years. The Elise SC, however, will be distinguishable from the NA version by a rear spoiler identical to the Type 72-D edition spoiler and new wheels. Weight remains a Lotus-claimed ; just  more than the previous year.Several new colour options for 2008 have been brought to the marketplace. These include new metallic colours (additional $590) Persian Blue and Liquid Blue; new Lifestyle colour (additional $1200) Isotope Green; new Limited Colour Level (additional $3,300) Candy Red, Ice White, and Burnt Orange; and the new Exclusive Colour Level (additional $5,100) Prism Green and Moonstone Silver. The following colours have been discontinued for 2008: Nightfall Blue, Aubergine Purple, Magnetic Blue, Polar Blue, Autumn Gold, Chili Red, and Krypton Green.Special EditionsSport 190Sport 135RType 23Type 25Type 49Type 72Type 99TSports RacerExige The Series 2 Exige, comes with the same high revving Toyota engine and six speed gearbox as the Elise 111R, replacing the Rover K-series engine of the previous Exige.The Series 2 Exige has been followed up by the limited-edition Lotus Sport Exige 240R, incorporating a Lotus-developed supercharger atop the Toyota engine.
