After many destructions, it was rebuilt by the Romans, with the name of Aquilonia, and was part of the Tribe of Galeria. It was later called Al Cidonia and then Cedogna until 1800. Finally it became Lacedonia.In 517 AD it was given to the Benedictine monks by the Emperor Justinian.It was under the Lombards, the Counts of Conza and the Normans, then became a fiefdom of the Balvano, Orsini, Pappacoda and Doria families.Lacedonia is famous for the "conspiracy of the barons" of the Kingdom of Naples against King Ferdinand I of Naples, which took shape in the cathedral of Lacedonia in 1484.Lacedonia has suffered much from earthquakes, especially in 1694 and 1702. In 1930 another violent earthquake destroyed the whole town; the population lived, temporarily, in earthquake-proof houses and only in the year 2001 were they able to move to more modern houses built after the earthquake of 23 November, 1980, which made thousands of victims in Savignano Irpino.See alsoRoman Catholic Diocese of Lacedonia, former see at LacedoniaSources and references(incomplete) http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08732a.htmCategory:Cities and towns in Campania Category:Roman sites of Campaniade:Lacedonia es:Lacedonia eo:Lacedonia fr:Lacedonia it:Lacedonia la:Aquilonia hu:Lacedonia nl:Lacedonia ja:ラチェドーニア nap:Lacedonia pms:Lacedonia pl:Lacedonia pt:Lacedonia vo:Lacedonia
