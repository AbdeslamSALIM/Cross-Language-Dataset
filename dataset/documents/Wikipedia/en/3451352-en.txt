The initial coat of arms was granted by King Edward VII on 7 May 1908, and the current version was granted by King George V on 19 September 1912, although the 1908 version continued to be used in some contexts, notably appearing on the sixpenny coin until 1966.Design.]]The shield is the focal point of the coat of arms, contained within is the badge of each Australian state. In the top half, from left to right, the states represented are: New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland. In the bottom half, from left to right: South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. Above the shield is the seven-pointed 'Commonwealth Star' or 'Star of Federation' above a blue and gold wreath, forming the crest. Six of the points on the star represent the original six states, while the seventh point represents the combined territories and any future states of Australia. In its entirety the shield represents the federation of Australia.The Red Kangaroo and Emu that support the shield are the unofficial animal emblems of the nation. They owe this recognition to the fact that they are native to Australia, and are found only on that continent. As neither animal can walk backwards, they have come to represent progress and an unwillingness to back down. In the background is wreath of Golden Wattle, the official national floral emblem, though the representation of the species is not botanically accurate.Australian National Botanic Gardens. 2003. Armorial bearings to the Commonwealth of Australia At the bottom of the coat of arms is a scroll that contains the name of the nation. Neither the wreath of wattle nor the scroll are technically part of the official design described on the Royal Warrant that grants the armorial design.The official blazon in heraldic terms is: Quarterly of six, the first quarter Argent a Cross Gules charged with a Lion passant guardant between on each limb a Mullet of eight points Or; the second Azure five Mullets, one of eight, two of seven, one of six and one of five points of the first (representing the Constellation of the Southern Cross) ensigned with an Imperial Crown proper; the third of the first a Maltese Cross of the fourth, surmounted by a like Imperial Crown; the fourth of the third, on a Perch wreathed Vert and Gules an Australian Piping Shrike displayed also proper; the fifth also Or a Swan naiant to the sinister Sable; the last of the first, a Lion passant of the second, the whole within a Bordure Ermine; for the Crest on a Wreath Or and Azure A Seven-pointed Star Or, and for Supporters dexter a Kangaroo, sinister an Emu, both proper.It's an Honour&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;HistoryFollowing the federation of Australia, the first official coat of arms of Australia was granted by King Edward VII on 7 May 1908.The Armorial Ensigns of the Commonwealth of Australia 1980. Commonwealth of Australia ISBN 0-642-04793-6 The original design is thought to have been inspired by the 1805 Bowman Flag, which showed a coat of arms of the rose, shamrock and thistle supported by a kangaroo and emu.Letter from William Gullick to Atlee Hunt, 10 July 1908 It consisted of a shield in the centre, the seven pointed star on a wreath as the crest above it, and a Kangaroo and an Emu supporting the shield, all on a bed of green grass with a scroll containing the motto "Advance Australia". The selection of the kangaroo, the Emu and the words, "Advance Australia" was tied together symbolically as both the kangaroo and the emu are unable to walk backwards... they could only "Advance". The shield had a white background, with a red cross of Saint George, blue lines outside the cross, and a blue border containing six inescutcheons featuring a red chevron on white, representing the six states. The Scottish Patriotic Association was vocally opposed to the shields designing, noting that it should display the Union Flag to represent British and Irish settlers. These arms were used by the government and appeared on the sixpence coin from 1910 until 1963, and the threepence, shilling and florin from 1910 to 1936.The 1908 arms were redesigned in 1911, and officially granted by George V on 19 September 1912. The redesign of the coat of arms spurred much debate in the Parliament, William Kelly said "The emu and kangaroo are so built that they hardly fit into the heraldic atmosphere, and I think we make ourselves ridiculous when we endeavour to carry on the traditions of the Old World with some of the wild creations of our Australian fauna."Hansard, House of Representatives, 31 October 1912Despite objections, the kangaroo and emu remained the shield bearers in the new coat of arms and were modified to appear more realistic. The principal reason for the redesign was to address concerns that Australia's states were not individually represented; this was achieved by showing each state's badge on the shield. The 1912 coat of arms removed the bed of grass that was beneath the shield and changed the scroll to read simply "Australia". The colours in the wreath were also changed from blue and white to blue and gold. A background of two sprays of Golden Wattle was added, however it does not form a part of the armorial bearings.-Symbols of Australia’s six states appear on the shield:New South WalesVictoriaQueenslandSouth AustraliaWestern AustraliaTasmaniathe Cross of St George with lion and starsthe Southern Crossa blue Maltese Cross and Crownthe Australian piping shrikea black swana red walking lionUseThe coat of arms is used to identify Australian government authority and property, accordingly the coat of arms should never be used where it could wrongly imply a formal guarantee, sponsorship or endorsement by the Commonwealth.It's an Honour - Page not found - Error 404&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Use of the arms by private citizens or organisations is rarely permitted, however there are provisions for use by sporting bodies and in educational publications.

A more stylised version is used as a badge of rank for Warrant Officer of the Navy, Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army and Warrant Officer of the Air Force.ReferencesExternal linksOfficial website with more informationNational Archives of Australia.
