 Argolis ( Argolída, ;  Argolís in ancient Greek and Katharevousa) is one of the fifty-one prefectures of Greece. It is located in the eastern part of the Peloponnese. Most arable land lies in the central part. Its primary agricultural resources are oranges and olives, and beaches are found in the south and east; mountains and hills dominate the west, northeast and east.It is bounded by Arcadia to the west and southwest, Corinthia to the north, the Saronic Gulf, the Attica prefecture and the Troezen area to the east and southeast over water, and the Argolic Gulf to the south. (The Argolid of ancient times included Troezen.)Its mountain ranges include Lyrkeia and Trachy in the northwest.HistoryParts of the history of the area can be found in Argos, Nafplio, Troezen(now part of Piraeus prefecture), Hermione, Kranidi, Tolo.From 1833 to 1899, the prefecture was part Argolidocorinthia, which included Hydra, Spetses and Kythira. It joined Corinthia to form Argolidocorinthia again in 1909. Forty years later, in 1949, the prefecture was finally separated from Corinthia. See also Argolidocorinthia.In early 1998, a flash flood carrying muddy water swept through the valley near Argos and devastated citrus crops and other area agriculture, including olives and other crops, and grazing areas. Damages were several million drachmas, then still the currency of Greece.TransportThe area is connected by highways:E65 (northwest)Greek National Road 7Greek National Road 70 (east)CommunicationsNewspapersArgeiakon Bima - ArgosTa Nea tis Argolidos - NafplioRadioArgaiki Radiofonia - ArgosArgos Radio Deejay - Argos - 96.2 FMCool FM - Argos, Kefalari - 90.7 FMDimotiko Radiofoniou Nafpliou - NafplioRadio Argolida - Nafplio - 90.2 FMRadio Ermionida - ErmioniRadio Kranidi - KranidiStyle 89.6 - Argos - 89.6 FMTelevisionMax TVGeography and administrationProvincesviewed from Nafplion.|]]Argos Province - ArgosErmioni Province - KranidiNafplio Province - NafplioMunicipalities and communitiesMunicipalityMunicipal codeSeat (if different)Postal codeArgos0402212 00Asini0403Drepano210 60Asklipieio0404Lygourio210 52Epidaurus0406Archaía Epídavros210 54Ermioni0407210 51Koutsopodi0408210 00Kranidi0409213 00Lerna0410Myloi]]212 00Lyrkeia0411210 58Midea]]0412Agia Triada]]210 55Mykines]]0413212 00Nafplion0414211 00Nea Kios0415210 53Nea Tiryntha0416Tíryns211 00CommunityYPES codeSeatPostal code Achladokampos0405210 57Alea]]0401Skoteiní205 00See alsoList of settlements in the Argolis prefectureList of traditional Greek place namesCategory:Prefectures of Greece Category:Argolisbr:Argolis ca:Argòlida de:Argolis el:Νομός Αργολίδας eo:Argolando es:Argólida fr:Argolide it:Argolide he:ארגוליס la:Argolis (nomus Graeciae) nl:Argolis nn:Argolis pl:Argolida pt:Argólida ro:Argolida ru:Арголида simple:Argolis sk:Argolis fi:Argolis sr:Префектура Арголида sv:Argolis tr:Argolis
