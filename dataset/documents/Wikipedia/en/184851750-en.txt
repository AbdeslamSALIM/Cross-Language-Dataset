Gulbis' most consistent shot is his forehand, which has been likened to that of American James Blake's for its rapid pace and relatively flat execution; his forehand is taken with a medium swing and with high levels of wrist action, which attributes to the explosive nature of the shot. His arsenal of forehand shots is nearly complete, and thus can be extremely disruptive and turn a defensive position into an offensive one. His running forehand has a slice action, but consistently lands extremely deep in the court, allowing for adequate recoil time to regain court position. Gulbis also has a particularly excellent array of finesse shots, including the high lob and drop shot, both of which he can strike from any position, including from deep in the court. Gulbis' primary weakness is his backhand, which while remaining adequately deep tends to lack variety, unless a particularly advantageous situation presents itself. Gulbis' foot speed is only moderate, although his return of serve is varied and dangerous, particularly on second serves and, due to his height, kick serves. In his televised matches in 2007 and early 2008 his serve would have been described as moderate, but has recently vastly improved in speed and variety, having served out several games with no returns against the incredible returners David Nalbandian and Rafael Nadal.Despite having prodigious talent for his age, Gulbis can be prone to nervousness when down in a set or match, which can cause tight matches to be more mentally straining on him. Similarly to Marat Safin, Gulbis' playing style is extremely tactical and aggressive, and relies more on making winners than drawing errors, which can sometimes lead to a very high unforced error count.Record against the top playersAs of 2 October, 2008, Gulbis win-loss record against certain players who have been ranked World No. 20 or higher when the match was played is as follows: Mario Ancic 1-1Marcos Baghdatis 0-2James Blake 2-0Guillermo Canas 0-1Nikolay Davydenko 0-2Novak Djokovic 0-2David Ferrer 0-1Carlos Moya 1-1Andy Murray 0-1Rafael Nadal 0-2David Nalbandian 0-1Tommy Robredo 1-0Andy Roddick 0-1Mikhail Youzhny 0-1ATP Tour titlesSingles (0)Doubles (1)No.DateTournamentSurfacePartneringOpponents in the finalScore1.April 14, 2008Houston]], United StatesClayGER Rainer SchüttlerURU Pablo Cuevas & Marcel Granollers Pujol7–5, 7–6(3)Singles performance timelineTo prevent confusion and double counting, information in this table is updated only once a tournament or the player's participation in the tournament has concluded.
