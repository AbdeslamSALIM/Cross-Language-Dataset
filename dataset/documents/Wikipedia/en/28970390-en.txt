He is the eighth president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).BiographyBorn in Ghent, Rogge is an orthopedic surgeon by profession. Rogge was educated at the University of Ghent. He competed in yachting in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics, and played on the Belgian national rugby union team. Rogge served as president of the Belgian Olympic Committee from 1989 to 1992, and as president of the European Olympic Committees from 1989 to 2001. He became a member of the IOC in 1991 and joined the Executive Board in 1998. He was knighted, and later elevated to Count, by King Albert II of Belgium. In his free time, Rogge is known to admire modern art and is an avid reader of historical and scientific literature. "2007 impressions", Het Laatste Nieuws, 31 December 2007Rogge was elected as president of the IOC on July 16, 2001 at the 112th IOC Session in Moscow as the successor to Juan Antonio Samaranch, who had led the IOC since 1980.Under his leadership, the IOC aims to create more possibilities for developing countries to bid for and host the Olympic Games. Rogge believes that this vision can be achieved in the not too distant future through government backing and new IOC policies that constrain the size, complexity and cost of hosting the Olympic Games.At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Rogge became the first IOC President to stay in the Olympic village, to enjoy closer contact with the athletes.Under his term, Rogge has been active in ensuring that baseball and softball be removed from the Olympic Programme. The decision was approved at the IOC Session in July 2005 in Singapore and will be in force for the London 2012 Summer Olympics. However, Rogge stated at the time of the decision that both sports would be eligible to win back their place in future Olympic Games.In February 2008, Rogge responded to questions by journalists regarding U.S. director Steven Spielberg's withdrawal from the position of artistic advisor for the Beijing Olympics due to Spielberg's position on Chinese involvement in the Darfur crisis. "Spielberg's absence will not harm the quality of the Games. The Beijing Games are much stronger than individuals." He declared that the IOC is "a sporting, not a political, association.", and that "one should not call on the IOC to solve the world's problems."China Daily-Xinhua.

Accessed 2008-04-07. http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/06/beijing.ioc.ap/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Rogge said, on April 10 2008, he was nonetheless "saddened" by the protests in San Francisco. "The Games are about generosity," Rogge said. "We have 120 days to achieve this."CNN "Olympic chief 'saddened' by protests". 2008-04-06. Accessed 2008-04-10. http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/04/09/olympics.torch/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;In mid-July 2008, Rogge announced that, "for the first time, foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in China. There will be no censorship on the Internet." However, by July 30, 2008 it was announced by IOC spokesman Kevan Gosper that the Internet would indeed be censored for journalists in Beijing for the 2008 Summer Olympics.http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/asiapacific/080730-IOC-Web_Censorship&lt;/ref&gt; Gosper, who said he had not heard about this, suggested that high IOC officials (probably including the Dutch Hein Verbruggen and IOC French director-general Gilbert Felli, and most likely with Rogge's knowledge) had made a secret deal with Chinese officials to allow the censorship, without the knowledge of either the press or most members of the IOC.http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gKf6TZUVV5O0svemHyOqBT1MvnxQD928TKH8B http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24110428-2702,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rogge later denied that any such meeting had taken place, but did not insist that China adhere to its prior assurances that the Internet would not be censored.Rogge has been criticized for rebuking Usain Bolt's jubilation after winning multiple track and field events during the 2008 Beijing Olympics in China.[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/olympics/wires/08/23/2080.ap.as.oly.diack.rogge.comments/ Sports Illustrated, 2008] Yahoo Sports columnist, Dan Wenzel, who covered the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing sharply criticized Rogge by describing him as "...a classic stiff-collared bureaucrat." Wenzel further contended that Rogge's "organization has made billions off athletes such as Bolt for years, yet he has to find someone to pick on."[http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news;_ylt=AmqY.ZiDfv9TOx6kMMTfER.VTZd4?slug=dw-olympicswinnerslosers082408&amp;prov=yhoo&amp;type=lgns "Beijing Olympics’ winners and losers", Yahoo Sports!, 24 August, 2008] He is also criticized by the Greek society for reportedly stating that "Greece won the gold medal in doping", referring to the disqualification of several Greek athletes due to doping.His son Philippe is the current delegation leader of the Belgian Olympic Committee.Notes     Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:International Olympic Committee members Category:Belgian rugby union footballers Category:Belgian yacht racers Category:Olympic sailors of Belgium Category:Sailors at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Sailors at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Sailors at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:People from Ghent Category:Belgian surgeons Category:Ghent University alumni Category:Counts of Belgiumaf:Jacques Rogge als:Jacques Rogge bg:Жак Рох cs:Jacques Rogge da:Jacques Rogge de:Jacques Rogge et:Jacques Rogge el:Ζακ Ρογκ es:Jacques Rogge eo:Jacques Rogge fr:Jacques Rogge hr:Jacques Rogge id:Jacques Rogge it:Jacques Rogge mk:Жак Рог ms:Jacques Rogge nl:Jacques Rogge ja:ジャック・ロゲ no:Jacques Rogge pl:Jacques Rogge pt:Jacques Rogge ru:Рогге, Жак sk:Jacques Rogge sr:Жак Рог fi:Jacques Rogge sv:Jacques Rogge tl:Jacques Rogge tr:Jacques Rogge zh:雅克·罗格
