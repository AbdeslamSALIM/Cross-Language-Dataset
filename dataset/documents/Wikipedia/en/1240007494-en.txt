Until the 2002/2003 season Sparta Rotterdam had always played at the highest level, but they were relegated from the top-level Eredivisie in 2002. Sparta returned to the Eredivisie for the 2005-06 season. The average attendance in 2005/06 was 9,950.Sparta has won six national titles (1909, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1915 and 1959) and three national cups (1958, 1962 and 1966). Sparta is one of three professional football clubs from Rotterdam, the others being Excelsior (est. 1902) and Feyenoord (est. 1908), the latter playing in the Eredivisie.HistorySparta was first founded in 1887. This club was disbanded shortly afterwards. On April 1, 1888, several ex-members of the old Sparta founded a cricket club called Sparta. In July 1888, a football branch of the club was established. In 1890 Sparta played its first real football match, and in 1892 Sparta disbanded the cricket branch. Sparta was promoted to the highest league of Dutch football on April 23, 1893. In 1897, Sparta withdrew from the competition after continuous dubious arbitration of Sparta matches. However, the club continued to exist, and in 1899, the board of Sparta visited a match of Sunderland A.F.C. Impressed with the red-white jersey of the English club, the board decided that Sunderland's colours (red-white striped jersey, black shorts) would henceforth be the colours of Sparta.In 1905, Sparta initiated and organised the first home match of the Dutch national team, against Belgium. The match, won 4-0 by the Netherlands, was a rematch of a game two weeks prior, when the Netherlands beat Belgium 4-1 in Antwerp.The first match at Sparta's new stadium, Het Kasteel (The Castle), in the Spangen area of west Rotterdam, was played on October 14 1916. The stadium was renovated in 1999 and is still Sparta's stadium.Sparta in EuropeQ = Qualifying Round1R = First Round2R = Second Round3R = Third Round1/4 = Quarter FinalSeasonCompetitionRoundClubScore1959-60]]European Cup]]1RSWE IFK Göteborg3-1, 1-3, 3-11/4SCO Rangers FC2-3, 1-0, 2-31962-63]]UEFA Cup Winners' CupQSwitzerland Lausanne Sports0-3, 4-21966-67]]UEFA Cup Winners' Cup1RMalta Floriana FC1-1, 6-02RSwitzerland Servette Genève0-2, 1-01970-71]]Inter-Cities Fairs Cup1RIceland ÍA Akranes6-0, 9-02RNIR Coleraine FC2-0, 2-13RGermany Bayern München1-2, 1-31971-72]]UEFA Cup Winners' Cup1RBulgaria Levski-Spartak1-1, 2-02RYugoslavia Red Star Belgrade1-1, 1-21983-84]]UEFA Cup1RNIR Coleraine FC4-0, 1-12REast Germany Carl Zeiss Jena3-2, 1-13RUSSR Spartak Moskva1-1, 0-21985-86]]UEFA Cup1RGER Hamburger SV2-0, 0-2 (4-3 n.p.)2RGER Borussia Mönchengladbach1-1, 1-5Current squad                           Out on loan  Notable players''See also Sparta Rotterdam players  NetherlandsDick AdvocaatRob AlflenLuuk BalkesteinRon van den BergRicky van den BerghJan van BeverenDanny BlindWinston BogardeTinus BosselaarHenk BosveldJobby CrossanSilvio DilibertoPim DoesburgTonny van EdeJuul EllermanRené EijerHans EijkenbroekHenk FräserMitchell van der GaagLouis van GaalRuud GeelsRené van der GijpWim van der GijpEd de GoeyGlenn HelderWout HolverdaNico JalinkAndro KnelDanny KoevermansBok de KorverTheo LaseromsTonnie van LeeuwenRonald LengkeekWim MeutstegeDennis de NooijerGérard de NooijerEdwin Olde RiekerinkJan Olde RiekerinkMike SnoeiHenk van SteeWim SuurbierAdri van TiggelenMichel ValkeHans VennekerPim VerbeekRobert VerbeekEdwin VurensMenno WillemsJohn de Wolf AustriaWilly Kreuz BelgiumDavy De FauwSepp De RooverTom Van Mol DenmarkOle Madsen GhanaPrince Polley MoroccoNourdin Boukhari PolandJanusz Kowalik United StatesGregg BerhalterFormer managers Gert AandewielJimmy AdamsonRob BaanCor BromHenk ten CateWiel CoerverChris DekkerJan EverseWillem van HanegemBert JacobsGeorge KesslerFritz KorbachFrank RijkaardDolf RoksElek SchwartzHenk van SteeMike SnoeiAdri van TiggelenPiet de VisserTheo VonkExternal linksOfficial website Sparta Rotterdam at Football-lineups.comStatisticsitwmdespartasupporter  Category:Dutch football clubs Category:Sparta Rotterdam Category:Sport in Rotterdam Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1888bg:Спарта Ротердам ca:Sparta Rotterdam de:Sparta Rotterdam es:Sparta Rotterdam fr:Sparta Rotterdam it:Sparta Rotterdam lt:Sparta Rotterdam nl:Sparta Rotterdam ja:スパルタ・ロッテルダム no:Sparta Rotterdam pl:Sparta Rotterdam pt:Sparta Roterdã ru:Спарта (футбольный клуб, Роттердам) fi:Sparta Rotterdam sv:Sparta Rotterdam tr:Sparta Rotterdam zh:鹿特丹斯巴達
