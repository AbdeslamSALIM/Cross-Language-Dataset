Igarka () is an town in Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia, located 163&nbsp;km north of the Arctic Circle. It is also a port on the Yenisey River, situated 673&nbsp;km away from the river's mouth. Population: 8,627 (2002 Census); 18,820 (1989 Census); 16,000 (1970). It is served by Igarka Airport whose location across the river makes access difficult when the water is part thawed: in winter one can drive across, in summer there's a boat connection but in between things get difficult.Igarka was founded in 1929 as a sawmill and timber-exporting port. It gained a town status in 1931. From 1949 to 1953 the Salekhard-Igarka Railway project made an unsuccessful attempt to connect Igarka to the Russian railway network at Salekhard, claiming the lives of thousands of Gulag prisoners.The town's main attraction is a curious permafrost museumИгарский краеведческий комплекс &quot;Музей вечной мерзлоты&quot;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; which has won some pan-European prizeswww.europeanmuseumforum.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.ReferencesCategory:Cities and towns in Krasnoyarsk Krai Category:Cities and towns built in the Soviet Union Category:Settlements established in 1929ar:إيغاركا be:Горад Ігарка de:Igarka es:Igarka et:Igarka eo:Igarka fr:Igarka os:Игаркæ it:Igarka nl:Igarka no:Igarka pl:Igarka ru:Игарка tg:Игарка zh:伊加爾卡
