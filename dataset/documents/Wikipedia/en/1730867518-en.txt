A sand lance or sandlance is a fish belonging to the family Ammodytidae. Several species of sand lance are commonly known as "sand eels" or "sandeels", though they are not related to true eels. Another variant name is launce, and all names of the fish are references to its slender body and pointed snout. The family name (and genus name, Ammodytes) means "sand burrower", which describes the sand lance's habit of burrowing into sand to avoid tidal currents.Sand lances are most commonly encountered by fishermen in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, but are found in oceans throughout the world. These fish do not have pelvic fins and do not develop a swim bladder, staying true to their bottom-dwelling habit as adults. Both adult and larval sea lances primarily feed on copepods. Larval forms of this fish are perhaps the most abundant of all fish larvae in areas such as the northwest Atlantic, serving as a major food item for cod, salmon, and other commercially important species. As adults, sand lances are harvested commercially in some areas (primarily in Europe), leading to direct human competition with diving birds such as puffins, auks, and cormorants. Some species are inshore coastal dwellers, and digging for sand lances to use as a bait fish has been a popular pastime in coastal areas of Europe and North America. Other species are deep-water dwellers, some of which have only recently been described to science, and most of which lack common names. Sand lances have chameleon-like independent eye movements.SpeciesThere are twenty-three species in seven genera:Genus AmmodytesAmerican sand lance, Ammodytes americanus DeKay, 1842.Northern sand lance, Ammodytes dubius Reinhardt, 1837.Pacific sand lance, Ammodytes hexapterus Pallas, 1814.Small sand-eel, Ammodytes marinus Raitt, 1934.Pacific sandeel, Ammodytes personatus Girard, 1856.Lesser sand eel, Ammodytes tobianus Linnaeus, 1758.Genus AmmodytoidesGill's sand lance, Ammodytoides gilli (Bean, 1895).Ammodytoides kimurai Ida & Randall, 1993.Pitcairn Sandlance, Ammodytoides leptus Collette & Randall, 2000.Ammodytoides pylei Randall, Ida & Earle, 1994.Scaly sandlance, Ammodytoides renniei (Smith, 1957).Ammodytoides vagus (McCulloch & Waite, 1916).Genus BleekeriaBleekeria kallolepis Günther, 1862.Bleekeria mitsukurii Jordan & Evermann, 1902.Bleekeria viridianguilla (Fowler, 1931).Genus GymnammodytesCape sandlance, Gymnammodytes capensis (Barnard, 1927).Mediterranean sand eel, Gymnammodytes cicerellus (Rafinesque, 1810).Smooth sandeel, Gymnammodytes semisquamatus (Jourdain, 1879).Genus HyperoplusGreat sand eel, Hyperoplus immaculatus (Corbin, 1950).Greater sand eel, Hyperoplus lanceolatus (Le Sauvage, 1824).Genus LepidammodytesLepidammodytes macrophthalmus Ida, Sirimontaporn & Monkolprasit, 1994.Genus ProtammodytesProtammodytes brachistos Ida, Sirimontaporn & Monkolprasit, 1994.Protammodytes sarisa (Robins & Böhlke, 1970).See alsoThe sand lance has lent its name to two submarines of the United States Navy:[[USS Sand Lance (SS-381)|USS Sand Lance (SS-381)]], a ''Balao''-class submarine.[[USS Sand Lance (SSN-660)|USS Sand Lance (SSN-660)]], a ''Sturgeon''-class nuclear submarine.Referencesbiologists.org on independent eye movementsExternal linksSand Lance profile at Fisheries and Oceans CanadaCategory:Ammodytidaede:Sandaale es:Ammodytidae fr:Ammodytidae ka:მექვიშიასებრნი lt:Tobinės nl:Zandspieringen pl:Dobijakowate pt:Ammodytidae sv:Tobisfiskar
