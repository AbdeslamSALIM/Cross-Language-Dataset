Jesolo (or Iesolo) is a town and comune in the province of Venice, Italy.GeographyThe town lies north of Venice, between Eraclea and Cavallino-Treporti. Jesolo gives its name to a lagoon (22&nbsp;km²) on the Adriatic Sea, between the rivers Sile and Piave.HistoryIn Roman times the lagoon extended over the area now occupied by the town. There were several islands in the lagoon, the biggest of which was known as Equilium, the place of horses. It is thought that Jesolo represents a corruption of this name.EconomyThe city's economy is mostly based on tourism, because of its 15&nbsp;km-long beach (Lido di Jesolo).SportFootball teams:A.C.
