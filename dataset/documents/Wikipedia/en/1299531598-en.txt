 The Carabinieri, '' (Italian for Carabiniers) are the national-level gendarmerie of Italy who also perform military police duties. They police both the military and civilian populations. Their Italian name has become the common name for this force in English. The full official title of the force is ''Arma dei Carabinieri (literally Arm of Carabinieri); it was formerly called the Corpo dei Carabinieri when it was a branch of the Italian Army.Historically, a ''Carabiniere'' was a cavalryman or soldier armed with a carbine. Their motto is Nei Secoli Fedele ("Faithful throughout the Centuries" but usually translated as "Always Faithful"). Their mission was to control crime and to serve the community through respect for the law.History(The Wars for Italian Unification).]] The corps was created by King Victor Emmanuel I of Savoy, with the aim of providing Piedmont with a police corps similar to the French Gendarmerie. Previously, police duties were managed by the Dragoni di Sardegna corps, created in 1726 and composed of volunteers.After French soldiers had occupied Turin at the end of the 18th century and later abandoned it to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Savoy, the corps of Carabinieri Reali (Royal Carabinieri) was instituted under the Regie Patenti (Royal Patents) of July 13, 1814.Both a military and a police corps, the Carabinieri have fought in every conflict in which Italy has been involved, suffering heavy losses and being awarded many decorations for gallantry.The Carabinieri are particularly proud of the memory of Brigadier Salvo D'Acquisto, who was executed by the Nazis in Palidoro, near Rome, in World War II, having exchanged his life for the lives of innocent citizens due to be executed in retaliation for the killing of a German soldier. Brigadier D'Acquisto falsely claimed responsibility and was shot for the offence.The history of the Carabinieri recounts many such actions and the corps is nicknamed La Benemerita (the Meritorious).The Carabinieri is a branch of armed forces (alongside the Army, Navy and Air Force), thus ending their long standing role as the first corps (Arma) of the Army (Esercito). It is likely that the antonomasia for the Carabinieri will continue to be the Arma.In recent years Carabinieri units have been dispatched on peacekeeping missions, including Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq. In 2003 twelve Carabinieri were killed in a suicide bomb attack on their base in Nasiriyah, near Basra, in southern Iraq, in the largest Italian military loss of life in a single action since the Second World War (see 2003 Nasiriyah bombing).At the Sea Island Conference of the G8 in 2004, the Carabinieri were given the mandate to establish a Center of Excellence for Stability Police Units (CoESPU) to spearhead the development of training and doctrinal standards for civilian police units attached to international peacekeeping missionsFormed Police Units Workshop and Seminar, http://www.carlisle.army.mil/pksoi/Docs/policeunits.pdf Issue Paper No. 2006-04, US Army Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute, January 2007..Personnel]] Chain of commandThe corps is headed by the , consisting of the Comandante Generale (a General), the  (a Lieutenant General) and the Headquarters Staff, all located in Rome.

Racconti del Maresciallo, La Tenda Nera, Il Maresciallo Rocca and Carabinieri are some of the titles that have been produced, mainly by the RAI fiction division.In January 2005, the private television network Canale 5 introduced a Carabinieri-related drama series called R.I.S. based on the Ra.C.I.S. (Raggruppamento Carabinieri Investigazioni Scientifiche; Carabinieri Scientific Investigation Group) and modelled on the American CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.The Carabinieri are the military police in Ernest Hemmingway's A Farewell to Arms who are arresting higher ranking officers, giving them summary trials, and shooting them for desertion.The Carabinieri appear in Ron Howard's 2009 film adaptation of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, the prequel to The Da Vinci Code (film).Criticism]]Although the Carabinieri have a very positive reputation among the Italian people , it is to be remembered that, in different historical periods, they may have been involved in some atrocities.The Carabinieri served alongside the Italian Army during the Invasion of Ethiopia and In Addis Ababa, (captured in May, 1936) a bomb was thrown towards a table around which General Graziani and number of officers were seated. No one was killed but an unidentified officer fired his weapon into a group of Ethiopian civilians seated at a table nearby. Allegedly, a Carabinieri then followed suit and subsequently 300 Ethiopians were killed while their bodies were then allegedly stripped of all valuables and money. Fires burned well into the next day. Over the next three days at least three thousand Ethiopians were killed by rampaging Italian soldiers. Individual Carabinieri served in the Italian Africa Police in occupied Ethiopia , in the late 1930s and early 1940s,Ethiopian Atrocities: http://members.iinet.net.au/~gduncan/massacres_axis.html#Italyhttp://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/iwpList96/DEB07F09BE30F4B8C1256DB000479398http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Italo-Abyssinian_Warhttp://www.bestofsicily.com/fascism.htm During the fascist regime of Benito Mussolini, the corps of Carabinieri cooperated with the regime by order of the King of Italy. http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Multilingua/EN/MilitaryOperations/http://www.militariamuseum.com/collection/Ital_1933_Carb/ItalianCarabinieriGeneral.htm  However, when King Victor Emmanuel III ordered the arrest of Mussolini on 25 July 1943, the Carabinieri were entrusted with this task. When Mussolini was freed by the Germans in September 1943 (following Italy's armistice with the Allies) and became the head of the Italian Social Republic in October 1943, he decided to replace the Carabinieri with a new force, the (Republican National Guard (GNR). The GNR included former MVSN militiamen, Police officers, Carabinieri, and former members of the Italian Africa Police (the PAI). Shortly after its formation many of the Carabinieri were expelled due to their having been Carabinieri, this decision was probably due to the fact that the Carabinieri were traditionally considered as more loyal to the constitutional monarchy than to the fascist regime, and therefore they were not fully reliable after the King had switched over to the Allies' side.Some senior Carabinieri were implicated in the controversies surrounding Operation Gladio, including the violent "strategy of tension" and an embryonic plan for a coup d'etat (in December 1970, an alleged coup attempt, dubbed the Golpe Borghese, failed). These allegations remain unproven.The Carabinieri were criticised for their handling of the policing of the 2001 G8 Summit in Genoa and the killing of anarchist Carlo Giuliani during the demonstrations against the Group of Eight. A Carabinieri Land Rover Defender had become stuck and protesters wielding metal poles and wooden boards attacked it. In the midst of this clash a man wearing a blue ski mask, picked up a fire extinguisher and, apparently intending to throw it at the carabinieri inside, was shot in the face at point blank range by one of the officers, Mario Placanica. The man in the mask was later identified as Giuliani. The charges against Placanica were subsequently dropped when the presiding judge concluded that the bullet which struck Giuliani was not directly aimed at Giuliani and had "ricocheted off plaster",  and ruled that the carabinieri had acted in self-defense, the case did not go to trial.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3002469.stmWeaponssemi-automatic pistol]] In response to the many and diverse needs of the Carabinieri, the service provides for the use of various types of weapons that are divided into ordinary weapons and special weapons, supplied to all staff is structured as follows:===Ordinary===Pistols: Beretta 92, the standard service arm, and 8000 Cougar for OfficersSubmachine gun: Mod.PM 12 S2Assault rifle: Beretta AR70/90Light machinegun: FN MinimiSpecial weaponsUsed only by certain departments and in certain circumstances:Submachine gun: Heckler &amp; Koch MP5Shotgun: Franchi SPAS-15Sharpshooter: Mauser SP66Sniper rifle: Accuracy International AWPVehicles and equipment]] ]]  Ovetti(egg), vehicle for patrolling urban areas]]  Rigid Inflatable Boat of the GIS]]  3000 – 5000 mobile labs for NBCR(nuclear, bacteriological, chemical &amp; radiological) activity]] Until very recently the Italian Police including the Carabinieri operated only Italian built vehicles but that has changed with the advent of Land Rover Defenders and Subarus into service.
