Upon his return in 2005, Clerc broke into the first team and made 19 appearances in the domestic league and in Europe.He was a member of the France U-21 team that participated in the European Under-21 Football Championship finals in 2006, making two appearances.He received a shock call-up (although he would not feature in the match) to the French national team for their March 2008 friendly against Slovenia. He earned his first cap for France in the 5-0 win against Faroe Islands on 11 October 2006. He then went on to take part in several matches as a substitute for Willy Sagnol, and was a starter in several games after Sagnol injured his knee in 2007. France coach Raymond Domenech seems undecided about who will succeed Sagnol at the right-back position, and he has also started Bacary Sagna and Lassana Diarra.Clerc now battles with Anthony Réveillère for the right-back spot at Lyon, although Clerc has also filled in on occasion as a right sided midfielder/winger in the team's 4-3-3 formation, with limited success.He scored his first Ligue 1 goal for Lyon on December 2 2007 against Strasbourg.He was banned for 4 matches because of an improper transfer agreement to Olympique de Marseille.French Professional Football League ban François Clerc for four matchesReferences  Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:French footballers Category:France under-21 international footballers Category:France international footballers Category:Football (soccer) defenders Category:Toulouse FC players Category:Olympique Lyonnais players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 playersar:فرانسوا كليرك de:François Clerc es:François Clerc fr:François Clerc it:François Clerc nl:François Clerc ja:フランソワ・クレール pl:François Clerc pt:François Clerc ru:Клер, Франсуа sv:François Clerc tr:François Clerc zh:弗朗索瓦·克莱尔
