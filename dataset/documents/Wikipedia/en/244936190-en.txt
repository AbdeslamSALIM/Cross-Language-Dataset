For his fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics that lead to the development of laser and maser, Basov shared the 1964 Nobel Prize in Physics with Aleksandr Prokhorov and Charles Hard Townes.&quot;Basov Nikolay Gennadiyevich&quot;BiographyBasov was born in the town Usman, now in Lipetsk Oblast. He finished school in 1941 in Voronezh, and was later called for the military service at Kuibyshev Military Medical Academy. In 1943 he left academy and served in the Soviet Army participating in the Second World War with the 1st Ukrainian Front.Basov graduated from Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPI) in 1950. He then held a professorship at MEPI and also worked in the Lebedev Physical Institute (LPI), where defended a dissertation for the Candidate of Sciences degree (equivalent to PhD) in 1953 and a dissertation for the Doctor of Sciences degree in 1956. Basov was the Director of the LPI in 1973-1988. He was elected as a corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences (Russian Academy of Sciences since 1991) in 1962 and an Full Member of the Academy in 1966. In 1967 he was elected a Member of the Presidium of the Academy (1967—1990), since 1990 he was the councillor of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences. He was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. He was the head of the laboratory of quantum radiophysics at the LPI until his death in 2001.BooksN. G. Basov, K. A.
