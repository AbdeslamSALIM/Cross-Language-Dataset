Its name is derived from 'Rooms Katholieke Combinatie' (Roman Catholic in Dutch) and was a fusion club of HEC, WVB and Hercules. It was formed on August 26, 1940 and once played its home games at Sportpark Olympia. Its new stadium, the 6200 seater Mandemakers Stadion was opened in 1996 and featured the home match against Roda JC. While considered as one of the Eredivisie's smaller clubs, it nevertheless maintained its top flight status for many years. Its home colors are yellow and blue. The average attendance in 2004/05 was 5,800 people. At the end of the season 2006/07, RKC Waalwijk were relegated from the Eredivisie after a defeat in play-offs against VVV-Venlo.Current squad                           Out on loan  Notable former players Khalid Boulahrouz Giovanni van Bronckhorst Harry Decheiver Rick Hoogendorp John Lammers Željko Petrović Cees Schapendonk Ferdi Elmas Clyde Wijnhard Dylan HughesFormer managers Peter Boeve Bert Jacobs Martin Jol Erwin Koeman Adrie Koster Hans VerèlSee alsoDutch football league teamsExternal linksOfficial website   Category:Dutch football clubs Category:RKC Waalwijk Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1940ca:RKC Waalwijk de:RKC Waalwijk es:RKC Waalwijk fr:RKC Waalwijk it:RKC Waalwijk lt:RKC Waalwijk nl:RKC Waalwijk ja:RKCヴァールヴァイク no:RKC Waalwijk pl:RKC Waalwijk pt:RKC Waalwijk fi:RKC Waalwijk sv:RKC Waalwijk zh:華域克
