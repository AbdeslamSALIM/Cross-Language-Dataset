The album's sound differed from Dummy, the main differences being that much of the music was composed and recorded by the band, then pressed to vinyl. This created a grainy, harsher sound. Three singles, "All Mine", "Over" and "Only You" were released, the first one achieving a Top 10 placing in the UK.''Roseland NYC Live'' (1998)In 1997, the band performed a one-off show with strings by the New York Philharmonic orchestra at Roseland Ballroom in New York.

There was also a long-form VHS video of the performance, and a DVD followed in 2002, with substantial extra material including many early videos.Hiatus (1999–2005)For the next few years, the band members concentrated on solo and other pursuits.
