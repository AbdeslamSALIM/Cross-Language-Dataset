Albert Claude (August 24 1899 &ndash; May 22 1983) was a Belgian biologist who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974. He studied medicine at the University of Liege (Belgium). During the winter of 1928-29 he worked in Berlin, first at the Institut für Krebsforschung, and then at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Dahlem. In the summer of 1929 he joined the Rockefeller Institute. While working at Rockefeller University in the 1930s and 1940s, he used the electron microscope to make images of cells which deepened the scientific understanding of cellular structure and function. He also developed a method for differential centrifugation, which separates cellular components based on their density.In 1930, Claude discovered the process of cell fractionation, which was groundbreaking in his time. The process consists of grinding up cells to break the membrane and release the cell's contents. Claude then filtered out the cell membranes and placed the remaining cell contents in a centrifuge to separate them according to mass. He divided the centrifuged contents into fractions, each of a specific mass, and discovered that particular fractions were responsible for particular cell functions.In 1949, he became Director of the Institut Jules Bordet, Centre des Tumeurs de l'Université Libre de Bruxelles of the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) in Brussels where he would stay until 1970.In 1970, together with George Palade and Keith Porter he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. For his discoveries concerning the structural and functional organization of cells, Claude received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with his student George Palade and Christian de Duve.ReferencesExternal linksNobel Prize BiographyThe Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize Category:1899 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Belgian Americans Category:Belgian biologists Category:Belgian scientists Category:Belgian academics Category:Belgian Nobel laureates Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:University of Liège alumnica:Albert Claude cs:Albert Claude de:Albert Claude es:Albert Claude fr:Albert Claude hr:Albert Claude id:Albert Claude it:Albert Claude sw:Albert Claude lt:Albert Claude nl:Albert Claude ja:アルベルト・クラウデ no:Albert Claude oc:Albert Claude pl:Albert Claude pt:Albert Claude ro:Albert Claude ru:Клод, Альбер sk:Albert Claude sv:Albert Claude tr:Albert Claude zh:阿爾伯特·克勞德
