's sitting statue, Watching Mondoñedo's Cathedral.]]Mondoñedo () is a small town and municipality in A Mariña county in the Galician province of Lugo. As of 2002, the town has a population of 4,987. Mondoñedo occupies a sheltered valley among the northern outliers of the Cantabrian Mountains.The town was declared a national cultural-historical site in 1985. Its main attraction is the three-nave cathedral, begun in Romanesque style around 1230. It reflects an unusual mixture of styles: Gothic in the naves, and Baroque in the its 18th century towers. The polychrome statue in the high altar, called Nuestra Señora la Inglesa (the English Madonna) was rescued from the St. Paul Cathedral in London during the Protestant Reformation of Henry VIII of England.According to local tradition, the bishopric of Dumium, near Braga, was transferred to San Martinho de Mondonhedo, 10 miles from Mondonhedo, in the 8th century; it was brought to Mondoñedo itself in the beginning of the 12th century. After having been for nearly a century and a half in the hands of the Moors, Mondonhedo was recaptured by Ordoño I of Asturias in 858; and the Christian possession was made permanent by Alfonso III of León in 870. It was taken by surprise by the French in 1809 during the Napoleonic Wars. The Galician Province of Mondoñedo disappeared in 1833 when all the seven provinces of Galicia were reduced to four, and the entire Province of Mondoñedo was first divided into two halves and later absorbed and assimilated into the existing provinces of Lugo and A Coruña.Originally the Mondonhedo province was linked to the arrival in this part of Galicia of Celts-Briton immigrants during the Dark Ages period (c.V-VI) fleeing by sea from the British Isles facing the Anglo-Saxon domination as it also happened in Brittany.(see Bishop Maeloc, Britonia)The Caves of King &quot;Cintolo&quot; ("Covas do Rei Cintolo") are also located in the outskirts of the city of Mondoñedo.Sister citiesThese are the official sister cities of Mondoñedo: Ferrol, Spain (2004)See alsoMailoc or Maeloc was the bishop of Britonia (Britoniensis ecclesiae episcopus)Province of Mondoñedo One of the seven Galician provinces from the 15th Century until 1833.Ferrol City and Naval Station in Northwestern Spain.Diocese of Ferrol-Mondoñedo List of districts and parishes from Ferrol to MondoñedoExternal links Official Web-site of the Diocese of Ferrol-Mondoñedo History of Mondoñedo The best Mondoñedo's Website Mondoñedo's Website Mondoñedo's Website The Mindoniensis-Ferrolensis Province in the 21st Century (Alternatives: The Britonia Province)References Category:Municipalities in Lugoca:Mondoñedo de:Mondoñedo es:Mondoñedo eu:Mondoñedo fr:Mondoñedo gl:Mondoñedo it:Mondoñedo nl:Mondoñedo pl:Mondoñedo pt:Mondonhedo ru:Мондоньедо tr:Mondoñedo
