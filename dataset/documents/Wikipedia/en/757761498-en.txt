He had a sister, Erna Mankiewicz (1901-1979), and a brother, Herman J. Mankiewicz, a screenwriter.Mankiewicz moved with his family to New York City where he graduated in 1924 from Stuyvesant High School. In 1928, he obtained a bachelor's degree from Columbia University. For a time he worked in Berlin, Germany, as a foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune newspaper before being lured into the motion picture business.During his long career in Hollywood, Mankiewicz wrote forty-eight screenplays, including All About Eve, for which he won an Academy Award. He also produced more than twenty films including The Philadelphia Story which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1941. However, he is best known for the films he directed, twice winning the Academy Award for Directing. In 1944, he produced The Keys of the Kingdom, which starred his wife, Rose Stradner, and Gregory Peck.In 1958, Mankiewicz directed The Quiet American an adaptation of Graham Greene's 1955 novel about the seed of American military involvement in what would become the Vietnam War. Mankiewicz, under career pressure from the climate of anti-Communism and the Hollywood blacklist, distorted the message of Greene's book, changing major parts of the story to appeal to a national audience. A cautionary tale about America's blind support for "anti-Communists" was turned into, according to Greene, a "propaganda film for America."He was the younger brother of Herman J. Mankiewicz. His sons are writer/director Tom Mankiewicz and producer Christopher Mankiewicz. He also has a daughter named Alexandra Mankiewicz. His great-nephew is radio & television personality Ben Mankiewicz, currently on TCM.DeathMankiewicz, who died in 1993, was interred in Saint Matthew's Episcopal Churchyard cemetery, Bedford, New York.Director and ScreenwriterComfortable in a variety of genres and able to elicit career performances from actors and actresses alike, Joseph L. Mankiewicz combined ironic, sophisticated scripts with a precise, sometimes stylised mise en scène. Mankiewicz worked for seventeen years as a screenwriter for Paramount and as a producer for MGM before getting a chance to direct at Twentieth Century-Fox. Over six years he made 11 films for Fox, reaching a peak in 1949 and 1950 when he won consecutive Academy Awards for Screenplay and Direction for A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve.In 1951, Mankiewicz left Fox and moved to New York, intending to write for the Broadway stage. Although this dream never materialised, he continued to make films (both for his own production company Figaro and as a director-for-hire) that explored his favourite themes - the clash of aristocrat with commoner, life as performance and the clash between people's urge to control their fate and the contingencies of real life.Cleopatra consumed three years of Mankiewicz's life and ended up both derailing his career and causing severe financial losses for the studio, Twentieth Century-Fox. Mankiewicz made more films, however, garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Direction in 1972 for Sleuth, his final production.== Filmography ==DirectorYearFilmOscar nominationsOscar wins1946DragonwyckBackfire]]''Somewhere in the Night1947The Late George Apley]]''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir11948]]Escape]]''1949A Letter to Three Wives32House of Strangers1950No Way Out]]''1All About Eve1461951]]People Will Talk1952]]5 Fingers21953]]Julius Caesar]]''511954]]The Barefoot Contessa211955]]Guys and Dolls]]''41958]]The Quiet American]]''1959]]Suddenly, Last Summer]]''31963]]Cleopatra]]''941964]]Carol for Another Christmas1967]]The Honey Pot1970King: a Filmed Record...Montgomery To Memphis1There Was a Crooked Man...1972]]Sleuth]]''4ScreenplaysFast Company (1929) co-writerSlightly Scarlet (1930) co-writerParamount on Parade (1930)The Social Lion (1931) AdaptationOnly Saps Work (1931) co-writerThe Gang Buster (1931)Finn & Hattie (1931)June Moon (1931) co-writerSkippy (1931) co-writerNewly Rich (1931) co-writerSooky (1931) co-writerThis Reckless Age (1932) co-writerSky Bride (1932) co-writerMillion Dollar Legs (1932) StoryIf I Had A Million (1932) (segments "China Shop", "Three Marines", "Violet") UncreditedDiplomaniacs (1933) co-writerEmergency Call (1933) co-writerToo Much Harmony (1933) StoryAlice In Wonderland (1933) co-writerManhattan Melodrama (1934) co-writerOur Daily Bread (1934) DialogueForsaking All Others (1934)I Live My Life (1935)The Keys of the Kingdom (1944) co-writerDragonwyck (1946)Somewhere in the Night (1946) co-writerA Letter to Three Wives (1949)House of Strangers (1949) UncreditedNo Way Out (1950) co-writerAll About Eve (1950)People Will Talk (1951)Julius Caesar (1953) UncreditedThe Barefoot Contessa (1954)Guys and Dolls (1955)The Quiet American (1958)Cleopatra (1963) co-writerThe Honey Pot (1967)Further readingJack Brodsky and Nathan Weiss: The Cleopatra Papers.
