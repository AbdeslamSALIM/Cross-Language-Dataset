He made his Ligue 1 debut on 26 March 1994 in a 2-0 victory against Angers SCOL'Equipe - Gregory Coupet profile. After three seasons, he surprisingly moved to league rival Olympique Lyonnais (the two cities are only 80 kilometers apart, and are long-time local and national rivals). His gamble paid off as Lyon have regularly dominated the Le Championnat since 2002 and are also a regular fixture in the UEFA Champions League.Coupet performed a memorable double save against FC Barcelona during an [[UEFA_Champions_League_2001-02|UEFA Champions League 2001-02 ]] match, when he first acrobatically headed an unintended lob by a defender to his own crossbar, and then immediately parried a close header by the arriving Barcelona striker Rivaldo.

Coupet credits the aftermath of Foe's death in helping him gain a new perspective on life, in the process settling his differences with Lyon after having been engaged in nasty contract imbroglios for most of the 2002-03 season, which included at one point his vowing never to play for the club again.In 2005 Coupet was voted for the first time, at age 33, into the top 10 for the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper Award. He finished with 43 votes, fourth behind winner Petr Čech, Dida, and Gianluigi Buffon, respectively. He has also twice been named Ligue 1 Keeper of the Year, in 2004 and 2005.The World's best Goalkeeper 2005On August 2, 2007, Coupet suffered a torn internal medial ligament in his left knee after catching his foot in the net during a training session. He underwent surgery four days later and missed the remainder of 2007, including France's final Euro 2008 qualifiers. He later joked on Lyon's official television network, "The good side...is that France have a rugby World Cup coming and I’ll be able to enjoy every bit of it.” Coupet out for four monthsCoupet returned to the squad in the new year making his return in Lyon's 4-0 victory over Ligue 2 side US Créteil in the Coupe de France on January 6, 2008.Coupet on track for comeback Since his return, he has played all of Lyon's matches; including the Champions League games against Manchester United.On Friday, May 23, 2008, Coupet announced that he will play his final game for Lyon in the French Cup final against Paris Saint-Germain.Coupet to leave Lyon after Cup final After several weeks of uncertainity, it was officially confirmed by Atletico Madrid on July 7, 2008, that Coupet will continue his career at the Spanish club, signing a contract for two seasons and signed for 1.5 million.Atlético de Madrid signs Gregory Coupet, French national team starting goalkeeperGregory Coupet puts on the Club Atlético de Madrid jersey for the first timeInternational careerCoupet has 27 caps with France. He made his international debut against Australia during France's 2001 FIFA Confederations Cup-winning campaign. He was called up for the 2002 FIFA World Cup as the backup to Fabien Barthez, but did not play. The following year, Coupet kept three clean sheets and conceded only three goals in five games as France won the 2003 Confederations Cup, which marked their second victory in the competition in three years.In February 2006, France Football magazine conducted a poll among its readers as to who should be France's first-choice goalie for the World Cup; Coupet received 69 percent of the votes (Barthez received 28 percent).France Fans Vote Gregory CoupetThough Coupet started six of 10 games in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying rounds, coach Raymond Domenech surprisingly elected Barthez as his number one, which would relegate Coupet to the bench once again. Many had expected Coupet to be chosen as the starter due to his excellent performances with Olympique Lyonnais that had contributed greatly to their torrid streak of five Ligue 1 championships. This ultimately led to a row on May 25, 2006 between Coupet and Domenech that resulted in Coupet storming out of the team's training camp in Tignes with his family in tow, but he later returned and made amends with the coach.Coupet storms out after Barthez disputeCoupet is now France's number one after Barthez announced his retirement from both club and country football in August 2006. His first regular stint - currently during the Euro 2008 qualifiers - however, has gotten off to a less-than-desired start; France were upset by Scotland 1-0 on October 7, and a hand injury suffered in that match kept him out of France's 5-0 victory over the Faroe Islands four days later.He was first choice goalkeeper for Euro 2008, conceding six goals in three matches as France were eliminated in the group stage.HonorsWith Lyon:Ligue 1 - 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008Trophée Des Champions - 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008Coupe de la Ligue - 2001UEFA Intertoto Cup - 1997Peace Cup: 2007Coupe de France: 2008With France:FIFA Confederations Cup - 2001, 2003External linksCareer StatisticsPlaying the waiting gameAmbitious Coupet lays claim to Barthez's goalkeeping spotNot Yet at 100% (translated interview)Grégory Coupet face à Rivaldo en 1999References      Category:1972 births Category:2001 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2003 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:AS Saint-Étienne players Category:Football (soccer) goalkeepers Category:France international footballers Category:French footballers Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Living people Category:Olympique Lyonnais players Category:People from Auvergne Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:UEFA Euro 2008 playersca:Grégory Coupet da:Grégory Coupet de:Grégory Coupet es:Grégory Coupet eo:Gregory Coupet fr:Grégory Coupet id:Grégory Coupet it:Grégory Coupet lt:Grégory Coupet hu:Grégory Coupet mr:ग्रेगरी काउपेट nl:Grégory Coupet ja:グレゴリー・クーペ no:Grégory Coupet pl:Grégory Coupet pt:Grégory Coupet ru:Купе, Грегори fi:Grégory Coupet sv:Grégory Coupet tr:Grégory Coupet zh:格雷戈里·库佩
