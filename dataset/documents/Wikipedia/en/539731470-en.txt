(), also known as simply Olympiacos, Olympiacos Piraeus or with its full name Olympiacos C.F.P. (, transliterated "Olympiacos Syndesmos Filathlon Pireos", Olympiacos Club of Fans of Piraeus), is a Greek football club, part of Olympiacos CFP, based in Piraeus, Athens.Olympiacos is considered one of the big three football clubs in Greece and it is one of the only four teams that have never been relegated from the first division. Olympiacos is by far the most successful club in Greek football history, having won the Greek League 36 times, the Greek Cup 23 times, 3 Greek Super Cups and 1 Balkans Cup, more titles than any other Greek team; in European competitions, they have reached the quarter-finals twice, in UEFA Champions League 1998–99 and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1992–93. Olympiacos is also one of the founding members of the European Club Association.HistoryEarly years and domestic successOlympiacos was founded on March 10 1925, in the port of Piraeus, when the members of Athlitikos Podosfairikos Syllogos Pireos (Sport and Football Club of Piraeus) and Omilos Filathlon Pireos (Club of Fans of Piraeus) decided, during a historical assembly, to dissolve the two clubs in order to establish a unified new one, with an emblem depicting the profile of an Ancient Olympic Games winner. Notis Kamberos announced the name Olympiacos and Michalis Manouskos completed it to its full name, Olympiacos Club of Fans of Piraeus. The Andrianopoulos brothers, however, were those who significantly raised the reputation of the club and added glory to it. Members of a prosperous family, they made the name of Olympiacos known over Greece. Jimmy, Dinos, Giorgos and Vassilis were the first to play. Leonidas made his appearance later on and played for a short time. The club's offensive line, made up of the five brothers, soon became legendary and, hence, Olympiacos is also known as Thrylos (Legend), after this classic side of the 1930s which won a hatful of titles. Olympiacos immediately caught the attention of locals, with the team filling the Piraeus Velodrome, present day Karaiskakis Stadium; back then their fanbase consisted mainly of the working class.In 1926, the Hellenic Football Federation was founded and in 1927 it organized the first Panhellenic Championship. However in the following season (1928-29) Olympiacos came to a dispute with the Hellenic Football Federation and did not participate in the championship. Panathinaikos and AEK Athens decided to follow Olympiacos, and together formed a group called P.O.K.. During that season they played friendly games with each other. The second Panhellenic Championship took place in 1929-30, with the champions of the regional leagues of Athens, Piraeus and Thessaloniki playing in playoff in order to determine the national champion. Up to 1958-59 the Panhellenic Championship was organized this way. The first championship as a national league, called Alpha Ethniki, was held in the 1959-60 season.Olympiacos won the Greek title for the first time in the 1930-31 season. It was going to be a very successful era. By 1940, Olympiacos had already won six championships in eleven seasons and by 1960 they had won fifteen championships in twenty-three seasons, as well as nine Greek Cups, making for six doubles. The legendary Olympiacos team of the 1950s, with key performers such as Andreas Mouratis, Ilias Rossidis, Thanassis Bebis, Elias Yfantis, Kostas Polychroniou, Giorgos Darivas and Savas Theodoridis, won the title six consecutive times, from 1954 to 1959, combining it with the cup in 1957, 1958 and 1959 to celebrate the only third double in a row to have ever been won in Greek football history. It is worth mentioning that Olympiacos for several seasons was not allowed to make use of the Karaiskakis Stadium and, with permission from Panathinaikos, found a temporary home in Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, the ground of the eternal enemy.Sporadic success and stone yearsThe 60s and the early 70s were not as fruitful for Olympiacos, having won only two championships and six cups. Another glorious chapter began in 1972, after Nikos Goulandris became president. He appointed Lakis Petropoulos as coach and signed star players Giorgos Delikaris, Yves Triantafyllos, Julio Losada, Milton Viera and Dimitris Persidis. Under Goulandris presidency, Olympiacos won the title three times in a row from 1973 to 1975, combining it with the cup in 1973 and 1975. The highlight for that side was the 1973-74 season, when Olympiacos won the league with record points (59) and goals (102). Following Goulandris resignation from the presidency in 1975, the team went through a relative "dry" period in the second half of the 1970s. However in the early 80s, Olympiacos emerged again as the dominant power in the Greek football winning the title four times in a row (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983). Key players during this period included forward Nikos Anastopoulos, midfielder Tasos Mitropoulos and goalkeeper Nikos Sarganis. Alketas Panagoulias, who had also been manager of the Greek national football team and the United States national soccer team, coached the team between 1981 and 1983 and again in the 1986-87 season, earning the championship title in 1982, 1983 and 1987.Olympiacos experienced its darkest days from the late-1980s until the mid-90s. In the mid-80s Olympiacos came into the hands of Greek businessman George Koskotas. Soon Koskotas was accused of and convicted for embezzlement, leaving Olympiacos deep in debt. On the pitch, the team without a serious management went nine seasons without a league title, 1988 to 1996. This period was known as Olympiacos' stone years. It is worth mentioning that 1987-88 was the worst season ever for Olympiacos, as the club finished 8th in the league, playing to avoid the relegation in most of the season.Absolute dominationThe situation improved after Socratis Kokkalis took over Olympiacos' shares in 1993. Having agreed to a settlement of the club's debts with the Greek government, a long term deal according to which the capital was to be paid without any of the large amounts of interest, Kokkalis slowly resurrected the team, first by appointing successful coach Dušan Bajević in 1996, who had just left AEK Athens, following a clash with the management team regarding financial issues and uncertainty. The same season Kokkalis signed for the Reds all the young talents he could find in the Greek market, such as Predrag Đorđević, Grigorios Georgatos, Stelios Giannakopoulos, Georgios Anatolakis and eventually Dimitris Mavrogenidis, Alexandros Alexandris, Giorgos Amanatidis, Andreas Niniadis, all of which proceeded to play for Olympiacos for at least five years and became household names.Hence Olympiacos' era of domination began, with success attracting players of international magnitude like Zlatko Zahovič, Giovanni, and World Champions Rivaldo and Christian Karembeu. Olympiacos won seven consecutive championships, beating their own past record of six, with their best campaign being 1998-99, when they celebrated the double and their qualification to the quarterfinals of the Champions League, their best ever European campaign. Following coaches had big shoes to fill and Kokkalis wasn't prepared to give them time to do it; Olympiacos employed eleven coaches in just four years. The most known are Ioannis Matzourakis (former coach of Skoda Xanthi), Takis Lemonis (who resigned from coaching Skoda Xanthi at the end of 2006 to manage again Olympiacos, replacing Trond Sollied), Oleg Protasov, Siniša Gogić and Nikos Alefantos.Despite the constant management changes, Olympiacos kept on winning championships, albeit collecting the same points as the 2nd ranked team in their last two. In the 2001-02 season, Olympiacos had the advantage over AEK Athens, as they had beat it twice (2-3 and 4-3), while they secured the 2002-03 championship on goal difference, as Panathinaikos had won 3-2 the first game, but was defeated 3-0 in the second.In the 2003-04 season, Olympiacos finished second, after switching three coaches in a year, losing the championship for the first time after seven years of absolute dominance. For the 2004-05 season, Olympiacos appointed again Dušan Bajević and transferred 1999 World Footballer of the Year and reigning World Champion Brazilian Rivaldo. The end of the season found Olympiacos with both domestic trophies (the championship and the cup) but without their manager Bajević, as he resigned.Therefore Olympiacos appointed Trond Sollied. They also made a great hit on the market by signing arch-rival Panathinaikos' striker Michalis Konstantinou. During the season 2005-06, Olympiacos achieved to win all the four derbies against their major rivals, Panathinaikos and AEK Athens, something only achieved once more, during the season 1972-73. The combined goal total in these four matches was 11-3 in favour of Olympiacos. They also beat their second biggest rival AEK Athens 3-0 in the Greek Cup Final to clinch their second straight double and managed to win 16 consecutive matches in the championship, thus breaking their own record.After that, Socrates Kokkalis put full faith in Trond Sollied and signed seven, though not expensive, players according to his recommendations, in hoping that the club will achieve the double for the third straight time for only the second time in Greek footballing history. However, Sollied did not live up to the club's expectations on the Champions League competition and was replaced by Takis Lemonis at the end of 2006.In the summer of 2007, Olympiacos made very expensive transfers like Darko Kovačević and Luciano Galletti and was part of the most expensive transfer in Greek football history, by selling striker-midfielder Nery Castillo to the Ukrainian club FC Shakhtar Donetsk for the record sum of 20 million Euro (27.5 million US Dollars). Because of a clause in Castillo's contract, Olympiacos received 15 million Euro, whereas the other 5 million Euro were given directly to the player. In 2008, Olympiacos also made some prominent transfers with Diogo Luis Santo and Avraam Papadopoulos signing in, and appointed Ernesto Valverde from RCD Espanyol as manager, with a contract worth about 6,000,000 € for a three-year agreement.Olympiacos is by far the most successful club in Greek football history. Indeed they have more championships (36) to their name than arch-rivals Panathinaikos (19) and AEK Athens (11) put together, while the Reds have equal number of titles to all the other crowned teams together. Olympiacos also hold the Cup winning-record, with 23.Crest and coloursWhen, in 1925, the merger of the two clubs of Piraeus, Athlitikos Podosfairikos Syllogos Pireos and Omilos Filathlon Pireos, gave birth to the new football club, the latter was unanimously baptized Olympiacos Club of Fans of Piraeus, a name inspired from the Ancient Olympic Games, the morality, the vying and the splendor that they represented in ancient Greece. Consequently, the club adopted the laureate teen as their emblem, which symbolizes the Olympic Games winner. Red and white were chosen as the colours of the crest; red for the passion and white for the virtue.The crest of Olympiacos underwent minor changes through the ages, while the typical kit of the team is that of a shirt with red and white vertical stripes, and red or white shorts and socks. The second most common kit is the all-red one and next the all-white one. Olympiacos has used several other colours during its history as an away or third kit, with the most notable of them being the monotint black or silver one.The most common kits of Olympiacos during their history are these below (the year of each one is indicant):pattern_la = _red_stripespattern_b = _red_stripespattern_ra = _red_stripesleftarm = FFFFFFbody = FFFFFFrightarm = FFFFFFshorts = FFFFFFsocks = FF0000title = 1971pattern_la = _red_stripespattern_b = _redstripes2pattern_ra = _red_stripesleftarm = FFFFFFbody = FFFFFFrightarm = FFFFFFshorts = FFFFFFsocks = FF0000title = 1978pattern_la = _redborderpattern_b = _thickwhitestripespattern_ra = _redborderpattern_so=_band_whiteleftarm = FFFFFFbody = FF0000rightarm = FFFFFFshorts = FF0000socks = FF0000title = 1979pattern_la = _red_stripespattern_b = _red_stripespattern_ra = _red_stripesleftarm = FFFFFFbody = FFFFFFrightarm = FFFFFFshorts = FF0000socks = FF0000title = 1985pattern_la = _red_hoopspattern_b = _red_stripespattern_ra = _red_hoopsleftarm = FFFFFFbody = FFFFFFrightarm = FFFFFFshorts = FF0000socks = FF0000title = 2008Stadium The Karaiskakis Stadium () is in the Faliro area of Piraeus, Greece. It is the home ground for the football section of the Olympiacos CFP. Furthermore, it hosts the Greek national football team. The stadium is named after Georgios Karaiskakis, hero of the Greek War of Independence, who was mortally wounded in this area. During their history, Olympiacos also used other stadiums as home ground, mainly the Olympic Stadium of Athens in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, until it was closed for renovation work, for the Athens Olympics 2004. They also used Georgios Kamaras Stadium during 2002-04.Supporters Olympiacos, is the Greek team with the biggest fan base according to most of the polls that have been conducted in Greece. The Reds coming from the port of Athens, Piraeus, was the team of the working class. Since the 1950s when Olympiacos was dominant, winning consecutive titles, their popularity increased throughout Greece and their fanbase was enlarged, to become the most well supported football club. In addition to this, Olympiacos attracted fans from all the social classes and their fanbase changed enough.Several newspapers and magazines have conducted polls during the last decade, which - more or less - give Olympiacos as the most popular team, with a varying 29-37% among the fans in Greece, which corresponds to around two and a half millions of supporters. According to these polls, Olympiacos is the most popular in the working class, while they are the most supported team in Athens, Central Greece, the Peloponnese and Thessaly. In terms of politics, the vast majority of Olympiacos fans comes from the centre-right and centre-left of the political spectrum.Olympiacos and FK Crvena Zvezda fans have developed a deep friendship. The fans of both teams have begun to call themselves the "Orthodox Brothers". Many times Olympiacos supporters from several fan-clubs have attended Crvena Zvezda's matches, especially against their old rival FK Partizan, and vice-versa. More recently, the Orthodox Brothers have started to include fans of FC Spartak Moscow.RivalriesOlympiacos' main rival is Panathinaikos, in the so-called derby of the eternal enemies. Each game between these two clubs splits Athens and the whole of Greece in two. The rivalry is based on the social status of the fanbases and the fact that these are the most successful Greek clubs in football and the Greek sports in general. Olympiacos used to represent the working class while Panathinaikos the upper class. Now the fanbases of both are almost similar. This derby is considered the classic derby of the capital and Greece, and exists in basketball, volleyball, water polo and other sports. Many times some violent incidents between the fans of the two sides have occurred, like the death of Mihalis Filopoulos, a Panathinaikos fan, in a clash of hooligans supporting the two clubs.The next major rivals of Olympiacos are AEK Athens and PAOK. AEK is considered the third giant of Greek football, the animosity between the two clubs is intense and got worse when Dušan Bajević left AEK for Olympiacos in 1996. The rivalry between Olympiacos and PAOK started in the 1960s when Olympiacos tried to acquire the "icon" of PAOK, Giorgos Koudas, and exists as the fiercest inter-city rivalry in Greece.Another classic rival of Olympiacos is Ethnikos Piraeus, the second most successful club of Piraeus but this rivalry is not so fierce anymore due to the fact that Ethnikos plays in lower divisions the last years. The match against Aris Thessaloniki also carries a certain rivalry towards it.European campaigns Olympiacos' best moments at European level came with appearances in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League 1998–99, where Juventus beat them, and in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1992–93 quarter-finals, where they lost to Atlético Madrid.Olympiacos has a long presence in the UEFA Champions League. Regarding the team's statistics, Olympiacos had to wait ten years and 32 away games in total, to manage their first ever away win in the main tournament of the Champions League, as they ran a record of 7 ties and 24 defeats, until they triumphed over SV Werder Bremen in Weserstadion for the group stage of the UEFA Champions League 2007–08, on October 3 2007. They tend to be a strong home team though, as they were never defeated at home during their first four years in the Champions League, having 13 consecutive undefeated games. Another proof for that is that they achieved one of the biggest victories in Champions League history in the season 2002-03, a stunning 6-2 against the finalists of the previous year Bayer 04 Leverkusen at the Georgios Kamaras Stadium in Athens.Following the great performance in the UEFA Champions League 2007–08 when they reached the knockout stage, Olympiacos was the victim of one of the greatest surprises in the UEFA Champions League 2008–09 third qualifying round, as they suffered a heavy away lose 0-3 by the Cypriot champions Anorthosis, a score that they were proved unable to override in the second leg. As a result, Olympiacos failed to take part in the group stage of Champions League after eleven consecutive years of participation and compete in the UEFA Cup 2008–09. After eliminating Nordsjælland in the first round with two wins, the Greek team was drawn to play in group stage against SL Benfica, Galatasaray, Hertha Berlin and Metalist Kharkiv.Season 1998-99In UEFA Champions League 1998–99, Olympiacos was drawn in Group A for the Champions League, along with AFC Ajax, Porto and Croatia Zagreb. There, "Thrylos" won all three home games, but also managed to secure two away draws and a ticket to the quarter-finals.There they met Juventus. In the first leg at the Stadio delle Alpi, Juventus beat Olympiacos 2-1 which meant that Olympiacos only needed a 1-0 victory to proceed to the semifinals. A vintage performance, scoring early with Siniša Gogić and never allowing their opponents to create chances, was 5 minutes away to making that scenario come true. However, Dimitrios Eleftheropoulos, Olympiacos’s goalkeeper, misjudged the flight of the ball in a seemingly harmless cross and Juventus had the last laugh and escaped with a 1-1 draw from the Athens Olympic Stadium, which was the beginning of the "Late-Goal Curse" that superstitious supporters firmly believe hangs upon the team, especially in away matches.Olympiacos’ supporters couldn’t believe how they fumbled such a huge opportunity to play in the semi-finals and even though they recognized Eleftheropoulos’ efforts up to that point, great efforts that even earned him the "UEFA Champions League Goalkeeper of the Competition"-award, they still held him responsible for the disqualification and up to this day there is no conversation about the "1998-99 campaign" without a single mention of the goalkeeper’s severe mistake.Arguably the most impressive incident supporting this folklore tale is the UEFA Champions League 2001–02 away match at Riazor Stadium against Deportivo de La Coruña, where Olympiacos managed to turn the game around and led 1-2 from 1-0, when, literally in the last seconds, with the referee ready to whistle for full-time, Eleftheropoulos miscommunicated with his centre-back in another innocent lob and gave away an easy, as unlikely, goal to the opposition forward for an unexpectable 2-2 draw.Season 2004-05In UEFA Champions League 2004–05 Olympiacos was drawn in Group A once again, this time against Liverpool, AS Monaco and Deportivo. Rivaldo made an inspiring debut for Olympiacos, in Spain against his former Spanish team Deportivo but "Thrylos" only managed to get a 0-0 draw. The team predictably won all three home games in the freshly renovated Karaiskakis Stadium, notably with the same score, 1-0, meanwhile losing 2-1 away against AS Monaco.With one match to go and in a very bizarre combination of results, Olympiacos were in danger of being one of only two teams in Champions League history that have managed to collect 10 points and still unable to qualify for the next round. They went to Anfield to play the last match against Liverpool and in order to progress they had either not to lose, or to score and not lose by more than one goal difference.Rivaldo turned back the years to show the capacity crowd why he was named "European Footballer of the Year" in 1999. He opened the scoring with a foul he earned after an impressive solo-effort for the 0-1 Olympiacos lead, which was the half-time result. Olympiacos needed to concede three goals in the second half to be eliminated and indeed Liverpool managed to score those three goals, with the final result being 3-1, which marked the premature end of yet another Olympiacos' Champions League campaign. Liverpool were the ones to progress and they, incidentally, went on to actually lift the trophy, producing a similar display in the final.Olympiacos’ 2004-2005 European effort did not end there however, as they were seeded to continue in the UEFA Cup. They were drawn against French team Sochaux for the "round of 32" and proceeded thanks to two more 1-0 victories. In the "round of 16" they faced Newcastle United and were easily eliminated with two losses, thus putting an end to the club’s third most successful European Campaign.Season 2007-08in Stamford Bridge]] In UEFA Champions League 2007–08, Olympiacos was drawn in Group C, against Real Madrid CF, SV Werder Bremen and SS Lazio. Following a draw 1-1 to Lazio in Karaiskakis Stadium, it is the season that Olympiacos made their first ever away win in the Champions League, a 3-1 win against Werder Bremen in Weserstadion, turning the game around from 0-1. In the third game, Olympiacos was finally defeated 4-2 to Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, after a heart-breaking match in which the Greek team was playing with 10 men from the 13th minute and was leading the score to the 68th with 2-1, turning it around from 0-1 and wasting a lot of chances to score more. Real Madrid scored their third goal in the 83th, but Olympiacos came close to score many times during the last minutes of the match and leave Madrid with the draw, when Real secured the win with a last-minute goal.Olympiacos opened the second round of the group stage with a draw 0-0 to Real Madrid in Karaiskakis Stadium and kept alive the record of being undefeated by Real Madrid in Athens in four matches, while the Reds moved a step closer to qualifying for the "last 16" after coming from behind to defeat Lazio 2-1 in Stadio Olimpico. On December 11, Olympiacos smashed Werder Bremen 3-0 at Karaiskakis Stadium in Athens, which ensured their place in the knock out stage of the tournament.In the knockout stage Olympiacos faced Chelsea. At the first match in Athens, the Reds achieved a scoreless draw against the Blues, but they were eliminated in the second leg in Stamford Bridge after they lost 3-0. Despite Olympiacos' successful European campaign, Lemonis was sacked less than a week later, due to the club's lower-than-expected performance in the Super League. He was replaced by his assistant José Segura.International RecordSeasonAchievementNotesEuropean Cup / UEFA Champions League1974-75Last 16eliminated by RSC Anderlecht 1-5 in Brussels, 3-0 in Athens1982-83Last 16eliminated by Hamburger SV 0-1 in Hamburg, 0-4 in Athens1983-84Last 16eliminated by SL Benfica 1-0 in Athens, 0-3 in Lisboa1998-99Quarter-finalseliminated by Juventus FC 1-2 in Turin, 1-1 in Athens2007-08Last 16eliminated by Chelsea FC 0-0 in Athens, 0-3 in LondonUEFA Cup Winners' Cup1963-64Last 16eliminated by Olympique Lyonnais 1-4 in Lyon, 2-1 in Athens1965-66Last 16eliminated by West Ham United FC 0-4 in London, 2-2 in Athens1968-69Last 16eliminated by Dunfermline Athletic FC 0-4 in Dunfermline, 3-0 in Athens1986-87Last 16eliminated by AFC Ajax 0-4 in Amsterdam, 1-1 in Athens1990-91Last 16eliminated by UC Sampdoria 0-1 in Athens, 1-3 in Genova1992-93Quarter-finalseliminated by Atlético Madrid 1-1 in Athens, 1-3 in MadridUEFA Cup1989-90Last 16eliminated by AJ Auxerre 1-1 in Athens, 0-0 in Auxerre2004-05Last 16eliminated by Newcastle United FC 1-3 in Athens, 0-4 in NewcastleSeasonMatchScoreEuropean Cup / Champions League1974-75Olympiacos CFP - Celtic FC2-01974-75Olympiacos CFP - RSC Anderlecht3-01983-84Olympiacos CFP - AFC Ajax2-01983-84Olympiacos CFP - SL Benfica1-01997-98Olympiacos CFP- FC Porto1-01998-99Olympiacos CFP - AFC Ajax1-02000-01Olympiacos CFP- Valencia CF1-0 12002-03Olympiacos CFP - Bayer 04 Leverkusen6-2 22003-04Olympiacos CFP - Galatasaray SK3-02004-05Olympiacos CFP - Liverpool FC1-0 32004-05Olympiacos CFP - AS Monaco FC1-0 42005-06Olympiacos CFP- Real Madrid CF2-12007-08SV Werder Bremen - Olympiacos CFP1-32007-08SS Lazio - Olympiacos CFP1-22007-08Olympiacos CFP - SV Werder Bremen3-0Cup Winners' Cup1971-72FC Dynamo Moscow - Olympiacos CFP1-21992-93AS Monaco FC - Olympiacos CFP0-1UEFA Cup1972-73Cagliari Calcio - Olympiacos CFP0-11972-73Olympiacos CFP - Tottenham Hotspur FC1-0 51999-00Juventus FC - Olympiacos CFP1-2Notes1 Valencia CF was the runner-up of Champions League 2000-012 Bayer 04 Leverkusen was the runner-up of Champions League 2001-023 Liverpool FC was the winner of Champions League 2004-054 AS Monaco FC was the runner-up of Champions League 2003-045 Tottenham Hotspur FC was the winner of UEFA Cup 1971-72|valign="top" width=33%|Biggest winsSeasonMatchScoreEuropean Cup / Champions League1974-75Olympiacos CFP - RSC Anderlecht3-01997-98Olympiacos CFP - FC Mozyr5-0 12002-03Olympiacos CFP - Bayer 04 Leverkusen6-22003-04Olympiacos CFP - Galatasaray SK3-02007-08Olympiacos CFP - SV Werder Bremen3-0Cup Winners' Cup1968-69Olympiacos CFP - Dunfermline Athletic FC3-01986-87Olympiacos CFP - Union Luxembourg3-01986-87Union Luxembourg - Olympiacos CFP0-31992-93FC Chornomorets Odessa - Olympiacos CFP0-3UEFA Cup1993-94Olympiacos CFP - PFC Botev Plovdiv5-12008-09Olympiacos CFP - FC Nordsjælland5-0Notes3rd Qualification round|UEFA Club Rankings 2009This is the current UEFA Club Rankings, including season 2008-09.
