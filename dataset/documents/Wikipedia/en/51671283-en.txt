The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is an independent, non-for-profit, standardization organization of the telecommunications industry (equipment makers and network operators) in Europe, with worldwide projection. ETSI has been successful in standardizing the GSM cell phone system and the TETRA professional mobile radio system.Significant ETSI standardisation bodies include TISPAN (for fixed networks and Internet convergence). ETSI inspired the creation of, and is a partner in 3GPP.ETSI was created by CEPT in 1988 and is officially recognized by the European Commission and the EFTA secretariat. Based in Sophia Antipolis (France), ETSI is officially responsible for standardization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) within Europe. These technologies include telecommunications, broadcasting and related areas such as intelligent transportation and medical electronics. ETSI has 696 members from 62 countries/provinces inside and outside Europe, including manufacturers, network operators, administrations, service providers, research bodies and users — in fact, all the key players in the ICT arena.In 2005, ETSI budget exceeded 20 million Euros, with contributions coming from members, commercial activities like sale of documents, plug-tests and fora hosting, contract work and partner funding. About 40% goes towards operating expenses and the remaining 60% towards work programs including competency centers and special projects.ETSI is a founding partner organization of the Global Standards Collaboration initiative.See alsoEuropean Committee for StandardizationEuropean Committee for Electrotechnical StandardizationDECTGSMKASUMIHiperMANHiperLANTBR21TETRATISPANDigital Subscriber System No. 1ISDNMMICAdESXAdESExternal linksOfficial web siteCategory:Standards organizations Category:1988 establishments  ca:European Telecommunications Standards Institute da:European Telecommunications Standards Institute de:Europäisches Institut für Telekommunikationsnormen es:European Telecommunications Standards Institute fr:European Telecommunications Standards Institute it:European Telecommunications Standards Institute he:ETSI lv:ETSI nl:Europees Telecommunicatie en Standaardisatie Instituut ja:欧州電気通信標準化機構 no:European Telecommunications Standards Institute pl:Europejski Instytut Norm Telekomunikacyjnych pt:European Telecommunications Standards Institute ru:ETSI fi:ETSI sv:European Telecommunications Standards Institute tr:ETSI uk:Європейський інститут телекомунікаційних стандартів zh:欧洲电信标准协会
