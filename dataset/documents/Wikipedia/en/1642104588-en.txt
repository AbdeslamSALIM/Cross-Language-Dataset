After the split of the Soviet Union, they played their first match against Hungary on April 29, 1992.Prior to the split, Ukrainian players represented the USSR national football team. Some of the best Ukrainian players of the beginning of the 1990s (including Andrei Kanchelskis, Viktor Onopko, Sergei Yuran and Oleg Salenko) chose to play for Russia as it was named the official successor of the USSR, while Ukraine did not participate in major international competitions until 1994. As a result a crisis was created for both the national team and the domestic league. Problems were further compounded when Soviet Union's five-year UEFA coefficients, despite being earned in part by Ukrainian players (for example, in the final of the last successful event, Euro-88, 7 out of starting 11 players were UkrainiansEuropean Championship 1988 - Final Tournament - Full Details&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;), were transferred directly to the direct descendant of the Soviet national football team - the Russian national football team.In the following years, the Ukrainian team improved, showcasing talents like Andriy Shevchenko, Anatoliy Tymoschuk and Serhiy Rebrov. However, Ukraine failed to qualify for any major intercontinental tournament prior to 2005, three times failing at the last qualifying stage, the playoffs, after finishing second in their qualifying groups. It lost to Croatia, failing to get to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Slovenia prevented Ukraine from going to Euro 2000, and Germany stopped them prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup.After an unsuccessful Euro 2004 qualification campaign, Ukraine appointed Oleg Blokhin as the national team's head coach. Despite initial resentment to his appointment due to his previous poor coaching record and calls for a foreign coach, Ukraine went on to qualify for their first-ever FIFA World Cup on September 3 2005, by drawing with Georgia, 1:1, in T'bilisi. In their first World Cup (2006 FIFA World Cup), they were in the group H together with Spain, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. After being crashed in the first match by Spain 0 - 4, Ukraine beaten other two opponents to reach the knock-out stage. In the round of 16, Ukraine played the winner of group G Switzerland, which they beat on penalties reaching the quarter-final of the tournament before losing 3:0 to eventual champions Italy.StadiumsThe most important matches of the Ukrainian national team are held in Kyiv´s Olimpiysky National Sports Complex, the previous home of Dynamo Kyiv (which presently only uses the stadium for major European matches). The alternative stadiums include: Ukraina (Lviv), Meteor (Dnipropetrovsk), Chornomorets (Odessa), Metalist (Kharkiv), and many others. However as new infrastructure and stadiums are built (especially in preparation for Euro 2012), other venues will include stadiums in the cities of Lviv, Donetsk, Odessa, among others.2006 FIFA World CupIn the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first major tournament since splitting from the USSR, Ukraine were drawn in Group H along with Spain, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.Ukraine got off to a poor start with a 4:0 defeat against Spain, but recovered to beat Saudi Arabia 4:0 in a then-national record victory. In their last group match, a lackluster performance by Ukraine saw them hold on to second place, as they beat Tunisia 1:0 with a penalty kick scored by Andriy Shevchenko.In the second round, Ukraine beat Switzerland on penalties (3:0) when the match ended 0:0 after extra-time. In the quarter-finals, Ukraine lost 3:0 to Italy to end their first World Cup campaign.Forthcoming fixturesDateTournamentLocationOpponent19 November 2008Friendly]]UkraineNorway Norway1 April 2009World Cup Qualifier 2010]]England LondonEngland England6 June 2009World Cup Qualifier 2010]]Croatia ZagrebCroatia Croatia10 June 2009World Cup Qualifier 2010]]UkraineKazakhstan Kazakhstan5 September 2009World Cup Qualifier 2010]]UkraineAndorra Andorra9 September 2009World Cup Qualifier 2010]]Belarus MinskBelarus Belarus[[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]]Group 6 ==Recent results==DateTournamentLocationOpponentResultScorers11 October 2008World Cup Qualifier 2010]]Ukraine KharkivCroatia CroatiaDrew 0:010 September 2008World Cup Qualifier 2010]]Kazakhstan AlmatyKazakhstan KazakhstanWon 1:3Ostapenko 68' - Nazarenko 45', 80', Shevchenko 53'6 September 2008World Cup Qualifier 2010]]Ukraine LvivBelarus BelarusWon 1:0Shevchenko 90' (pen)20 August 2008FriendlyUkraine LvivPoland PolandWon 1:0S.
