Smith's grandfather was a steamboat captain and his father built a bus system that led to the southern Greyhound Bus system.Foust, Dean, Frederick W. Smith: No Overnight Success, Business Week, September 20, 2004 This gave Smith a seeming history and influence to do something with travel and business. The original funding for FedEx came from an investment of $4 million that he inherited from his father with an additional $80 million pro from venture capitalists and $27,000 won by Smith at a Las Vegas at a blackjack table by a desperate Smith.The company moved to Memphis, Tennessee and Memphis International Airport after lack of support from Little Rock National Airport and began operations on April 17, 1973 with 14 Dassault Falcon 20's connecting 25 U.S. cities.

In December 2007, the Internal Revenue Service of the United States 'tentatively decided' that FedEx Ground Division might be facing a tax liability of $319 million for 2002, due to misclassification of its operatives as independent contractors. Reversing a 1994 decision which allowed FedEx to classify its operatives that own their own vehicles, the IRS is auditing the years 2003 to 2006, with a view to assessing whether similar misclassification of operatives has taken place. FedEx denies that any irregularities in classification have taken place, but is facing legal action from operatives claiming benefits that would have accrued had they been classified as employees.Operating units and logosFedEx is organized into operating units, each of which has its own version of the wordmark, designed by Lindon Leader of Landor Associates, in 1994. The Fed is always purple and the Ex is in a different color for each division. The original "FedEx" logo had the Ex in orange; it is now used as the FedEx Express wordmark.
