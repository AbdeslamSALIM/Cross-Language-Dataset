Official emphasis on Penn began c. 1990 and intensified in 2002 with President Rodin's "One University" initiative.http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/3d48ac7827f61?in_archive=1. The University's formal branding and usage guidelines http://www.upenn.edu/secretary/nameuse.html, http://www.upenn.edu/webguide/style_guide/identity.html, http://www.business-services.upenn.edu/creativecommunications/pdf/logostyleguide.pdf specify Penn and the "Penn-University of Pennsylvania" logo but do not explicitly deprecate UPenn or other abbreviations. The recent popularity of UPenn is probably influenced by campus email addresses which use the domain name "upenn.edu," and possibly by parallels with UMass and UConn (which, unlike UPenn, have official status and are trademarked). Daily Pennsylvanian columnist Jeff Shafer traces the origin of the "upenn" domain name to pre-Internet days, citing SAS computing head Ira Winston as saying that in the early days of email the University chose upenn.csnet, which "mimicked the University of Delaware's udel.csnet." Thus the choice of "upenn" was made when computer network names had little public visibility, and before the university decided to emphasize Penn as part of a conscious branding strategy. Shafer says the university studied the feasibility of full conversion to "penn.edu" in 2002 but decided that the costs were too high.http://www.dailypennsylvanian.com/vnews/display.v/ART/43f433d839822?in_archive=1.

Penn is America's first university and is the fourth-oldestPenn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. Penn, Princeton, and Columbia originated within a few years of each other. In 1899, Penn officially changed its "founding" date from 1749 to 1740, affecting its rank. See Building Penn's Brand for the reasons why Penn did this. Princeton University implicitly challenges thishttp://www.princeton.edu/main/about/history/, also claiming to be fourth. Penn was chartered in 1755, making it sixth-oldest chartered, behind Princeton (1746) and Columbia (1754). A Presbyterian minister operated a "Log College" in Bucks County, Pennsylvania from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) which would justify pushing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, earlier than Penn's 1740. But Princeton never has done so and a Princeton historian says that "the facts do not warrant" such an interpretation. http://etcweb1.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/log_college.html. institution of higher education in the United States. Penn is also a member of the Ivy League, and is one of the Colonial Colleges.Benjamin Franklin, Penn's founder, advocated an educational program that focused as much on practical education for commerce and public service as on the classics and theology. Penn was one of the first academic institutions to follow a multidisciplinary model pioneered by several European universities, concentrating several "faculties" (e.g., theology, classics, medicine) into one institution.About 4,500 professors serve nearly 10,000 full-time undergraduate and 10,000 graduate and professional students.In FY2007, Penn's academic research programs undertook more than $787 million in research, involving some 4,200 faculty, 870 postdoctoral fellows, 3,800 graduate students, and 5,400 support staff. Much of the funding is provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for biomedical research.Penn tops the Ivy League in annual spending, with a projected 2007 budget of $5.18 billion. In 2007, it ranked fourth among U.S. universities in fundraising, bringing in about $392.4 million in private support.Bloomberg.com: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Penn is incorporated as The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. The university is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities.The University of Pennsylvania is often confused with Penn State although there is no affiliation between the two.HistoryIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians joined together to erect a great preaching hall for the evangelist George Whitefield. Designed and built by Edmund Woolley, it was the largest building in the city and it was also planned to serve as a charity school. The fundraising, however, fell short and although the building was erected, the plans for both a chapel and the charity school were suspended. In the fall of 1749, eager to create a college to educate future generations, Benjamin Franklin circulated a pamphlet titled "Proposals for the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania," his vision for what he called a "Public Academy of Philadelphia."A Brief History of the University, University of Pennsylvania Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; However, according to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first drew up a proposal for establishing the academy, "thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution." Unlike the other three American Colonial colleges that existed at the time&nbsp;— Harvard, William and Mary, and Yale&nbsp;— Franklin's new school would not focus merely on education for the clergy. He advocated an innovative concept of higher education, one which would teach both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and doing public service. The proposed program of study became the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum.Franklin assembled a board of trustees from among the leading citizens of Philadelphia, the first such non-sectarian board in America. At the first meeting of the 24 members of the Board of Trustees (November 13, 1749) the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from Independence Hall was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the Trustees realized that the building erected in 1740, which was still vacant, would be an even better site. On February 1, 1750 the new board took over the building and trusts of the old board. In 1751 the Academy, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, took in its first students. A charity school also was opened in accordance with the intentions of the original "New Building" donors, although it lasted only a few years.For its date of founding, the University uses 1740, the date of "the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself"Cheyney, Edward Potts. History of the University of Pennsylvania 1740–1940 University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia. 1940. pp 46–48. (the charity school mentioned above) during its existence.The institution was known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then-provost the Rev. William Smith's loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a University of the State of Pennsylvania.Penn in the 18th Century, University of Pennsylvania Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791 the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into the University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution on the new board of trustees. These three schools were part of the same institution and were overseen by the same board of Trustees.Penn has three claims to being the first university in the United States, according to university archive director Mark Frazier Lloyd: founding the first medical school in America in 1765, makes it the first university de facto, while, by virtue of the 1779 charter, "no other American institution of higher learning was named University before Penn." Also, as previously noted, Harvard, William and Mary, and Yale were merely colleges dedicated to the education of the clergy.After being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the Schuylkill River to property purchased from the Blockley Almshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as University City.Heads of the University of PennsylvaniaProvosts of the Academy, College and Universitybirth–deathYears as provost1The Rev.

Penn is also home to the oldest Psychology department in North America and where the American Medical Association was founded.MottoPenn's motto is based on a line from Horace’s III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt? ("of what avail empty laws without good mores?") From 1756 to 1898, the motto read Sine Moribus Vanae. When a wag pointed out that the motto could be translated as "Loose women without morals," the university quickly changed the motto to literae sine moribus vanae ("Letters without morals are useless"). In 1932, all elements of the seal were revised, and as part of the redesign it was decided that the new motto "mutilated" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, Leges Sine Moribus Vanae ("Laws without morals are useless").ColorsThe official school colors are red with hex value 990000, and blue with hex value 011F5B.Penn: Web Style Guide: Color Values&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In printed materials they are PMS 201 red and PMS 288 blue.http://www.business-services.upenn.edu/publicationservices/pdf/logostyleguide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;AcademicsUndergraduate programsThe University of Pennsylvania has four undergraduate schools:The School of Arts &amp; SciencesThe School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS)The School of NursingThe Wharton SchoolThe College of Arts & Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences, which also contains the Graduate Division and the College of General Studies, Penn's division for non-traditional undergraduate and graduate students.Penn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It emphasizes joint degree programs, unique majors and academic flexibility. Penn's One University policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools, except the medical and dental schools.Undergraduate students at Penn may also take courses at area colleges participating in the Quaker consortium, including Swarthmore, Haverford, and Bryn Mawr.One of the most well known guest professors at Penn is the actor Kal Penn who taught a very popular class at the University of Pennsylvania.Graduate and professional schoolsThe following schools offer graduate programs:Annenberg School for CommunicationGraduate School of EducationLaw School (law school)Graduate School of Arts & SciencesSchool of Dental Medicine (dental school)School of Design (formerly the Graduate School of Fine Arts)School of Engineering and Applied ScienceSchool of Medicine (medical school)School of NursingSocial Policy and PracticeSchool of Veterinary Medicine (veterinary school)Wharton School (business school)Joint-degree and interdisciplinary programsPenn offers specialized joint-degree programs, which award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the University upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools. Undergraduate programs include:The Jerome Fisher Program in Management and TechnologyThe Huntsman Program in International Studies and BusinessNursing and Health Care ManagementThe Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and ManagementDual Degree programs which lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike joint-degree programs, "dual degree" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without involvement of another program. Specialized Dual Degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as a Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Science and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.For graduate programs, there are many formalized joint degree graduate programs such as a joint J.D./MBA. Penn is also the home to interdisciplinary institutions such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science, and the Executive Master's in Technology Management Program.Academic Medical Center and Biomedical Research ComplexPenn's health-related programs&nbsp;— including the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine, and programs in bioengineering (School of Engineering) and health management (the Wharton School) - are among the university's strongest academic components. The combination of intellectual breadth, research funding (each of the health sciences schools ranks in the top 5 in annual NIH funding), clinical resources and overall scale ranks Penn with only a small handful of peer universities in the U.S.The size of Penn's biomedical research organization, however, adds a very capital intensive component to the university's operations, and introduces revenue instability due to changing government regulations, reduced Federal funding for research, and Medicaid/Medicare program changes. This is a primary reason highlighted in bond rating agencies' views on Penn's overall financial rating, which ranks one notch below its academic peers. Penn has worked to address these issues by pooling its schools (as well as several hospitals and clinical practices) into the University of Pennsylvania Health System, thereby pooling resources for greater efficiencies and research impact.Admissions selectivityPenn is one of the most selective universities in the United States. The university received 22,634 applications for the Class of 2011 entering in fall 2007; Penn admitted 15.9 percent of those applicants, its lowest-ever proportion. The College of Arts and Sciences itself had an acceptance rate of about 11 percent. For comparison, in recent years, Penn has received 18,000–20,000 applications for each freshman class, has admitted 20–25 percent of applications and saw 60–67 percent of admitted applicants matriculate. Further, Penn consistently ranks among the 10 toughest schools to get into, according to the Princeton Review.The Ten Toughest Schools to Get Into - MSN Encarta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Penn has an acceptance rate of 15.9%, and is arguably the most selective of the "middle" or "lower" Ivies (i.e. Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth, and Cornell). To wit, 96% of Penn's incoming freshmen for 2007 were ranked in the top 10% of their high school classes, compared to Columbia, Brown, Dartmouth and Cornell, whose statistics were 93%, 90%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. To quote a recent article about the university regarding its admissions policy and research prowess, "The University of Pennsylvania holds its own against the best of its Ivy League brethren."At the graduate level, Penn's admissions rates—like most universities'—vary considerably based on school and program. Based on admission statistics from U.S. News, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing), and its business school.RankingsU.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Penn #6 (tied with California Institute of Technology) for undergraduate education in 2009 rankings, fourth in the Ivy League behind Harvard, Princeton and Yale.USNews.com: America's Best Colleges 2008: National Universities: Top Schools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Penn was previously ranked #4 by U.S. News in 2005 and sixth in 2006.

At the undergraduate level, Penn's business and nursing schools have maintained their #1, 2 or 3 rankings since U.S. News began reviewing such programs. Wharton's undergraduate program has been ranked number one by BusinessWeek also. In the School of Engineering, top departments are bioengineering (typically ranked in the top 5 by U.S. News), mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and nanotechnology. The school is also strong in select areas of computer science and artificial intelligence.Graduate and professional programsPenn's graduate schools are among the most distinguished schools in their respective fields. Penn's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is generally regarded as one of the top schools in the nation (see 1995 rankings by the National Research Council). A study updated the NRC rankings and adjusted them for faculty size and also factored out reputational surveys (stating that such surveys were lagging indicators of actual academic quality). That study, titled, "The Rise of American Research Universities: Elites and Challengers in the Postwar Era", ranked Penn's arts, humanities and sciences departments seventh in the US.Among its professional schools, the schools of business (Wharton School), architecture and urban planning (School of Design), communications (Annenberg School for Communication), medicine (School of Medicine), dentistry (School of Dental Medicine), nursing and veterinary medicine rank in the top five nationally (see U.S. News, National Research Council, Planetizen, DesignIntelligence magazines). Penn's law school is ranked seventh and the social work and education schools are ranked in the top twelve (U.S. News).CampusMuch of Penn's architecture was designed by the architecture firm of Cope &amp; Stewardson, whose principal architects combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style. The present core campus covers over 269 acres (~1 km²) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City district. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. Recent improvements to the surrounding neighborhood include the opening of several restaurants, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus.In 2007, Penn acquired about 35 acres between the campus and the Schuylkill River (the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby 24-acre site owned by the United States Postal Service). Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south. It encompasses the main U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets (the retail post office at the east end of the building will remain open), the Postal Annex between Chestnut Street and Walnut Street, the Vehicle Maintenance Facility Garage along Chestnut Street and the 14 acres of surface parking south of Walnut Street. Over the next decade, the site will become the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. Penn also plans new connections between the campus and the city, including a pedestrian bridge.The University also owns the 92-acre Morris Arboretum in Chestnut Hill in northwestern Philadelphia, the official arboretum of the state of Pennsylvania. Penn also owns the  New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its Veterinary School. Located near Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.Penn borders Drexel University and is near the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia (USP). Also nearby is the University City High School.===Libraries=== , also referred to as the Furness Library or simply the Fine Arts Library]] Penn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Louis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. More than 250 years later, it has grown into a system of 15 libraries (13 are on the contiguous campus) with 400 FTE employees and a total operating budget of more than $48 million. The library system holds 5.7 million book and serial volumes. It subscribes to 44,000 print serials and e-journals.Penn's Libraries, with associated school or subject area:Annenberg (School of Communications), located in the Annenberg SchoolBiddle (Law), located in the Law SchoolBiomedical, located adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical SchoolCenter for Advanced Judaic Studies, located on Walnut Street at Washington SquareChemistry, located in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry BuildingDentalEngineeringFine Arts, located within the Fisher Fine Arts Library, designed by Frank Furness.Lippincott (Wharton School), located on the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library CenterMath/Physics/Astronomy, located on the third floor of David Rittenhouse LaboratoryMuseum (Anthropology)Rare Books and ManuscriptsVan Pelt-Dietrich Library Center (Humanities and Social Sciences)Lea Library, located within the Van Pelt LibraryVeterinaryHigh Density StorageThe University Museum The University Museum, as it is commonly called, was founded in 1887.

Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur. The Museum also has a strong collection of Chinese artifacts. Features of its Beaux-Arts building include a dramatic rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus. UPM's scientific division, MASCA, focuses on the application of modern scientific techniques to aid the interpretation of archaeological contexts.The Institute of Contemporary Art based on Penn's campus, showcases various exhibitions of art throughout the year.ResidencesStouffer College HouseFisher Hassenfeld College HouseRodin College House (formerly Hamilton College House)Harrison College HouseHarnwell College HouseHill College HouseDuBois College HouseGregory College HouseKings Court English College HouseWare College HouseRiepe College HouseSansom Place East / WestWithin the college houses Penn has nearly forty themed residential programs which bring together students with common interests ranging from science and technology (STWING) to world cinema.Many of the nearby homes on 40-42nd are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after freshman year.Student life  Of those accepted for admission to the Class of 2009, 39.2 percent are Asian, Hispanic, African, or Native American. Women comprise 51.3 percent of all students currently enrolled. A total of 2,440 international students applied for admission to Penn's undergraduate schools for the Class of 2008, and 489 (20%) were accepted. More than 13% of the first year class are international students. Of the international students accepted to the Class of 2008, 15.8% were from Africa and the Middle East, 48.1% from Asia, 0.4% from Australia and the Pacific, 11.7% from Canada and Mexico, 10% from Central/South America and the Caribbean, and 14.1% from Europe. Penn had 4,192 international students enrolled at all levels in Fall 2004. The Philomathean Society of the University of Pennsylvania, founded in 1813, is the oldest continually-existing student group in the United States. The Daily Pennsylvanian has been published since 1885, and is among the top college papers in the country, regularly winning Pacemaker and CSPA Gold Circle awards. The Pennsylvania Punch Bowl is one of the nation's oldest and most acclaimed humor magazines. The student-run TV station UTV13 is the oldest college TV station in the country. The University of Pennsylvania Glee Club is one of the oldest continually-operating collegiate choruses in the United States, having been founded in 1862. Its best-known and longest-serving director was Bruce Montgomery, who led the club from 1956 until 2000. The Mask and Wig Club is the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country.The University's Political Science Department is known for publishing a semesterly scholarly journal of undergraduate research called "Sound Politicks." The journal is student-run and is widely noted for the originality and quality of the articles it publishes. It accepts submissions from Penn students year round. There are many such journals across the university, with the oldest being the Pennsylvania Triangle founded in 1899 to cover Science and Technology.The University of Pennsylvania Band has been a fixture of student life on campus since 1897. The Penn Band performs at football and basketball games as well as University functions throughout the year and has a current membership of approximately 80 students. Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games are: Fight On Pennsylvania.AthleticsThe first athletic team at Penn was its cricket team.Kieran, John (1932), "Sports of the Times," The New York Times, October 8, 1932, p. 22. In the sport of football, Penn first fielded a team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.Rottenberg, Dan (1985) "Fight On, Pennsylvania" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 25.Penn's sports teams are called the Quakers. They participate in the Ivy League and Division I (Division I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades they often have been league champions in football (12 times from 1982 to 2003) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). Penn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s Penn's famed coach George Woodruff introduced the quarternick kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904 Penn was generally regarded the national champion of collegiate football.Rottenberg, Dan (1985) "Fight On, Pennsylvania" Trustees of University of Pennsylvania pg. 28, 33–34. The achievements of two of Penn's outstanding players from that era—John Heisman and John Outland—are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.    In addition, each year the [[Bednarik Award]] is given to college football's best defensive player. Chuck Bednarik (Class of 1949) was a three-time All-American center/linebacker, and starred on the 1947 team, generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the '47 squad boasted four-time All-American tackle George Savitsky and three time All-American halfback Skip Minisi. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, as was their coach, George Munger (a star running back at Penn in the early '30s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the NFL's last 60-minute man. He was elected to the NFL Hall of Fame in 1969. [[Image:FranklinFieldPenn.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Franklin Field ([[American football|football]])]]Harold Stassen, during his presidency of the institution from 1948 to 1953, attempted to recultivate Penn's heyday of big-time college football, but the effort lacked support and was short-lived.Penn basketball is steeped in tradition.
