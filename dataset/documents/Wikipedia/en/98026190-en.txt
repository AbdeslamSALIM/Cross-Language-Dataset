Like all squirrels, it is a member of the rodent order.DescriptionThe European ground squirrel grows to a length of approximately 20 cm and a weight of between 200 and 400 g. It is a diurnal animal, living in colonies of individual burrows in pastures or grassy embankments. The squirrels emerge during the day to feed upon seeds, plant shoots and roots or flightless invertebrates. The colonies maintain sentinels who whistle at the sight of a predator, bringing the pack scurrying back to safety.The European ground squirrel hibernates between autumn and March, depending on the climate. In preparation they will build up reserves of brown fat during the late summer.In early summer, between 5 and 8 cubs are born in one litter.DistributionIt is to be found throughout eastern Europe from southern Ukraine, to Asia Minor, the Czech Republic, Greece and north as far as Poland.References Listed as Vulnerable (VU A1c v2.3)Category:Ground squirrels Category:Mammals of Europe Category:Mammals of Asiabar:Eiropäisches Ziesl  bg:Лалугер cs:Sysel obecný de:Europäischer Ziesel es:Spermophilus citellus fr:Souslik d'Europe it:Spermophilus citellus lt:Pilkasis staras hu:Közönséges ürge nl:Siesel pl:Suseł moręgowany ro:Popândău ru:Суслик европейский sk:Syseľ pasienkový fi:Siiseli sv:Sisel
