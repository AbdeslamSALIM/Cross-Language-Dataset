The music is a composition by Bilegiin Damdinsüren (1919 - 1991) and Luvsanyamts Murdorj (1915 - 1996), the lyrics were written by Tsendiin Damdinsüren (1908 - 1988).Over the twentieth century, Mongolia had several national anthems. The first one was used between 1924 and 1950. The second between 1950 and 1962, and a third one between 1961 and 1991. Since 1991, most of the anthem of 1950 is used again, but the second verse (praising Lenin, Stalin, Sükhbaatar, and Choibalsan) has been removed. On July 6th, 2006 the lyrics were revised by the Mongolian Parliament to commemorate Genghis Khan.Lyrics of current anthemCategory:National anthems Category:National symbols of Mongolia Category:Mongolian musiccs:Mongolská hymna de:Nationalhymne der Mongolei es:Himno Nacional (Mongolia) fr:Hymne national de la Mongolie ko:몽골의 국가 he:המנון מונגוליה kk:Моңғолия әнұраны lt:Mongolijos himnas mk:Национална химна на Монголија mn:Монгол улсын төрийн дуулал nl:Bügd Nairamdakh Mongol ja:モンゴルの国歌 pl:Hymn Mongolii pt:Hino nacional da Mongólia ru:Гимн Монголии sk:Bügd Najramdach Mongol fi:Bügd Nairamdah Mongol sv:Bügd Najramdach Mongol th:เพลงชาติมองโกเลีย vi:Bügd Nairamdakh Mongol
