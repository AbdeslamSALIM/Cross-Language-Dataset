.]] "Panamax" ships are of the maximum dimensions that will fit through the locks of the Panama Canal. This size is determined by the dimensions of the lock chambers, and the depth of the water in the canal. Panamax is a significant factor in the design of cargo ships, with many ships being built to exactly the maximum allowable size.DimensionsPanamax is determined principally by the dimensions of the canal's lock chambers, each of which is 33.53&nbsp;metres (110&nbsp;ft) wide by 320.0&nbsp;metres (1050&nbsp;ft) long, and 25.9&nbsp;metres (85&nbsp;ft) deep. The usable length of each lock chamber is 304.8&nbsp;metres (1000&nbsp;ft). The available water depth in the lock chambers varies, but the shallowest depth is at the south sill of the Pedro Miguel Locks and is 12.55&nbsp;metres (41.2&nbsp;ft) at a Miraflores Lake level of 16.61&nbsp;metres (54&nbsp;feet 6&nbsp;in). The height of the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa is the limiting factor on a vessel's overall height.in October 1945.]] The maximum dimensions allowed for a ship transiting the canal are:[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/maritime/notices/n01-05.pdf Vessel Requirements], from the Panama Canal AuthorityLength: 294.1&nbsp;metres (965&nbsp;ft)Beam (width): 32.3&nbsp;metres (106&nbsp;ft)Draft: 12.0&nbsp;metres (39.5&nbsp;ft) in tropical fresh water (the salinity and temperature of water affect its density, and hence how deeply a ship will sit in the water)Air draft: 57.91&nbsp;metres (190&nbsp;ft) measured from the waterline to the vessel's highest pointA Panamax cargo ship would typically have a displacement of around 65,000 tons.[http://www.lr.org/Publications/Info+30+Ship+sizes.htm Modern ship size definitions], from Lloyd's registerExceptionsVessels up to 62.5&nbsp;metres (205&nbsp;ft) in height may pass by prior approval, co-ordinated with low tide at the Bridge of the Americas.On an exceptional basis, vessels up to 32.61&nbsp;metres (107&nbsp;ft) in beam may be permitted to transit, subject to additional draft constraints.Vessels with structures extending beyond the maximum length and/or beam above the level of the lock walls may be permitted transit subject to inspection and approval.During an exceptionally dry season, when the water level in Lake Gatún is low, the maximum permitted draft may be reduced.The longest ship ever to transit was the San Juan Prospector, now Marcona Prospector, an ore-bulk-oil carrier that is 296.57&nbsp;metres (973&nbsp;ft) long, with a beam of 32.3&nbsp;metres (106&nbsp;ft).[http://rainforest.montclair.edu/pwebrf/rainforest/Region/panama.html Background of the Panama Canal], Montclair State University The widest ships to transit are the two North Carolina class battleships,  and , which have beams of 33.025&nbsp;metres (108&nbsp;ft 3.875&nbsp;inches).Battleships, United States Battleships in World War II, by Robert O.

A Panamax ship is a tight fit that requires precise control of the vessel in the locks, possibly resulting in longer lock time, and requiring that these ships be transited in daylight. Because the largest ships cannot pass safely within the Gaillard Cut, the canal effectively operates an alternating one-way system for these ships.Post-Panamax shipstransiting the Panama Canal. Some containers have been offloaded and are transported by the Panama Railway over the isthmus to allow acceptable draft.]]Post-Panamax or over-Panamax are the terms used to describe ships larger than Panamax that do not fit in the current canal.Many modern ships are far larger than canal limits and cannot use the canal. This is the case for supertankers and the largest modern container ships. U.S. Navy supercarriers are also in the post-Panamax class; the ''Nimitz'' class aircraft carriers are 333&nbsp;metres (1092&nbsp;ft) long overall with a beam of 41&nbsp;metres (134&nbsp;ft), while the flight deck is 76.8&nbsp;metres (252&nbsp;ft) wide.ExpansionAs early as the 1930s, new locks were proposed for the Panama Canal to ease congestion and to allow larger ships to pass.On October 22, 2006, the Panama Canal Authority (with the support of the Electoral Tribunal) held a referendum for Panamanian citizens to vote on the Panama Canal expansion project. The expansion was approved by a wide margin, with support from about 78% of the electorate. It is estimated that this expansion will be completed by 2014. The projected cost is $5.3 billion; this sum is expected to be recovered within 11 years.After expansion, the Panama Canal is expected to be able to handle vessels up to  in size; currently, it can only handle vessels up to about .
