Like Arthur Seaton, the anti-hero of Sillitoe's first novel Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, his father worked in the Raleigh factory.He served in the Royal Air Force ,where he was a wireless operator . After returning to England from Malaya he was discovered to have Tuberculosis and he spent sixteen months in an RAF hospital.Pegasos - A literature related site in Finland,Pensioned off at 21 on 45 shillings at week, he lived in France and Spain for seven years in an attempt to recover.Whilst living in Majorca, with his lover, American poet Ruth Fainlight, in 1955, and in contact with the poet Robert Graves, Sillitoe commenced work on Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, which was published in 1958. Influenced in part by the stripped-down prose of Hemingway, the book conveys the attitudes and situation of a young factory worker faced with the inevitable end of his youthful philandering. As with Look Back in Anger and Room at the Top, the novel's real subject was the disillusionment of post-war Britain, and the lack of opportunities for the working class. It was adapted as a film by Karel Reisz in 1960, with Albert Finney as Arthur Seaton.His story The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, which concerns the rebellion of a borstal boy with a talent for running, won the Hawthornden Prize in 1959. It was also adapted into a film, this time directed by Tony Richardson, and starring Tom Courtenay (1962).In 1990, he was awarded an honorary degree from Nottingham Trent University. The city's older, prestigious Russell Group university, The University of Nottingham, also awarded Sillitoe an honorary DLitt degree in 1994, and in 2006 his best known play was staged at the University's Lakeside Arts theatre in an in-house production.Sillitoe has written many more novels, and several volumes of poetry, listed below. His 1995 autobiography Life Without Armour was critically acclaimed on publication, and offers a view into his squalid childhood.In 2007 Gadfly in Russia was published an account of his travels in Russia spanning 40 years. In 2008 London Books republished A Start in Life as part of their London Classics series and to mark the author's 80th birthday.He married Ruth Fainlight, lives in London and has two children.NovelsSaturday Night and Sunday Morning  London: Allen, 1958; New York: Knopf, 1959; new edition with an introduction by Sillitoe, commentary and notes by David Craig,In the Longman edition 1976 there is a sequence of Nottingham photographs, and stills from the film, HarlowThe Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner  London: Allen, 1959; New York: Knopf, 1960.The General London: Allen, 1960; New York: Knopf, 1961.Key to the Door  London: Allen, 1961; New York: Knopf, 1962; reprinted, with a new preface by Sillitoe, London: Allen, 1978.Road To Volgograd London: Allen, 1964; New York: Knopf, 1964.The Death of William Posters  London: Allen, 1965; New York: Knopf, 1965.The City Adventures of Marmalade Jim London: Macmillan, 1967; Toronto: Macmillan, 1967; revised edition, illustrated by Shelagh McGee, London: Robson, 1977.A Tree on Fire London: Macmillan, 1967; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1968.''A Sillitoe Selection: Eight Short Stories, edited by Michael Morland '' London: Longmans Group, 1968.A Start in Life London: Allen, 1970; New York: Scribners, 1971.Travels in Nihilon  London: Allen, 1971; New York: Scribners, 1972.Raw Material London: Allen, 1972; New York: Scribners, 1973; revised edition, London: Pan Books, 1974; further revised, London: Star Books, 1978; further revised, London: Allen, 1979.Men, Women and Children London: Allen, 1973; New York: Scribners, 1974.From Canto Two of The Rats Wittersham, Kent: Alan Sillitoe, 1973.Somme London: Steam Press, 1974.
