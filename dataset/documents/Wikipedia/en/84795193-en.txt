The population was 5,346 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Chippewa County.HistoryDuring the 1700s, Europeans established a fur-trading post near the rivers and traded with Native Americans in the area. Later, Montevideo became an agricultural center.On the edge of Montevideo, just off U.S. Route 212, stands the Camp Release State Monument. The Minnesota River Valley and Montevideo played an integral part in the United States - Dakota Conflict of 1862. At this site, in the fall of 1862, the Dakota tribes surrendered and released 269 captives to Colonel Henry Sibley. The Camp Release Monument was dedicated on July 4, 1894.Today, the region faces the challenges resulting from declining population and dramatic changes in the rural economy. In response, the city applied for and was named Minnesota's first Star City -- a state program that provides the framework and encouragement local governments need to play a stronger role in economic development.In 2004, the city was honored with the presentation of the National Civic League's All-America City Award, which is given to only ten cities a year. The award is the oldest and most respected community recognition program in the nation and recognizes communities whose citizens work together to identify and tackle community-wide challenges and achieve uncommon results.The city is also home to a burgeoning artists community, and serves as a hub to the annual Meander -- Upper Minnesota River Art Crawl.Montevideo’s sister city is Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1949 a statue of José Artigas, Uruguay's leader of independence, was given to the Minnesota community by Uruguayan citizens. Each year Montevideo marks Fiesta Days in honor of its association with its sister city.GeographyMontevideo is located where the Minnesota and Chippewa rivers converge, approximately 140 miles west of Minneapolis at the junction of U.S. Routes 59 and 212 with Minnesota State Highways 7 and 29.The surrounding topography is dominated by farmland and prairies, as well as river valleys with many scenic overlooks and small bluffs.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 11.8km² (4.5 sq&amp;nbsp;mi). 4.5&nbsp;square miles (11.6&nbsp;km²) of it is land and 0.1&nbsp;square miles (0.1&nbsp;km²) of it (1.10%) is water.Montevideo is the site of an unusual natural phenomenon known as a "magic hill" or "gravity hill". The hill is located on the on-ramp to Hwy 7 from North 1st street.Montevideo means, "I see the Mountain." The name originated from the exploration of South America, when a Portuguese sailor who had not seen land for three months and from the crow's nest called out, "I see the Mountain!" off the coast of modern-day Uruguay. The city in Minnesota is named because of the hill the railroad saw while approaching the city from the south which is a shoreline of an ancient river. Later Montevideo, Uruguay was conquered by the Spanish so the Sister City of Montevideo is of Spanish influence and not Portuguese. There was another city across the river called Chippewa City (so it was a twin city at one time in early days) but it was incorporated into the city of Montevideo.DemographicsAs of the census of 2000, there were 5,346 people, 2,353 households, and 1,444 families residing in the city.
