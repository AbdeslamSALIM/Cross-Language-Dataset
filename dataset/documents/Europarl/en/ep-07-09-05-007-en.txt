      (Before the vote)
    
    
      
        Mr President, concerning declarations of interest, could you explain to me whether, in the vote on the next three reports on milk, the dairy farmers among us should declare an interest and refrain from voting?
      
      
        (Applause)
      
    
    
      
        Obviously, Mr Titley, we proceed on the basis of declarations signed by individual MEPs with reference to conflicts of interest at the time of taking on the mandate and with reference to individual parliamentary procedures.
