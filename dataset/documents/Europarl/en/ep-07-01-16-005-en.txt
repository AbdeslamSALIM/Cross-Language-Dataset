        The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament.
      
      
        I have received notice of the following candidacies:
      
      
        Adam Bielan
      
      
        Luigi Cocilovo
      
      
        Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou
      
      
        Mario Mauro
      
      
        Edward McMillan-Scott
      
      
        Luisa Morgantini
      
      
        Pierre Moscovici
      
      
        Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez
      
      
        Gérard Onesta
      
      
        Mechtild Rothe
      
      
        Manuel António dos Santos
      
      
        Marek Siwiec
      
      
        Alejo Vidal Quadras
      
      
        Diana Wallis
      
      
        The candidates have informed me that they each accept their nomination as candidates.
      
      
        Since the number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacant positions, the groups will not be consulted, and I propose that the election be by acclamation in accordance with Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, albeit with a subsequent vote to determine their seniority.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
      
        I therefore declare the candidates whose names I have just read out to be Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament.
      
      
        I congratulate them all on their election.
      
      
        The next item is the determination of the Vice-Presidents' seniority.
        Since all we need to do is to determine their seniority, qualified majority is not required for this vote, as they have all already been elected.
      
      
        The voting slips are being distributed, so the voting is now open.
