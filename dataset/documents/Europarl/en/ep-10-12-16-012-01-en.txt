        (RO) Mr President, before we proceed to the vote, I would like to request on behalf of my group that when we vote on the situation of Eritrean refugees, we abandon the roll call vote for a joint resolution and request a roll call vote for the resolution proposed by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats).
      
    
    
      
        You have heard your fellow Member's request.
        If there are no objections, we shall proceed as suggested.
        I see no objections.
