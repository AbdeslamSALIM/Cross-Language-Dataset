      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (ES) Mr President, as regards the vote on Zimbabwe, I am here for the vote but will not participate.
        I would like it to go on record that my reason for not taking part is because, in the event, I have decided not to do so.
        However I would like the record to show that I was here at the plenary.
