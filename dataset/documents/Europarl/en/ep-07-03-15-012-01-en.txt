      - Before the vote on recitals B and C
    
    
      
        Mr President, a couple of small but important wording errors have managed to creep into the resolution.
        I propose to correct them as follows: in recital B, to replace the word 'authors' with the word 'perpetrators', and in recital C, to replace the words 'intellectual authors' with the word 'instigators'.
      
    
    
      
        Are there any objections to the inclusion of these oral amendments?
      
      
        (The oral amendments were accepted)
