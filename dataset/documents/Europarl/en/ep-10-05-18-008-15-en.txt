        (DE) Madam President, it is a little unusual, but I must inform my own group that our voting list for the Tr√ºpel report is not correct in the form that we have laid it down.
        There has been a misunderstanding.
        We reject all the amendments, except our own.

        It looks as though the leadership of your group is well aware of the situation.
