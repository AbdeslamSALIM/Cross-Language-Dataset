      Discharge 2005: Section III, Commission (vote)
    
    
      - Report: Garriga Polledo
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to table an oral amendment intended to remove two footnotes in paragraphs 37 and 108 of the report, on pages 16 and 25 of the English version.
        This is because both footnotes are redundant and contribute nothing to the report.
        I would call upon all of the groups in the House to accept this oral amendment, please.
      
      
        (The oral amendments were accepted)
