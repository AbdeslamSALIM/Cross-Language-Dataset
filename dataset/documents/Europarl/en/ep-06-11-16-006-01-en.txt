      EU-Mauritania fisheries agreement (vote)
    
    
      - after the vote:
    
    
      
        (FR) Mr President, since we had some difficulties last time with roll-call votes on a show of hands, I would like to know why we have had a roll-call vote today, which is not even indicated on my voting list.
      
    
    
      
        Because a political group requested one.
