        on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, while we welcome the idea that there should also be 'high standards of democracy', on behalf of my group I propose that the phrase 'and free-market principles' should be retained.

        Mr President, in Amendment 26, second part, second sentence, I should like to replace the word 'could' with 'should'.
