        Mr President, it is a ludicrous state of affairs to commence voting at 12.40 on 48 pages of votes.
        You, Sir, have been doing remarkably well in organising Parliament so that we vote at proper times in order to deal with these large voting lists.
        We should have started at 11.00, not at 12.40.
        I urge you to revert to type and ensure we do not do this again.
      
      
        (Applause)
