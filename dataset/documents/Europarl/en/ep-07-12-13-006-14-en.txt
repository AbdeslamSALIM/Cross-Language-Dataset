      - Motion for a resolution
    
    
      
        Before we proceed to the vote on the last report, allow me to dedicate this last vote to a fellow Member who will be leaving us in a few days' time and who has done a wonderful job for us here, at the European Parliament, and for the whole of Europe.
        It is, of course, Jean-Louis Bourlanges.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
      
        Mr Bourlanges, I hope that the warmth of this applause tells you, more than any speech, how much we will miss you.
        We wish you all the best.
