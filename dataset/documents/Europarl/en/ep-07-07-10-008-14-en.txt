      Labour force sample survey (vote)
    
    
      Report: Jan Andersson
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (SV) I just want to direct Members' attention to the fact that Amendments 1 to 3 have been withdrawn in order to facilitate an agreement with the Council at first reading.
        Members of the committee have been informed of this measure.
      
    
    
      
        I therefore move straight to the single vote.
