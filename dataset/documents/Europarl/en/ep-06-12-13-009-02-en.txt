      The institutional aspects of the European Union's capacity to integrate new Member States (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on Amendment 8:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - Mr President, on Amendment 8 which has been tabled by the PSE Group, the version we will follow is the French original language version which refers to the 'Lisbon Strategy'.
        The English version talks about the 'social model', and of course the PSE Group did not mean that.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was adopted)
      
    
    
      
        That concludes the vote.
