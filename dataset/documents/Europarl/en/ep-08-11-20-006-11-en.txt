      Response of the European Union to the deteriorating situation in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on Amendment 1:
    
    
      
        (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there is agreement among the political groups to delete the word 'special' when talking about European special forces.
        Therefore: 'delete the word "special"'.
