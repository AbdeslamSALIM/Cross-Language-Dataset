      European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism and future actions (vote)
    
    
      Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (EL) Madam President, the procedural issue concerns the vote on Amendment 2.
        If Amendment 2 is passed, the original paragraph 14 lapses, because Amendment 2 applies to paragraph 14.
      
    
    
      
        (DE) Madam President, as the coordinator for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I would like to make a comment on Amendment 6.
        I would like to call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment 6, in contrast to what appears on our voting recommendations.
        This is a mistake in the list.
        We should vote for Amendment 6 and this is likely to clarify the way in which we will vote now in a decisive situation.
