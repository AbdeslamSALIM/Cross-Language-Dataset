        (CS) Mr Chairman, I would just like to ask whether today's special regime will be repeated or whether it was really only today's extravaganza.
        Can you give me an answer, please?
      
    
    
      
        As I understand it, this was an exceptional situation as regards the number of applications.
        I hope that this situation will not be repeated.
