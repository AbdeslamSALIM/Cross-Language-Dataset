      Discrimination against young women and girls in the field of education (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on recital G:
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, I have just a brief statement to make on the amendment.
      
      
        (PL) The report refers to many negative aspects of so-called feminism and segregation, and I therefore consider it is worth highlighting a positive example.
        Marie Skłodowska-Curie could serve as an inspiring example of a woman, mother, wife, scientist, Nobel prize-winner and exemplary European.
        That is why I am surprised that Mrs Flasarová, the rapporteur, is opposed to Marie Skłodowska-Curie and I cannot understand why.
        Is it a case of woman against woman?
        Is it politically and psychologically correct?
      
      
        - Before the vote on the amended motion for a resolution:
      
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (CS) Thank you for giving me the floor, Mr President.
        I feel that in terms of women who have made a significant contribution to our European Union and to Europe, there are too many to name.
        I therefore feel that it is not only Marie Curie-Skłodowska, a woman for whom I have great admiration, who should be on the list.
        This report, in my view, deals with the issues that have been mentioned here.
        Thank you.
