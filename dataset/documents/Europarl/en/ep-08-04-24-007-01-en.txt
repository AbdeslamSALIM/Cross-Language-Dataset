      Commission Annual policy strategy 2009 (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote on paragraph 24:
    
    
      
        Madam President, very briefly, two days ago we adopted a policy action at EU level on organ donation and transplantation.
        I thought this was important enough to include it in this motion for a resolution with a suitable short reference as indicated in the voting papers.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was not accepted)
      
      
        - Before the vote on paragraph 37:
      
    
    
      
        (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am asking for the three words 'independent impact assessment' to be included after 'better regulation'.
        That was the wording in the original draft but, for reasons I am unaware of, it seems to have fallen by the wayside.
        As far as I can determine, the oral amendment has the approval of the other groups.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was accepted)
