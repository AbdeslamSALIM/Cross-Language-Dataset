      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I should like to thank the Members who have played their part in this report's coming into being.
        In committee, we agreed on 19 compromise amendments.
        The majority in committee was a clear one, of 35 to 3, and I hope for a similar confirmation from the plenary.
      
      
        - Before the vote on Amendment 26:
      
    
    
      
        Mr President, I would just like to point out that a mistake has been made which we would like to correct.
        It is in paragraph 2a.
        It starts 'Regrets the agreement reached on the financial framework 2007-2013, in particular the reductions in the structural funds from 0.47%'.
        It should be '0.41%'.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was accepted)
