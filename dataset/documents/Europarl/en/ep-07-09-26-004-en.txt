        (DE) Mr President, President PÃ¶ttering asked us yesterday to be on time for the vote.
        Many of us tried, but the lifts here in the building are not capable of bringing our colleagues down from the upper floors in time.

        Well, Mr Rack, do not worry: we did begin again at exactly 12 noon and it is now 12.04 p.m., so we are not doing too badly.
