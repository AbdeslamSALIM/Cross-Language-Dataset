        In English the text reads: 'Urges the EU to take a firm stance in upholding the democracy and human rights clause ... examining the possibility of setting up a specific human rights dialogue with Pakistan'.

        - After the vote on Amendment 52:
      
    
    
      
        Mr President, I understood that a request had been put in for an oral amendment by myself through the ALDE Group secretariat.
        Could you kindly check your notes?
      
    
    
      
        It might have been requested, but it is not in my papers.
        Therefore we have to proceed as usual.
