      The particular situation of women in prison and the impact of the imprisonment of parents on social and family life (
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (ES) Madam President, before we begin the vote on this report I must say that along with the rapporteur, Mrs Panayotopoulos, and the other rapporteurs, I have an oral amendment to propose regarding the first amendment to paragraph 6.
      
      
        It is to remove the last two words of the amendment, I shall say them in English: (EN) 'contraception and abortion';
        (ES) this would obviate the need for voting on the second part of the amendment in question.
      
      
        (Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
      
      
        - Before the vote on Amendment 7:
      
    
    
      
        Madam President, this is about a change in the phrase 'detention of girls and boys'; and the age is changed too, to 18 instead of 17.
      
      
        (Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
