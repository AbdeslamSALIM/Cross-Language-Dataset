        Mr President, we, the co-authors, all agreed to a compromise yesterday that reads as follows: 'Notes the growing illegal trade in all Member States in counterfeit and pirated products imported from third countries, which are threatening the competitiveness of European SMEs'.
      
      
        We authors all agree to this.
