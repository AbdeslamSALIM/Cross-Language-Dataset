        (FR) Mr President, I should simply like to draw the translation services' attention to the quality of the French translation.
        The French word for supervision is supervision, and not contr√¥le or surveillance, hedge funds are fonds alternatifs and parliamentary committee is commission parlementaire.
      
    
    
      
        We take good note of those corrections for the sake of the purity of the French language.
