      Situation in the Horn of Africa (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (PT) I would like to propose a new paragraph before paragraph 1 that states as follows:
      
      
        'Notes that the current situation in the countries of the Horn of Africa is not in conformity with the essential elements of cooperation stated in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement;'.
      
      
        This is a sentence that was already in the report that our three colleagues, who visited the region, recently gave to us.
