      International Financial Reporting Standards and the governance of the International Accounting Standards Board (
    
    
      - Before the vote on Amendment 8:
    
    
      
        Madam President, this is quite a simple amendment.
        It is to delete the word 'legitimacy' in the phrase 'may lack transparency, legitimacy and accountability' and corresponds with a similar deletion by the rapporteur in Amendment 1.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was not accepted)
