      - After the vote:
    
    
      
        (DE) Madam President, can it be that those who in recent days have been calling persistently for roll-call votes have not been doing so this afternoon because most of them are absent?
      
      
        (Applause)
      
    
    
      
        - They had all been informed, Mr Posselt.
