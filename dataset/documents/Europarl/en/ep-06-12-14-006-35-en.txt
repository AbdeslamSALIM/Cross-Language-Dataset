      A European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy (vote)
    
    
      Before the vote on Amendment 10:
    
    
      
        Mr President, in this amendment, one phrase was deleted from the original text which I believe is important - it is supported by the Socialists and the Liberals - and which reads as follows: 'strengthening laws with regard to competition policies'.
        We should add that.
        It then makes more sense to vote for the whole paragraph.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was not accepted)
