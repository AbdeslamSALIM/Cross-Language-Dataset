      - Before the vote on Amendment 79:
    
    
      
        Mr President, I would like to propose reversing the order of the vote.
        Amendment 79 is broader and Amendment 163 restricts Amendment 79, so Amendment 79 is the most far-reaching.
        Therefore we would like to have that first.
      
    
    
      
        The reason it has been placed in this order is the addition of the word 'severe' in Amendment 163.
      
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - Mr President, I am happy to support the reversal that is proposed by the PSE Group.
