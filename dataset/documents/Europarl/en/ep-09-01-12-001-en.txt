        I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 18 December 2008.
      
      
        I would like to wish you all, ladies and gentlemen, a Happy New Year and a successful 2009 which will hopefully bring us nearer to European unity.
        May we be successful in promoting peace in the world.
        I would now like to make a statement.
