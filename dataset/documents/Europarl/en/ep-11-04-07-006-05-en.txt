      Before the vote on Amendment 2:
    
    
      
        (RO) Madam President, I would like us to replace:
      
      
        'Urges the people of Iceland to support this agreement' with 'Encourages the people of Iceland to support this agreement'.
      
    
    
      
        Mr Preda, I am sorry but I think you have read the wrong oral amendment.
        You have two, could you try the other one.
        That would be helpful.
      
    
    
      
        (RO) Madam President, I would like us to replace in Amendment 2:
      
      
        'Enter into constructive talks' with 'Continue the constructive talks'.
      
    
    
      
        Madam President, I urge all Members not to adopt the amendment, and I urge Iceland to protect its fish stocks ...
