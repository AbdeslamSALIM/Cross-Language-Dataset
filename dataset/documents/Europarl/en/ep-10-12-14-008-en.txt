  
    
      Welcome
    
    
      
        I am delighted to inform you that there is an official delegation in the Chamber made up of religious leaders, in particular, from the Christian world in the Middle East, from Iraq and Lebanon.
      
      
        (Applause)
      
      
        We are aware of the difficult situation in the region for many Christian communities, and consequently we are delighted to express our support.
        You are therefore very welcome to the European Parliament.
