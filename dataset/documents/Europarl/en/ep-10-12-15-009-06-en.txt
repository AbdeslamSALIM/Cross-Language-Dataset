      Presentation of the Commission work programme for 2011 (
    
    
      - Before the vote on Amendment 7:
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, I would like the end of this amendment to be reworded.
        The wording is very negative and I would like it to read as follows:
      
      
        The initiative "Youth on the Move‚Äù underlines the importance of the above mentioned programmes.
      
    
    
      
        Mr President, I just want to say that we are withdrawing Amendment 14.
      
    
    
      
        (DE) Mr President, this is about the Union for the Mediterranean.
        We know that it has currently come to a standstill and that we want to revive it.
        The wording does not express this clearly enough, so we would like to insert the following text:
      
      
        The current stalemate of the Union for the Mediterranean.
      
      
        (DE) I know that there is a contradiction here.
        Perhaps another wording would be possible, but the wording we are proposing is:
      
      
        The current stalemate of the Union for the Mediterranean.
