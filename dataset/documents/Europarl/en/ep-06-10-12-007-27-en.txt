      EU economic and trade relations with Mercosur (vote)
    
    
      - After the vote:
    
    
      
        (ES) Mr President, before moving on to the final item, on behalf of many Members of this Parliament I would like to express my profound sadness and discontent.
      
      
        By not voting on a resolution on the death of the Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya today, this Parliament is, I believe, making a political and human mistake.
      
      
        I hope that the honourable Members, particularly the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, understand this message.
