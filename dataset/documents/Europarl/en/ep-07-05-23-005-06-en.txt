      The exclusion of health services from the Services Directive (vote)
    
    
      - Report: Vergnaud
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am taking the floor simply to point out to the House that there has been an error.
      
      
        Indeed, as the same sentence appears in three different paragraphs, Parliament's services have rightly deleted paragraphs 47 and 53 from the report, since this sentence appears in its entirety in paragraph 51.
      
      
        I simply wished to inform my fellow Members of this matter.
