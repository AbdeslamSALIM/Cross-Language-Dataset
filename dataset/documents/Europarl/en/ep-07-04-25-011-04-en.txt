      Investigation of accidents (vote)
    
    
      - Kohlíček report
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to change the order of the votes.
        With regard to recital 11, it would be better to vote in the first instance on Amendment 26, because it is more extensive than Amendment 1.
      
    
    
      
        The voting list is established in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, but if the House has no objections, we will do as the rapporteur wishes.
