      EU Election Observation Missions (
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        (DE) Madam President, in consultation with the two rapporteurs, I propose the following addition:
      
      
        'Pays tribute to the participation of observers from third countries, such as Switzerland, Norway and Canada, in EU electoral observation missions'.
      
      
        (DE) Those concerned had requested that, and I think this encourages them to take part again next time.
      
      
        (Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
