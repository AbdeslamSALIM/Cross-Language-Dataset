      Family life and study (vote)
    
    
      - Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou report
    
    
      - Before the vote on paragraph 24
    
    
      
        (SV) I have an oral amendment to the second clause of paragraph 24.
        I shall read it in Swedish: Parliament 'calls, furthermore, on the Member States to count maternity and parental leave during a period of study towards women's/men's aggregate time spent in work and their retirement pension entitlement periods, with a view to meeting fully the goal of genuine gender equality'.
        The word 'men's' should, then, be added.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was accepted)
      
      
        President. - That concludes the vote.
