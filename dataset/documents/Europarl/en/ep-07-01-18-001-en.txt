      (The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)
    
    
      
        I declare the session open.
      
      
        I am very pleased to have been elected: this is my first time as President of this House.
        I regard it as absolutely crucial and highly symbolic that I am opening this session with a debate on gender parity and equality.
        It must be said that our Parliament has made some significant progress, and I hope that it continues to do so.
