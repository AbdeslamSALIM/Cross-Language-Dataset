      China's policy and its effects on Africa (
    
    
      - Before the vote on Amendment 5:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, I wish to propose an amendment to Article 5 which involves a minor alteration to the text.
        The current text reads:
      
      
        'calls on the EU to encourage the creation of an African Partnership Forum engaging all major donors and investors;'
      
      
        (PT) and, following the amendment that I propose, it will read:
      
      
        'calls on the EU to ensure that the African Partnership Forum engages all major donors and investors, namely China;'.
      
      
        (PT) This amendment stems from the fact that we have realised that the African Partnership Forum has just been created and this is therefore a minor alteration which reflects the current situation.
        It was communicated to all colleagues and shadow rapporteurs and I have not been informed of any objections.
      
      
        (Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
