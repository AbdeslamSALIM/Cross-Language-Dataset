      - Before voting commenced:
    
    
      
        on behalf of the ALDE group. - Mr President, this is just a simple amendment that has been agreed with the main political groups.
        It is to replace in the PPE-DE Group amendment the word 'by' Turkey to the word 'with' Turkey.
        I understand that this is acceptable to all the main groups.
      
      
        Since I have the floor, there is a second amendment concerning recital H, which a colleague mentioned earlier on, which is to replace the word 'territory' with the word 'status'.
        I understand that this is also acceptable to the main groups.
        I am very grateful to the Secretariat because this was a very late oral amendment.
      
      
        (The oral amendment was adopted)
