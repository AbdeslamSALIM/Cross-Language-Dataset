        (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has lost one of its greatest artists today.
        Luciano Pavarotti died this morning in Modena, and I think it only right to pay tribute to this great man of art and culture who took European music to the entire world.
        His passing is a huge loss to the European Union as a whole, and I believe it fitting to remember Luciano Pavarotti in this House.
