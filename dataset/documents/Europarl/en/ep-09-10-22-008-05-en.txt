      Common organisation of agricultural markets and specific provisions for certain agricultural products (single CMO Regulation) (vote)
    
    
      Before the vote on paragraph 79:
    
    
      
        Mr President, I would first of all like to apologise to colleagues for this intervention, but I wonder if someone could explain what 'CMO' actually stands for.
      
    
    
      
        It stands for 'common market organisation', although it will be slightly different in different languages!
