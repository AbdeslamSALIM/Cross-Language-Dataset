      Guant√°namo: imminent death penalty decision (
    
    
      
        (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for intervening in this vote.
        I would just like to ask for Amendment 9 to be placed in paragraph 7 and not in paragraph 4.
      
      
        I think there has been a mistake.
        Amendment 9 concerns the right to a fair trial and, if it is adopted - which would surprise me, but anyway - that would mean that Amendment 12, which is about another topic altogether, will fall.
