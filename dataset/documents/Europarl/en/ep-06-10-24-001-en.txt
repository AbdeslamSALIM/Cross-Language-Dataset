      (The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m.)
    
    
      
        You wish to take the floor, Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez.
        I imagine that it is for a point of order.
        On the basis of which Rule do you wish to speak?
      
    
    
      
        (ES) Yes, Mr President, I simply wished to mention the fact that the media is reporting that a European citizen, of Spanish nationality, Mr Emilio Morenatti, has been kidnapped in Gaza this morning by a group of armed men.
        I would ask that you call upon the Presidency of the Council and the Commission to do everything they can ...
      
      
        (The President cut off the speaker)
      
    
    
      
        That is not a point of order.
        I understand your concern, but the Rules of Procedure must be respected.
        I take good note of what you say, thank you.
