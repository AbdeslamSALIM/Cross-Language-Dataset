        Mr President, I want to thank those colleagues who supported and signed this declaration, and I would like to take this opportunity to call upon the Commission and Council to establish a solid and strong anti-corruption monitoring mechanism in the European Union.
        I appeal to the Member States to show political will and strengthen their fight against corruption before it is too late.
