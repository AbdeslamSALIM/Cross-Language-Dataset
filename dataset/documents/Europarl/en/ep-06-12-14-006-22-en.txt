      Creation of the External Borders Fund (2007-2013) (vote)
    
    
      - Before the vote:
    
    
      
        rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to inform this House that during the tripartite talks on the border fund we were assured by the Commission and the Council that firearms do not qualify for purchase using this fund.
        It will not therefore be possible to use the fund to buy firearms.
      
      
        I therefore appeal to this House to adopt the compromise amendment referred to in the text as the LIBE Commission proposal.
