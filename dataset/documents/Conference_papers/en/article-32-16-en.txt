Table 1 shows the results. We first present the performance of the baselines, followed by our model with only local NP features, then our model with local EDU features added, and then our model with progressive additions of discourse features (marked by the “+” sign). The last row presents the final results, obtained by using all features. The results show that, among the three baselines, the second one provides the best results for Verbmobil. This is expected, since the ontology is tuned to the data. However, it has limitations, because some NPs that contain a concept of the ontology are not outcomes (since they are repetitions, comments etc.) and of course not all the outcomes expressed by agents are “covered” by concepts in the ontology. For Booking, the ontology degrades the results (namely, the recall) with respect to the first baseline, since there is a weak overlap between the concepts in the ontology and those in this corpus.
