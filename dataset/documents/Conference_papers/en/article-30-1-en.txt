INTRODUCTION Discourse segmentation aims at splitting texts into Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are nonoverlapping units that serve to build the discourse structure of a document. Indeed, EDUs are the entities that have to be linked by coherent relations or the entities that have to be grouped together if a set of EDUs is, as a whole, an argument of a coherent relation. Identifying EDU boundaries is thus an important first step in discourse parsing, since a wrong segmentation degrades the performances of discourse parsers. For instance, Soricut and Marcu [2003] have pointed out that perfect segmentation reduces the number of parser errors by 29%.
