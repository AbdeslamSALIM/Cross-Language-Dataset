The computation of the global vector is done then by weighted vectorial sum of the various sets in the tree in starting with the lowest part. This mode of calculation makes it possible to consider in a dominating way the genus on the other terms of the definitions and in a more general ways the heads on their syntactic dependent. The figure 1 synthesizes this calculation. No predicate is the set x3 then it does not appears on the figure.
