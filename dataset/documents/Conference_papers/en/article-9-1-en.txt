Introduction Our aim is to propose a generic formalism as simple as possible but powerful enough to write real grammars for natural language and to handle complex linguistic structures. The formalism we propose can strongly simulate most rule-based formalisms used in linguistics.1 Language utterances are both strongly structured and compositional and the structure of a complex utterance can be obtained by combining elementary structures associated to the elementary units of language. The most simple way to combine two structures A and B is unification, that is, to build a new structure C by partially superimposing A and B and identifying a part of the objects of A with those of B.
