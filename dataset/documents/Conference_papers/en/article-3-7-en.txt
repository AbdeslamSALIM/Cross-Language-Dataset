Certainly, the application context, the prior knowledge, the type of data and many other factors may help in the identification of the appropriate measure. For instance, if the objects to be compared are described by Boolean vectors, we can restrict to a class of measures specifically devoted. However, the number of measure’s candidates might remain quite large. In that case, how shall we proceed for identifying the one we should use? If all measure’s candidates were equivalent, is it sufficient enough to take one randomly? In most cases, this is not true. The present work aims to solve this problem by comparing proximity measures. To do this, three approaches are used.
