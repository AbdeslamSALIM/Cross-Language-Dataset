Our proposal is to benefit from this complementarity while adding toWordNet conceptual vectors built starting from definitions and relations contained in this base. The method suggested here holds of the continuous field contrary to the whole methods we studied in the literature which belong to the discrete field (addition of arcs for the relations, symbols about the domain, etc).
