Properties vs. Constraints Properties[3] are constraints that apply to categories, and specify syntax well formedness rules and phrase cohesion rules. There are seven kinds of properties : constituency, heads, unicity, requirement, exclusion, linearity and dependency detailed in section 2.2. That such linguistic constraints can have a counterpart in a constraint system seems obvious. For instance, linearity (or precedence) can be implemented using an order relation among integers. Some constraints, like constituency or heads, deserve a more object oriented translation involving at least set variables.
