Several strategies have been used to discover such hierarchies by iteratively grouping or splitting groups. Good examples are algorithms based on a similarity metric. At each iteration the two closest groups (in term of similarity) are merged leading to the construction of a hierarchy. However, the resulting hierarchy is barely relevant for an analyst because a level is the division of only one single group. In a recent paper [13], Pons and Latapy provide a procedure to simplify this kind of structure.
