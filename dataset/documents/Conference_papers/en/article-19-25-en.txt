Table 4 gives the results of the evaluation of our algorithm for the words of the English cooccurrence network that are nouns only and for which at least one sense was discovered. As Pantel and Lin, we only take into account for evaluation 4 words of each sense, whatever the number of words that define it. But, because of the way our senses are built, we have not a specific measure of the similarity between a word and the words that characterize its senses. Hence, we computed two variants of the precision measure. The first one selects the four words of each sense by relying on their number of strong links in the shared nearest neighbor graph. The second one selects the four words that have the highest similarity score with one of the synsets of the target word, which is called “optimal choice” in Table 43. A clear difference can be noted between the two variants. With the optimal choice of the four words, we get results that are similar to those of Pantel and Lin: their precision is equal to 60.8 with an average number of words defining a sense equal to 14.
