This work is at the interface of speech recognition and analysis to IF modules. More precisely, the speech recognition module was adapted to be able to deliver a chain partially or completely analyzed into IF. This was done by using a class-based statistical language model for which classes directly correspond to IF entries. In the method proposed in this paper, only the most frequent IFs are selected to represent a class in the language model The methodology used to obtain this “semantic” language model is described in section 2 of this paper. Section 3 presents some preliminary experimental results obtained with this methodology while section 4 concludes this work.
