This paper presents an NLP based approach for preference expression extraction from negotiation dialogues. We propose a new annotation schema for preferences and dependencies among them and illustrate on two different corpus genres. We then suggest a learning approach that efficiently extracts preference expressions using a combination of local and discursive features and assess the reliability of our approach on each corpus genre.
