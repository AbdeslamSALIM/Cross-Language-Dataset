From a set of elementary notions, concepts, it is possible to build vectors (conceptual vectors) and to associate them to lexical items 1. The hypothesis2 that considers a set of concepts as a generator to language has been long described in [Rodget, 1852]. Polysemic words combine difierent vectors corresponding to difierent meanings. This vector approach is based on well known mathematical properties, it is thus possible to undertake well founded formal manipulations attached to reasonable linguistic interpretations.
