In the derivation process, elementary structures combine successively, each new elementary structure combining with at least one object of the previous result; this ensures that the derived structure is continuous. Polarities are only necessary to control the saturation and are not considered when the strong generative capacity of the grammar is estimated. Polarities belong to the declarative part of the grammar, but they rather play a role in the processing of the grammar.
