Antonymy We proposed in [Schwab and al, 2002] a definition of antonymy compatible with the vectorial model used. Two lexical items are in antonymy relation if there is a symmetry between their semantic components relatively to an axis. For us, antonym construction depends on the type of the medium that supports symmetry. For a term, either we can have several kind of antonyms if several possibilities for symmetry exist, or we cannot have an obvious one if a medium for symmetry is not to be found.
