Since the list of terms associated to each concept in the ontology is small, this feature helps us to detect additional lexicalizations; the EDU contains (2) a disjunction or (3) a conjunction; scoping features that look if the NP is under the scope of (4) a negation, (5) a modal, or (6) a domain action verb (such as “to meet”, “to book” and “to reserve”). For negation and modality, scope is resolved quite simply by using the syntactic tree of an EDU: an NP is in the scope of a negation or a modal word if the father node of that word is also a father of the NP node. Of course, this procedure does not suffice for resolving some scoping ambiguities. However, since EDUs in our data are quite short, this simple approach seems to give correct results in most cases; the EDU contains (7) an opinion word that indicates whether the agents’ preferences are acceptable or not (good, bad, OK, etc.), (8) polite words or (9) words that introduce preferences, such as (to prefer, to favor, favorite, choice, too, rather, etc.); (10) the EDU restates a preference of another agent.
