Conclusion We created a list of French prepositions for parsing applications by comparing various lexicons and dictionaries. We hence focused on syntactic aspects. Manual filtering was used to eliminate obsolete or rare prepositions, as well as a number of errors. The resulting lexicon contains more than 250 French prepositions, among which 49 are simple prepositions.
