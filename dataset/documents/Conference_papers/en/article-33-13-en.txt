Exogenous features are features that are not entirely derived from the (reference) corpus itself. They are computed from external data (in our case, our lexical resources). The lexical resources might be useful to discover new expressions: usually, expressions that have standard syntax like nominal compounds and are difficult to predict from the endogenous features.
