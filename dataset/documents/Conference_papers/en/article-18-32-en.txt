The phenomenon detection is done by examination of the neighbourhood of a conceptual vector. If among the N first neighbors, the density of words with no correlation with the target word is important then an action of separation must be undertaken. This action of separation consists in plunging the whole network in field where the nodes tend to be pushed back. In directly being inspired by physics, a force of repulsion in 1/d2 is calculated iteratively between nodes.
