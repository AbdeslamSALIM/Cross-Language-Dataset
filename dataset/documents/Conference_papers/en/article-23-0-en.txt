ABSTRACT Inductive and deductive inferences in a Crowdsourced Lexical-Semantic Network In Computational Linguistics, validated lexical-semantic networks are crucial resources. Regardless the construction strategies used, automatically inferring new relations from already existing ones may improve coverage and global quality of the resource. In this context, an inference engine aims at producing new conclusions (i.e. potential relations) from premises (pre-existing relations).
