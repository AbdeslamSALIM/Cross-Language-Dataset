This filtering process also allowed us to identify some issues, in particular elisions in multiword forms, like afin de, afin d’, or contractions like face `a, face au or `a partir de, `a partir du, which will be processed in the segmentation step. Others, like l`es, which is only used in toponyms in dashed forms (e.g. Bathel´emont-l`es-Bauzemont), will be processed during named entity segmentation.
