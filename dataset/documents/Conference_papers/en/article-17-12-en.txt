We would generally consider that, for a distance DA(A;B) 4 (45 degrees) A and B are thematically close and share many concepts. For DA(A;B) 4 , the thematic proximity between A and B would be considered as loose. Around 2 , they have no relation. DA is a real distance function. It verifies the properties of re exivity, symmetry and triangular inequality. We have, for example, the following angles(values are in radian and degrees).
