A visualisation of the results is provided in Figure 4 where counties are geolocalized. The two first hierarchical levels are drawn using a color mapping. Both levels illustrate the following observation: geographically close counties are more likely to be part of the same clusters. This observation can be also found in the results obtained using Oslom and Infomap algorithms.
