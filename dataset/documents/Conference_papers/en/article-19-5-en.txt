As (Church and Hanks, 1990), we adopted an evaluation of mutual information as a cohesion measure of each cooccurrence. This measure was normalized according to the maximal mutual information relative to the considered corpus. After filtering the less significant cooccurrences cooccurrences (cooccurrences with less than 10 occurrences and cohesion lower than 0.1), we got a network with approximately 23,000 words and 5.2 million cooccurrences for French, 30,000 words and 4.8 million cooccurrences for English.
