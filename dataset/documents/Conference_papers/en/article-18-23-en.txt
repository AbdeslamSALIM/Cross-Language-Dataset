Thus, the continuous domain offered by conceptual vectors gives flexibilities that the discrete domain offered by the networks cannot. They are able to bring closer words on minority ideas but however common what it is not possible with a network. The conceptual vectors and the operation of thematic distance can correct the weak recall inherent of the lexical networks. The defects of the ones are thus mitigated by qualities of the others what makes therefore conceptual vectors and lexical networks complementary tools.
