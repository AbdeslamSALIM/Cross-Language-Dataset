Polarization takes its source in categorial grammar and subsequent works on resourcesensitive logic (see Lambek’s, Girard’s or van Benthem’s works). Nasr (1995) is among the first to introduce a rule-based formalism using an explicit polarization of structures. Duchier & Thater (1999) propose a formalism for tree description where they put forward the notion of polarity (and they uses the terms of polarity and neutralization). Perrier (2000) is probably the first to develop a linguistic formalism entirely based on these ideas, the Interaction Grammar.
