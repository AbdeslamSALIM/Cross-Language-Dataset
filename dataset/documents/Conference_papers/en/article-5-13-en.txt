Secondly, the nodes of the set s(t) do not longer correspond to a flat clustering of the subgraph Gt but are new parts of the flat clustering of the subgraph Gp(t). Looking at the previous example in Figure 1, after the deletion of the node 22, the nodes 221 and 222 are now direct successors of the node 2. Therefore, the number of edges leaving 221 and 222 increases because the edges between these clusters and the cluster 21 are added.
