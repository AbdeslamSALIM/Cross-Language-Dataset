The glossary of terms built in the first task (build glossary of terms) contains all the terms and associated definitions corresponding to the different ontological constituents (such as concept, instance, relation and attribute). In the second task (build concept taxonomies) taxonomies are constructed by selecting from the glossary the terms that are concepts, by grouping similar terms corresponding to a same concept, and by arranging concepts in a concept (is-a) hierarchy.
