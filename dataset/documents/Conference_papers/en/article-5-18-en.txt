First, we analyze the results obtained using the algorithm without optimization (left column in Figure 2). The micro-communities seem to be identified when they are well defined theoretically. This situation occurs when Âµ2 < 0.5. Macrocommunities are also identified when the proportion of edges between microcommunities is superior to the proportion of edges between micro-communities. We can however observe that the clustering trees produced by the algorithm contain additional levels. Indeed the flat clustering N2(T) should be equal to F(T) (the micro- communities) but it is obviously not always the case here.
