Antonymy Evaluation Measure It seems relevant to assess wether two lexical items can be antonyms. To give an answer to this question, we have created a measure of antonymy evaluation. Let A and B be two vectors. The question is precisely to know if they can reasonably be antonyms in the context of C. The antonymy measure MantiEval is the angle between the sum of A and B and the sum of AnticR(A;C) and AnticR(B;C). Thus, we have:
