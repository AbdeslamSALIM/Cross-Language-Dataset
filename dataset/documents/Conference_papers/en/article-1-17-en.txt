The level criterion of extracted patterns is still stable in noisy contexts. Notice that most of the confident or emerging rules in noisy contexts has a negative level. As we mentioned above, a rule with a negative level is less probable than the default rule and thus is not statistically significant, i.e. not interesting. In the last experiments, we show that a positive level indicates that a rule is interesting.
