A (strict) preference is commonly understood as an asymmetric, transitive ordering by an agent over outcomes, which are understood as actions that the agent can perform or goal states that are the direct result of an action of the agent. For instance, an agentâ€™s preferences may be defined over actions like buy a new car or by its end result like have a new car. The outcomes over which a preference is defined will depend on the domain or task. Among these outcomes, some are acceptable for the agent, i.e. the agent is ready to act in such a way as to realize them, and some outcomes are not. Among the acceptable outcomes, the agent will typically prefer some to others.
