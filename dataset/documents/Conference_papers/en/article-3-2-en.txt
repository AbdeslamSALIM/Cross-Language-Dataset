Introduction Comparing objects, situations or things leads to identifying and assessing hypothesis or structures that are related to real objects or abstract matters. In other words, for understanding situations that are represented by a set of objects and be able to act upon, we must be able to compare them. In natural life, this comparison is achieved unconsciously by the brain. In the artificial intelligence context we should describe how the machine might perform this comparison.
