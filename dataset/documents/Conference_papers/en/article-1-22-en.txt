Notice that another recent work embraces the MDL principle for classification rule discovery: in [Suzuki, 2009], the author suggests an extended version of MDL to integrate user knowledge (in the form of a partial decision list). The code length cl of the partial decision list L to be discovered from data D is extended with the user knowledge K and serves as a subjective interestingness measure: cl(L) = -logP(L)-logP(D | L)-logP(K | L).
