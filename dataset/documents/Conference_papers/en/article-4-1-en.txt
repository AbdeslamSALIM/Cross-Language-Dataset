Introduction Since the foundational work of Gruber [Gruber, 1993], ontologies are an essential element for knowledge engineering, and the development of the semantic web increased even more their importance. Today, in several domains, ontologies are considered the central component of decision support or information retrieval systems (e.g. [Osborne et al., 2009] focuses on ontologies in the medical domain and [Bourigault and Lame, 2002] focuses on ontologies in the legal domain).
