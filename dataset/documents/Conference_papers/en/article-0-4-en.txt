In Section 5, we present the algorithm that automatically constructs summaries based on QSL and the quality measure. We also introduce the properties of the summaries constructed with sub-languages of QSL. Section 6 presents the language for querying logs, and describes how properties of the framework can be used to ensure efficient searches. Section 7 describes the implementation of the framework and the experiments conducted to evaluate its effectiveness. Section 8 discusses related work. We conclude and draw perspectives in Section 9.
