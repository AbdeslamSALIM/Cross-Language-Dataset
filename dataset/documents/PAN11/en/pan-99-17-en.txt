being masters as free and had no one to realize, and neither had any such powerful among them

with their wives, and other hobbies - and never say or that none of them used the above sin,
before they hated those who used it, having them in just as vile to timid, as gloried in such
filth. And not just in their people did not find this sin, but even consented to be in their
houses or palaces no they knew who used it, and even without all this, I think I heard that if they
were know of anyone who had committed such a sin, punished [him] with such punishment, it was
noted and known to everyone.
