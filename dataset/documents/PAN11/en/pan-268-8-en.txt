 Oh
terribile time!

The unfortunate writer arose from his seat, threw paper and pens,
without caring for those fatal men continue or not managers of public
affairs.

The two set the view with eager curiosity in a group down the street was composed three persons,
namely, an old woman with an extremely stiff and pompous air indicating his adoration of all
things traditional and venerable, a young woman, whose beauty no enough data were taken from
the balcony, although it was not difficult to appreciate the slenderness of her body, her graceful
walk and dress, where elegance and modesty had achieved twin, and
finally, a lad, whose face was not easy to distinguish, with only
I saw some pins, their little crumb of lenses and a nose.

The writer was desperate to scream, to throw the object to find more hand over the innocent couple crossing
the street. Stood pale when she noticed that they spoke with a confidence similar to the privacy,
and even he seemed to hear some tender and moving phrases. He clenched his fists and looked
for frogs and snakes that mouth, away from the balcony by no longer attend a show you crazy. He
turned his eyes met with the look of raw print, which still in the middle of the room, uglier,
ugliest and sinister than ever, claimed the nefarious pages. Nothing, nothing, to finish the article!
Blind with rage, pale as death, trembling, and lost eyes, sat down, took pen and splashed right
and left large splotches of ink, peppering the paper the peck of
the pen, reel off the following:

"Yes: you have to remove the management
of public affairs fatal to those men who have usurped power in a way
never seen before in the annals of ambition to such immoral men, which
have spread to all levels of government their vicious habits, to those
men to mock the country with their makeshift fortunes.

Everyone sees with indignation abuse, the audacity, the cynicism of such men, and we participate
in that patriotic indignation. Oh! can not contain us.
