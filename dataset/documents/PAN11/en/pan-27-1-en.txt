 The old peripatetic he said
with confidence: The soul is a entelechia, a reason under the qual is power being what it is,
so what Aristotle says expressly, pag. 633 of the edition of Louvre: Entelexeia esti, etc.
I do not understand the Greek, 'said the giant. Nor I, "replied the plowman philosophical. ? Well,
that citais, "replied the Syrian, in that Aristotle in Greek? Because what you do not understand,
"said the sage, it must include language that does not know.

I take the Cartesian thread, and said: The soul a pure spirit in the womb has received all the
metaphysical ideas, and so leave the has been refined to go to school and relearn what we
knew so well and never gonna know. For these prospered, the animal responded eight leagues,
who could both remember when I was in your soul the womb of your mother, if had to be so ignorant
Quando were your man with a beard. ? Y you mean by spirit? ? That's what I ask? he said the
discurridor, I have no idea none of it: they say that it is not subject .--? And you know what
is matter? That if you answered man. That exemplo stone is brown, and such a figure, has three
dimensions, and is serious and divisible. That's right, he said on Sirius? But that thing
that you think divisible, serious and dark, I'll say it is? Some attributes see but? The backbone
of these attributes you know? No, he said the other.

Then you do not know that something is the matter.

Addressing Mr. Micromegas then another wise beyond his thumb had, asked who was his soul, and
he was doing. Any thing, "replied the philosopher Malebranche; It is God who does everything for
me, I see it in everything I do in everything, and the one who all cooperation does not mine.
Both mating does not exist, "replied the philosopher of Sirius. ? And you, friend told him to
Leibniz who were there, you say? ? That is your soul? A pointer Relox, he said the Leibnizian, which
indicates the hours while you touch my body, or, if you will, touches
the soul as the body signals; or my soul is the mirror of the universe,
and my body mirror frame: this is clear.

Estabalos hearing a sectarian Locke, and when I touch him speak, he said: I do not feed, I know
is that I never thought of as not through my senses. That has substance immaterial and intelligent,
I do not doubt, but God can not communicate intelligence to matter,
so I doubt it.

Respect the eternal power, and I do not limit your responsibility; not saying anything, and
I stick to believe that there are many more things possible than you think.

Sirius smiled the animal, and it seemed that this was not the less sane, and if there were no been

the band was in a animalucho with a bonnet on her head, which cutting the wire to all philosophers,
he said that he knew the secret, which was in the Sum Santo Tomas, and he looked from head
to toe with the two inhabitants of heaven, they support their persons, their worlds, their
suns and stars, everything had been brought to man. Al hear such nonsense, our two travelers
had to fall over each other, killing of that inextinguishable laughter which, according to Homer, share

Sciences Paris.

Quand le Mas opened the secretary, it was found that was all white,
and said: ha, and I boasted to me.

HISTORY

A GOOD BRAMA.
In my journeys I found an old rut, sugeto very sane, educated, discreet,
and with this rich, which made him more sane, because, as he did not
lack anything, did not need to cheat anyone. Three women governed
their very beautiful family, whose husband was, and when not recreated
with their wives, were occupied in philosophy. He lived with his house
that was beautiful, well-jeweled and pleasant gardens, an old India,
blessed, silly, and very poor.

DÃ­xome one day the rut: I never been
born. Ask why, and he replied: Quarenta years I am studying, and all
I have lost forty; taught to others, and do not know everything
