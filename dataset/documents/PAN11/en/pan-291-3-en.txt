 The case was that by going to ride early in the morning
attend the funeral of my uncle, had delivered a letter from the court of first instance forcing
him to practice some procedures as he entertained about two hours ... all respects to "trigedia"
the day before, that I should know, and for this the truth were told, for who knew him mainly
came.

Hicímosle seat at the table, preventing Facia that were served from the noodle soup inclusive,
and while out Tona and his mother was changing and removing leftover food destroyed in stews,
and all we paid him very great care, he noted that lowering a pastor of winter, just started
the desnieve, cross country, because it pushed the ran very cold and a black cloud of bad
part and worse road, stopped for a moment and take a tinderbox and light the pipe, the same
mouth of a covachón, known to very few for being out of path frequented, as half the distance, the
short cut between Tablanca and the people of relatante, but in this municipality. Standing
there and give the pastor you hit the edge of the knife, because it sparked the stone was not
tinder the best, notes on the nose gives a "jedor" that would lie on his back. Look here smells
there, note that the jedor out of the cave, curiosity tempt them, enter, and at a bend very wide,
to the right, sees three men lying in the long run, face up, stiff and almost stacked on each
other, killed three and leaning against one of ash and embers Piluca off. Frightening, flee
from there, and for being the closest, according to his account, gives the people the narrator
relates what he has seen. It goes back in his office, accompanied by appropriate way, and
truth is denounced by the pastor. Three were, indeed, the bodies and of well-known place, and
were well equipped firearms ... and up ropes and knives. Without doubt the surprise snowstorm
there since the beginning, and they perished from hunger and cold ... by decree of God who
knew his evil intentions. It was a comb that was called an engineer and said go in search
of a gold mine, months made and, with his ragged clothes, his matted hair and wild beard and seams
in the face, it started half an eye and nose.

Here there was a clatter of dishes infernal tattered, and a cry of Facia who is had fallen from
his hands as a dozen of them. Then I looked and found her looking at me me with frightened eyes
and the color of death in the face. I told him to mine not to commit indiscreet; entendióme, and
added in words and smiling was not the mess one reason to be frightened so much, referring
to the pieces, while snuggled Tona the municipal judge's two half-full of dishes knowledgeable
sources, so some pasmadona had caught the story, but probably more by the disaster of the vessel,
which had started her mother cry.

Relatante to become the story after this incident, and seeing that, out of respect for I certainly
was with Repulgue and fussiness to testify who were net Castilian the other two dead, apresuréme
to say:

- I am well aware of who it is, and you want to avoid reluctance to declare before me are two
of my relatives, of the two gentlemen of promise. With a that the engineer lived CHIRLA, in his
hometown of you: we saw them together and I passed Neluco for him, going to Provedaño. As good
news source, then waiting overnight missing brother of one my relative (who, apparently, arrived
in time) to give final blow to the exploitation of gold mine he had discovered the lynx wild
beard. In good justice, had three more than deserved the stick, which had dead are not dying in this
different manner. So you see you if I have to reason, as far as touches my relatives, to rejoice
that they have finished well, like any good man.

Preopinante said was the truth that everything I had said, added in response a question that
someone did, that the man in the face Chirlo had lived in the place with the name, certainly, of course,
Pedro Gonzalez as reflected in his personal card, and that that had been registered as dead
in the book in question; alegréme yo this, and surely would be glad Facia, who listened, much
more ... and ended the conversation without getting into a new one, because he had also finished
the meal, time was pressing and had much to outsiders for the guests go back to their homes
each, and other to complete their journey. Because Don was the first leg advantage to Recaredo
Tablanca to transact business, yet that step and a half ago in a village of Nansa downstream, and
was also renowned chores campurriano emergency in the capital so he took with Don Roman and her
husband. Disappeared without knowing how Don Lope; depart, while he was eating everything put
in front of the municipal judge aforesaid, the two unequal and the five wealthiest Caórnica Nansa
upstream and downstream of the house, ended at last, eating the remaining eating, and went
off too, and well stocked, instead ...

The next day, very early, took off to Robacio's sister and brother-Neluco, and few hours later,
alas! I also left the whole family of giant of Castañalera.

And that was the darkest for me! Of me, alone in the fields of muted and stiff the manor house,
castle of my new and patriarchal dominion, in the poor soil of "my greatest." Everything was
wide, all I was left over there and all I came up, as if built in the air, since he had returned
home the family of the old Marmitón. Because the continued presence of some women as lively and
happy as these two, more hectic when engaged and walked in and out of so many different people
in recent days, could not find me in its true light the void left in the death house of habitation
and venerable owner, who, alive, filled her whole and was also the bond that tied me to it with
the strength of my commitment, funded primarily in consideration
of what he considered the gift of my company.

Often came to see me and Neluco Cura Don Sabas, and spent long hours with me, still the gathering
of the night very busy and lively; presidial me with the greatest assiduity, and made pluck up
the courage to believe a lot of fun in it, or to let him know ahead of those rustic and good commentators,
ocupábame at times to dispatch or to fix my mail papers and accounts of the estate, spoke to
Facia and I was pleased to see how believing and, under the news brought by the municipal judge
of yore, and my subsequent reflections, forever free of the cross that had so oppressed and kept
assuming at the bottom of a grave the secret of what could be an affront to his daughter, was the
poor women turning to life, and gradually regained the strength of his spirit exhausted, crying and
praying while the hapless man, died with the black-stained soul intentions after an eventful
life and criminal gozábame also decipher the impenetrable continent of Chisco certain characters
confused himself betrayed in their glee pechazo gentle and deep from the legacy of the "stack
of ounces", and pull his tongue to know how he was since then in their dealings and friendships
with the family of Toper, which, as I know, has been humanized a lot with him and even "caught
him with eyes memorials" and even with some hints too suggestive; interesábame Pito Salces
really that amurriadote and suspicious walked fearing that would have changed the good dispositions
of Tona to him since his mother was rich, and even on their own, taking the poor for contempt
astonishment, very natural, which fell monsoon sets in those days of fat, left home sometimes
to vent some ideas and stretch cramped limbs, but was always waterlogged soil as a sponge and cold
the sun that illuminated the valley, while I mowed the beard the environment not put out a match
and had to go back to my hole without having dared to fall on stony ground where it wanted to
conduct impulses of my need to socialize with someone who understood me; tramábala with Chisco
later or the first one I put forward, and, finally, even sought, following the teachings of
Neluco bucolic, down to my right, the brighter, the dark places of those men to find the desired
level and with it the promised pleasure, but even so, I left over endless hours of solitude
and silence in those aged and black moors echoing the echo of my steps give fever as if under a
gloomy vaults dungeon, and wherever you look, that my heroic efforts to make life bearable
was not there to be anything other than work in prison, even with the tough, deep and tempting
to want to escape.

Be escaped, because he had returned to imponérseme this idea, not
the first time going through my brain felt like a blast, but as an
irresistible itch that was falling apart at times the work of my acclimation,
almost nearing completion now.

It seemed to drain a truly despicable, but the bodies left in the air, fall under its own gravity;
I felt so down, broken, with the death of my uncle, the link that bound me over to the house. Admittedly,
I left the bonds of commitment and solemnized many times before so many different people, but
it was also true that he had put that commitment I limit 'as I possibly could, "and that,
assuming that it became capable to penetrate the work of my uncle to work on it, my work would not
be continuous or individual hour or even every day, whereas the tedious reality that was suffocating
me continuously Perennial, all the time.

Constantly struggling between these impulses empecatados and dislikes of my consciousness formal
man, there were times when I laughed at my own, seeing reason with the criterion ill-assorted
a schoolboy with his confinement.

What things occurred to me to justify a trip, with a promise to return and intention not to
fulfill it!

After sobering up and giving more of my thoughts to consider the value
detúveme of which had achieved good results with the work of my own
observations, and example and preaching, more or less directly, my
uncle, Neluco, Mr. de la Torre of Provedaño, mostly, and many others
of great rides, and then I felt ashamed I have thought as to shake
the burden of my sorrows.

Placed in this area, soon realized that what I needed at once and with urgency to exit gracefully
from the conflict, was to acquire other bonds to replace what's broken by death, another new
link Tablanca me to join, and not as closely as it was my uncle,
to the point, at least he left the house to be a prison for me.

Well. But this link where to find him? What breed was it? ... Who knows the spaces then walked
to the angry and visionary imagination!

In this fast and crazy ride I found no quiet time or rest, because everything seemed wrong
to make a high Respite ... until I found the most singular of occurrences. But it was even a assumptions
on which to conclude the analysis fatigued. As a result, and with all the scrupulous detail
of whom, as I meditate on that matter as serious as the first time in his life. I raised thoughts
over the barriers craggy valley, and carried him far, far away of Tablanca, closed my eyes, I went
to the parts of memory, and was extracting from it a legion of images, which I later paraded
one by one, ahead of me. When he had spent the last figure of this bizarre procession returned
to the thought the realities of Tablanca montunos ... and I put my hands to his head as he
realizes that has been filling it with nonsense ideas for saving. I turned off the flashlight
of my thoughts and, oh surprise, with the last ray of light I saw her breeze through obfuscated
terms of imagination, a new and unexpected image that seemed to have itself the power to resolve
all the difficulties of conflict. But ... And I ended up making me crosses and to laugh.

Was still laughing when he came Neluco.

- So I like to see you - I said - and not with the degustation of
these sad days ago.

- For her return, Neluco friend - I said - if
God does the miracle that I ask.

- However, you laugh now ...

-
Laughing Rabbit ...

- I do not insist - said the doctor - because
I do not want to have you by reckless, but I assure you, without that
fear, more than twice had asked him in recent days on the grounds
of a disappointment that you could not hide.

Woke up this statement Neluco the idea, not entirely asleep on me,
to confess with him as Facia had pleaded with me.

Could expect much from the advice of your experience, and, ultimately,
the relief given in the crush of departing spirits of the resource
them with a good understanding friend.

- Exactly - I said armándome
resolution - I had a great desire to have a paragraph with you on
these individuals.

So, now or ever.

I closed the door of my cabinet, sentámonos the two with the table between them, and began to
speak as follows:

- You must know, friend Neluco that since returning to the rule of order and silence in this house after
my uncle died and was buried, I do not know where to invest the hours I have plenty in it ...
I seem endless, do not see how to improve them and it scares me the
future with a similar perspective.

This is the truth of what happens to me, will I have to your good friend, and you declare
it.

- Why? - I asked the doctor, very quietly, after a silent contemplation
moments.

- For now - I answered - so that you know, then, that, if
any kindly assist me with his authoritative advice.

- What? - Ask
me again with the same serenity as before.

- Well, I like the occurrence,
gee - I cried a little bit by that way of cornering, that looked very
much like a joke rather heavy -.

What is meant here to help a man perishing in the bottom of a cliff?

- Excuse me - "the doctor - but either I'm not in my right mind, or the case I quoted for example,
is not entirely applicable to your particular case. Which is in the bottom of a cliff, can
have no other desire than to go out and get away from him and you,
in the situation today is, you can serve in two ways: helping out
it, or go for a test work bearable and even fun.

Now you tell which of these two extremes is.

- The best seems to you - I said - or both together ... In order to please you in my case, tell
me frankly.

- Well, frankly I say - said the doctor not to wonder what happens to you. I expected ... Be clear:
Don Celso expected dead and you alone at home, was to it seem bigger, blacker and bleaker than
before, and the time spent on it very long and tiresome.

Nothing more natural in a man of taste, education and you worldly background. I did not expect
it to arrive their disappointments so far that, apparently, has come ... Well, look you, Don
Marco: courtesy or even I encourage you to divert your boredom, get the hell next to Tablanca;
advice that, or I can not read faces or is it more had you to thank me. And do not give, I am
quite sure that if the long run you in the state of mind that is now, not here again for all
the days of his life.

- Men - said I caught in the middle of right - that's saying a lot.

-
No more and no less than fair - "the doctor - because it is the truth,
and you can not and should not do that, but let's forgotten some promise
and to the solemn occasion which was ratified, because you have nothing
to do in this world that tempts him, and here yes, because there -
and dispense openness - despite his personal merits, it would not
to be one in the bunch of anonymous, and this would play a much more
lucid, not by the glitz of its hierarchy, but by the charitable status
of the position.

None of this means that you are perpetually forced to bury here: on the contrary, I would
the first to advise him not to, that from time to time transposed these summits to whoop it
up, pretty sure that these raids, made by a man of understanding and culture and flows you were
to look at the end of the benefit of this valley. But to reach that end, that is, that I may
excite him to leave, must be assured here before with something that serves as a bait to return,
for natural and spontaneous movement of your heart ... In short, you have to get used to this house
again and this earth, and these men, such as they had come to seem, to the death of his uncle
Don Celso.

- But the man of God - I cried here - if my finger exactly is that
bad, if that you tell me seems to think my own thoughts and said with
my own language; if I do not want anything to stick to this land and
take her all the love that you have; But how?

With what? This is the case.

I live my uncle, the obligation and converted into comfortable, to accompany me entertained, and
with it, everything around him, killed him, I needed that powerful resource, I get lost in
the emptiness of this house, and overwhelmed by the endless hours I happened there looking
for ways to shorten. Continue his charity work. Congratulations. This is easy and beautiful to
say, but is very vague and does not solve anything, and what I need is something more concrete,
more practical and time. If it were, eg, to cut shirts poor or teach the doctrine to the boys,
I would spend the whole day driving, scissors or ingesting Padre Astete on the heads of these
motilones, but it is not that or something similar: the work of my uncle does not what to
do every minute or every hour.

- What do you mean? - Interrumpióme Neluco -. Do you know her thoroughly in case?

- No, sir - I said.

- And you think - he said - some entertainment on to study it in that
way, not only access to it, but to improve it?

Because you also have to demand - continued mediquito kidding - that the better, and better
security.
