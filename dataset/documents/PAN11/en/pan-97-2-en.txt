 Rarely leaving Poldy
the warm room in the castle, where he was just more of a person with whom to talk his brother,
Count Henry.

He and she had been dwelling there temporarily, but soon had to leave
his former home which he owned and had already taken possession of
both the older brother.

Poldy therefore with sadness and despair brooding over their fate.

His brother Henry, who enjoyed high-deserved reputation as scholar,
well versed in various disciplines, was named a professor at a university,
where his science and his work, would remedy the shortage of its heritage,
giving to live honestly and decently, but with excessive narrowness.

But how Poldy, which was poor and helpless, too, had to leave with
his brother and be of constant burdensome?

This was not possible. A Poldy also hurt in the soul having to abandon those places, so full for
her sweet and mysterious memories.

Moreover, Poldy, who loved the solitude, I felt invincible repugnance to go live life convent,
among other canons in the house of her institute. To live alone, by class, and in Vienna, and
in another city, his income was insufficient.

And finally, contrary to was more revolted against added to the family of any of his brothers
or sisters and do there the sad role of host for life, Tia and companions, living in something
graceful as a little ill-concealed dependence and servitude.

Horror Poldy caused to any of these plans that traced and represented
its future.

Even had before him all that year that began then, and during which she and the Count Henry had
already concluded with his older brother, stay in the castle, while
it lasted the mourning and had just done the survey and the partitions
of the very short hacienda where they still played them very little.

After that period, Poldy felt forced out of the castle, and take firm resolve to live as you wish
and with independence and propriety.

Such was the position of Poldy disappointed. Only dark clouds, presaging storm discerned, to look
in all directions in the horizon of life.

Only a dim light, vague, wandering, that it might be a star, but
had more traces of deceptive wisp, illuminated occasionally the dark
empty space of the sky.

Also had to comply Poldy twenty-nine years. Was at the height of her beauty, the best and most
glorious moment of spirited youth, and the rich imagination of dreams and the will moved and
uplifted by powerful impulses tenderness.
