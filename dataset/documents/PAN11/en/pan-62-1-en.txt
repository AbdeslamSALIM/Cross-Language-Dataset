 Back to Lift the pale semicircle of the moon poked his upper horn
on the sleeping waters. A streak of light ran strongly on them causing them to swell. The star collected
her ray divine gallantly, in the serene light of the goddess who started to rise slowly and
majestically, dwarfing the diamonds of all sizes around wore hers. Stood in the middle of a
bright and splendid atmosphere, drawing on her its graceful contours and scattering by the
atmosphere soothing influence. And the ocean that docile it comes and goes steadily since the
beginning of the world, pure flame was kindled, shook his broad bosom inflamed, and threw rocks
at the waters of Santa Maria and huge layers of mercury that rose above others removed and merged
with them.

Sublime silence reigned, a gathering of inexpressible softness in that scene as old and so new
at the same time.

Nature seemed to stay the course to hear the eternal harmony of heaven.

The waves gently caressing without daring to interrupt the August games serenity noisy night.

Gonzalo,
despite deep concern that the conversation with his uncle left him, he felt the fascination of
that sea, that sky, that moon, and his agitation was becoming in blue. The harsh words of the old
sailor had awakened conscience lashes. Reborn with more fury than before the fight between
the angel and the devil. Once it was about to expire. The boy imagined occur the next day at
home Belinchón talk Dona Paula and rogarla not to say anything to Cecilia and hasten the marriage.
But at the moment was offered to mind the image of Venturita, and thought it would be impossible
to live next it, without suffering horrible torments. Then, as almost always happens in these
struggles, came the period of transactions .-- "Nothing, it's best - he said - is to flee, leaving
again France or England, not marry one or another. Thus there is no treason. The Cecilia wound
caused will heal soon. Find a husband worth more to me, and when you return after a few years,
probably I will find happy and surrounded by children ... "

But ... Ventura flee! Run away from that image radiantly happy! Do not listen to more his voice
that delights the soul caused incomprehensible! Not feeling the sweet touch of his hand Solid fresh
as a rosebud!

Get away from her eyes bright and smiling and magnetic! ... Oh, no!

He felt his forehead bathed in sweat. A deadly grief he fell into thinking about this, as if
and the decision was taken, and to leave she had to say: - "We'll
see, we'll see ... Now it is very difficult, almost impossible, to
turn ... The mother already knows ... Don Rosendo also ... and Cecilia
at this time just in case ... "

The angel loosened her arms, weary, fell off his hands and finally
surrendered.

If not with the body, Gonzalo could see through the eyes of his white spirit image flashing through
serene and sink into the sparkling waters.

And wept seized with strange sadness. This kind of struggle is never made in the human soul
without tearing it somewhere. To achieve this needed step on the heart of a Young innocent, violating
an oath, as a traitor. The words of his uncle still vibrating his ears: - "The man who broke
his word can not help you God." And indeed, he deemed unworthy of aid. A feeling cruel, indefinite,
unfortunately, death, sadness, pierced his chest, and observed strong
and rapid vision ugliness of life without virtue and tranquility,
as the knight of the legend, embracing a beautiful young lady, to
swing the light wind strength saw her transformed into old, naked
and stinking.

The water gently beating the wall at his feet. Staring at them was distracted their undulating
movement. Algae, subject to the bottom, waving to the lapping waves resembling the hair of the dead.
How well we sleep down there! What peace in that fund transparent! What magical light up! Gonzalo
heard for the first time in his life, the eloquent voice Nature invites you to sit in the
maternal womb, the sweet voice of irresistible attraction The unfortunate
hear in my sleep, and that drives them many times to bring the cold
barrel of a gun to his temple.

It was a moment no more. His happy temperament blood rebelled against this appeal. The life,
which boiled exuberant nature of an athlete, he indignantly rejected shooting thoughts of
death. An insignificant event, the appearance of a green light in confines of the horizon, was
enough to divert his mind from those sad thoughts .-- "A ship that wants to come - he said .--
What time is it?

(He took out his watch.) Half past ten already! If were a little earlier, I would. Let's see
if it's that people in the cafe and want to play a few sheets.

"

He took a great cigar of the pouch, lit it, and sucking sensuously, the was closer, little by
little, the cafe of the Navy.

Almost at the same time spent at home in Belinchón a sad scene. All that day, had been Dona Paula
in bed, complaining of an intense tightness in the left side, which made it difficult much to breathe.
He did not like to call the doctor, for that invincible antipathy, and even terror that has
the populace to science. Instead he used on tips how absurd remedies mujerucas advised him
many who came daily to your home to get the rooms with vicious and hyperbolic flattery. So that
did not stop the friction of sheep tallow, gardener cups, the substance of chicken, etc., etc.
Finally, in spite of this formidable therapy, the good lady has improved enough to obscure: even
wanted to get up, but Cecilia stopped him and Pablito. Both of them had accompanied her to spend
time sitting bedside.

Cecilia In particular moment just broke more than necessary to prepare
the ointments and teas.

Pablito made frequent trips to the runners, where, by strange coincidence,
almost always encountered Nieves and made to pay tolls.

Sometimes suppressed their laughter came to the room of the sick, and she smiled benevolence
telling Cecilia:

- How foolish!

No guess, of course, that his beloved son could do nothing but play
hide and seek.

As I was running free and unfettered his chest, head cargábasele care tell your daughter that
as sad news that it had been in bed. He kept guide long and melancholy eyes, sighing at the same
time with pain signals. Several I had said:

- Cecilia, hey.

And many others, sorry, had ordered any trifle.

Had closed the night. Venturita candle lit the lamp, and then went
away.

Paul, seeing her mother better, and having no occasion to exercise
their rights in the halls manor the house was a walk for coffee.

They were mother and daughter in the bedroom, the first in bed, quiet and, the second sitting near
her.

After long time of silence, during which the lady gave Belinchón
thousand rounds in his head to find an entry that naturally leads
to the confidence that was required to do.

- Have sewn today much
the girls? - Asked.

- Do not know ... I've barely been there - said
Cecilia.

- I suppose that if we continue to work well, we will end
too soon.

- Could be.

Dona Paula did not know how to proceed, and was silent.

After a few minutes took the thread again.

- Throughout the month of August will be completed by the team ...
And I think it take even some months to marry.

- Do some months?

...

- I think ... I think Gonzalo not want the ceremony to be so soon
- the lady said trembling voice.

- You have said it?

- Yes, I said
it ... I say, no, tell me, no ... but I guess for certain things ...
by some indirect words ....

Dona Paula was stunned and suffocated.

Fortunately, Cecilia could not see color well on their cheeks.

-
Would like to know what words were those - the young woman said firmly.

-
Do not ask me, the daughter of my soul - said the lady, bursting into
sobs.

Cecilia was heavily pale, and let his mother kiss the hand with effusion
had hers.

Response from the shock, he asked:

- What happened, Mom? ... Speech.

- A horrible thing, my soul ... A disgrace!

... I would die at this time, not see the meanness, evil is done
with my daughter.

- Calm down, Mom.

You're sick, and can really hurt you this emotion.

- Who cares!

I tell you I wish I was dead ... Life would be glad that you did
not want Gonzalo ... Do you love him, my heart, you want a lot?

Cecilia did not reply.

- Tell me, by God, who does not want!

Cecilia remained silent. After a few moments said, trying in vain to give a secure voice inflection:

-
Gonzalo resignation to marry me, right?

At the same time Doña Paula was silent and hid her tearful face in
his hands.

It took a few moments.

- Do you have a complaint about me?

- What must have!

Who will be complaining to you, my lamb?

- So, if you already did not like or does not want me, what can we do? ... I'd better time
disappointment.

- Oh! - Dona Paula shouted breaking into sobs again. Under the apparent resignation of daughter
sensed a deep pain, which made efforts to hide.

- What can we do, Mom! Is it not better to tell me now that after marriage? Did not understand
the life of torment that would attached to a woman who would not? ... The penalty can it cause
at this point, however great, can not be compared to that which would knowing that my husband
did not love me. The penalty would then be increased to death whereas now they may disappear
or at least calm down ... Maybe after he leaves, not seeing much time you'll gradually forgetting
...

- It's ... not going away - he uttered a confused lady.

- If you are going, patience ... Try not to leave home, so you do not see him.

- Well ... Daughter of my soul, your misery is even greater! ... Gonzalo is in love your sister.

Cecilia
grew even paler, to give in pale, and was silent.

Her mother came to kiss the hand with effusion.

Then brought to him and covered him with kisses face.

- Forgive me is torturing you this way ... As much as you suffer, I suffer even more ... Yesterday
afternoon, your sister came to tell me .. Imagine the shock and pain I will have received ... My
first impulse was to drown, it is impossible that she does not have the Most of the blame ...
I gave evidence that they were already long in relationships, taught me letters ... Then, the
lack of Gonzalo these days, did everything believable. As I conviction of treason, I told him
that was irrelevant, that is, that I could not agree hiciese anyone mockery of my daughter, and would
no more Gonzalo foot in this house throughout his life how this infamous villain and he was
like her ... Everything came to me mouth. But this morning ... This morning I heard a horrible
thing yet ... I knew your sister has arrived where I can not want to say. There is no choice
but to marry them, and the soon ... You know why I have given this
oppression that nearly killed me, and more worth it were so!

... The same thing your father that I are caught, have their arms tied. If not were the case, before
agreeing to this marriage, I would first pieces ... The infamy you have used this man makes me
hateful and for life ... Yes, yes, for all life! - with emphasis added angrily.

Cecilia did not reply. Hands folded in her lap, and head down to the chest, looked down with
astonished eyes. Neither the broken speech and vehement of his mother, or the sobs that followed,
managed to make her change in attitude. It remained for a long time, still and white as a statue.

In
those big eyes ecstatic, finally a tear trembled, rose, hesitated ... desprendióse rolling, leaving
groove on her cheeks wet withered and fell like a drop of fire on his hand, which was left burning
without moving. Soon after, had evaporated. An angel picked and took it to God to account for
it should ask who is responsible.

A new and clear light dawned on Sarrió, after so much darkness. By the mercy and grace singularity
of God, found himself provided the beautiful villa, when least expected, an organ in the press,
was even weekly or 'weekly', he said its illustrious founder. Graves obstacles, dangerous pitfalls
opposed the construction of the undertaking. Everyone knew defeat and avoid the perseverance
and genius of that extraordinary man take charge. The first difficulty overcome was that of
money. Fifty shares were created a thousand real each, for the support of the newspaper, of which
Don Rosendo's Friends only took nine, Don Rudesindo five, two and Don Pedro Feliciano Miranda, despite
its large income, two all. As for the others, Alvaro Peña, Don Rufo, Navarro, etc., The apologized
to his lack of resources, and they were right. Also, put in the business intelligence, which
is the main thing. He remained with the forty-one other, Don Rosendo. Singular greatness of mind
which caused great impression at all.

Lancia despatched emissaries seeking press. Not having paid off their efforts, the founder
himself moved to the city. After a few days had the fortune to discover ruined a printer for some
years, broken and rusted screw press which had refused buy one and lay covered with dust in a
dark basement. When Don Rosendo was to examine with her owner, could not but feel friendly emotion.
A flood of serious and deep reflections off the continual act of mind to contemplate: - "I have
here - said - the most powerful tools of human progress in shameful
laziness, not because own, but for the abandoned men.

Much enlightenment, how could spiritual bread spread in the years they have cornered and quiet!
As the barbarism and ignorance prevail in most of our districts, they, who alone have the force to
banish, remained here still, lacking a hand and start pushing them of his heart the secrets of
science and politics. "

Very nearly the kiss and embrace her tenderly. The printer, being in so benevolent mood about
them, not to be outdone, and declared love to the bones of their instruments. Consent for
any money in getting rid of those old colleagues who had helped him to earn their bread (and wine
too, as was said by the people). Their Excellencies sang with such fire and enthusiasm, like
their parents and his brothers and they should be the breath of life that encouraged him and
made an important addition printed statement that, if not soon, better
and cleaner than all known presses until.

According to these ends, Don Rosendo strove, however, convince that would alienate even for
not losing their very remarkable qualities. But showed the more eloquent dealer, appeared more
tender and fond of the printer. Finally, it was agreed that it is not clear from these garments,
so dear to his heart, because it had no courage to carry it out, and moved with them to Sarrió,
which would establish definitely. Would entail some typesetters who could teach other young
people the village, and all the necessary items to mount the print. Folgueras, that was his name
The printer broke, remained as owner and ruler of her. Charged by Chuck's new somewhat regular,
twice as large, according to our calculations, what they charge in the best Madrid printers.
Not much if you consider the merit of the etching press and the pure
professed to love them.

The title was one of the best points was the dashing Don wit and invention Rosendo. Sarrió Intitulólo
Lighthouse, highly expressive and sonorous name, and scope unique nothing else because its founder
intended to enlighten the people and give splendor. Madrid secretly commissioned an engraving
for the head of the newspaper. Arriving a few days then caused spasms of joy, both among shareholders
and between all those who had fortunate to see him. It represented a sea port, Sarrió apparently
in the late night, judging by the black ink of the sky and sea. On the left rose a high mountain
overlooking it entirely ideal, and she saw a gentleman who kept distant resemblance to Don Rosendo,
directing the fires of a huge flashlight on the villa. Near him percibíanse few other heads of
characters. Shareholders in good faith believed were his effigies, and were deeply grateful
to the artist.

Was designated as a local printing store gift Rudesindo, paying rent, course. The wording was
used in the same place a magazine, for which there to perform some work. Montosa the end of
printing, but not many and unforeseen expenses. Folgueras, who claimed to be equipped with everything
you need, I had nothing, and it became necessary to instruct Madrid foundries and missing pieces
to the press, build Galerina, buy tables, etc., etc. At last everything
was settled.

Don Rosendo worked as a black man, seized up in the smallest details. His organizational talent
is revealed in this time better than ever. Was appointed editor in chief Sinforoso Suarez, with
a monthly salary of twenty-hard, and administrator to the first child of Don Rufo.

Missing paper. He had telegraphed to Madrid asking for a remittance, and did not quite get.
Belinchón's impatience was great. Telegrams came and went through the wiring. Some, sometimes
saying he was arrested in Lancia Lancia telegram to claim it. Others which had not happened in Valladolid:
Valladolid telegram. Others who had not left Madrid: telegram to Madrid. Don Rosendo vowed this
time not more responsible role to Madrid and yes it would bring in Belgium. But what was reason
for dislike trocóse in intense pleasure, as always happens, when after they took a few bales
had arrived Lancia, and that she hoped the car had to bring them to their destination. As the
newspaper was already made for days, They proceeded immediately to the roll, which was to be substantial.
Don Rosendo intended to spread it widely throughout the province, sent to all of Spain and to
make Him known in foreign nations. Both that and their partners attended forward to the act
of operating. Never tired of admiring its complicated shoot, the unique precision of its movements,
and the astonishing speed with which the newspaper printed, they do not come down from two hundred
copies left entirely completed at a time. His illustrious founder, unable to suppress the fire
that devoured newspaper, emptied to the presence of all of his coat, and began to find energy
to handle the flywheel, until the sweat flowed in abundance from
his high forehead.

Example given of enthusiasm and love for the civilization that we take pleasure in referring
to education of new generations.

Finally came Sarrió Lighthouse large size, because its founder did not want to be spared paper,
and fairly well printed. The only blur that appeared was the engraving of the head, to the point
that most of the audience was convinced that the individual who had
Flashlight in hand, he wanted to represent a black man instead of
a respectable person already mentioned.

Contained a feature article printed in large type the twelve, called Our purposes. Although
he was signed by The Editors, was due solely to the pen Don Rosendo. Faro purposes "to appear
on the stage of the press", were mainly defend, "high shield and pierced his visor," the moral
and material interests Sarrio combat ignorance "in all its forms"
and the fiery battles of the press, fight tirelessly for the triumph
of the reforms that the progress of time required.

The Lighthouse editorial believed that "sounded when break with the
doctrines the past.

" Sarrió eagerly wanted to be emancipated from the routine and petty ideas, "break narrow molds
that lay trapped "and" enter fully into the domain of its own conscience and their rights. "
"We hope - read the article - that the occurrence of our paper coincides with a period of moral
and material activity, and can attend one of these social transformations that are time in the
annals of nations. If our voice managed to wake the village of Sarrió
from their long slumber and stagnation, and we could succeed look
soon see the dawn of an era of self-study work and the reform movement
who aspire to start, that is the best prize that will our efforts
and sacrifices. "

The language could not be more noble and patriotic.
And, as always, ran to modesty couples with authority and eloquence.

"Do
not entertain the claim - he said - to be the leaders in this great
battle of thought which will soon commence within the precincts of
Sarrió. Only hope to fight as dark soldiers, and that we are given
a place in the forefront. They will fight as good, and if at last
fall due, we will involved in the sacred banner of progress. "

This
military allegory, caused great impression among the residents, and
contributed not a little The enthusiastic reception that the newspaper
obtained. Finally, the article was so elegant the words, so full of
heavy sentences, the style so arranged, that the public did not who
is worthy, but his glorious director.

And it was true.

Inserted
after a lengthy newspaper article Sinforoso on women. There were two
columns closed poetic prose, adorned with all the flowers of rhetoric,
which was sung the sweet influence of this half of humankind. Claimed
in warm terms, that civilization exists only in marriage. Conjugal
love is the only base. Everything is holy, everything is beautiful,
everything is happy in the intimate bond that unites young couple
