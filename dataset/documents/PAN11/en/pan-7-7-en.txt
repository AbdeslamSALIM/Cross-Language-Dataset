 Give to God what is his,

vomiting.

A discreet clergyman suprised everyone with his morning greeting at the door. Watching the entertainment
of two priests and two women came to an end when a priest sat down, covered in sweat and struck
a blow. He restured and thre flies then declared that having been killed in the apothecary of Rhodes
and the street of Sailes. He spoke of his uncle's house in Caro, and said last night there
was no excitement and the house was dead this morning.

Father Fracian Amostazad urged him not to overtire himself, saying
it would be bad for the new inhabitants of Nazaria.

There have been a few deaths there he said, although Tables denied
this witha laugh.

He said he drank with Tinajas Gregorio last night, and now he is cold and dead. Maricadalso
said with some dismay that he was as dead as their grandfather.

The friars also died. Nazaria closed his eyes at what he was hearing. Maricadalso said that
the athlete returned and told him that his daughter Ildefonsa has
fallen on the street of Dove, and was dying.

Maricaldo roared as he spoke, then jumped up to leave.
