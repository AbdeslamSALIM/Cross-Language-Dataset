Sit unfinished just these characters appeared in the Hall one whose appearance I surprised.
He was tall, more than Caórnica; of luenga and pointed white beard, dark color, very prominent
and aquiline nose, tiny eyes and eyebrows and ruffled green-white; head covered with a high cylindrical
hat otter skin, and the whole body until feet, with a gray cloth capotón. He looked like a

hairs tough and tight, and an old-fashioned dress form in relation to existing figurines, of
