 

With the taste of this news and these "assurances" without a visible star in the sky the earth in
the most closed and dark nights, and starting to drizzle, I plunge into the canyon left that
opened a short distance from the sanctuary, commending my soul God and my life instinct that
led me quadruped.

And so I, not knowing how or where or at what time, the end of my
journey sighed memorable.

III

A very original Chisco whistle, the beat of a big dog soon after, a dim and wandering appeared suddenly,
the sudden arrest of my horse, after the last couple of slips with all four legs on lastrales "hung"
on the sidewalk, around black bodies of light and sound of harsh voices and different "strings",
my horse down difficult, to which my body seemed joined by the losses of the day and the rigors
of the weather; fall on my breast and between arms wrapped in rough clothes that smelled of smoke
from cooking and feel of a big hand hit me affectionately ribs while that oppressed my arms
against my chest, my name many times, by one of my ears, a chipped mouth, my entry later, and
almost in tow, in an astragalus or very dark lobby, my climb up a ladder rungs something spongy
and trembling stringers, my income, to finish it in another dark abyss, my transit through carried
hand, like a blind man, by a person who kept on telling me, between gasps of breath and strong
threats of cough, nice things and certainly believe he would leave the heart, warning me on the
way to where I had to lead my people, or lifting one foot where desirable or step with certain
precautions, without ceasing to ask cries and exclamations of the depths, a light that never appear,
because, as I learned later, the servants walked into the porch struggling with the baggage and
horses, and suddenly a little light on the right, and entry into other funds moor very black with
a fire in one of its front ends, then accommodating to oft-repeated instances of my driver, in
the best seat of those who were around the fire, and put him, pushing
and coughing, to amass the scattered embers, and repriming with two
large, dry and copudas escajo bushes.

This reduces all the memories I have of my arrival "of my biggest solar." The exact notion that
surrounded me there in those moments, and even of my own, not I catch up to the heat of the huge
fire that resulted from the handling of my business uncle, loosen my numb members to circulate
my blood turned to his usual regularly, and revived her and enquiciaron
all components of the hindered machine of my ideas.

Lord and master, and of them and started to guide, I noticed that the kitchen was huge, and
its black walls, gleaming like polished jet, that the fire plumes whose licking flames rose housewarming
thick coated flakes of soot, to exceed of the chimney wide, was leaning against a bench with
vault, which was the jorn√≠a or ashtray, on a spacious, tiled plateau, one of the edges are
hardened wood, and less than one foot above the floor general, I support my people, which I chair,
big and armbands rights, still, to shut down the entire perimeter of the plateau banks and
bare wooden stools and very bright for the use, as well as the chair and this home warmer sat
at the head of the kitchen. Then I view all and each of the numerous and unrelated junk, appliances
and gizmos that were in that enclosure, and up to two ollon interested me and three clay pots, which
coverts shaking between the impulse froth boiling beneath them, leaning against the fire and footwear
with individual rubble behind, finally, and when he had nothing to look in the kitchen and accessories,
I set all my attention on my uncle, who was by my side, or as fronting me as it allowed the
fire before we were both seeking the word and filling of loving care. Who knows what whim unconscious,
how evolution discordant, was born that procedure so rude to the most interesting and, of course,
the most esteemed and respectable to me, between what he had, at that time, the scope of my
eyes! ...

They were very young and hazel of my relative, and looked with the vivacity of the fox, a the
shade of gray eyebrows, very thick and bristly, the nose aquiline, the mouth, never or closed
entirely quiet, talkative as the eyes, but quiet, the complexion pale and rugged, the chin,
round and somewhat prominent below the lower lip, ears, formidable and very hairy in the vicinity of
the ears, head, fairly flat back, and hair (Discovered in the moment examine me, for having removed
the cap Don Celso home that is ordinarily covered, both hands to spend it, which he liked,
as shown below) of the same caste and same color as the eyebrows, falling into sturdy locks
on the front, and without visible signs of baldness upon their heights.
