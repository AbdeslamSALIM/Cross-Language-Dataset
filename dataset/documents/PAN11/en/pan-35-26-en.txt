 In case of attack submarine,
transport carrying guns could come off the line and help patrol armed vessels, giving face to the
enemy. The others should continue its way quietly without worrying about the assault. If the
ship that was ahead or astern was torpedoed had to stop to give assistance. The torpedo and "chaluteros"
be responsible for to save the shipwrecked, whether it was possible. The duty of transportation
was always going forward, blind and deaf, without leaving the training, without stopping, to drive
to the port terminal the fortune he had in his heart.

This march in convoys, imposed by the submarine warfare, was a throwback to the life of the
seas. Ferragut recalled the fleets to sail from other centuries, escorted by ships line, following
its course through ceaseless battles, the voyages of the galleons remote of the Indies, leaving
Sevilla to arrive in flocks to the shores of the New World.

The double row of black helmets with plumes of smoke moved gently in the days bonanza. When the
day was gray, foaming sea, the sky low and hazy atmosphere are spread and reared like a herd
of lambs dark and frightened. The guardians of convoy, three small boats in full swing, they
were the mastiffs guards these cattle ocean, preceding it to scan the horizon, leaving behind him
or marching to their sides in order to keep training. Its lightness and speed made them give
prodigious leaps over the waves. A ribbon of smoke curled to continue its double fireplaces. His
bow, when it was hidden, expelling foam falls, rising to show the beginning of the keel.

At night they sailed all the Halls: A simple lantern to bow to notice marching front and a
rear to indicate the path to the next. These lights were barely visible wan. Suddenly, the boat
had to turn the machine back and ask for direction, seeing that grew larger in the dark silhouette
of the vessel. A few minutes of carelessness, and entered by the stern with a deadly espolonazo.
Al amenguar the march, the captain looked irked back, fearing to turn collide with it still in
line.

They thought of the invisible underwater. Now and then gunshots rang. The escort the convoy pulled
and pulled, going from side to side with agile developments. The enemy had fled, as wolves howl
before the watchful dogs. At other times it was a false alarm, and
wounded with guns, steel whip water in the desert.

There was an annoying enemy that storm that disrupts the convoys, more frightening than torpedoes.
The fog was thick and white as albumin, which fell on the ships, making them sail into blind
in broad daylight, filling unnecessary space siren roars, leaving see the water that sustained
no other boats nearby, which could leave a time to another of the blurry atmosphere, announcing
his appearance with a shock and a big crunch, mortal. So the sailors had to march for days, and when
they finally got rid of this shroud, breathing with the satisfaction of waking up from a nightmare,
another wall Cinderella and nebulous advancing on the water, wrapping
them back into night.

The brave men and serene vowed to see the bar closing endless horizon haze.

Such trips were not like Ferragut. Irritated him straight up like a soldier, having to adapt to
the speed of ships negligible.

Will be even more enraged obliged to obey the commander of the convoy, which was often an old
sailor character authoritarian.

Because of this, one of the arrivals to Marseilles to the maritime authorities said their determination
not to sail more so. They had enough four expeditions. Were good for masters fearful, unable to leave
port if they did not in sight an escort of destroyers, whose crews,
the slightest incident, intended to lay the boats into the water,
taking refuge on the coast.

He felt safer going alone, trusting to his skill, no other help than his deep knowledge of the routes
of the Mediterranean.

The request was granted. He owned the ship, and feared losing their cooperation when scarce both
the means of transport. In addition, the Mare Nostrum, for its speed, deserved to be employed
addition, special services and prompt.

It was in Marseille a few weeks waiting for a shipment of shells, and stroll as always the
Mediterranean capital. The afternoons were spent on the terrace of a cafe in the Cannebière.
The Von Kramer remember sometimes arose in his memory. "Do you have shot ?...» wanted know, but
its findings were not very successful. Councils of war avoided the publicity for their acts of justice.
A dealer friend of Ferragut Marseille remembered that, some months
before, had been executed a German spy caught in the harbor.

Three lines in the newspapers just realizing his death. It was said an official ... And Marseille
went on to talk of war news, while Ulysses thought the run could be none other than Von Kramer.

On
the same afternoon he met. Marched down the Rue Saint-Ferreol, looking storefronts, the cries
of various drivers of cars and cars that do not succeeded at passing their vehicles on the narrow,
crowded road caught his eye. Saw in a carriage to a blonde woman with her back to him, accompanied
by two naval officers English. Freya immediately thought ... His hat, his suit, all he could
distinguish of person, not remembered at all to the other. And yet, when he left the car, no
he came to see the face of this unknown, the image of the adventurous
persisted in his memory.

Finally ended up getting angry with himself, owing to the absurd similarity was found no reason.
How could this English Freya who was with two officers? ... How German refugees in Barcelona
could slip in France, where it was clearly known military police?

... Still irritated him the suspicion that this was like a rest the old love, which made him
see Freya throughout blond woman.

At nine o'clock the next day, when the captain dressed in his cabin
for go ashore, Toni opened the door.

His gesture was gloomy and shy at the same time, as if to give bad news.

- That is there - he said laconically.

Ferragut looked at him quizzically ... Who was "that »?...

- Who will it be?

... The Naples! The blonde demon who brings disgrace!

... Let's see if that witch still leaves us a few weeks, like last
time.

He apologized, as if she had a foul in the service. The vessel was attached to the dock by a walkway
and all he could enter.

The pilot was an enemy of these moorings, which left free passage to the curious and importunate.
When he realized the visit, lady was already in the deck near the cameras. He remembered well the
way of living: wanted to go ahead, but he had made the stop as he
came Caragol to warn Captain.

- Christ! - He murmured -.

Christ! ...

And his surprise, surprise, was not allowed to launch another exclamation.

Then

angry.

- Cast it! ... That the two men grab and put in the dock, even by
main force.

But Toni hesitated, not daring to enforce such orders, and the impetuous Ferragut launched outside
the cabin for himself what he had commanded.

As he passed the hall, someone came at the same time by the side of the deck. Was Caragol trying
to block the way to a woman, but she, mocking their short-sighted eyes, was slipping little
by little from his body and the wooden partition.

To see the captain, Freya ran towards him extending her arms.

- You! - Joyful voice said -. Knew you were here, in spite of these
men claimed Otherwise ... Heart told me ... Good morning, Odysseus!

Caragol turned his eyes toward the spot where he guessed the presence of the second, as if imploring
forgiveness.

With females could not enforce any order ... Toni, meanwhile, seemed embarrassed by this woman
who looked hostile.

The two disappeared. Ferragut could not figure out how the leak was, but he was glad it. He feared
that the new arrival in his presence allude to things of the past.

Long time was watching her. He had thought to recognize back the day before, and now I was sure
I would have gone on with indifference at her head. In fact, Was the same two officers who
accompanied the British? ... He seemed much higher than another, with a thinness that made clear his
skin, giving it a sickly transparency.

The nose was prominent and sharp, his eyes sunken in circles shining blackish their watersheds.

These
eyes began to look to the master humble and pleading.

- You! - Ulises
exclaimed in surprise -.

You! ... What are you doing here? ...

Freya spoke with a shyness servant. Yes, it was she who had known the day before long before
he turned, forming immediately in order to come in search of him. He could hit like last time they
met, she was willing to suffer all ... But with him!

- Save me, Ulysses, take me with you ... I ask this more painfully than in Barcelona.

- How you doing here? ...

She understood the captain's astonishment at finding in enemy territory, the concern felt by
him to see a spy on his ship.

He looked around to be convinced that they were alone, and spoke softly. The doctor had sent
to France to "work" in the ports. He alone could reveal the secret.

Ulysses was indignant at this confidence.

- Go away! - Said in an angry voice -. All I hear from you ... I do not care what's yours, no
I want to know ... Out! Why am I looking for?

But she did not seem disposed to do his bidding.

Instead of leaving, he fell with disappointment in one of the couches of the camera.

- I came - he said - to beg you to save me. I beg you seen ... I'm going to die; I guess my end
is near if you do not me a helping hand, I feel the vengeance of
the mine ... Keep me, Odysseus!

Do not let me return to earth: I have fears ... So I feel safe here,
at your side!

...

Fear, indeed, reflected in her eyes, remembering the last months of
his life Barcelona.

- The doctor is my enemy ... She protected me
so much at one time, leaving me as something old that must be abolished.

I have the certainty that I have condemned in the top ...

He shuddered, remembering the anger of the doctor when, at the back of one of his trips, learned
of the death of his faithful Karl. Captain Ferragut was for her a kind of demon invulnerable
and victorious, it escapes all dangers, killing the servers good cause. First, Von Kramer, now,
Karl ... Like I needed someone to vent his anger, Freya had taken responsibility for all the
misfortunes. For she knew the captain and had mixed in the affairs of "service".

The desire for revenge made her smile at the awesome lady with a fierce
expression.

The Spanish sailor was noted in high place. Precise orders had been given against him. "As
to !...» accomplices Freya are undoubtedly among these accomplices, for daring Ferragut to defend
recalling the tragic death of her son for not doing choir those who
wanted to exterminate them.

Weeks later, the angry doctor had been kind and smiling, as in another
time.

"My dear, it is to give you a tour of France. We need an agent we are aware of movement from
ports of exit and entry of ships to our submersible know where to wait. Marine officers are
gallant, and a woman beautiful may win her affection.

"

She had tried to disobey. Go to France, where his works were known
before of war!

... Back to the danger when they had become accustomed to life in safe neutrals! ... But their
attempts to resist were never carried out. Lacked will: the "service" had become an automaton.

-
And here I am suspecting that maybe marched to death, but to fulfill
the orders that receipt, striving to be enjoyable and thus delay the
fulfillment of his revenge ... I'm like a condemned man who knows
he is going to die and try to be necessary to take a few month sentence.

-
How did you come in France? - Asked him, ignoring his accent painful.

Freya shrugged. In his office is easily changed nationality. It was now public of a Republic
of America. The doctor had given him the necessary papers to crossing the border.

- But here - he continued - I have more secure than in a prison. I have been given the means to enter,
and they alone can make me leave. I am completely in their power.

What will you do to me? ...

The terror had suggested at times desperate resolutions.

Wanted to complain to itself, to appear before the French authorities
telling his story, letting them know the secrets of that era possessed.

But he was afraid of his past: there were many evils I have been doing against this country. Perhaps
the spare his life taking into account the spontaneity of his act, but the prison, the prison with
his hair cut, dressed in rough serge, condemned to silence, perhaps
suffering hunger and cold, he inspired a repulsion invincible ...
No: before death.

He continued his life of espionage, a blind eye to the future, living in the moment This, avoiding
thinking, considering happy when I saw a few days ahead security.

Ferragut encounter with Marseille on a street had revived, giving new hope.

- Get me out of here, keep me with you.

In your ship in the world I can live forgotten, as if dead ... And if you dislike my presence, take
me away from France, let me in a distant country.

Wanted out of this isolation in enemy territory having to obey their superiors, like a caged
animal that receives punctures through the bars. The fear had presentiment of his approaching
death.

- I do not want to die, Ulises! ... I'm not even old to die. I love my body, I am the first my love,
and I am terrified to think that I can be shot.

Went through their eyes a reflection phosphoric teeth chattering collided with terror.

- Do not want to die - repeated -. There are times when I guess I follow and surround me ... Such
Once I have known and await the moment of surprise in the middle of work ... Help me: make me
out of here, my death is certain. I have done so much damage! ...

He paused, as if calculating all the crimes of his former life.

-
The doctor - he went - with patriotic enthusiasm, which inflames to
continue their jobs.

I lack your faith: I am German and I am disgusted to be a spy ... I feel ashamed considering my current
life, I think every night in the outcome of my abominable works; employment calculation can
give to my listings and my reports, I see ships torpedoed ... How many beings have died because
of me? I have visions of my conscience torments me. Save me!

... I can not. I feel a terrible fear. I have so much to atone! ...

She had risen gradually from the couch, and would seek protection
Ferragut towards him arms outstretched, while humble and caressing,
by a desire for seduction which prevailed over all his actions.

-
Let! - Shouted the ocean -.

Do not come closer ... Do not touch me!

He felt the same anger that had made him end his interview brutal
Barcelona.

Was irritated the tenacity of this adventure, which, after tragic influence in his life, wanted
engage it again.

But a cold feeling of restraint and compassion made him speak with
some kindness.

If he needed money to flee, he would give it without any haggling.

Could set the figure, the captain was ready to satisfy all your desires, but nothing to live
together.

We would a large sum to secure his future and not see it.

Freya made a gesture of protest, while the marine regretted his generosity
... Why favor to a woman who reminded him of the death of his son?

... What was common between the two?

... Naples vile sick love had paid with their misfortune ... That each follow his destiny belonged
to different worlds ... Was I going to have to defend lifetime of this female sticky?

Apart from this, I was not sure he really say now ... Everything about her was false. Even certainly
knew his real name and his past life ...

- Go away! - Roared menacingly -.

Leave me alone!

He extended his powerful paws to her seeing that refused to obey.

Would raise soil with rough stretch, to take as a slight burden off camera, off the ship,
throwing away the same as if it were a regret.

But an invincible repugnance inspired this body abundant temptations: he was afraid his contact, wanted
to escape the power of his flesh surprises ... In addition, he was
not going to mistreat at every meeting, as a professional scoundrel
who mix love and bumps.

Remembered sadly its violence in Barcelona.

And as Freya, instead of leaving, he dropped back on the couch with a discouragement seemed
to defy his anger, was he who fled to end the interview.

Entered his cabin, slamming the door shut. This flight took her to it its inertia. He wanted to follow
a young panther jump, but his hands struck the obstacle just immobilized,
while still sounding inside keys and locks.

Desperately hit the door. His fists were injured in unsuccessful pushing.

- Ulysses, open!

... Listen!

In vain he cried as if she gave an order, exasperated at not seeing obeyed. His anger was stirred
powerless against the unyielding strength of wood.

Suddenly he began to mourn. Was softened his will to feel weak and helpless as an abandoned
child. All his life seemed to concentrate on her tears and her voice pleading.

Run your fingers through the door, feeling the moldings, sliding on the painted surfaces, as
if you fumble a crack, a hole, which allowed him to reach the man
I was on the other side.

Instinctively bent his knees, hitting the mouth to the opening of
the lock.

- Owner mine! - A voice murmured beggar -.

Breakthrough! ... Do not forsake me. I think to death if you do not save me.

Ferragut heard, and to escape her moan was away to the back of the
cabin.

Then opened the round window that looked out on the deck and ordered to a sailor who seek to
second.

- Don Antonio!

Antonio! - Shouted several voices throughout the ship.

Toni arrived, sticking his face into the arena to get angry complaints of his captain. "Why what
had been left alone with this woman? ... Should immediately remove
the vessel, although were subjected to violence ... He commanded.
"

The pilot walked away with a bewildered air, scratching his beard
the same as if just received difficult to execute a warrant.

- Save
me, my love - still moaning imploring whisper -. Forget who I am ...
Think Only in Naples ... in which met in Pompeii ... Remember happiness
he alone, of the times I swore never to leave ... You are a gentleman!

He
paused voice. Ferragut heard footsteps on the other side of the door.
Toni fulfill your orders.

But the appeal again to resume a few moments,
concentrated, persistent, attentive only his desire to flout the new
obstacles that came to stand between her and the captain.

- Whether
you hate me? ... Remember the happiness you say, you yourself swore
you'd never been so fortunate. I can rise again the past. You do not
know what I can to make you sweet existence ... And want to miss!
...

There was a crash at the door, a touch of bodies pushing an anti-rub
wood.

Toni had entered, followed by Caragol.

- There's enough, ma'am
- "His voice was grim, to hide his emotion -. Did not realize that
the captain did not want to see? ... Do not you see that is clogging?
... We ... Up!

He tried to help him up, separating the mouth of the
lock, but was repelled with Freya easily to the strong ocean. It seemed
lacking in strength, no courage to repeat his tough action. It was
fearful the beauty of this woman was still shaken by the contact of
firm that just touch curves during the short fight. Her virtue had
been sleepy the torment of a resurrection without object. "Ah, no!
... Operated by other ejecting. "

- Ulysses, throw me! - She cried
again hitting his face to the lock -. And you, my love, allow it?
... So what do you love me? ...

After this desperate appeal was silent
a moment. The door remained motionless behind her did not seem to
be any living being.

- Goodbye - continued quietly, his throat swelling
with sobs -. I do not see ... I am going to die soon: heart tells
me ... I will die for you! ... Maybe someday cry thinking you could
save.

Someone had stepped in to start your rebel Freya immobility.
Was Caragol requested by imploring eyes of the pilot.

His big hands
helps her up, without her repeated protests that he had repeated Toni.
Due and shedding tears, seemed to submit to parental help and advice
Cook.

- Up, good lady! - Said Caragol -. A little encouragement and
do not cry ... To everything there is comfort in this world.

Swollen
right hand locked in her two hands, and passing the other arm around
her waist, the directing was little by little to the departure lounge.

-
Believe in God - he said -. Why look for the captain, who is back
in his land to his wife own? ... Other men there that are free, and
you can communicate with them without falling in mortal sin.

Freya
was not listening. Near the door was still the head, initiating a
reverse to the captain's cabin.

- Ulises! ... Ulises! - Screamed.

-
Believe in God, madam - Caragol said again, while pushing with your
flabby belly and his hairy chest.

A charitable purpose filled his
mind. Had a remedy for pain of this woman beautiful, that desperation
had become more interesting.

- Come on, lady ... Trust me, my child.
On reaching the deck, was leading into his domain. Freya sat in
the kitchen, no know with certainty where he was. He saw through her
tears to this old obese, goodness priests, going from one side to
another to collect bottles and mixing liquids, stirring spoon in a
glass with a merry jingle.

- Drink without fear ... There is anger
that resists to this medicine.

The chef offered him a glass, and
she, shocked, drank and drank, his face contracting by alcoholic strength
of the liquid. Still crying, while savoring mouth a thick sweetness.
Her tears were falling in the brew that slid between his lips
