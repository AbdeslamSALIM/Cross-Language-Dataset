 Even the most conscienceless libertines figure we all means trouble before,
and though will not find any, they will stop frightened before proposing to her friends this way
of numbing the mother or husband to have them then peacefully. Moreover, Margarita, who was alone in the
house of Martha, unscrupulous woman and that everything is paid,
what need was to infuse his mother sleep?

We
say that infanticide is worse, that infanticide is the most heinous
of crimes, but infanticide was necessary to motivate the torture of
Margarita, whose goodness is spared thanks to delirium.

Mad, throws his son into a pond, where they drowned, while his mother gives him the narcotics intentionally,
all over the clearing of his trial, and without the narcotic remove or put the argument or development
of the action. Is a refinement of realism mischief and sinful, and is entirely useless to spare. Dreadful
crime is also the death of Valentin given at close range by Faust,
but it was inevitable, is justified aesthetically.

Also, here is forgive any defect in the poet, if he had, in favor
of the tough character and military honor, the brother of Margarita.

The pride and arrogance that inspired her, before his fall, the anger that causes the loss of his
honor, all he utters the words before and during the duel, and its terrible counterclaims to Margarita,
when moribund, all this is real and beautiful at the same time.
