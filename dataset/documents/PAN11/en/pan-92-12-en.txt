 Made I happen
also to journey I found myself at the time one of these expeditions. Will copy here the point of
my diary that refers to this passage.

"... More than forty boats were preparing to depart at once from the port of Loreto, composing
a veritable fleet. Priests and traders who were incorporated into the expedition, they wanted
I ordered me to lead the way, traveling in company, and how could practice better, since my
rowers were the ablest, of course I accepted the honor they gave me. At the end of the day
we stopped for the night on a roomy bench Sandy, not far from a forest. Then I was taken to
enjoy a promising perspective, canoes as they came slowly and successively greeted by triumphant
shouts or derision of those who speak in advance. All Indians then scattered into the forest,
and bringing back wood, some with canes that armed beds for travelers, and symmetric key stakes
thick on the ground to suspend, for separate groups the beds belonging to the rowers in each
boat: in the center of these groups went on a fire, and the outside parle shone at intervals, and
other fires where making dinner. "

"Our camp, which brought together over six hundred people, had the most curious aspect I could
imagine. They spoke to him almost all the languages ??of the province, without being confused each
other different nations. All the white people had gathered in the center while here and there,
the Baures, the Itonama, the Movimas, the Cayuvava, the Canichana Moxos and forming various groups,
conversing in their respective dialects. The little beach transuto lonely before the theater
was the most animated. Each group of white beds, hanging around a bonfire, in contrast with
the nets of travelers and the row of canoes which extended majestically along the banks [1]: sitting
all on the beach after dinner in the community, raising thousands cheerful conversation, to which
the strangeness of different lenguages ??was more originality.
