 A philosopher
German would say the money is put into the self in an absolute manner. More fool is thus tormented, because
they want one for the money, which tormented because they want one because it is clean, well-bred,
elegant, educated etc., all qualities that are purchased at artificially same as money, that
money should be more or less quantity. Maybe I better not the last porter in Madrid, sometimes
physical, sometimes intellectual, sometimes morally considered and yet, assuming single, any beautiful
lady might have even the caprice of love Me, not censor anyone, but if the porter fall in love, everyone
have this passion for extravagance or folly.
