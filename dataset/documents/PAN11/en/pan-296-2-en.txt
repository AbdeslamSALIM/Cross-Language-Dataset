 Ah what a sight for a man of faith! That summed up for me all the marvel of the progress
and glory of man, all the dignity of this being, created in the moral likeness of God, carrying
in his mind the immortal attributes of a thoughtful and intelligent soul. Each wheel, cylinder,
each cog of the machine. Bogota pictured each muscle, vital organ and saw the whole structure
of humanity, because that machine was inspired by man's motion, strength, tenacity, genius, faith,
life, spirit, light, civilization, progress, and immortality. My
soul was moved to a deep meditation.
