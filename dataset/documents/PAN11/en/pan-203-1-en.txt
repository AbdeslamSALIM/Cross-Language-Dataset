 

Apolonio's telegram said: "Back in Castrofuerte tell me I'm heir fabulous fortune. I'll get
away. We will live a successful life together .-- Peter. "

Bellarmine's telegram said: "I am saved. Peter has saved me.

Peter himself will take you out there and will bring me at once.
We shall all be happy .-- Anguish.

"

Bellarmine is maintained with arms outstretched, but now look at the sky, but Apollonius.

Apolonio hesitate a second, nothing more than a second.

Ineluctable force, a requirement of fate also leads with open arms,
bottle in hand, and tall, aggressive, to Bellarmine.

Bellarmine ahead of his meeting. Belarmino and Apolonio ... embrace in a hug quiet, dark, warm
and fraternal.

- Never have I hated, I swear - says Apollonius, after -.

I've never hated, even if you despised me.

- I've never despised
- Bellarmine murmurs softly.

This is the first time you speak, and you are treated with spontaneity,
because in the mystery chest were close to each other, for many years.

-
I admire you and envy - Apolonio confesses with a blush.

- Me too,
I've been envious - Bellarmine says, frankly.

- You're like my other
half.

- Yes, and you my other figurehead.

(Figurehead = hemisphere.)

- We are united. What I write dramas now.

You will be my inspiration, as Socrates Sophocles what was, at least,
Valeiro and assured me.

Sounds far, the bell that called the refectory.

- Concludes fill the bottle - Bellarmine advised.

- It's true. But I assure you it is the first time I do this.

- I know.

Van arm through the garden of daffodils, wrapped in golden haze of the sun, which produces a
fleeting illusion, as if alleviated the severity of material things.

- But we are not dreaming? - Apollonius asks, yearning -. Barely touch the ground where floor.

- Looks like a dream. The tetrahedron is a dream.

Only true love, goodness, friendship.

Inside the house, the inmates in a row, are waiting to arrive Apollonius
and Bellarmine in order to get to the point up to the dining room
and pastries.

- Where do those crazy walk? - Asks the sister of Dolores.

And out in search of them.

Seeing them come from the bracero, along a path, the nun crosses herself:

- Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Am I dreaming? What miracle is this? It is not sleep, no. It is true .--
Y added, and the pair of them: - Thank God you have been reconciled.

The Lord has touched on the heart. Nothing is more palatable than forgiveness over resentment.
Today, that is a day of glory, I also dare to ask you to forgive me. For years now, and although
the best intentions, I have done suffer. And worse: I have contributed, with my stunning foolish,
to make unhappy Sorrows, perhaps Don Pedrito, and, of course, to you. Well I paid! God forgive
me. Forgive you.

- What Nah, you said there, Felicita?

Nah, you is not simple.

Nah, you, unknowingly, and therefore of handling those years ago,
has been the deus ex machina of this day the happiest day of our life,
Don Pedrito, anguish, Belarmino and mine.

- That's right - Belarmino
said.

And then, musing -. How long?

- What we have left to live - says Apollonius, triggering stage emphatically.

And he congratulated the telegrams show. The sister of Dolores, invaded by grief, almost faint,
puts his hands to the heart.

- Everyone has come when happiness - whispered, as if talking to herself -. To all, but me. Much
should God reward me in another world!

Already incorporated Apollonius and Bellarmine in the two rows of inmates. And move the rows awkwardly,
with bastoneo, coughs and shuffling. Bellarmine walks, as always: head down, smiling and absorbed
in his inner world. Apollonius, as always, and from his youth, go hispid, erect the skull, slowly
and pontifical excellence. In the arms, ostentatious, leads the bottle of Vichy water, apocryphal,
assuming everyone else look with envy that mark of distinction, evidence of wealth and signs of stomach
pain.

EPILOGUE.

THE ESTUDIANTÓN.

Froilan Escobar, alias Aligator Estudiantón and died of starvation, which falls within the logic
immanent things.

He himself had a glimpse of the disastrous end that awaited him, because between notes and notes
left at his death that I read this sentence: "He who devotes his
days and exercise in search of Truth, Goodness and Beauty, is incompatible
with life by at least, life as we find in today's society.

Modern life is denial of Truth, Good and Beauty, and, conversely, the Truth, Goodness and Beauty
are the negation of modern life.

In result, the affiliation in the three categories or waiver to live,
or will be taken as a revolutionary and anarchist.

"Really, who would Escobar seen so wretched plastic forms, so shabby and filthy, never could guess
that the renowned Alligator had professed in the category of Beauty. True the unfortunate allusion
to the supersensible and spiritual beauty, not to the physical and perishable. Anyway, had to
be fatally starve. But the strange, paradoxical, is that died at home of a butcher named Serapio,
who had collected for charity. The Matachine Free gave a closet with a bunk, where shelter,
and some falls, debris or scraps of meat, kind of Cordilla, to eat. Unfortunately, Escobar was
herbivorous, and repelled the flesh to such an extent that before eating it was left to die of
starvation. What Escobar and Serapio contrast! The butcher, so plump and red looked like a beef
skinning, was to incorporate more corporeal human body in its most
material.

Escobar, yellow, blue, resonant, almost ethereal, spiritualized was
the projection of spirit people in their transit through the mud corporeal.

At

death, Escobar left wealth of writings, mostly letters and sketches. I was lucky see them and
examine them, before the throw to Serapio trash bin. Some of the thoughts, expressed in concise
form, I was amazed and filled with perplexity. For example:

"The two historical facts harmful to the advancement of pure science and the final rule of culture
were the invention of paper and the invention of printing. "

"If instead of writing reams of paper to write on a sheet of parchment diminished, deserves to be read
then, because they do not write but write what he deserved. "

"All public libraries should close."

"The most stupid thing I read is this sentence from Carlyle: The best university in these times
is a library. I reply: The best university would be a barracks. I mean a culture socialized
and enforced in the manner of military discipline. Military discipline is abominable because it
is undeveloped. Modern culture is abhorrent because it is undisciplined. Nobody has the right
to have more culture than it deserves, according to their abilities
and social function that is to be used.

In the current state of the culture there that are simple generalísimos
ranchers and, conversely, there are miserable ranchers great spark
gifted, frustrated men and undervalued, which had been generalísimos
own right, if there is proper cultural organization barracks.

"

It seems to me that in writing the above lines, Escobar thought Belarmino and Apolonio.

As I was reading the drafts of the Alligator, I could only remember the great gift Amaranth
Fraile. What states and what the two characters opposite! Were in the relationship the two poles
of an axis. One was the self-taught, the other is the dogmatist. Both were suffering sciendi
libido, lust for knowledge, scientific lust.

I mention here Escobar's posthumous papers, not because I have reminded Don Amaranth but because
they speak of Belarmino and Apolonio, and particularly one who provided me interesting and
useful document, which the reader can also take advantage.

Copy everything that came up with Escobar on the two shoemakers, it would be annoying. Be moving
only some outlandish opinions. "Bellarmine had to invent their language because it lacked instruction,
reading. Have read since childhood variety of classical authors How would come to speak and write
Bellarmine? Max Muller repeated countless times, and evidenced by many others, that thought and
language are identical. By the author's style becomes aware of his intelligence, metaphorical
style, haughty style, archaic style, cut style, style naked plain style, exquisite style, colorful
style, style abstract, etc.., etc., all of them, each in itself, show limited intelligence and lack
of thought. The completeness and merging all of them, dominating every way according to reason
thought: Cervantes, the Spanish first thinker. "

And later:

"The primary quality of the playwright (read Apollonius) is the ability for effective simulation.
This simulation is not skin deep and surface. The playwright, from the depths of his own soul,
begins to pretend to himself, but the more obscure and personal ego remains and inhibited always
absent of emotion. So the playwright is unable to truly love. There is a paradox of the playwright,
is the same as Diderot called paradox of the actor. The communicates emotion, but that is raised.
To provoke an emotion must be kept cold. They mourn the actors who can fake tears. Those who cry
in earnest, make you laugh. The same with the playwright. The drama created the kind of man
that causes love at all women, because he pretends to love, but no love: Don Juan. The playwright
goes through life inventing dramas, dramas discovered. It would seem that this gift of invention
(inventing means to discover) that comes from living playwright drama. On the contrary. The
living do not see the drama drama sees his individual drama. And if the playwright if he happens
to be a victim in a drama vivo, it remains balanced, serene. Pretend to be an actor forever,
and always the spectator, viewer himself. Such is the paradox of the playwright. Anyone who
drives through life with gestures pathetic accent is a simulator,
a playwright in the making.

These men are necessary in the world, because without that failed passion will naturally contagious
humanity would end, apathy and wisdom. But alas, if these men predominated, whose marrow VIP is
an absence, a void, a bubble, as seen in the levels, bubble hardly able to focus ... and if this
kind of male-dominated, humanity, each more swollen and empty, burst, like the frog who wanted to
equal the ox. Providentially against the playwright is the philosopher (read Bellarmine). The
philosopher is constituted the inverse of the playwright. On the outside, calm, impassive,
in the most secret, burning unquenchable. The philosopher is a madman preserved in ice. Because the
ice is the great conservative, and to the passions for things like groceries, that once they
are removed air and light to get stale, stale. The philosopher lives all the dramas, never is the
viewer. Feels the pain of others as their own suffering, the pain multiplies it by himself all the
pain outside, and so in pain as the alien himself experiences this and that contact embers of
the bonfire pain is universal, the drama of life. The playwright, who suffers its last and shameful
emptiness, rushes to the surface, appears to emphatic extent, as the caster, and it spells the passion
and frenzy. Passion Search corrective imagined the intimate apathy. Moreover, as the inside
can not mourn, outside fails to smile. The philosopher, on the other hand, looking in apathy,
in serenity, in the wisdom, a corrective to the overwhelming passion hidden. That is the sophrosyne.
The weeping philosopher smile inside and out. When the philosopher is reached when the drama,
the drama is so intense that it feels like to be destroyed, not his own heart, but the whole
universe, and no longer exists. It is the ultimate apathy and indifference ataraxia. But the philosopher
needs the playwright, not to be sterile or perish. And the playwright needs the philosopher for
not be vain or disappear. Sophocles needs of Socrates, Sophocles and Socrates needs. The Socratic
dialogues are dramatic and sofóclitos dialogues are philosophical
background.

"

Something like that of Socrates and Sophocles Apollonius told him to Bellarmine in the asylum
and in quite dramatic circumstances, which makes me believe that
Escobar and Apollonius had reached to be friends, and the cobbler
was inspired by the theories of Estudiantón.

Be observed that these theories are entirely opposite to those of
Don Amaranth.

For Don Amaranth, playwright is entering the individual drama, and the philosopher, who was away
from him. For Escobar, which enters the drama is the philosopher, and playwright is the remaining
distance. Baffling disparity and contrast of human opinions! The doctrine of Don Amaranth is refutable,
and no less defensible, and another of Escobar. And in short, all human opinions. The error
of those who call for a human opinion possesses absolute truth. Just be true in part, to enclose
a powder or a nugget of truth. When a search engine Gold says it has struck gold, it implies
that has taken over all the gold keep the bowels of the earth, but that which has struck gold, some
gold.

So true Don may be the Amaranth as Escobar, and between truth and
Don Escobar Amaranth extend infinitely countless other truths intermediate,
which is what mathematicians call the ultracontinuo.

Irreducible truths as there are so many views.

I wanted present, about Belarmino and Apolonio, the views of Mr.
Amaranth and Escobar, because clearly documented including all others,
as being the most antithetical, are the most comprehensive.

And singularly I have appealed to science and teaching of these gentlemen,
to hide that face Belarmino and Apolonio, and I have had no point
of view.

Belarmino and Apolonio have existed, and I have loved.

I'm not saying they have existed in the flesh on the face of the
earth have been around for me and for me.

That's it. Exist, multiply and love.

Above I alluded to an interesting and useful document Escobar left
among his posthumous papers: is a complete glossary of all words and
terms that Bellarmine was served, accompanied the sense that he used
them.

I have culled, for convenience, those that reader has already heard
Bellarmine, which are appended to this volume.

The vocabulary has been collected by the following lines Escobar Preliminary

"Max
Müller says that placing the twenty-three or twenty-four letters of
the alphabet in all possible combinations would be obtained all the
words that have been used in all world languages ??and all have been
employed.

Taking twenty-three letters as a basis, the number of words would be: 25,852,016,738,884,976,640,000,
and twenty-four basis: 620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000.

Bellarmine did not use such wealth lexical, or even is close to Dante,
Shakespeare and Cervantes, which used thousands of words.

Belarmino was about five hundred.

I remember reading somewhere that Racine in his writings 400-voice
was not, to be his language so ductile, fine and nuanced.
