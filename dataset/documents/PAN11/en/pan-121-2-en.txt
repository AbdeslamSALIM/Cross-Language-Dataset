the keys, and opened, I went and hid in my room. Had not yet become them of the party they go every
night, which is also the man who kills me. The get heard, I heard them laughing, celebrating
man's jokes. To distract the penalties for my absence might be supposed that I had my wife, he
had been more talkative and humorous than usual.

"I had to wait quiet to lie down and wait even for that Beatrice fell asleep. During some time there
was some energy in me that now I shudder. I thought about killing Beatriz stabbed to death
while he slept.

"I assure you that I entered her bedroom with this tremendous purpose. Laugh now. It is very
funny, is funny what you'll say. I do not use weapons, I have only one who brought me gumi
This officer friend, who was of those who came in Tetouan. With that
