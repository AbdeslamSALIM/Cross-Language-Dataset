 To
hear, suddenly stopped Doña Paca, as the little mouse that night, feeling constantly gnaw steps
or the man's voice. Was heard only, for a long time, the occasional sigh very profound for
the lady, who then began to complain and grumble under his breath. The other is not complaining. Quick
crisis had made the genius of the unhappy lady, determining a sharp turn of vane. Trocáronse
anger and displeasure to the point tenderness and affection. Occur soon the clearest symptom
of sedation, he was a keen remorse of what he had said and shame to remember, did not mean anything
because the grunts, and complain imaginary pain. As Benina not respond to these demonstrations,
Doña Paca, and about midnight, it started to call her "Nina, Nina, if you only knew how bad
I am! What a nochecita I'm going! Looks like I applied a hot iron on the side, and tear me to pulling
the leg bones. I have the head as if I had got the brains, putting in place of bread crumbs
and parsley finely chopped ... Not bothered, I have not told me make a cup of lime, rub me back and
give me a ballot salicylate bromide, or sulphonal ... This is horrible. You sleep like a basket.
Well, woman, rest, a little fat ... I do not want to bother. "

Without a word, Nina left the pallet, and throwing a skirt, made the
cup tila in economic stove, and before or after giving medicine to
the sick, and then rubs, and finally went to bed with her to coo like
a child, until getting sleep it off.

Mrs. Longing forget his previous rant, I thought the best way was clear loving the evil expressions
of ideas before, and so, while his companion cooed, he would say: "If I did not have you I do
not know what would happen to me. And then I complain to God, and say things and to insult
him as if he were a nobody. I really deprived of many goods, but I have given your company and
friendship, which is worth more than gold and silver and shiny ... Y I remember now, what do you advise
I should do in case of renewed D. Francisco Morquecho and D. José María Porcell embassy with that
inheritance? ...

- But, Madam, if thats what you dreamed ... and such men are a thousand years achantaditos very underground.

-
You are right: I dreamed ... But if not those, others might come
to the same music the best day.

- Who says no? Have you ever dreamed
you with empty boxes?

Because this is a sign of inheritance safe.

- And you, what you dream?

- Me? Last night we were with a black bull.

- So that means that we will discover a hidden treasure ... Look you,
who tells us that this old house, once inhabited the rich merchants,
there is within such partition wall or a pot full of pelucones well?

-
I have heard tell that in the last century lived here a few stockists
of cloth, powerful and when he died ... no money was not found.

It may be that the paninis. There have been cases, many cases.

- I have certainly money is on this farm ... But you know where they
hid démontrer these indinos.

Is not there a way to find out?

- I do not know ... I do not know! - Benina murmured, letting fly
his mind wander to the eastern spells proposed by Almudena.

- And
if the walls do not, under the tiles of the kitchen or pantry can
be what these gentlemen hid, thinking that they would enjoy in the
afterlife.

- May be ... But it is more likely to be in the walls,
or a guess, on roofs, including beams ...

- I think you're right.

The same can be up than down. I assure you that when strong floor in hallways and dining room, and
swept through the mansion as if to collapse, I think I feel a ruidillo
... metal and they sound and they ding ... Have not you felt?

- Yes,
ma'am.

- And if not, try it now.

Date walks around the room, stomping, and hear ...».

Benin and his wife obeyed his command, with no less conviction and faith that she, in effect
... heard a metallic clang, which could not only come from the huge
amounts of silver and gold (probably more gold than silver) embedded
in the ancient factory.

This illusion both asleep, and dreams were still hearing the ting, ting ...

The house was like a huge body, sweating, and each of its infinite pores let go one ounce, or
center, or twenty-one and a quarter penny.

XXVII

In the early morning the next day was Cambroneras Benina way, with
his basket on his arm thinking, not without concern, in the exaltation
of the good Almudena, which would lead to early madness, if she, with
her very quick, he could not restrain the right.

Below the Puerta de Toledo and found the other poor Burlada calling a stubborn child. Said
to her fellow parishioners who had moved his home to the Bridge, not being able to fix in the
kidney of Madrid with the high cost of rent and the meanness of the fruit of charity. In a
shack by the river gave accommodation for little more than nothing,
and this advantage united to ventilate the field trips that gave morning
and afternoon, the river and point to point river.

Asked by Benin on the Moor and his blind housing, replied that it had seen near the fountain,
past the bridge, asking, but did not know where he dwelt.

"Well, with God, madam - said goodbye Burlada -.

Are not you going to the point now? I do ... because although little is gained, there is a settlement.
Now I have every evening a good Platão ca food on Mr. Banker, who lives very entrance facing
the street las Huertas, and live as a canon, enjoying to see how he sharpens the snout to the
Caporal when the girl Mr. banker takes me my big cazolón of edible ... In short: with this and
something goes down, live, Dona Benin, and can be a bug in the rich. Goodbye, which have fun,
and find your health Moor ... Well, preserved. "

Followed each his due, and the entrance of the bridge on the road and ran Benina declining that
to the right leads to the suburb called Cambroneras, to the left bank Manzanares, at low land.
As he found a small square, bordered on the west side by a common building, the south by the railing
of the bridge abutment, and the other two unequal sides sandy slopes and embankments, are born
wild thorns, thistles and stunted grass. The site is colorful, airy, and might almost say happy,
because since it is dominated by the green banks of the river, washing and dish clothes tenderijos
thousand colors. To the west stands the mountains, and the opposite bank of the river cemeteries
San Isidro, San Justo, offering a spectacular view to both tuft of cemeteries and both dark
green cypress ... The melancholy inherent in the cemeteries not deprive them in that picture,
its decorative nature, as a good backdrop added by man to Nature.

To descend slowly toward the square, he saw the beggar two donkeys ... What do I say two? eight
ten or more donkeys, with their angry red collars, and with them groups of Gypsies sunbathing,
which flooded the neighborhood with its radiant light, cheerful giving shine to were adorned
with colorful gross and people. In the animated huddles all was laughter, chacota, running
to and fro. The girls jumped, the boys ran in pursuit; the children, dressed in rags, tumbled,
and donkeys were kept only serious and reflective in the midst of unrest and commotion. Old
gypsy women, some tanned complexion and black circle gossiping in separate Grandón arrimaditas the
building, a house regular racer look. Two or three girls wash cloths in the middle puddle
of the square is formed with escurriduras and waste from the local source. Some of these girls
were very dark skinned, almost black, which highlighted the filigree hanging their ears, others
color of mud, all agile, graceful, and drop-waisted esbeltísimas
language.

He sought the old familiar faces among those people, and look around here and there, thought he
recognized a gypsy who had once been in the hospital, going to pick up a friend of hers. He would
not approach the group in which such other disputed on a donkey whose sores were the subject
of lively discussion, and waited a favorable opportunity. This was soon come, because entangled
two churumbeles clean punch, the one with legs open from top to bottom, showing the black cops,
the other with a sort of turban on his head, and all dressed in a man's sweater: the gypsy
came to separate; ayudole Benin, and Immediately afterwards he holed in this way:

"Tell me, good friend, have you seen around here yesterday and today to a blind man they call
Almudena moro?

- Yes, ma'am: halo seen ... jablao with him - said the gypsy, showing two teeth racing ideal because
of their whiteness, equality and perfect preservation, which highlighted within the case two
large, fleshy lips, a violation retinto -. We saw in the bridge ... she said she dende dwelling
houses last night Ulpiano ... and ... I do not know what else ... Desapártese, good woman, this
beast is many inconsiderate, and kicks ...».

Benina fled from the chair, looking around him the great hind legs of a donkey, two peas beaten, and
to know the tricks and his education asses and gitanesca, and went to the houses that he motioned
that of perfect teeth.

Start of the esplanade a winding road or street towards the bridge of Segovia. In left as you enter
it, is the house broker, a vast hive of rooms poor worth six pesetas a month, and follow the walls
and outbuildings of a fifth or farm Valdemoro call. On the right, several ancient houses, dilapidated,
with indoor pens, dirty rusty fences and walls, offers the most irregular, decrepit and miserable
that architecture can be urban or rural.

Some doors boast beautiful tiles with San Isidro figure and date of construction, and the dilapidated
roofs, full of humps, twisted vanes are made of sheet iron, gracefully wrought. As you approach,
noting Benina somebody showed up to a fence on the ground floor,
he intended to ask was white donkey, excessive ear, which headed out
when she began speaking.

Came the woman in the first corral, paving, all bumpy, uneven door rooms and sheds or stalls
vivideros covered with rusted tin sheet: the only wall white or less dirty than the others, saw
a boat painted with ocher, three-masted frigate, child style, with fireplace which curves out
smoke. In this part, a woman scrawny wash rags in a trough: it was a gypsy, but paya. For the reasons
that this gave him, in the left part of the Roma lived with his donkeys, in peaceful community
room, for bed each other the holy ground, serving as pillows troughs the sound. On the right,
and also blocks borriqueñas, no less filthy than others went to sleep at night many of those who
are poor in Madrid: ten cents were given a portion of the soil, and live. Almudena detailed
signs of Benin, said the woman who, in fact, had slept there, but other poor people was gone
early, it did not provide those bedrooms to laziness. If the woman wanted a message for the Moor
blind, she would give, if come the second night to sleep.

Thanking the scrawny, left Benin, and went across the street below, watching to either side. Expected
to distinguish one of those bald hillocks of the Moroccan Fig sunbathing or delivered to his melancholy.
Ulpiano past houses, are not the right rather than arid, rocky slopes, landfill debris, slag
and sand. As a hundred meters from the Esplanade is a curved or zig-zag rather, leading to the station
Fleas, which is recognized from below by the stain of coal in the ground, the fences enclosure
of way, and something that steams and boils above all this. Next to the station, East Side,
a stream of sewage, black as ink, down a channel open slopes, and saving the road by a culvert,
runs to fertilize gardens before discharge into the river. " He stopped there, the beggar, looking
with a keen eye on ditch, where the water plunges for dark froth, and orchards, which left extend to
the river, planted with Swiss chard and lettuce. Continued even later, he knew that the African
liked the solitude of the countryside and the rough weather.

The day was peaceful: vivid light accentuated the bright green of the greens and the purple of
the cabbage, pour across the landscape shouts of joy. He walked and stood alone several times, looking
at gardens to feast their eyes and spirit, and the arid hills and saw nothing resembling the
image of a blind Moor sunbathing. Back to the Esplanade, down to the margin river, and ran the
laundry and the shacks that are supported by the buttress, and found no no trace of Mordechai.
Dejected, he turned to the Madriles up, intending to repeat the day following their investigations.

At
home he found no novelty, I mean, yes, found one that might well be called wonderful event, a
work of genius Samdai underground. Shortly after entering, said to Dona Paca with joy: "But,
my dear, do not you know ...? I wanted you to come to tell you ...

- What, ma'am?

- Who's been here D. Romualdo.

- D. Romualdo! ... I think you're dreaming.

- Do not know why ... Is it a thing of another world that this man come to my house?

- No, but ...

- Of course that has given me what to think ... What happens?

- Nothing happens.

- I thought something had happened at Mr. Priest, a nasty issue you,
and he came to me with complaints.

- There is nothing like that.

-
Do not you see him you leave home?

Do not you said that coming here?

- What a character!

Now I'm going to tell me sir where it goes, when it comes out.

-
Well, it's very strange ...

- But in the end, if you came, you would
say ...

- What should he tell me, if I have not seen?

... Let me explain.

A ten fell to keep me company, as usual, one of the girls in the cordonera, the largest and
Celedonia who is smarter than gunpowder.

Well, at about quarter to twelve, ding, call the door.

I told the girl: "Open, my daughter, and whoever it is you say I'm
not."

Since the scandal that I put together that rascal of the store, I
do not like seeing anyone when are not you ... Celedonia opened ...
I felt a deep voice here, as main person, I did not understand anything
... Then I told the girl who was a priest sir ...

- What signs?

-
Tall, handsome ... Neither old nor young.

- That's right - Benina
said, amazed at the coincidence -.

But do not let card?

- No, because he had forgotten his wallet.

-
And asked for me?

- No. He just said he wanted me for a matter of
great interest.

- In that case, again.

- Not very soon.

He said that this afternoon had to go to Guadalajara.

You've heard of that trip.

- I think so ... Someone said something down to the station, and the suitcase, and I do not
know why.

- Well, you see ... Celedonia can call for me to explain better. He said he felt therefore not meet
... that Guadalajara would come around ... But it is rare that you
do not have discussed the matter of interest that has to deal with me.

Or do you know and want to hold back the surprise?

- No, no, I do
not know anything about that ... What is safe Celedonia name?

- Just
ask ... Two or three times repeated: "Tell your wife that has been
here D. Romualdo.

"

Questioned the girl, it confirmed everything that is said by Dona
Paca.

It was very clever, and not I missed a single word they heard Mr.
Church, and described in faithful memory her face, her dress, her
accent ... Benina, confused for a moment because of the rarity of
the case, gave soon to be forgotten for having more important things
to occupy their understanding.

He found Vial so much better, they agreed to lift the bed, but to
take the first steps room and hallway, he found the lover with the
news that her right leg had been a bit invalid ... Expected, however,
that with good food and exercise regain its activity and that member
firm.

Would soon discharged.

Its recognition the two ladies, and particularly Benin, would last as long as life ... New
felt encouragement and new hope, cheerful omens soon get a good placement
allowed to live in ease, having their own home, however humble, y. ..

Anyway, that was lively man, and the pharmacy inexhaustible optimism
was restored sooner.

Since all attended Nina, and no need of the people under their care is forgot, saw fit to warn
the ladies of San Andrés Costanilla, sure have missed the absence
of a dependent.

"Yes, bring me the favor of a recadito on my part - said the gallant, admiring this new trait
estimate -. Tell you what you like, and certainly leave me in good stead. "

Benin did so early evening, and the next morning, with fresh, started again his walk to the
Bridge of Toledo.

XXVIII

He found a tattered old man who used to ask, with a girl in her arms, at the Oratory Olivet,
which told him crying over their misfortunes, which would be enough to break the rocks. The
daughter of this mother of the child, and one that stayed home sick one neighbor, had died two days'
misery, lady, tired of so much suffering laying the gofes in search
of a medium muffin. "

What did it now with two kids, not having to keep if for himself did not draw? The Lord had
his hand stopped. No saint in heaven and damned if he did. Wanted no more to die, and to bury
soon, soon, to stop seeing the world.

His only aspiration was to leave worldly colocaditas the two girls in a arrecogimiento of many
that are for infants of both sexes. And in order to see his evil
shadow!

... He had found a kind soul, a man ecclesiastical who offered the girls put in an asylum, but
when I thought I had managed the business, the devil came to break
it down ... "You see, Madam, do you know a man by chance very priest
showed up called D. Romualdo?

- I think so - said the beggar, again
feeling a lot of confusion or dizziness in head.

- Tall, well built,
habits of fine cloth, or old or young.

- He says that is called D.
Romualdo?

- D. Romualdo, yes ma'am.

- Will ... by chance, one that
has a niece named Doña Patros?

- I do not know how to call, but niece
is ... and pretty.

Well, you see my dog ??lucky.

Was in me, yesterday afternoon, right. I'm going home, and tell me that he had gone to Guadalajara.

-
Just ...-- Benina said, more confused, feeling that the real and imaginary scrambling and
intertwined in the brain -. But soon will come.

- I wonder if he returns. "

Then the old man said to be dying of hunger had not entered his mouth, in three days, more than a
piece of raw cod that occurred in a shop, and some of corruscos bread, dipped in the fountain
to soften them, because they had no bone in the mouth.
