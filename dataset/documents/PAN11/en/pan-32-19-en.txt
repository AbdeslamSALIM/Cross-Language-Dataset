 

For all these things observe with equal and timely in all villages was must make a statement,
which clearly and minutely arranged government method economic development of each people, and serve
as ordinance and other factors used in this management, which, if necessary, would be easy to
train, practice and knowledge through I have of terms can be practiced and practiced.

Managed and implemented the proposed method, in my opinion would be favorable infallible result, and
for the factory to the Indians, since wages were safe, and where provided all their needs, those
who did not have their own crops, and those who had none security to sell all their fruit at a price
fixed and determined, and the factory security grown about increases in all areas that would benefit,
leaving no doubt that in a funds and people of medium proportions would not drop from 8 to
10,000 pesos annual profits, still considered the principles and tasks with only the present, what
you evidenciaré with the next score.

In a village whose rooms have 20,000 head of cattle, begat of not lower 4,000 of misses a year,
and having, as they all breeds of mares and mules, produced also the increase of young animals
well so that I have found that by lowering those killed, lost, stolen, annual consumption of
stay, and computing wages of laborers and foremen, passes for 3,000 pesos the value of the annual
increase in a room like the proposal.

In a town that has 1,200 souls among young and old, does not lower the annual consumption of
2,500 cattle, and although not dealt only 2,000, whereas the remaining ones to give feed the laborers
who will work on behalf of the factory, and consider a utility weight
in each, according to what I have said, are 2,000 pesos.

Limited as they are in the grocery store sales of the effects of daily consumption, having to provide
themselves with all the people there, not being possible that taking
money from wages stop buying what they desire, can be computed gains
in this sector, at least at 1,000 pesos per year.

While growing yerbales peoples are very deteriorated and are short
of crops, but we can always regulate your product at 500 pesos a year,
after rebates wages that can be used in cultivation and weed.

The cotton crop can easily produce the same as the grass, and even exceeded in much, if you get a
little application.

The planting and benefit of snuff, and twisted like enmanojado, is a row of little use, and beneficial
as we have said can be assured without risk of mistake, which would 1,000 pesos surrender the profits.

The
fabrics in linen, in a village in the number of people expressed, in the day up to 16,000
beam, without nearly as many that weave dressing particularly his
own; and so, but do not count but the same 16,000 yards, and they
average real income in each stick to the factory, is 1,000 pesos.

The purchase of goods brought from Buenos Aires to sell to the Indians in these terms, I think
it would not be less than 4,000 pesos of annual principal, at least one or two years past, which,
charging them fifty percent, occur in the sale 6,000 pesos, of which
2,000 of utility, and considering that the cost of buying commission,
handling and sales taxes amounted to 500 pesos, were free to 1,500.

Although there are many other peoples that make utility classes, such as benefits grass in the
mountains, the cattle, cutting wood and referral, the benefit of the sugar and honey, indigo, should
it be established, and many others who are targeted, I will not stop
to make computation of profits give up, because for my attempt suffice
implied, and that they show sufficient profits, as shown in the following
summary.

                                                         
   
   Pesos Utilities begat the 3,000 rooms Idem meat consumption
   in 2,000 people Ditto for the 1000 general store Ditto for
   the herb that benefits the 500 people Ditto for 500 cotton
   Ditto the benefit of snuff 1,000 Idem of cotton canvas fabrics
   1,000 Ditto the purchase of goods from outside the province
   1,500
   

   There are 10,500 pesos

The resulting short history of free utilities to the factory, 10,500 pesos.

It is true that some people can not expect these utilities, at least in principle, because their
rooms are very backward, and the small number of Indians would not allow the power undertake
many tasks, nor the supplies and stores would yield much, but it is also true that there are
others who by their proportions, and many of them, far exceed. I have no doubt to ensure that even
the principles, would not drop the annual increases in the thirty
villages in the province of 300,000 pesos, and I found this sum settlement
of government general of the province as well as particular to each
people.

To establish the proposed arrangement was necessary to the principles which de Buenos Aires
Some people send a lot of money, even 2 or 3,000 pesos for each village, Without it nothing
would be verifiable, and being sure thing that many people are not there equity, the royal
treasury could suplírseles to snuff account that would benefit later. To this decision I think there would
be no pregnancy, because the mercy of His Majesty crossing in the new ordinance their real
assets to help the needy Indians, supplying them by way of loan, without interest, they need to
promote them, delivering them and of the divisions that suffered before. And although that provision
is directed to assist individuals, and this the common, as in common include individuals,
should be by the same, taking it the advantage of greater security in the collection, which I the
most backward village concept, the second or third year, and would
have satisfied what had supplied.

Having to be so vast management factors, and these subjects, as expressed, I think debérseles
noted ten percent of the profits which will be at the factory, that is the same as indicated
by law to guardians of minors by the administration of its goods, but should not be allowed
any money or merchandise is special in itself, nor intermediary, nor any thing that use of
the factory, except the room, which should be the principal houses, not anything else. And if
for would ease the work they wanted to have a dependent, was Spanish or Indian, should pay for
the work that have gone on their profits, not understanding that the who run the grocery stores,
foremen or other employees in the benefit, preservation and increased the factory, because they,
like all other laborers and workers, they should pay their salaries and wages of the management
body, as they worked to their advantage and utility, and all other expenses that were offered
in the village that had no relationship or are intended to benefit the assets of the factory, the person
should be the utility that this corresponded, such as food and costumes of old handicapped, sick
priest poor salaries of justices, actual payment of taxes, tithes and any useful or pious work
to be established for the benefit of the common, as we will express where appropriate.

With the allocation of ten percent to the factors I think people would not be wanting useful
that serve them, considering that the peoples of a middling amount at least to 10,000 pesos
in profits, as evidenced by, and they will correspond to factor 1,000 pesos. And although
some do not amount to as much, always had the hope of promotions as merit and circumstances
of each, to reach the most profitable. Well it would be desirable that any so-called ascent without
having first served five years in the occupied village, being convenient
mudasen not very often.

For the Indian steward of each village were applied to the performance
of this important commission, and had no reason to apologize for any
embezzlement, it should be noted two percent of the profits of the
factory.

And appears quite what I have specified in order to economic government of the people, and
assets of their communities, so that you know the utilities would
continue to be, way to express to you that I understand should be
established in general province.

For the newest provisions of His Majesty are thirty people in this province subject to the jurisdiction
only governor with them in the military and justice causes, leaving the two branches of police
and real estate by the Governors mayors of Buenos Aires and Paraguay, each in the district
of his bishopric. And because I have not seen but in passing the ordinances, nor is my intention to express
to you the convenience and desconveniencias than his total adherence to these peoples could follow,
depending on circumstances of them, I will tell you what I think should, through the knowledge
that with practice I have purchased.

Although always keep the spirit and provisions of the new ordinances, general as to what their establishment
in this colony.

According to the knowledge that assists me in the situation of this province, marriage, relationship
and dependency some people have with others, and other circumstances that are very noticeable,
and it would Referring neat, I think that the best thing would be if they remained united
all thirty people, at least twenty-six, excluding or separating the four most immediate Paraguay,
which are Santiago, Santa Rosa, Our Lady of Fe and San Ignacio Guazú, who have little or no relation
with others, and are best placed to add to that province, and were ruled by a governor-mayor
who had charge of all classes in the same manner as other newly created, with power to appoint
sub-delegation in the parts as needed, for to my knowledge, one should be put an the six towns
comprising the department of San Miguel, and one in four of Yapeyú; and if the people of Santiago
department were to be subject to this province governance, should
be put there another, and the remaining villages would be all subjects
the immediate command of the governor, because they are near Candelaria,
which should be the capital.

The limits of this province, she felt even in all the thirty towns, I dies should be as follows:
on the northern side, Tebicuari River from its headwaters Ñembucú to the estuary, on the west,
the estuary to the Paraná, crossing over below the falls, following the Ibera Lagoon, including
land that is the band West of the lagoon and its slopes fall to it, and following a search
for the origin Miriñay River, which may serve as a boundary on that side to Uruguay, crossing a
seek Cuarey mouth of the river, which may serve as limits on the south side, following to its
origin and going in between the headwaters of Black River and looking
Ibicuy Portugal's borders, they serve the term of this band.

Excluding the four villages mentioned above, could serve as limits
on the band's north, the Monte Grande de Santiago, and its marshes
and swamps, which are to enter the Falls in the Paraná, and otherwise
as aforesaid.

But, as I believe, will these people in a few years make such overtaking I judge may be subject
to a bishopric erected them with incomes ping that of Paraguay, and
then another district or division should be limits, I will propose
to you for consideration and tell me what you think, because if that
was the case.

I can not seem to hide the convenience and utility of the latter river. The Current city and its
jurisdiction have their treatment and turn in these people and keep some useful correspondence
dependence and its business and trade, the profits would be higher each other if they were under
a single government. This province borders the Portugal domains across the band from the east,
and in times of disagreement with that crown not have the governor in that province but Indians
to fend off invasions, and Buenos Aires must send you the aid of Spanish people, and having under
his command to Corrientes, had in them a speedy and effective relief for any emergency. The
drawbacks to this division may be offered ignore them, and thus manifest
only conveniences that you know, as I reach.

Is so short that these natives pay tribute to His Majesty, that even in the day is not enough
to cover salaries and synods accruing to employees that the charge of the exchequer, though they
are very moderate. And if you put a governor mayor with the authority such employment is, would
need to assign a salary provided, and would be taxed more the royal treasury, and so it does not happen,
I think it would be best and the governor subdelegates as they pay their salaries from the
profits resulting to the factories; then, having to address the new form of government for good
and utility of natural these costs would be as regular their benefit be established, mostly
being found so relieved in taxes. And so I think the utilities of all peoples bring forth out
of two and a half percent, and distribute them in this way: the governor-half percent than surrender
all people, with more than two per cent of the people who were only in their care, and two percent
subdelegados of who produced the their immediate care. Thus each other would seek the advancement
of the peoples, for claimed it theirs.

Should the governor or lieutenant had a consultant lawyer, an assistant and clerk government,
and also had a protector of Indians and a tax lawyer, otherwise could
not be a good way this government, and to pay these five places could
be Take three percent of profits, pointing to each one what they seem
appropriate.

It would also be desirable to be bred a minister of the royal treasury, with the necessary dependent
actual salary paid, to tend to the recovery of real rights, real taxes and other belonging to His
Majesty, and especially the tobacco industry, which here are better
than in Paraguay, and could anticipate their cultivation and under
high magnification of real estate.

The town of Candelaria is very suitable for their situation and provide for capital the province,
and it was with more luster and brilliance could be obtained from Her Majesty the grace that
awarded him the title and privileges of city, thus getting there
courts and other ministries that after say, I have no doubt soon be
increased population with the many Spanish who avecindarían there.

For people flourish in the sciences and the arts would be more convenient than the town of Candelaria
establish a school for letters and a hospice for arts; the first should be taught from the first letters
to theology, jurisprudence, scholastic medicine and other sciences should be had to teach
these natives with all other parts of education and police, with young people in close as
to college, no jostling with each other, discarded or not acquire the hardiness that this
is raised, and were later useful in their villages, without losing the love country, as would happen
if the bring forth out to learn outside of the province. In the hospice learn arts and crafts
more useful and necessary in these villages, putting skilled teachers, and which are suited
for later distributed in their villages, working perfectly the works
of his powers and could teach others.

The libraries of all people could form a very good school of Candelaria and leaving in each village
those books that priests could serve to the very exercise of his ministry, send the rest to Buenos Aires
so that there they sold, even at a low price, and amount to buy modern
works that were required for the school library.

It would be good in the capital had a seminar to teach girls all work of their sex, and especially
the government of a house and family, the upbringing and education of children and women for others,
and so to them, as the boys should perfectly instructed in the Castilian
language, forming, for everything and have got due effect, a good
education and putting all the responsibility of a director which suited.

The

rents for these houses should keep out of the profits of all peoples, taking three percent,
and applying the same purpose also the value of the works to be working at the hospice, and the product
of the passage of cattle crossing the Parana Candelaria making it necessary step and removing
the traveling on the other hand, and if the government was some other branch or discretion, may
apply to the same end.

In each village should be sent each year to Candelaria, at least 4 boys and 2 girls always preferring
the sons of chiefs, for them there would be for that each one on purpose or had inclination, and
for every one who send, you should see with one or two dollars per month, or what should be
had by signaling for help food and clothes for them and them, that
everyone should have decently.

Also useful is sought royal permission to found convents in Candelaria could the three religions,
Santo Domingo, San Francisco and Merced, that the religious of them could occupy the chairs of
the school and practice all other matters concerning their school
and the salvation of souls, but to admit to the habit by the little
Indians who were able to do so.

Very convenient thing would be that the capital be established a provincial board, composed the
governor, his advisor, the royal treasury minister, the prosecutor and protector, and if includes
some of the sub-delegation, to take place in it, voting or not, as seemed convenient. At this
meeting and would try everything pertaining to real estate, assets
of people and police of them, giving every part of the junta superior
de Buenos Aires, so that, seen there, it is determined as appropriate.

This meeting presented the factors accounts for its consideration,
and with the advice guard, for tax and the report of the provincial
board, be referred to higher of Buenos Aires for approval.

The Buenos Aires attorneys would be convenient to surrender their accounts every two years, giving
people from those who were dependent, and the factors they would
invest in theirs, as industry dependent on them, or exposing them
saying what he pleased, and the provincial board would examine the
factor, and would turn, as already stated.

All peoples are beaded earrings, even from the time of expatriates and every day more than
its liquidation is impossible without the government can separate
hindrance offered when it comes to fit, and they pave the provincial
board all paths and settled on the best way possible.

The provincial board would fix the costs each year people would have in patron saint festivals, the days
of the King and his birthday, and other solutions; as well as the
same ordinary or extraordinary expenditure of each, giving the way
in delivering, spend and give accounts should be observed.

For the Indians were proclaiming to work on what was most useful to the province, real treasury
and to them, could have the same provincial board in each of the villages should be brought more
awards to apply and advance in the occupations or more branches useful, as practiced in Spain
in real economic societies of friends the country, getting these
awards from mutual funds, according to the peoples they had, and giving
all part of the upper board for approval
