 Niagara, on the other hand, with its reputation, with its easy access, universal
consecration of her beauty has some of these lieux communs of literature classic, which, admired
by men of all time, end up becoming choruses. In short, I was away one night and was still
ahead five or six days; I set off. Decided to go for the line of Erye going to Buffalo and Niagara
Fall's, draw the borders of Canada to Albany, and then from there to New York down the Hudson.

At
half past seven p.m. I entered one of these superb palace-car, found
only in the American lines and took up the compartment reserved in
advance.

The sleeping-car Americans, arranged with more luxury than Europeans, are undoubtedly more comfortable.
A central corridor, on either side, small divisions that are easily isolated by light curtains and
walls, the beds are placed within the meaning of the wagon. Broad, clean and warm. In each compartment
there are two, one below and one above, but while not likely, the two sofas, vis-a-vis, can
hold four people. I had retained below the bed, so I drew attention to reach the Division
I corresponded installed and see two people. They were a white-bearded man of about 60 years
of age and a girl of 20, slim, nice and fine features. There was still a quarter of an hour
the departure of the train, and I began to be alarmed at night than I expected in case there
had been error in the allocation of parts.

- Sorry, sir - I said in my broken English, - in this compartment there are only two beds,
and I have the ticket of one of them
