in those eyes on us, Magdalena had a suspicion? I believe, because it became suddenly as to
surprise me. I held the fire in his eyes, the most immediate and clairvoyant I have ever faced.
If it had been in his life I would not have been more committed to an act of recklessness that
he demanded the best. The rest of the evening was spent wrong. Magdalena seemed less busy of the
music, distracted by an annoying idea, as if that meeting and that remain face to face importunity.
Once or twice yet sought to clarify the doubts, then was foreign to everything happening around
her and I realized that was removed from the back of his mind.
