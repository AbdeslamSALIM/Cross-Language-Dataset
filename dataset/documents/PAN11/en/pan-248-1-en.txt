How to resist the temptation here how much more expensive D. Juan
Fresco is puffed and proud, and what you put plump, well paid and
given the eyebrows have been peeled decoding and reading the inscriptions
and papyri manuscripts from which is taken from this story?

For it is stated that a bermejino, for within bermejino was Mutileder, as was Vescio Villabermeja
then, rivals Solomon comes to making brilliant and extraordinary see the role that reading followeth.

Mutileder
not discouraged to learn that he was in the harem Echeloría Solomon ordered before stay in Jerusalem,
spy opportune moment, and as soon as they submit, grab it by the forelock, the pretty girl
wresting from the hands of the Wise King. Thought why not make slightest damage to Solomon.
Mutileder was too monarchical, and the king, as king and his science
infused and other virtues, he instilled respect.

Solomon also was not to blame nor had any Mutileder offended. He had accepted the gift that
had brought him, and had given proof in good taste to accept and store.

Sometimes conceived Mutileder some flattering hope. I imagined that had to mourn Echeloría he
and Solomon had to say, with all courtesy and finesse, that did not love him because he loved
to another and wisdom was that Solomon, who was kind to women, and so polite and condescending
have consented to the idols of the land of each of them should not
be fierce with Echeloría, but not well knew that his idol was Mutileder,
had to give up their claims.

Mutileder came to descry as likely to make the King look to deliver a the girl, and even that
may be smoothed to be best man.

The strength, perseverance and endurance Echeloría had to move all this and more, generous
spirit of Solomon. What mattered to this great King a woman more or less when had in his harem queens
seven hundred, eight hundred concubines, and infinite number of princesses?
