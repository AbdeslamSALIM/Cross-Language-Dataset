 I must be terrible if necessary. In the same books you have
made me read not only extols the servile gentleness of Ruth, but, if possible, the ferocity
of Judith, who slaughters the captain of the Assyrians, and the frightening feat of Jahel,
crossing with a hammer and nail the temples of Sisera.

- But do not worry not overtake
you.

He is not obliged to play in such extremes will not the river of blood. Although it will be
severe lesson I give, there will be a tragedy, and will in farce.

- But what will you do, my child? What frenzy is yours? - Dona Ines asked, deeply moved and loving.

- How? Where?

- Come home with me.

There are only a few minutes to get the appointment time.

With give me the value your presence.

- That's another thing - said Dona Ines.

Doña Inés thought, no doubt, in time to taste that would have contributed
to flick Don Alvaro, which would come very proud of the appointment
and she would be in his austere consort.

Indeed, if the launch went well, but tragedy would be farce.

Doña Inés lost her fear and felt the irresistible temptation to see
the farce and even make in him one of the leading roles.

- Okay,
Juanita - said -.

Go to your company and I'll lend you my assistance.

Fine test I'll give you my friendship with this, because I can also
get involved.

- Understand each other - said Juanita -. I do not
want your help. What merit would then my victory? You do not undertake,
because you will be hidden and nobody will know you've been in my
house. Nor will expose you to any accident, because you will see the
bulls from the scaffold.

- Yes ... but ... explain yourself, do not
make me go blind ..., explain yourself ....

- It will happen when.
