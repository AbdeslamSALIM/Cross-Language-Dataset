 

As the dangers and supernatural defenses exist only by creation of the human spirit are different
in kind and degree in all negotiations and latitudes and susceptible abandoned or maintained,
decreased or increased, by simple change of thought, without change in the world other than
the use of the subject's life itself, will cease to spend them if you cease to believe in them,
or spend twice if you think twice, to the detriment or benefit of the respective brokers,
interested in maintaining this instinctively the highest voltage in the supernatural terror to
milk it more profitably, for which made before the people believe that the world was by and
for the beliefs and would end if they cease.

As in central Europe and western theologians failed to maintain maximum tension universal religious
terror, the human mind could free itself from the theological danger and reach to aggrandize
the power of cosmic energy, working for free for anyone who learns how to govern them.

In the imaginary ills, the employer of choice is, of course, the most enthusiastic and most indefatigable
propagandist of danger: each is concerned to believe in the reality of hell that can take prisoners,
and at the same time the most ardent denier the existence of the other hells that take other
specialists.

It turns out that the dangers and fears of the past are grafted supernatural, not only religious
institutions but political institutions of the past, so that there are two large and powerful
interest in maintaining it, since his termination entail the collapse of both. And the biggest
complication in competition international education imposed by the people, otherwise canceled
abruptly or slowly the country that abolished or reduced. The dilemma is inevitable: to be
eaten slowly by monks, dervishes, the monks, with high mortality and great misery to be later
suddenly stripped or absorbed by rivals or get up and walk like them.

And the solution has been found to grow without destroying the intellectual powers or decrease
fear of the supernatural dangers, avoiding the antagonism between natural coincidence and the supernatural,
religious education is the profane sciences, the cultivation of memory without arousing the intellect,
by ingesting refined explanations of responses made, learned and stored in the mind to respond to
questions, so that the learner go through school, college and university mule with blinders, "subject
to strict to texts, seeing what lay ahead and not what is subtracted or sideways, like Renan,
who received minor orders at St. Sulpice had been unaware that the Revolution 89.

But the individual entitled only to repeat as a phonograph, with or without variations, what has
been taught in science circumscribed by faith, not be more than a parrot wise, or even wonderful
large vocabulary, and the country to cultivate all the powers resident intellectual is always
much higher than just grown somewhere. Although building knowledge about the passive capacity
to assimilate knowledge, religious education Risks are waking up unexpectedly active capacity, raising
a seminarian one Combes, and France in a disciple of the Assumption.

Mariano Moreno, the soul of the revolution of May, was a doctor of theology at the University
Chuquisaca, as Voltaire was a pupil of the Jesuits, for the same education calculated to stunt
the wings of the spirit, the intelligence failed in not having abutments worth proceeding
to transform the condors and eagles in poultry.

Miracle of chance, which is the base of the church school, has not left any invention, no discovery,
but have left all the actors of the French Revolution terrorists, nihilists and anarchists, and universities
founded and regents overseers, came all the liberators of South America, consisting of well its
only merit in having served for which there were established.

As a consequence, lower price and the national psyche by teaching unscientific science, often
equivalent to stolen, and victims in the first place orphans and the conservatives, the powers to defer
only get dogmatic complete collapse to make it final. Under the teaching of religion, monarchical
France became more Republican and more liberal free-thinking that
England, whose Parliament voted in 1840, 30,000 schools and 70,000
pounds for the king's stables.

Embracing the cause of liberalism, the House of Savoy monarchy lifting
up the Italy, and supported by clericalism, the house of Braganza
lost the crown, delaying, weakening and indebted to Portugal.

South America is evolving mystical spirit of practicality in parts, and rapidly declining in others.
For the prosperity of the people, a rail, port, school, bank, are infinitely more effective
than a bishop, and is with them that in sixty years of tepid liberalism, Argentina has sent down
gold price in 2000 to 227 0 | 0, while Colombia has done up to 5000 0 | 0 and lost Panama in
18 years of rabid reactionary. With its wonderful shrine, Catamarca not able to escape poverty
even customary, and scientific agriculture, Mendoza has increased its resources for a half
to four and a half million dollars in 25 years, even taking in, such as apples damaged, plundered
the most skilled of rich and pious widow, who pay the highest tribute to religious fear in money
accumulated by their husbands disbelievers happens to the assets
of ecclesiastical wealth.

The penetration of the material instruments of modern civilization is inevitable even in countries
where the man lives feeling, thinking and perishing in the old molds and those going after the infiltration
of mental methods of origin.

Steam, railroad, automobile, are the precursors of the constitutional and freethought in Turkey,
Persia, China, Russia.

You see how deep was the thought of Lord Acton, the famous English
Catholic, when he said, in reference to the high priest who left born
and grow to modernism: "I think Leo XIII is the first pope to have
been wise enough to despair, and felt that it must begin a new game
and rule by foreign stars on uncharted seas.

"

FREE INSTITUTIONS [10]

The problem that free institutions must resolve is that of corporate governance human, at ease and
benefit of the governed, and the biggest drawback to good governance from outside interests, is the spontaneous
tendency of individuals to prefer their own will and their own convenience to those of other
more so we are less related by blood, the spirit, land, language
or color, and ways to eliminate or lessen are naturally the division
of power into several branches, which counterbalance each other, and
the comptroller by public opinion.

In ancient times, only the Greeks who made the first attempts at confederation and government of
the people by the people, and the Romans, who were dedicated to the conquest addition, conceived
of the problem and worked to resolve it, testing a variety incomplete policy forms that failed
on, and develop the culture of understanding to an extent so vast that even passed over because
it "was not to save" over ten centuries ago our ancestors forgot the needs rave on earth to heaven,
purgatory and hell, has become the fertile seed from which the modern
civilization.

The republics of Greece, in whom the instinct of revenge was still larger than sense of justice,
ignoring the rights of minorities, like us in the first half of last century, and failed to recognize
or division, or limitation of powers, nor the great mutual benefits of benevolence to the vanquished,
condemned always ostracized and conspiracy, was also the place where
human thought could get up and function more comfortably.

As Renan says, "the usual state of Athens was the terror. Never political practices were more
ruthless, never the safety of the people was lower. The enemy was always ten leagues every year
saw him appear, all the war years was necessary to him. And inside, what endless series of revolutions!
Banished today, tomorrow sold as a slave, or sentenced to drink hemlock, then lamented, honored
as a god, all exposed daily to be dragged to the bar more inexorable "revolutionary court" the Athenian,
in the midst of this hectic life, I never was sure the next day,
produced with a spontaneity that amazes us.

"

The Roman republic, which came to perform in a way the separation of powers and principle of
responsibility, had, therefore, a more robust life and existence longer, but, ignoring the principle
of representation, to fatally bullied conquered people, the less heard in the opulent capital depleted
in the more remote province, and the exercise of despotism out, disabling the rulers to practice
of freedom at home, gradually replaced the tastes and republican
forms, the Oriental absolutism and pumps.

And that unique human group that started as a school of political
freedom, ended Chair of absolutism in Asia, inoculated to the most
civilized of the ancient world five centuries of the most compelling
centralism.

The law, which had begun to be the expression of the will of the people ended up being nothing but the
expression of the will of the prince, according to the maximum of
the Institute, Sir John Fortescue declared in the fifteenth century
"completely foreign to the principles of English law": principe quod
placuit, vigorem habet leges.

"More efforts are needed to formulate the idea that man is free to know that the earth moves
around the sun, says Ihering.

History has worked countless of years, millions of men groaned in bondage and rivers of blood
have run in the More recently, before that principle is carried out.

"

And this applies and the second of the major obstacles encountered by the problem free institutions.

Because the terror of the unknown and need to know to do or abstain, have led six thousand
different explanations for natural phenomena by supernatural powers we call religions, and these
have been out of the comptroller of reason and experience human issues that most concerned,
to give sanctity to the primitive conceptions, more so the more ancient sacred, that is, the
more absurd.

Of course, understanding is adapted to the beliefs that have been breastfed as taste to food,
and all religion is held by those who profess it, and mostly those that make their living,
like most good. Its effects moral, intellectual and on economic societies, all are disastrous
to varying degrees, according to the story and statistics, that believers can not understand,
and that statesmen should take account, if you really care about the future of their country.

"A religion is a source of weakness for a country," said the Marquis Ito. And indeed, Whether you
intend to govern the living at ease and benefit of the dead, to be happy after death, such
as from Judaism, whether they intend to defend against evil spirits,
such as China, Africa, Oceania and the American wild every religion
is a double fraud on human energy, of course lead to exercise it because
in ways as costly as sterile, and later by the easements and the limitations
imposed on the individual in exchange for imaginary benefits, depending
on the extent of the evils that produce the degree of political power
they have to feel self-conscious thought within their enclosures.

So, nothing is free, but the despotism owes much, as they have always been a spring of government,
and precisely what has to be continuity and stability, providing the only character that could
do it inherited - the sacred - from the capabilities natural is not necessarily transmitted
from parent to child. The first Roman dictator which was proclaimed god, were by that fact
in a position higher than all other Roman citizens, and to prevent
his stay, like Cromwell, in common.

Napoleon took power anointing of God and consecrated by the pope.

Hence, all power, dynastic and hereditary aristocracy are all natural
allies of any religion, that is, the particular form of implementation
of the terror of the unknown it comes from or where it rests his authority
or superiority extra staff.

Nothing was more natural and the "Holy Alliance", in which the despots of Europe, shaken by the
first burst of resurgent sense of freedom, the end of the century XVIII, conspired to destroy it,
support each other and help quell Fernando VII the independence of
its colonies, that the pope, meanwhile, was excommunicated from the
first time.

In populations emerged in Greece that Greek and Roman republics, as in Germanic tribes, individual
manhood by the strength, talent and health, was a desideratum Nationally, the current valimiento outweighed
ancestral merit, and religion was an assistant the state, as secondary category, the heroes
demigods of Greek mythology from the field of action lay, unlike the Christian civilization
from the the field of religious action, unlike modern civilization
also, in which from the field of political action, social, scientific
and educational.

In the Germanic tribes who lived in England at the time of Tacitus, the civilian head was an
elected official, not on merit of his birth but of his deeds, to manage justice and preside
over the assemblies of free men, in which the priests only mission had to keep order, the military
leader was chosen for each issue common in recognition of his exploits in previous expeditions,
volunteers, and conservation the elective nature and limited power and revoked the Anglo-Saxon
kings in front absolute and irrevocable power of kings by divine
right, erected by Christianity, has been for twelve centuries the
great work of the English people the benefit of liberal civilization.

Because the process of asiatización of Europe, which lowered the standard of living throughout
the continent, from the faith in human effort to faith in God's grace, even in Scotland with
Protestantism and Catholicism in Ireland was less or more effectively carried happily resisted
by indigenous trends in England, a country relatively has produced less saintly and more political,
explorers, thinkers and inventors, the only country where freedom has flowed from the spirit of independence,
despite the excommunications several of the popes against all successive letters of freedoms,
where the political right has left the previous widened by natural growth, as an indigenous plant,
not transplant or graft as exotic plant, where a greater interest in positive real, countering
the excesses of visionary idealism, caused the highest fitness for trade, industry and settlement, offering
scope for the practical spirit which is not interested modes of thinking to serve the ways of acting,
the reverse of that spirit sentimental men printed by Christianity and Mohammedanism, which
disregards the facts and infeuda doctrines, until he could not produce more than saints and
mahdis, ie mummies spiritual, mental passivity so that the secular social stagnation becomes instinct
national, that the Inquisition in Spain led to the maximum, extinguishing the isolated focus of liberalism
of Aragon, and that came among us the fierce intransigence of unitary and federal on liberal
political doctrines held by the procedures brutally tyrannical.

In the spirit of self-government, is also preserved in the British love of justice and the instinct
for progress, sleeping on the continent for the trust in divine justice and the hope of heaven
for the poor in spirit, stagnant in the civilizations of India and China by the institution
of caste closed and Mandarin, which opposed an insurmountable barrier to the particular capabilities,
and were saved precisely because open class system, because it was not hereditary nobility,
but the title couple and the oldest son, and the aristocracy being interested in the fate of
the commons of which involved their other descendants.

Of these factors the resistance always came up and always people against resurgent the excesses
and greed of kings and popes, which reaches its first big step in the Magna Carta, King John
pulled by the barons in 1215, often eluded later but never erased from public spirit, which is held
with the fixity of a constellation in the sky; reconfirmed and extended in the parliament of
Simon de Montfort, in 1265, casting Dover Sea containing the bull of excommunication of the pope against
the rebel barons be, since, as the great national beacon for the days of storm or fog policy
while on the continent, even in Scotland and Ireland, with the exception of the Netherlands and
Switzerland, Christian submission to divine authority of the popes, pastors and kings in the form
Protestant, Catholic or Orthodox, made a clean sweep of all feelings individual or communal independence,
and especially in Spain where the Inquisition, sat its real and its instruments of torture twenty
one years after the birth of the Magna Carta in England, to model our elders for maximum terror
in the larger plan sectarian intolerance and more complete passive
submission to the altar and the throne.

And since 1534 this universal abdication of the natural capacity of man in God's ability the
church was reconfirmed with the founding of the company of Loyola, and therefore Pride fan favorite
servants of God externalized half century later, in "Invincible", sent, Fiske says, "to strangle
freedom in his beloved country, for the most heinous and cruel tyrant that Europe has ever seen
tyrant whose victory would have meaning not just the theft of the
crown of England, but the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition
in the court of Westminster.

"

The characteristic of the Greco-Roman civilization, which paved the way twenty centuries on which were
extended later to simple substitution, Christian civilizations and Arabic, which made possible the
prodigious expansion on neighboring countries and continents, was the fact that religion - regional,
not sacred cosmology, without theological dogmas no large hierarchy and church - not mostly inhibited
the free play of natural abilities, as the progressive party of the same problem in England - their
tolerance of the customs and particular religions of the conquered countries to the point of having
two religions officers in the UK itself, constituted the cradle of freedom and refuge for the persecuted
of all Europe - English explains the relentless expansion, as the same circumstances, suddenly
produced in France on the political and military, by the revolution of 89, as it Napoleon meant when
he said that every soldier carried in his knapsack the baton of Marshal of France explains the
unexpected French expansion and the Napoleonic era, as the same circumstances educational field,
commercial and industrial in North America explains his prodigious prosperity, like Christianity
without European science in Abyssinia, and the European science without Christianity in Japan,
explains the secular stagnation of the first and the prodigious sudden development of the second, as
the reverse situation - the fanaticism without thought and without science, - in Spain and Portugal,
in turn explains the stagnation regressive way that Muslim Iberian empire that the sun never
set, when that which has gone Modern full potential - the human spirit - was still everywhere
prisoner past centuries, says Ugarte, when hope in the miracles of faith blocked everywhere,
the advent of the miracles of science and human intelligence.

"Among the great modern nations was only England, said Fiske, which in political development remained
more independent of Roman law and the Roman church and the only one
out of the medieval melting pot with its own government Teuton substantially
intact.

"

"From Homer to Constantine the ancient city is a group of free men is object of conquest and
exploitation of other free men, "says Taine. From Constantine onwards, other life goals for
governing conduct in other directions, with a new design man and the world that has made way
in the spirit of the masses and finally reached the political and social supremacy, has invested all
human values, discrediting the thought and action, joy, health and strength and extolling
the sterility, sadness, dirt, disease and poverty, for the ideal and man's fate have been
magnified in the good and evil and outside of humanity, in another world will be the reverse of
this. The moral, that Aristotle did consist of "social utility" according to theologians is
"submission to the will of God", ie the utility of God.

This is called "Christian civilization" as it is turned the other semi-barbarous Europe by persuasion
or force. Since then, the medieval city is a group theocratic visionary expectation of doomsday
and doomsday, raising castles, prisons, gallows and strengths to cope with the natural savagery
of the wicked alive, and shrines, temples, monasteries and chapels to obtain God's grace, achieve
miracles and supernatural defend the barbarism of the wicked dead, who theology been given a second
life, infinitely worse than the first, demons, witches, goblins,
ghosts, the souls in purgatory, etc., etc.

The Christian civilization,
which considers the lost man from original sin, in dire need to save,
unable to behave himself and in need of guardianship, it happened
the Greco-Roman civilization, only to prevail in Europe until eighteenth
century, in various ways, and one of the worst was imported to the
new world by Spain in the XV.
