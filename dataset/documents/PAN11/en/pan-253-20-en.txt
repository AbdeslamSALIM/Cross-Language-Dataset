 

Desnoyers family was to fulfill his wish.

Regaining his senses after the fatal news, the father had concentrated
all his will in a petition:

- I need him ... Oh, my son ... My son!

Unnecessarily senator demonstrated the impossibility of this trip. They were still beating in the
area where he fell in July. Later it might be possible to visit. "I want to see him, insisted the
old man. Needed to consider the grave of the child before he died in his turn. And Lacour
had to work for four months, making supplications and forcing resistors
Don Marcelo could make this trip.

A military vehicle was, at last, one morning to all the Desnoyers
family. Senator could not go with them.

Rumors of a forthcoming ministerial change, and he was displayed in the Upper House, if the Republic
claimed their services a bit slighted.

They spent the night in a provincial town, where he was the commander
of an army corps.

René took reports of the officers who had witnessed the great struggle. With the map to the
view was following in his explanations, to know the section of land that had July the regiment
moved.

The next morning resumed their journey. A soldier who had taken part in the battle served as
their guide, seated on the seat beside the chauffeur. René consulted from time to when the
map spread on his knees and asked questions to the soldier. The Regiment he had fought alongside
the Desnoyers, but could not remember the exact locations walked by him months earlier. The field had been
transformed. Appearance was than when it was covered with men, including the incidents of the
battle. Loneliness baffled him ... And the car was moving slowly, without further north than the
groups of graves, following the central road, smooth and white, getting
on the roads cross: winding ditches, bogs of deep ruts, in which it
was made big leaps scream docks.

Sometimes it was to cross country, a group of crosses to the other, crushing with the footprint
of your tires the furrows opened by the plow.

Tombs ... graves everywhere. White locusts covered the landscape of death. No left free corner of
this flutter glorious funeral. The newly opened gray land by plowing, roads yellow, dark groves,
all throbbing with a ripple tireless. The ground seemed to shout, his words were the vibrations
of the restless flags.

And the thousands of screaming, with a chant incessantly restarted through the days and nights, singing
the monster clash I had witnessed this land and which kept A chill
still tragic.

- Dead ... dead - Chichi murmured, following the line
of sight crosses glided the flanks of the car in constant renewal.

-
Lord, for them!

... By their mothers! - Dona Luisa moaning resumed his recitation.

Here we had developed the most terrible battle, the fight to use old,
the shock body to hand, out of the trenches with the bayonet, with
the head, fists, teeth.

The guide, who began to orient themselves, was pointing out various
points of the compass alone.

African shooters were there, more here, hunters. Large groups of tombs line were soldiers who
had charged with the bayonet by the wayside.

He stopped the car. René fell behind the soldier to examine the inscriptions on a crosses. Perhaps
these dead of the regiment came looking. Chichi also lowered mechanically with the irresistible
desire to protect her husband.

Each burial kept several men. The number of bodies could be counted by kepi helmets or rotting
and rusting attached to the arms of the cross.

The ants were Rosary on military uniforms, pierced with holes of
putrefaction, and they occupied yet the number of the regiment.

Crowns that had adorned with patriotic devotion some of these graves were blackened and leafless.
In some crosses the names of the dead were yet clear, in other began to fade and soon would
be unreadable.

"The heroic death! ... Glory! "Chichi thought sadly.

Neither the name was going to survive even the most vigorous men missing
in his youth.

Only memories remain of them to rob from time to time to a old farmer driving his cow on a road
in France and that he would mutter and sigh: "My baby!

... Where is he buried my little boy? "Just live in the village woman dressed of mourning that does
not know how to solve the problem of their existence, children going
to the school with black blouse with a fierce will say: "When I grow
up I will kill them Boches to avenge my father.

"

Dona Luisa, motionless in his seat, his eyes following the passage of Chichi among the graves
again, interrupting his prayer:

- Lord, for mothers without children ... for children without parents
... your anger that we forget and your smile back to us!

The husband, dropped into his seat, the field also looked funereal. But his eyes were fixed steadfastly
in some graves wreaths or flags, simple crosses with short inscription
tablet.

They were German graves, which appeared to form separate page in the book of death. A Moreover,
in the countless French tombs, inscriptions to small-simple numbers: one, two, three dead.
The other, in spaced and unadorned graves, heavy items, bulky figures, figures of a frightening
brevity.

Fences limited long narrow sticks these ditches filled with meat. Bleaching earth as if it had
snow or salt. Lime was mixed in with the lumps.

The cross was in his board indicating that the tomb contained Germans, and then a number: 200 ...
300 ... 400.

These figures Desnoyers forced to make an imaginative effort.

They said promptly, but it was not exactly easy to evoke the vision of three hundred dead together,
three hundred wrappers livid and bloody human flesh, the straps broken,
dented helmet, the terminated boots mud balls, smelling of hard tissues
in which decomposition begins, glassy-eyed and tough, with the grin
of supreme mystery, lining up in layers the same as if they were bricks
in the bottom of a trench that is about to close forever ... And this
memorial alignment was repeated at intervals throughout the vastness
of the plain.

Don Marcelo felt a fierce joy. His fatherhood comfort suffering runaway experienced of revenge.
Julio had died, and he was going to die too, unable to bear his misfortune; but many languish
in these rotting enemies who left loved ones in the world we remember, as he remembered his son!
...

He imagined them as they should be before the time of his death, as he had seen on the progress of the
invasion around his castle.

Some of them, the most learned and formidable, bore in the face of dramatic scars of dueling academics.
They were soldiers who had books in the backpack and after execution of a batch of farmers or
the looting of a village he read poets and philosophers in the glow of fires. Science swollen,
with swelling of the toad, proud of their intellectual and pedantic enough, had inherited the heavy
dialectic and winding of the ancient theologians. Children and grandchildren of sophistry
lies, is considered able to provide the greatest absurdities with mental somersaults to which
they had used his intellectual acrobatics. The preferred method of the thesis, antithesis and
synthesis they used to demonstrate that Germany was to be mistress of the world, that Belgium was
to blame for his downfall for having defended, that happiness is to live every human regimenting
the Prussian, without losing any effort, to the supreme ideal of existence is in the barn clean
and the full manger, that freedom and justice do not represent more
than French revolutionary illusions of romance, all which is holy
from fait accompli when that succeeds, and the right is simply a derivative
of force.

These intellectuals with a rifle appeared to be the champions of a civilizing crusade. They wanted
to triumph definitely on the dark blond man, wanted to enslave the
despicable man South, getting for all that the world was run by the
Germans, "the salt the earth, "the aristocracy of humanity."

Everything in German history was worth something. The ancient Greeks had been of Germanic origin,
Germans great artists the Italian Renaissance.

Mediterranean men, with evil in their own home, had falsified history.

But the best of these ambitious dreams, the crusader of Pan-Germanism was shot the "Latin" negligible,
down to the grave with all his pride.

"Well you're where you are, pedantic bellicose," thought Desnoyers, remembering conversations
with his friend the Russian.

Too bad there were not also all the Herr Professor who had remained in German universities, scholars
of indisputable ability mostly to uncheck the intellectual products, changing the terminology
of things! These bearded men river and gold spectacles, peaceful laboratory rabbits and the chair,
had prepared the this war with their sophistry and pride.

His guilt was greater than that of Herr Lieutenant in tight corset
and shiny monocle that want the fight and I had only to slaughter
professionals continue their hobbies.

While the German soldier I got the lower class could and shot them drunk so he jumped the passage,
students read at the bivouac warrior Hegel and Nietzsche. It was too religious for run with their
hands on these acts of "historical justice."

But he and his teachers had excited all bad instincts of the beast Germanic, giving them a veneer
of justification scientific.

"Stay in your grave, intellectual dangerous," continued Desnoyers mentally.

The Moroccans fierce, the black child's mentality, the Hindustani gloomy, seemed more respectable
than any ermine robes parading proud and warlike by faculties of German universities. How peaceful
the world would disappear if their carriers! To barbarism refined, cold and cruel wise ambitious
preferred barbarism modest childish and savage bothered him less, and it was not hypocritical.

Therefore
the only enemies that inspired pity the soldiers were dark and few
letters that were rotting in those graves.

They were rustic field workers factories, shop, gluttonous Germans were immeasurable bowel
in war an opportunity to satisfy their appetites, and paste to send someone after spend his
life in obedience to his country and getting kicked.

The history of his country was no more than a series of raids to the south, similar to those
raids of Indians, to seize the property of men living on the banks temperate Mediterranean. The
Herr Professor had shown that these expeditions looting work represented a high civilization.
And the German was going forward, with enthusiasm of a good father
who sacrifices to win their own bread.

Hundreds of thousands of letters written by families with trembling
hands were at the Germanic horde in their progress through the invaded
lands.

Desnoyers heard reading some of them, to the late afternoon, before his haunted castle. Papers were
found in the pockets of dead and prisoners. "Have no mercy on pants red. Mata Welch did not spare
the small ... "" We appreciate the shoes, but girl can not wear them. Those French have ridiculously
small feet ... "" Try apoderarte of a piano. "" I'd like a nice watch. "" Our neighbor has
sent Captain his wife a pearl necklace. And you just send little things! "

Germany moved heroically virtuous with the double desire of enhancing his country and make valuable
items to the children. "Germany on the world!" But the best of your dreams fell into the pit
mixed with other comrades who cherished the same dreams.

Desnoyers imagined impatience, on the other side of the Rhine, the holy women who hoped and
waited. The death lists had not said anything maybe absent.

And the letters were starting towards the German lines: letters that never receive the recipient.
"Answer. When not writing is perhaps because we have prepared a good
surprise.

Do not forget the collar. Send a piano. A carved dining cabinet I would like very much. The French
things are beautiful ... "

The brief cross the earth stood still white lime. Near it fluttered the flags. They moved to
one side to another as a protest head, smiling wryly. No! ... No!

He drove the car. The guide pointed to a group now distant graves. There was certainly where the regiment
had fought. And the vehicle off the road, its wheels sinking disturbed soil, having to make
long detours to avoid the scattered graves capriciously by the hazards of combat.

Almost all fields were plowed. Man's work extended from tomb to tomb becoming more visible
and was repelling the morning mists envelope.

Under the soles last winter began to smile, nature, blind, deaf, insensitive, ignoring our existence
and indifferent in her womb welcomes the same to a poor little animal
One million human corpses.

Sources still kept their beards of ice, the earth was crumbling under foot the crunch of glass,
the wrinkles were still ponds, trees, black and asleep, retained on the trunk metallic green shirt that
had worn the winter; the bowels of the earth all breathed a cold
and fierce, like that of the planets off and the dead ... But spring
had girded on his armor of flowers in the palaces of tropics, saddling
the green steed neighing impatiently soon run the camps, bringing
to his gallop in disorderly flight to the black goblins winter, while
his floated back the loose hair of gold like a trail of perfume.

Announcing their arrival herbs covering the roads of tiny buttons. The birds were afraid to go
out from their shelters to flap between the crows cawing of anger at the tombs closed. The landscape
was taking in the sun a smile falsely childish gesture of child looking candid eyes, while
his pockets are full of stolen goods.

The farmer had plowed the seed patch and fill the groove. Men could continue killing, the earth
has nothing to do with their hatred, and not for them is going to
be discontinued course of his life. The gate had opened his lines
straight and inflexible, as all years, erasing the kick of men and
beasts, the deep ruts of cannon. Nothing baffled laborious stubbornness.
The funnels open by the bombs had filled.

Sometimes, the Iron Triangle
was hampered underground ... anonymous dead and without a grave. The
iron scratch went on, mercilessly for what is not. From time later
stopped at least soft obstacles. Shells were buried in the floor and
burst. The farmer dug the apparatus of death, sometimes with malice
late, did explosion in his hands ... But the man on earth knows no
fear when he goes in search livelihoods, and continued his straight
forward, twisting only upon reaching a tomb visible
