 

In places, neither more nor less than in large populations, there are many gossips; but concurred
on this occasion a thousand circumstances that prevented the slander is cebase so innocent in
relationships and perverse interpreted.

The main causes of the talk at once, as the reason or pretext or appearance, of any love affair,
particularly if they intended to marriage, did not show here. Usually, a cause that will talk and
gossip is the lover's desire, who would want to be told what is and even what is not, and sometimes
pretends that conceals so contrary skill, rather discovered or even to suspect mysteries and
adventures that perhaps not been achieved. Women are also less keen on not everything is known, particularly
when alleged and despise and outwit the suitors. And many, when the suitors are highly respected and
famous, even throwing to roll all respect, as long as the teasing abandoned rivals are, as they
say, a quarter to a preacher, and calls for her to disclose its fragility and its affairs.

None of this was taking place between the Father and Dona Luz. Rather
the opposite was true.

The young men or outsiders who, by most handsome and important, dared to aspire to Dona Luz and had
been rejected gently before a declaration that commits them, had such a high opinion of Mrs. Light
and of themselves, that everyone thought that was impregnable which to his charms and good qualities
had not surrendered.

How can we believe that like a monk almost sickly old man who had been cold, unfeeling and unloving
with a handsome boy, sturdy and handsome? This would have been monstrous.

Women are usually those who discover or invent adventures, falls or
slips their enemy, but Dona Luz was so far top and far removed from
all rivalry and had gained in such a way the affection of all, nobody
told him the steps and walked stalking to see if anyone was false
and charged with it afterwards.

On the other hand, Mrs. Manolita, with his talk, his poise and his jokes, was the organ most
authoritative and resonant Villafría public opinion, and Dona Manolita,
no longer having the slightest reason, but although he had not ever
had consented to say anything in against Dona Luz, had drowned in
their teasing voice of gossip more brazen.

The concept that the father had not paid in Villafría not to the point we spoke reeds were lifted.
Most, as you were not as fun and almost no understand him, he had all but forgotten, even
if ever it was agreed to consider him as a saint, annoying, and nothing valetudinarian fun. Man
who not used, and rare exotic bird, for Voltaireans place, there would have been difficult someone
would involve plotting for the restoration of the Inquisition and even children eating raw,
but no one fit in the head could be flirtatious and have good fortune
a man so pale, sickly, melancholic and forlorn.

For all these reasons, no one was malice, offending no one commented on how privacy and Dona Luz
and coexistence of the Father, who, on the other side, where tried, they were, they spoke and
still admired innocently, with the largest drop was within the small gathering, which nothing
transcends, in which everything is explained Blessed, or better that is not explained, because
not to D. Anselmo and his daughter and son, or to D. Acisclo, or for the priest D. Miguel,
required that any explanation. The priest D. Miguel, above all, and D. Acisclo, each in its own
way, were in Luz and the father left two people unique, two-thirds
of whose thoughts and words heard as one listens to music celestial
without entering what they meant
