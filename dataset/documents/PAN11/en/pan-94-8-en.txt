 

We were already in the room; sent치monos all, and began to prosecute the visit. Evoc치ronse by
women's memories of the last chores in those days so sad, and I took the opportunity to ponder
the loneliness I had been and what he missed in home ... I do not know a fixed point in what
way was tangled conversation here, because I mechanically mixing it with the word, while having
the thoughts in Lita I was in front of me. But a very strange thoughts. Once dressed I imagined
with all the frills of the elegant Madrid, and gave me the vision of the imagined deplorable
fact that I jumped in the chair. They seemed a profanation those trimmings in that body that
had not been trained to have the funds the conventional devices of the city, but the immutable
and grand scenes of nature.

For this and other similar paths were my thoughts flew to my delight ... until suddenly struck
me the memory of that proviso had Neluco by auction of "Account" we were both on the eve ech치ndonos
afternoon. Could the "guests" not to be agree to it if we had heard adjustment. The devil take
me if at that time had I made decision to conduct any related term plan with the approval of
our calculations, and, however, doubt emerged suddenly in the presence of "hostess" itself, I much
resented. No man is an ounce of gold that everyone likes the same, even if many a safe place,
as I was then, and could very well happen that did not like Lituca me for special reasons
... and even for being in love with Neluco without him knowing it, they all fit in the field of plausible
assumptions. But how to clarify this question in the act, without discovering the mystery of
my intentions? And yet, it could not be well, because I needed to have the main thread in his
hand to pull it when I give want, or if you never pull more convenient for me. Pure selfishness
and rebellion unhealthy love contradicted himself, and as long as a man, run it, is in these situations
of mind, the first thing missing is common sense, I guessed there was going to commit a fat
crap if I could dominate a little bit of itching that began to be consumed, gave a cut to the conversation
that followed mechanically, and end the visit with the formal promise, well he was! to repeat
often.

I do not know what you think of the old house Marmit칩n the confusion
that must be noted between the words coming out of my mouth and ideas
that I frolicked in the brain, or whether I even noticed, but the
fact that as I was walking towards the house, creating serious purposes
of clarifying the doubts go slowly, pulling the bottom of the clear
stream the mysterious pebbles with tweezers from my experience and
feel of my native serenity for those things, I marveled at the development
that had reached that arrechucho mine, and how close I had to commit
an improper light, not of a mature man but an inexperienced college.
