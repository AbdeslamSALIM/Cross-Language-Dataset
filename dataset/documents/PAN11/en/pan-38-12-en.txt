WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE AREA.

[77.] We have seen that reason is not based on the opinion of Descartes, which completely confused
space with the body, making the essence of this include the extension thereof, and stating that
wherever we conceive space, there is no body.

But perhaps nearer to the truth who say, that in fact the space is not more than the same extension
of the body; regardless of whether they constitute the essence of them, and also denying its
infinity.

[78.] Examine this opinion. Analyzing the generation of the idea of ??space is which is nothing
more than the idea of ??extension in the abstract.

If I have before me an orange, I can get through abstractions to the idea of ??a pure extension,
equal to that of the orange.

To do this begin to dispense with its color, taste, smell, softness or hardness, and as may
affect my senses. So I have no more than an extended being, which, if you spoil mobility, is
reduced to a portion of space equal to the volume of the orange.

It
is clear that these abstractions I can make over the entire universe:
what will give me the whole idea of ??space is the universe.

[79.]
Here I am going to drop a difficulty that can be opposed to this explanation
of the idea of space, and I'll take advantage of this opportunity
to clarify some as the origin of the idea infinite space, or is the
imaginary space
