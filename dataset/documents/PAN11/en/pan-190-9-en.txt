 This custom, it is extirpate, forces
from both the priests to join at a very early age to the young, with object to somehow explain
away the behavior of these and their relatives, for what girls are formally married eight years
with twelve young men. The worship of these exterior is but natural, so that his conscience is
entirely foreign to all kinds scruples. Men cross a spontaneously their wives, which in turn is
also when they want to give all his relatives. I have already spoken in another place, for the
superstitions that dominate with respect to disease, and the barbaric conduct these superstitions
are forced to look for the sick.

The population of the mission for Magdalena amounted in 1820 to 2100 and eight souls, 1832,
to two thousand seven hundred eighty-one, for so in the space of eleven years the increase it had been
only six hundred souls seventy-three.

In 1832, state farms had seven thousand seven hundred and fifty head
of cattle cattle, and two thousand nine hundred and twenty horses.

There are 20 degrees north east of Magdalena, a mountain whose summit
is visible from very far on the horizon to aim it is necessary to
take advantage of the dry season, and if not, one in which the general
flood allows free navigation through the plain.

Magdalena road to Concepcion.

Baures Concepcion Magdalena far from twenty miles to the south. At the station dry leaves on
horseback, across the plain, but in the rainy season is up nine leagues Itonama the river, much
curved near Magdalena and passing through flooded meadows in part, but populated by thousands
of cattle belonging to the rooms in San-Antonio and San-Miguel are discovered at one side of
river. From time to time also became aware on the riverbank some capybaras and alligators that
come out of the water. The edges of this River, which is enough width, are bare of trees until
they reached their confluence with the stream of Guacaraje, by which three leagues up to the
port of Concepcion, located on the bank. This port, nine leagues from Concepcion, and in which
there a captain in charge of your vigilance, is the starting point for missions and Moxos
Mamore, not being able to continue on the White River, whose large and numerous rodeos greatly
lengthen the path. Leaving the port is followed by a beautiful road from two miles long, built
by the Jesuits in the middle of a swamp. This road, made no more than land, perfectly drawn, and
easy transit all the time, leads to a forest also two miles long, and covered with palm fronds
and palm tree variety very beautiful, which adorn a sandy soil, full of blackened earth, very
convenient for tillage. After the jungle, there is another road almost as long and well built as
the first, then some boscages, and finally a plain, flooded in parts, leading to the Rio Blanco.
Pass the canoe, after having made to swim the horses often drown often frightened by the alligators,
so abundant in all rivers. A third road of the same nature as before, leading finally crossing straight
line a deep swamp, to the town of Concepcion.

Immaculate Conception of BAUR.

The mission of Immaculate Conception Baur was founded by the Jesuits, then the year 1700, with
the Indians of the nation Baur, who were at that time, as the Moxos, the most industrious natives
of those regions, knowing protect, and constructed tected clothing or cotton robes. The people
and the beautiful cultivated fields around it, occupy a quite spacious and very even, which always
remained dry and being surrounded by swamps, has to form in the rainy season a kind of island a distance
of just over a quarter of a mile of the stream called Black, by which indigenous people are fields
planted to yourself.

A dirt road, which is two leagues long, to this stream joins with the Rio Blanco.

Among the buildings in this mission are distinguished, the church built with wood and bricks,
and his school, which consists of many courtyards, in the first has a flat building high, the
lower rooms that form the periphery of the others, serve as workshops. In each of the four
corners of the square, which is quite spacious, there is a chapel, the center is occupied
by a large cross surrounded by beautiful palm Kuchi, on the sides
are seen numerous houses of the Indians, placed in a row and placed
in the most suitable for facilitate ventilation.

These Indians are, as I said, the most industrious of the missions, do some tected very fine cotton
and a lot of esteem in the republic: the hammocks that make no can be of better quality, but
it is also true that require assiduous work, and that between six wives employ one or two
months in the fabrication of a single hammock. There are workshops tegedura, painting, carpentry,
where you can admire, and painted tablecloths pen, very original work, and chests and boxes
neatly worked, and a thousand other objects made of rosewood inlaid with mother of pearl. Also
Fabr√≠canse chests, beds journey, etc. Other artisans are engaged in skillfully weave fine straw
and nothing brittle, with making hats, cases and lots of gorgeous objects. Finally, this population,
the most industrious of the province, exploiting all known for their curious jobs served many times
without other tools than their knives, which merely duplicate merit: there are used gourds, transforming
them into jars or painted vases, which look so beautiful as those of China, the coconut, making
boxes turned, and many other materials such as antlers, bones, crocodile teeth, ETC. small luxury
items and useful.

Mission plantations are vast, and as they are very well maintained, occur abundant cotton, maize,
cassava, rice, sugar cane and cocoa fruits are property State.

Plantations belonging to the Indians are somewhat apart from the mission on the banks Black creek.

In
1830, the locked state farms nine thousand three hundred forty-two
heads cattle and two thousand three hundred twenty-nine horses.

Concepcion has changed somewhat under the government of the republic.

The difference in products both manufacturing and farming, observed between 1803 and 1830,
given a proof.

Baures Indians, residents of Concepcion, usually attached to his toughness and physical strength,
a very kind and gentle character, but unfortunately so timid that the only fear of punishment
are determined to yield and bow to it. The chief, whose authority borders on Absolutism is the
despot more rigid, and never leave unless accompanied by his lieutenant and interpreter. The
Indians profess a servile respect, so when you see it coming, are removed hat from far away, crossing
his arms over his chest he may not do so would punished severely as has happened many times. Administrators
and priests, not dealing more than their interests, leaving all copyright to these proud chiefs, who
have no qualms about abusing her at his own discretion, and as today or religion, or customs of the
Jesuits severe to discourage their derangement, drink chicha maize continuously to get drunk,
then administering justice according to his whims. It has been noted that individuals living Concepcion
very little time when they come to obtain the position of chiefs, a circumstance which necessarily
abuse brutal that make all the joys that provides the new range, which at the same time that
destroys your health, so puffed up, that certainly would change their badges cacique on an
imperial throne.

The bad example is the unbridled depravity of superior breeds corruption
a people who scarcely discerned on the horizon the first dawn of civilization,
so Concepcion as residents were already filled with vicious shameful,
and immorality has reached its highest degree.

The girls, completely naked until the age of consent, know no modesty, so nothing can curb bad
behavior later, above all, having already extinguished the principles
of sound morality professed before the natives, and returned to dominate
among the women the beautiful custom confused with many other palm
trees look beautiful.

As are forbidden to Indians of all missions Moxos going armed rebellion from held in San-Pedro,
hunting is plentiful in all these spot, growing more and more not being pursued. The monkeys are
having fun at every step to the travelers with their faces and bounds: there is also a kind
of night monkeys. The river is full of dolphins dolphin or a very strange kind that lives in
fresh water constantly: his skin is pintitas pink or dotted. It is one thing that really surprised
to find these animals more than eight hundred leagues from the sea, when the known species
live forever in the oceans, or just upload a few leagues from the mouth of the rivers.

When the rainy season is well underway, you can save a third of the way out by canoe from the
same mission, and across the plain in a straight line until to a stream called Oquire, which will
lead to the right in the White River, which then leads to Carmen.

OUR LADY OF CARMEN.

The people of this name, which lies, as above, fifteen miles south of Concepcion Baures, is
located on the right bank and at a short distance from White River,
occupying the center of a plain where flooding never reached.

The church is simple: State houses, grout with tiles, are temporary:
the rooms of indigenous have thatched roofs are in very bad condition.

Four totais palms that surround the average cross placed in the plaza, is perhaps what is most notable
in this mission.

Perhaps nowhere has as many bats as in the Carmen. Throughout the day remained hidden under the
roof, letting out a very loud odor similar to musk. When night falls, thousands of them out
to wander through the air to pursue relentlessly mosquitoes without
ever destroy them.

Around the village should be picturesque in dry weather, but in the rainy season, Only the banks
of White River offers a pleasant look for cocoa plantations that
adorn.

A very comfortable road leading from the river mission.

In 1792, having been informed that the manager of Concepcion near
the headwaters White River there was a tribe of savage Indians, took
part in this event the governor Zamora, who was ordered to fetch them,
taking to it all necessary measures [1].

In 1794, haprimitiva of the nation, delivered without reservation to all his relatives.

In sung Masses that are said in the church at Concepcion, yet still held apparatus employing the
Jesuits, instrumental music is such, that surprises really captivating
taste to pair admiration.

The bass tones are produced by an instrument of the invention of the Indians, a kind of pastoral
flute to bagpipe, a or two yards long and made of palm leaves, bound one to another, forming thirteen
tubes different size and thickness, nine of these tubes are placed on a line for notes whole,
and four on one for the midtones. To play this instrument, whose notes low produce extraordinary
sound, it is necessary to place it horizontally, not address zampo√±a vertical and ordinary.
Finished the Mass, some Indians, crowned with feathers, leg full of bells and carrying in his hand
a large wooden sword, running ahead the church a religious dance and martial very monotonous;
completed this, there are more sixty musicians, armed with flutes of every shade, from the highest
notes to the lowest, and standing in two rows, are started slowly and a Compaz unique music,
accompanied by drums [1]. Each of the musicians made their instruments to produce one particular
note, and all these savages generally flatter entirely consistent heard many times of their
great harmony. This troupe of musicians, followed by the people, stops to pray before the shrines
that adorn the four corners of the square.

In 1830, the population of Concepcion was composed of three thousand one hundred twenty-six individuals
and was divided into twenty sections, or bias, whose names are: Gimoboconos, Hompaceboconos,
Write to us, Tirajabanos, Nipocenos, Coriceboconos, Choyinobenos,
Itapimuyiros, Taramuinos, Chaquionos, Muchogeonos, Choromonos, Cabiripoyanos,
Abejanos, Arayamanos, Amoriciboconos, Paresabanos, Paromoconos, Abenbanos,
Joboconos.

Road to Carmen Concepcion.

Cu√©ntanse fifteen leagues from the Carmen Concepcion, which is towards
the the south, or if you like, two days of sailing, climbing canoeing
on the White River is very deep, well boxed and much wider than the
Rio de San-Miguel, it has at least one hundred fifty yards from side
to side.

Although little difference in appearance looks the same, its current
is somewhat more tortuous, and increases with the charge of streams
that flow from the neighboring marshes.

Its banks are well-built manned the Baures a number of canoes, sufficient to carry out this
expedition, headed the indicated place, where they found hundreds of Indians, the rest of the
nation Tapacura, submitted by the Jesuits in Concepcion de Chiquitos, and taking with him willingly
or by force hundred individuals, together with ninety-five families Moxos Concepcion, the which
composed a total of three hundred fourteen Baures, creating the mixed population in this small
town del Carmen. This was first built near the banks of White River, about twelve miles southeast
of the site now occupied, but by unsafe site, was transferred in the year of 1801 to the point
where this exists.

The Tapacura it agreed readily to the customs of the missions, and soon they was so submissive
to all the same rules as Baures.

The population was composed of Carmen at the time of its foundation, of five hundred and fifteen people;
but having intermittent fevers prevented its accretion in 1801 was
almost the same notwithstanding that there were seventeen native who
spent seventy years [1].

In 1815 there were reached number sixty-six six hundred inhabitants in 1822, that of seven hundred
and sixty and eight, and in 1830, nine hundred and thirty-two.

This figure is very low provided to the fertility of Indian women to stop almost every year, but three-quarters
of children usually die on the eighth day of his birth. This population was composed, in that
year of 1830, the following indigenous

Quitemocas or Chapacuras. 340 Muchojeones. 230 Baures. 362 ----- 932

The Quitemocas, Chapacuras, or Tapacura have retained their original language, although they
Baures language use has become widespread in all missions Moxos East:
the Muchojeones speak a dialect slightly different from that of the
Baures.

      All these natives are kind in extremity.

The
      population of Carmen is the most
      backward of all the province with
                                  respect
                                   to industry factory, their very ordinary tected.

Cocoa products also yield the most fruitful you should, because of the great neglect with which
it is grown. In the surrounding forests is reflected large number of excellent vanilla.

In 1830, state farms were composed of three thousand six hundred animals,
cattle, and three thousand two hundred ninety-two horses.

All located on the south plains of Carmen and on the bank of the river San-Miguel, are also populated
entirely earned savages and it is estimated that the number should exceed ten thousand.

Major means of communication between the province and neighboring
provinces Moxos.

Currently, the province announced Moxos, with the river Chiquitos San-Miguel, with Yuracare and
Cochabamba Chapare river, and also by the way practiced by me down
Securi river, with Santa Cruz de la Sierra in the rivers Grande and
Piray.

I shall give here a indication of these various vehicles of communication.

Moxos Guarayos Walk to the river of San-Miguel.

Seven or eight days they used to be the country of the Carmen de Moxos
Guarayos, falling in canoe, about sixty leagues to the northwest,
by the river San-Miguel, the edges in Guarayos near present an extremely
varied.

On their own embankment is discover some virgin forests, and whose
foliage of varying colors stand Tufts Mambu bounds of canes or tacuaras,
contrasting with the finely cut leaf of lambaibas, or with the dark
green of the palms palm fronds.
