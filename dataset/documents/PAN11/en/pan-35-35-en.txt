 This inland sea had learned men the art of sailing.
Everyone looked to the waves rather than the sky. Along the way were blue reached the wonders
of life and their entrails were born the gods. The Phoenicians - Jews stuck to sailors - abandoned
their cities in the Mediterranean fornix, to spread mysterious knowledge of Egypt and Asian monarchies
along all the edges the inland sea. Then I replaced the Greeks of the maritime republics.

To Ferragut, the highest honor in Athens was a democracy have been sailors. Citizens served the country
as rowers. All his great men were naval officers.

- Themistocles and Pericles - added - were squad leaders, who ruled
after sending ships his country.

So the Greek civilization had spread and become immortal, rather than shrink and disappear
fruitless, as other inland. Then, Rome, Rome Earth, not to die under the superiority of Semitic
sailors of Carthage, had to teach rowing management and fighting the waves to the farmers
of Latium, hardened legionnaires cheeks the cheeks of the helmet,
they did not know how to move on stage slippery feet iron masters
of the world.

Mare nostrum deities inspired the doctor a loving devotion. Knew they had not existed, but thought
of them as poetic fantasies of natural forces.

The ancient world knew only in the immense ocean hypothesis, giving it the form of a belt water
around the earth. Ocean was an ancient god of long beards and horned head living in an underwater
cave with his wife and his three hundred Tethys Oceanides daughters.

Argonaut No one dared to get in contact with these divine mysteries. Only Aeschylus grave had
dared to represent the oceanic green and dark virgins crying around the rock where Prometheus
was chained.

Other deities were those of the more affordable inland sea, whose borders were settled the opulent
cities of the Syrian coast, the Egyptian cities, which sent sparks into Greece ritual of their
civilization, the Hellenic cities, homes for fire that melted clear
all knowledge, giving them a way to eternal Rome, mistress of the
world, Carthage, the bold geographical discoveries, Marseille, he
did participate to Western Europe civilization of the Greeks, poured
it down the coast from factory to factory, to Straits of Gades.

A brother of the oceanic, wise Nereus, reigned in the deep Mediterranean. This son of Ocean
was blue beard and green eyes, with bundles of reeds in marine eyebrows and chest. Fifty of his
daughters, the Nereids, took their orders through waves or fiddling around ships, sending the
faces of the rowers raised foam her arms. But the sons of Time, to beat the Giants, divided the
world playing it to the lot.

Zeus was the owner of the land, the fateful Hades reigned in the depths Pluto and Neptune ruled
the blue plains.

Nereus, dispossessed monarch, fled to a cave Hellenic sea, to live the calm life the philosopher,
giving advice to men, and Poseidon was installed in the palaces of pearl with their white steeds
bronze helmets and manes of gold.

His loving eyes were fixed on the fifty princesses Mediterranean, the Nereids, who took names of the
colors and aspects of the waves: the Glauca, the Green, the Quick,
the Melosa ... "Nymphs of the green depths of fresh faces and button
rose-scented virgin that you take the forms of all the monsters that
fed the sea, "sang the national anthem in orfeico Greek shore.

And Poseidon to distinguish between all the mermaid of the foam, the white Amphitrite, who
refused to accept his love.

I knew the new god. The coasts were populated by cyclops like Polyphemus, monsters frightful,
the product of their copulations with Olympic goddesses and mortals.

A dolphin complacent running errands back and forth between Poseidon and the Nereid, until, given
by the eloquence of this pimp wave jumping, accepted Amphitrite be wife of the god, and the Mediterranean
seemed to take on new beauty.

She was the looming dawn pink fingers of the vast space between the
sky and sea; noon when numbing warm waters under a cloak of gold restless,
the bifurcated foam tongue licking both sides of the bow rustling,
the wind full of aromas swells the sail like a sigh of virgin kiss
numb the merciful that he drowned, without anger and without resistance,
before falling into the abyss.

Her husband - Poseidon on the Greek coast and Neptune in Latin - woke storms while riding in his car.
The helmets of bronze horses created with their trampling waves to
swallow ships.

Newts of his entourage threw their shells the roaring air to chop down the masts like reeds.

Oh,
mother Amphitrite! ... Ferragut the same as if you described what had happened before his eyes. Sometimes,
when I swam around the headlands, as primitive man, feeling surrounded by the blind force of natural
powers, he had believed to see the goddess emptying between two rocks,
with all their smiling train, after having rested in a sea cave.

A pearly shell was his coach and six dolphins pulling it with trappings of purple coral. Newts,
their children, held the reins. The nymphs, his sisters, beaten the sea with scaly tails, craning
their trunks wrapped in the magnificent woman a green hair, whose loops protruded the tops
of the breasts with a trembling drop at the apex. White gulls and pigeons cooing and flapping
Aphrodite on cuddling and lovemaking in this kindred delivered to the serene immortal incest, privilege
of the gods. And she, the Queen, watched them from your mobile nude throne crown of pearls and phosphorescent
stars drawn from the bottom of their domains, white as the cloud-white sail, white as foam, with
no change in its morning glory a wet pink blush, like the varnish on the shells, that colored
his mouth and calca√±ares, the final petal of her breasts and her belly button convex, pearly
sea smoothness, which erased the traces of motherhood with the same speed that the circles in the
blue water.

The whole history of European man - forty centuries of wars, migrations and collisions races
- the doctor explained by the desire to have this sea of ??harmonious
framework, to enjoy transparency of its atmosphere and vitality of
its light.

Northern men, who need the burning log and booze to defend his life from the jaws of the cold, they
thought at all hours in the Mediterranean shores. All their movements were peaceful or warlike
to descend from the shores of the sea ice to the shores of the warm sea. Craved the possession
of the fields where the sacred olive AC severe with his old cheerful vineyard stretches where
pine and cypress dome rises its minaret. Wanted snow dream under the endless fragrant orange
groves; owning sheltered valleys where the myrtle and jasmine perfume the salt air; of volcanoes
dumb rocks allowed to grow among the aloes and cactus, mountains of its white marble edges down to
the bottom of the sea and refract the African heat emitted from the
opposite shore.

A North invasions had answered the South defensive wars coming up
Central Europe.

And history will continue with the same ebb and flow of waves human fighting men thousands of years
to master or maintain blue glass Amphitrite.

The Mediterranean peoples were to Ferragut the aristocracy of humanity. The powerful Climate had
tempered man as anywhere else on the planet, giving it a dry strength resistant. Tanned and bronzed
by the sun and deep absorption of energy from the environment, his sailors went to the state
of metal. Northern men were stronger, but less robust, less acclimated to the ocean Catalan, Provencal,
Genoese and Greek.

The Mediterranean sailors were established in every land as if it were their home. On this
sea was where the man had developed their highest energies. Ancient Greece had become steel human
flesh.

An accurate likeness of landscapes and races close to the two coasts. The mountains and flowers on
both sides were identical. Catalan, Provencal and Italian South were more like the inhabitants
of the African coast and the Greek islands with Mexican nationals who lived behind him inland.
This fraternity has been shown instinctively in the ancient war. The Barbary pirates, Genoese
and Spanish sailors and the Knights of Malta were slaughtered relentless
on the decks of the galleys, and be conquerors respected the prisoner's
life, treating cavalierly.

Barbarossa Admiral of eighty-four, called "my brother" to Doria, his eternal rival, who had
about ninety. The grand master of Malta's hand shook Dragut terrible to see him captive.

The Mediterranean man, fixed on the banks that were born, accept all changes History, like shellfish
attached to endure the storms rock. For him, only important thing was not to lose sight of the
blue sea.

Spanish, beating the oar in Liburna Roman, Christian, Saracen ships manned in the Middle Ages,
a subject of Carlos V, passed, by a random warrior from the galleys of the cross to those of
the crescent, and came to be reis Algiers, wealthy sea captain, making his name famous renegade.

The
inhabitants of the coast of Valencia were the Moors in Andalusia, in the eighth century, to bring
the war to the bottom of the Mediterranean and seized the island of Crete, naming Heraklion.
From this nest of pirates were the terror of Byzantium, taking by assault Salonica and sold as slaves
to patricians and most leading ladies of the Empire.

Years later, when displaced from returning to its shores Candia home, adventurers Valencia created
a population in a fertile valley, giving the name of the remote island, which was transformed
Gandia.

All types of human force had emerged from the Mediterranean race, thin, sharp and dry such as chert,
doing good and doing evil always great, with the exaggeration of burning an unknown nature and
extent of the double jump to the greatest extremes of generosity.

Ulysses was the father of all, the hero wise and prudent, and at the same time malicious and
complicated. So was the old Cadmus, with his turban and beard of Phoenician ringed large sea
??robber, who was spreading, of wrongdoing in wrongdoing, the art
of writing and the first notions of trade.

In one of its islands Hannibal was born, and twenty centuries later, in another one, the son of a
short of litigation lawyer embarked for France, no other baggage than a poor standard cadet,
to Napoleon's famous name.

On the waves had sailed Roger de Lauria, knight errant of the plains maritime which sought to dress
the fish with the colors of Aragon.

A visionary of obscure origin, named Columbus, recognized for his country to the Republic of
Genoa. A smuggler of costs Liguria was becoming Massena, the beloved quarterback of Victoria.
And the last character this breed of heroes Mediterranean was lost in the fabulous times was a
sailor Nice, simple and romantic, a warrior of all oceans and all continents, called Garibaldi,
heroic tenor cast on his century reflection of his red shirt, repeating on the remote coast
of Marsala epic of the Argonauts.

Ferragut summed up the merits and faults of men of his race. Some had been bandits and other saints,
but none mediocre. Their companies were much more daring and thoughtful
practical.

When engaged in the business, while serving to civilization. In them, the hero and the merchant were
so united, it was impossible to tell where it ended one and start another. They were pirates
and cruel, but the navigators of the seas Hazy, imitating the Mediterranean discoveries in other
continents, did not display sweetest and loyal.

After these talks was Ulysses greater esteem for the old pots and blurred figures that adorned
the bedroom of his uncle.

Objects were spewed by the sea, covered jars of mollusk shells, for a burial centuries underwater.
The deep waters of these ornaments were carved stone with strangers arabesques that made them
think about art from another planet. And scrambled with pots that had kept the wine and fresh
water from a capsized Liburna had hardened pieces of rope by diatomaceous limestone anchor
whose iron grip was broken in red foil.

Several statuettes corroded by salt inspired as much admiration as the boy frigates grandfather.
He laughed and trembled at these biremes Kabir from the Phoenician or Carthaginian grotesque
and terrible gods who contracted their covers with a wave of lust and ferocity.

Some of the marine divinities, muscular and bearded, had an air of kinship with his uncle. This
was to be at certain times. Ulysses had heard some conversations fishermen. Also saw the rush
of women, their eyes of concern when were with the doctor in an isolated
spot along the coast.

Only the presence of nephew was easing back to them and contain their step.

The sea went mad from time to time with a burst of fury love.

Poseidon was emerging unexpectedly on the banks to turn goddesses
and mortals. Females were running scared, as are the princesses painted
Greek vessels, surprised as you wash your clothes, by the appearance
of a newt in heat. She hated the love between four walls. Nature needed
free as a background for your pleasure, the pursuit and assault, as
in the times primitive felt her feet touch the dead while stirring
wave on its prey Roar of passion, like a sea monster.

Some nights,
at the hour when the fog began to pierce the shadows with their nascent
first stab of fire, he felt melancholy, and ignoring the difference
in age, spoke his nephew as if it were a co-browsing.

He regretted
not having married ... Already have a son like Ulysses
