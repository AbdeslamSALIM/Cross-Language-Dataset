 Several times during night
rose up to pray at dawn, in the wet and cold days of the year, leaving home to go to church,
where he spent several hours on his knees, fasted with a rigor that had not seen in his ascetic
master of the seminar, prolonged abstinence, terrible that seemed impossible to resist; spent
sackcloth in the legs and arms, and disciplined Fridays and the eves of feasts. This detachment of the
flesh, this hatred of the beast never felt the young priest. In vain he had wanted to instill
his spiritual director, for nothing had worked their entire lives to acquire it. All was useless.
Bodily penances ached, so terrified him that he had just started to adjourn.
