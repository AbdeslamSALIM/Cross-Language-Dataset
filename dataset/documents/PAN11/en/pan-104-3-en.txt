 Mr. Canon Obrero more than once he had put right out in the
street if it were not for consideration to the memory of his father and grandfather and name
it takes, we all know that the moon is old in the cathedral as stones of the walls .... Can
not think of escapade that do not: in the middle sacristy jura as a wicked gentlemen behind the
benefit. Do not say no, you rascal!

And threatened him with one hand, between severe and smiling, as if in the back of his mind
some grace might make him the faults of the nephew.

He welcomed the reprimand with grimaces waving monkey face mobility and without lowering his
eyes, which had a staring insolently.

- It's a bad shame - continued Uncle - combs you so, as the bravado of the court Toledo comes in
large parties. In the good times of the cathedral and you had been peeled to rape. But as
in this time of confiscation, freedom and misfortunes, our holy church is poor as a rat, poverty
leaves no humor to the lords of the council to be set in detail, and everything goes down
to pity. What abandonment, Gabriel! If you saw! This seems an office like that of Madrid where
people go to charge and runs away. The cathedral is beautiful as always, but not found by
some the majesty of worship the Lord. So does the choirmaster, indignant to see that in large
only parties took seats in the middle of half a dozen chorus of musicians. Young people living in the
Claverias not love our cousins ??and complains about how short they are salaries, regardless
of the time enduring religion.

If this continues, I do not miss see this bird and others as villains
like him playing hopscotch on the cruise ... God forgive me!

And the simple wooden wand waved scandalized his words. He then continued:

- This gentleman, here you see, is not happy with their condition, and that which, being almost
a kid, took the position that his poor father could not get up to thirty years. Want be a bullfighter,
and even a Sunday ventured out in a bullfight in the Plaza de Toledo. His disheveled mother came
down like a Magdalene to tell me everything, and I, thinking that his father had dead and I belonged
to their times, wait for the Lord when throwing them back from the square handsome, and tack on
the stairs of the tower to his room with the same stick stick that I served in the cathedral.
He will tell you if I have the strong hand when I get angry ....
Virgin the tabernacle!

A Moon for the Holy Metropolitan Church got a bullfighter! Little laughed canons and to the cardinal,
as I have said, to hear the case!

A benefit of good humor dubbed him since then Tato, and so everyone calls him at home. Did
you see, brother, what provides the family honor this rascal ...?

The intended Silentiary overwhelm your look at Tato, but he smiled, unimpressed much with the words
of his uncle.

- And do not think, Gabriel - continued - that this guy is missing a piece of bread and why
makes such nonsense. Despite his poor head, is from twenty years the position of dogcatcher of
the holy cathedral, which can only be reached in better times came after many years and good
handles. Cobra realitas its six newspapers, and as the church is loose, can teach the curious
to outsiders. With the tips that fall is better than me. Foreigners who visit the cathedral,
excommunicated people looking at us like monkeys rare and we are all curious and worthy of
laughter, set in it. The English will wonder if it is toreador, and he needs to do more ...! Seeing
that give the taste, loose the bag of lies (because nobody liar leg check above) and count runs
great bearing given in Toledo and beyond, the bulls is dead ... and those England simpletons
take note on their albums, and even some blonde bigeye drawn from stroke the head of this swindling.
For him what matters is that you create the lies and finally we long the peseta, it matters little
that these heretics are to their land being disseminated in the Cathedral of Toledo, in the
Metropolitan Church of Spain, employees are bullfighters and help religious ceremonies between
run and run. Total earning more money I, and despite this, it is believed postponed in office
... A beautiful job!

Marching in the great processions in front of everyone, with great breadth of the Primate,
with a fork red velvet lined to hold if you fall, and wearing a brocade
gown scarlet as a cardinal!

So it seems in that suit, according to the choirmaster, who knows much about such things, a certain
tooth or do not know how, living in Italy for centuries and went
to hell, writing his journey in verse.

Steps sounded on a narrow spiral staircase, punching the wall, connected the welcome to the upper
floor.

- It Don Luis - said Wooden Staff -. Going to say his Mass in the chapel of the Tabernacle,
and then the chorus.

Gabriel got up from the couch to greet the priest.

It was small and weak constitution, highlighting it from the first glance the disparity between
the ailing body and the enormous head.

The front, curved and outgoing with his weight seemed to crush factions brown, irregular, disrupted
by the imprint of smallpox.

It was ugly, however, expression of his blue eyes, the brightness
of the teeth healthy and white alike, who seemed to light mouth, and
smile naive, almost childlike, which folded lips, gave his face that
sympathetic expression reveals to simple absorbed in artistic hobbies.

-
"So the Lord is the brother of whom you spoke me so much? - Said to
hear the presentation Stephen was doing.

Gabriel put his hand in friendship.

Both were sickly: the imbalance Organic seemed to attract them as brothers.

- Since the Lord has studied at the Seminary - said the Kapellmeister - know something music.

-
That's all I remember from those lessons.

- And so much traveling around the world, have heard good things ...!

- Something about that. Music is for me the most gratifying of the arts. I understand some of it,
but "I feel it."

- Very good, very good. We'll be friends.

And you will tell me things. How I envy him for having run the world ...!

He talked like a restless child, not wanting to sit for more than
Silentiary, each of developments around the room, offered a chair.

Went back and forth with raw mantle and the tile in hand, a poor
hat no trace of hair, dented, with a layer of fat in the wings, miserable
and old as the cassock and shoes.

Despite this poverty, the teacher chapel had a certain elegance.

Her hair, too grown for custom ecclesiastical is curled at the top of the skull. The arrogance
with which folded his cloak around of her body reminded layer opera tenors. There was a certain
amount of panache profane that betrayed the artist buried in clerical
robes, eager to fly out of them, leaving them to their feet like a
shroud.

They reached the room, like distant thunder, some severe strokes that shook the cloister.

- Man, they call in unison - said Tato -.

And we should be in the "cathedral. It's almost eight.

- It's true, man's funny that you who remember me. Underway.

Then he said to the priest musician:

- Don Luis, his Mass is at eight. Will talk after things with Gabriel. Now, the obligation. Can
be drawn to the dessert, as you say, because in these times the devil
hardly gives the office to eat.

The choirmaster nodded sadly nodded and left after two temple servants, disgruntled, as if you
drag a painful and unpleasant work. Humming absently to shake hands with Gabriel, and he thought
he recognized a fragment of Septimino of music Beethoven, deaf and cut out from the lips of
the young priest.

Moon lay on the sofa, abandoning themselves to be just fatigue after the long wait to the cathedral.
The old woman who served as his brother stood beside him a jug of
milk, filling after a glass.

Gabriel drank, making efforts to master the trembling of her stomach patient, who was struggling
to expel the liquid. Your body, exhausted by the bad night and fatigue of waiting, finally assimilated
food, sinking into a sweet languor that had not in a long time. Gabriel was able to fall asleep,
and so was more than an hour, still in the couch, cutting several
times their uneven breathing with the rattle of hollow cough, that
did not reach his dream fade.

When he awoke, he was hit with a nervous tremor that shook the feet to the head, making him
jump off the couch and the influence of a spring. Was the concern of danger that it had been fixed
for ever in the habit of uneasiness made in the dark dungeons, all the time while waiting to see
the door open to be beaten like a dog or led to the execution table at the double row of rifles,
and more than this, the habit of living in all countries watched, sensing the police spying
around him, caught in the middle of the night in lodging rooms for the order to leave immediately,
the anxiety of the former Asheverus, hardly like a moment of rest, I heard the eternal "Go, go."

He
would not sleep more, as if afraid to suffer again the nightmares of dreaming black. Preferred
reality: the silence of the cathedral which enveloped him in a sweet caress, calm augusta temple,
a huge mountain of carved stone crushing seemed to weigh on him, hiding forever haunted his weakness.

He
left the cloister, and put her elbows on the railing looked at the garden.

The Claverias seemed deserted. Children who encouraged them to start
the day were school, the women in their homes, preparing food.

Throughout the faculty not he was someone else. Sunlight bathed the whole side, the shadow
of the columns cut obliquely large gold boxes covering the tiles. August silence, calm saint
of the cathedral, entered the agitator as sweet narcotic. The seven centuries attached those
stones seemed just like so many veils that isolated from the rest of world. In a room of the
Claverias sounded a hammer ringing incessantly. Was that of a shoemaker that Gabriel had seen,
through the glass of a window, bent at his bedside. In the patch of sky framed by the roofs fly
some pigeons white moving their wings as if in a lake bogasen bright blue. When fatigued, descending
the cloister, and clinging to the railings, undertook a whisper that shook the religious silence
like a sigh of love.

From time to time opened the gates of the cathedral, scattering in the garden and the Claverias a
breath of air laden with incense, organ roars and bass voices singing Latin words solemnly prolonging
the syllables.

Gabriel looked at the garden, bordered by white stone arches and buttresses rough of berroqueña
dark, in whose peak rains left an efflorescence of fungi black velvet
buttons.

The sun descended at an angle of the garden, and the rest was a green light, twilight convent.
The bell tower concealed a piece sky, boasting on its sides red, adorned with daffodils and
Gothic buttresses projections, the strips of black marble head of mysterious figures and coats
of arms of the various bishops who participated in its construction. At the top, near the
pinnacles pure white stone, showed themselves behind huge bells bars, and bronze birds in
iron cages.

Three severe strokes, saying the high mass was at its most solemn moment, echoed throughout the
cathedral. Stone mountain trembled, the vibration transmitted by ships, galleries and arcades
to deep foundations.

Then silence again, which seemed more impressive, deep, after the thunder of bronze. Again he
heard the rustle of the birds, and down in the garden, some birds chirping, as enraged by
the ray of sunshine revived the greenish gloom.

Gabriel was moved.

He gripped the sweet intoxication of silence and quiet absolute:
the happiness of not being.

Beyond those walls was the world, but is not saw, was not felt, respectful and dull parable
to that monument of the past, beautiful burial within which nothing excited his curiosity.
Who could imagine that he was there ...?

That wart of seven centuries, formed by political powers who died and dying faith, would be his
last refuge. At the height of disbelief, the church serve as a place of refuge, as the greatest criminals
of the Middle Ages, from on high Cloister mocked justice, held at the door like beggars. There
would consummation in the silence and calm the slow ruin of his body. There would die, with
the sweet satisfaction for the world have perished long ago.

Finally performed the desire to end his days in a sleepy corner of the Spanish cathedral, only
hope smiled as he walked on foot along the roads of Europe, hiding
from the civil guard or the policeman, and spent the night in a pit,
matted, his beard in the knees, believing die of cold.

Take the cathedral and grab a rest of the shipwrecked vessel, and a near drowning: it was hope,
and just do it. The church welcomed him as a dour old mother who do not laugh, but open arms.

- Finally .... ...-- Finally whispered Luna.

He smiled thinking about that world of persecution and pain that he left as a place remotely
located on another planet, he'd never return. The cathedral in store for you forever.

In the deep silence of the cloister, which did not reach the street noises, the companion Luna thought
he heard, far, far away, the shrill sound of bugles, and after a dull roll drums. Then he remembered
the Alcazar of Toledo, which seems to dominate since its height Cathedral, intimacy with the
heavy mass of the towers. These were the bugles of the Academy Military.

A Gabriel harmed these sounds. Had lost sight of the world, and when it was believed far, far away
from him, felt his presence, just beyond the roofs of the temple.

II

Since the time of the second Cardinal de Bourbon, was Mr. Esteban Luna gardener cathedral, seemed
right in your family connected. What was the first moon came the service of Holy Church Primate?
The gardener, to ask the question, smiled with satisfaction, and his eyes looked to the infinite, as
if to encompass the vastness of time.

The Moon were as old as the foundations of the church. Had been born several generations in
the chambers of the upper cloister, and when the illustrious Cisneros
had not yet built the Claverias, the Moon lived in neighboring houses,
as if it could exist outside the Primate shadow. No one owned the
cathedral with a better right than them. Passed canons, beneficiaries
and archbishops, won the seat, died, and another for the post; was
a parade of new faces of gentlemen who came from all corners of Spain
to sit in the chorus to die years later, leaving the post to other
newcomers, and the moon always in place, as if the ancient family
was a pillar of the many who hold the temple. Could it be that one
day the archbishop was called Bernardo, was called a year next Don
Gaspar and another Don Fernando, it was impossible and implausible
that the cathedral could exist without a moon in the garden, in the
sacristy or in the crossing, used for centuries for their services.

The
gardener spoke with pride of his race: his noble and unfortunate kinsman
Constable Don Alvaro buried like a king in the chapel behind the high
altar of Pope Benedict XIII proud and stubborn as all of the family
of Don Pedro de Luna, V of his name on the chair Archbishop of Toledo,
and other relatives no less illustrious.

- We are all the same stock
- said with pride -. We all came to the conquest of Toledo with the
good King Alfonso VI. Only took him like a moon to kill Moors, and
were lords and conquered castles, and others, my grandparents were
in the service of the cathedral, as zealous Christians they were.

With
the satisfaction of a Duke who has parents or grandparents, Mr Stephen
went back the chain of the Moon to falter and lose in the fifteenth
century
