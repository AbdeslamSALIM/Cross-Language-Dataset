 

With the many Indians who had assembled to Tupac Amaru, and weapons that had already been seized, decided
to go on Cuzco, to take possession of this city, and made his attempt, crown on it, as the ancient
capital of the Peruvian empire, with all the solemnities to imitate the custom of his old powers.
Availed of this population many fugitives from the provinces immediately, which frightened of
the damage caused the tyrant, but did not think their lives for that environment, and when
they were imagining leaving the city, and it was futile trying to resist the rebel, prevented D. Manuel
Villalta, mayor Abancay, who had served in the royal army with the rank of lieutenant colonel. This
game officer, ignoring the fears, and the experience of their profession, those spirits up shot,
he picked up the militia, and ordered things so difficult to project Rebel, who contributed much to
the chiefs and Chicheros Ink, Rozas and Pumacagua, whose loyalty and the Chuquiguancas, shone
like a bright star in the middle of the black darkness of the rebellion, offering the gift of
loyalty worth sacrificing some lives of their families and all the farms they owned.

Known by the tyrant how hard it was to take the Cuzco, abandoned the
effort, after some attacks, which was rejected by its neighbors gloriously,
directed and governed by Villalta, who removed a dam hand that already
had, and lost that hope, contracted to continue the raids and robberies
against the Spanish.

Declared and everywhere war, and people and campaign without resistance, they could escape the
first insults, fled to the cities and villages that were more immediate. In Cochabamba only,
parts of the Yungas (with whom valleys bordered by Ayopaya), came more 5,000 people of both sexes and
all ages, who led the mayor, D. Jos√© Albisuri.
