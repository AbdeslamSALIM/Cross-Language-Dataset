 

And with the terrible majesty of the Latin father, absolute master of his children more likely to
instill fear to inspire affection, began to walk followed by the trembling Rosetta, which, when
approaching to his cabin, believed to march to a safe hiding.

He was wrong. The poor father had no more children at that time in the world that their harvest
diseased wheat, wrinkled, thirsty, calling him screaming for a drink to stay alive.

And in this thought while his wife arranged dinner. Rosetta went from side to side pretending
occupations to avoid attention, expecting at any moment the outbreak
of cholera paternal.

And Batiste was thinking in his field, sitting at the bedside dwarf, surrounded by his family
often, than to light the lamp looked greedily a steaming pot cod with potatoes.

The woman sighed still thinking about the fine, and certainly provided comparisons fabulous amount
they were going to tear and the relief with which he moved his entire family jaws.

Batiste just ate, occupied in contemplating the voracity of their own. Batistet, the eldest son
to be seized with feigned distraction of small crumbs. A Rosetta, fear gave him a ferocious
appetite.

Never Batiste then realized the burden on their backs. Those mouths that opened to swallow up the
meager savings of the family would be without food if came out to dry.

And all for what?

For the wickedness of men, because there are laws to harass workers honest .... Should not pass
through it. His family before anyone else. Was not ready to defend his men of the greatest dangers?
Did not he have a duty to keep them?

... Man was he able to become a thief to feed them.

Why should I submit, when it was not to steal, but the salvation
of his own, than it was all his own?

The image of the ditch at a short distance caudal dragging its whispering
to others was for him a martyr.

Enfurecíale life pass her door without being able to take advantage, because they wanted the
laws.

Suddenly he rose, like a man who adopts a resolution, and to do it tramples all:

- A water! To water!

The woman was frightened, realizing all the danger instantly so desperate resolution. "By God, Batiste!
... Would impose a higher fine, perhaps the court, offended by default, to take from the water
forever.

Had to think about .... It was better to wait. "

But Batiste had strong anger and phlegmatic phlegmatic men that when
they lose calm take long to recover.

- A water!

To water!

And Batistet, gleefully repeating the words of his father, took the hoe and left the barracks
followed by his sister and the kids.

Everyone wanted to take part in this study, which looked like a party.

The family felt the joy of a people to rebellion gains his freedom.

All went into the ditch, murmuring in the shade.

The vast plain lost in blue gloom cañares waving, as rumors and dark masses, and the stars twinkled
in black space.

Batiste went into the ditch to the knees, placing the barrier that had to stop water, while
his son, his wife and even his daughter attacked with spades the
bank, opening gaps where irrigation came in spurts.

The whole family felt a sense of freshness and wellbeing.

The earth sang with a sweet joy glu-glu which reached the heart to all of them. "Baby, baby,
poor thing!" And his feet sinking in the mud, Bent going side to side the field to see if the
water was everywhere.

Batiste roared with cruel satisfaction that produces the joy of the
forbidden.

What weight is removed off me ... Could the court now come and do what they wanted. Drank his
field; this was important.

And as his fine ear of a man accustomed to solitude thought he heard
a disturbing rumor in neighboring cañares, ran to the cabin, to return
immediately clutching his shotgun new.

With the gun on the arm and finger on the trigger, was more than an hour beside the barrier
of the canal.

The water did not go forward, poured in the fields of Batiste, who drank and drank the thirst of
dropsy.

Perhaps complained below, perhaps Pimento, warned as "atandador" haunted
by Nearby, outraged by the insolent attack upon the law.

But there was Batiste as a sentinel of his crop, desperate hero of the struggle for life, keeping
his men, who were moving about extending the irrigation field, ready to drop a shotgun at first
tried to take the course by restoring barrier water law.

His attitude was so fierce standing upright in the middle of the canal, could be glimpsed in
this black ghost to receive such resolution shots that show, nobody left the cañares immediate
and drank their fields for an hour without any protest.

And what's more strange: the following Thursday, the "atandador" did not appear before the Tribunal
de las Aguas.

The garden had learned that in the former barracks of Barrett the
only valuable was a double-barreled shotgun, purchased recently by
the intruder with passion African of Valencia, who are deprived of
bread glad to have behind the door of your house a new weapon that
will excite and inspire envy respect.

V

Every day at dawn, jumped out of bed Rosetta, daughter of Batiste,
and eye sleep-swollen, extending the arms with gentle stretches that
shook all slender blond body, he opened the door of the hut.

Screamed the pulley of the well, barking jumping for joy with her skirts the ugly tyke who spent
the night outside the barracks, and Rosetta, by the light of the latest stars, cast face and
hands for a bucket of cold water taken out of that hole round and dark, crowned on top by
thick tufts of ivy.

Then, to light the candle, paced the cabin preparing for the journey to Valencia.

Her mother still did not see it from the bed to make all sorts of directions. Could be the leftovers
from dinner with this and three sardines would find in the Vasari
had enough.

Beware of breaking the pot, like the other day. Ah! And do not forget to buy yarn needles and
espadrilles to the child. Destrozona creature! ... In the drawer of the table find the money.

And while the mother went for a walk on the bed, gently caressed by the warmth of the students,
proposing to sleep half an hour along with big Batiste, who was snoring loudly, Rosetta followed
their progress. Placed the food in a basket miserable, spent a comb through the a blond hair, as
if the sun had eaten its color, knotted handkerchief under beard,
and before going back with a caring older sister to see if the boys
were well covered, worried about the little people, sleeping on the
floor of his study, and lying in order from largest to smallest -
from the giant to the little Batistet barely spoke - it seemed a pipe
organ.

- Well, goodbye.

To nit! - Shouted the spirited girl from her arm through the handle of the basket, and closed
the door of the barracks, throwing the wrench at the bottom crack.

It was daylight. Under the steely light of dawn could be seen in the paths and roads laborious
parade going in one direction, attracted by the life of the city.

Graceful groups spent spinners with equal step, gracefully moving
arm right, cutting the air like an oar, and screaming all in chorus
each time a tall boy hailed from the neighboring fields with loving
words.

Rosetta walked alone into the city. The poor knew they were her friends, daughters and sisters of
the enemies of his family.

Several of them worked in his factory, and the poor blonde, more than
once, making gut heart, he had to defend to scrape clean.

Taking advantage of their carelessness, showed infect things in their food basket, break the pot
had done several times and not passed along to it in the workshop but would stop pushing for the
smoking pot where the bud was drowned, and devote wolverine calling
other similar praise to his family.

On the way all of them fled as a troop of furies, and only felt calm to be within the factory,
an old mansion near the market, whose facade, painted al fresco in the eighteenth century,
still preserved among certain groups chipping and cracking Pink legs and faces in profile
bed, remnants of medallions and mythological paintings.

Rosetta gives the whole family was the closest to his father: "a beast
for the job" as Batiste told himself.

The steam burning of pots where the cocoon subíasele drowning at the head, scald the eyes, but
in spite of this, remained firmly in place, looking at the bottom of the boiling water up the
loose ends of those flabby tissue capsules of a light caramel color,
into which death had scorched the worm laborious baba precious larvae
for the crime of making a rich dungeon for processing butterfly.

A reigned in the big house deafening roar and tiring work for the daughters of orchard, accustomed
to the calm of the vast plain, where the voice is transmitted to
huge distances.

Roared down the steam, giving snorting appalling that were transmitted by multiple pipes, rolling
pulleys and winches with a cacophony of a thousand devils, and if not sufficed much noise, the spinners,
as traditional custom, singing along with a nasal voice Our Father,
Hail Mary and the Gloria Patri, with the same tune of the named Rosario
of Aurora, procession parades through the paths of the garden on Sunday
at dawn.

This devotion did not prevent it riesen singing, and so on, between prayer and prayer, bespoken
to be insulted and four scratches to the output, because these girls
brunette, enslaved by the rigid tyranny that reigns in the family
and forced laborers of concern for inheritance to be always before
men with downcast eyes, there were real demons to be together and
without restraint, indulging their tongues drop everything heard on
the roads roads and farmers.

Rosetta was the most quiet and industrious. To not be distracted at work, he refrained from singing
and never caused strife. Had such an easy to learn all that he earned a few weeks three reals a day,
almost the maximum of wages, with great envy of the others.

While girls disheveled bands came from the factory to lunchtime to swallow the contents of their
pots in the immediate content, harassing men with eyes insolent to
say something and scream them after falsely outraged by undertaking
with them a shameless shooting, Rosetta stayed in a corner of the
shop sitting on the floor, with two or three young men who were of
another garden, on the right bank of the river and damned if they
were interested in the history of Barret and hatred of their peers.

In the first weeks, with some terror Rosetta saw the arrival of dusk,
and with it the departure time ...

Fearing companions who followed
the same road, entertained at the factory some time leaving them out
in front like a whirlwind, which departed outrageous laughter, fluttering
skirts, daring and smell dicharachos health of members harsh and hard.

Lazily walked through the streets of the city during the cold winter sunsets, shopping the orders
of his mother, stopping captivated by the shop windows began to glow, and finally, crossing the
bridge, got into the dark alleys of the slums to exit Alboraya the road.

So far so good. But after dark fell in the garden, with its mysterious noises, their black bodies
and alarming passing greeting her with a "Bona nit!" gloomy, and
began for her fear and chattering teeth.

Not intimidated by the silence and darkness.

As a good daughter of the field, was used to them. The certainty that they would find one on
the road would have given confidence.

In his terror, never thought, as her companions in death, or witches and ghosts. The were worried
that the living.

He recalled with horror stories of the garden some hearing in the factory: the fear of girls Pimento
and other jaques to those who gathered at the home of FIFA: thugs
who take advantage of darkness, pushing the girls alone at the bottom
of the shower dry or made them falling behind the barns.

And Rosetta, which was no longer innocent after its entry into the factory, let your imagination
run wild to the limits of what horrible, seeing killed by one of these monsters, his belly sliced
??open and the inside as well as children they were talking about
the legends of the garden, to which a mysterious executioner drew
the shortenings, preparing miracle drug for the rich.

In the twilight of winter, dark and often wet, shivering saved Rosetta more than halfway. But
the cruelest trance, the most formidable obstacle was almost eventually close and your cabin,
and was the famous Tavern Cup

There was the cave of the beast.

This piece of road was the busiest and well lit.

Rumor vocals, bursts of laughter, guitar playing and songs to his lungs out through that door
red like a furnace mouth, which showed the way black a light box cut by agitation of grotesque shadows.
And yet, the poor weaver, to get near there, indecisive he stopped trembling, as the heroines
of the tales to the ogre's cave, ready to get across the fields to
be turned on and behind the building to sink into the ditch bordering
the road and crouched by slipping between the slopes, to anything
but to pass the red face to face bouncing the din of drunkenness and
brutality.

Finally he decided. An effort of will, as he is about to plunge from a height, and along the edge
of the ditch, with very light and balanced way that gives the portentous
fear, going fast at the tavern.

It was a breath, a white shadow that will stick by its speed in the murky eyes of the customers'
Cup

After the tavern, the girl ran and ran, thinking that someone was going to her achievements,
waiting felt in her lap the pull of a powerful claw.

Not calmed until you hear the dog barking in his hut, that ugly animal
that by antithesis doubtless was called Lucifer, and who received
it in the middle of the road with capers, licking their hands.

Never guess at home Rosetta past terrors on the road. The poor girl composing the gesture as he
entered the cabin, and to the questions of his mother, anxious, answered
by casting of courageous and said they come with some mates.

I did not want his father had to go out at night on the road to accompany
it.

Knew hatred of the neighborhood, the tavern Cup with quarrelsome
people inspired him scared.

And the next day returned to the factory, to suffer the same fears to return, animated only
hope that soon would come the spring, with its long afternoons the
twilight light, that would return to the barracks before darkening.

One night Rosetta experienced some relief. Near the city yet, went on the road a man he began to march
in step with her.

- Bona nit!

And while the spinner was on the high bank that bordered the road, the man walked by Basically,
in the deep furrows by the wheels of cars, stumbling blocks broken,
chipped pots and even glassware with which sighted hands wanted Remote
blind bumps in origin.

Rosetta was calm: he had seen his companion just waved. Tonet was the Tomba grandson of the pastor,
a good boy, who served as valet to butcher Alboraya and who mocked
the spinners to find on the road, delighting in seeing how blushed,
turning her face to the lower floor.

Chico more shy! ... He had no other relatives in the world that his grandfather worked up Sundays,
and so was going to Valencia to collect manure for the fields of
his master, as helped him in the killing of cattle and tilled the
ground or carried to the farms rich meat.

Malcolm everything to change him and his grandfather and go there in his ragged, old clothes
of his master. He did not smoke, had entered two or three times in his life at home in the Cup,
and Sunday, if he some free time, instead of standing in the square Alboraya squatted as others,
seeing the boys so to play the ball, found himself on the field, wandering aimlessly through the
tangled web of paths, and if he found a tree full of birds, there
gawk by the flutter and the shrieks of those bohemians of the garden.

People saw in him something of the extravagance of his grandfather mysterious pastor, and everyone
regarded as an unhappy, shy and docile.

The spinner was encouraged with his company. It was safer to leave it next to a man and more
if it was Tonet, who inspired confidence.

He spoke, asking where he came from, and the young man knew only vaguely
with his usual answer shyness, "D'there ... d'there ... "then paused,
as if those words cost him great effort.

Followed the path in silence, parting near the hut.

- Bona nit and greasy! - Said the girl.

- Bona nit! - And disappeared Tonet marching toward the village.

For it was a minor incident, a pleasant meeting, he had removed fear no more. And yet, Rosetta
had dinner that night and went to bed thinking of the grandson Tomba uncle.

I remembered the times she had met in the morning on the way, and even seemed Tonet tried to
always march in step with her, but something separate to avoid drawing
the attention of the stinging spinners .... On occasion, the head
sharply back, believed to have been surprised with his eyes fixed
on her ...

And the girl, as if spinning a cocoon, grab these loose
ends of his memory and pulled and pulled, remembering all of his life
that was related to Tonet, the first Once they saw it, and compassionate
sympathy for the fun of the spinners, he bore downcast and shy, as
if these harpies in band will inspire fear, then frequent encounters
on the road and the stares of the boy, who seemed to want to tell
her something.

To go to Valencia in the morning, saw him no, but at night, to start back to his cabin, he felt
no fear, in spite of the twilight was dark and rainy. Sensed the appearance of reassuring companion,
and actually met him at almost the same point the previous day.

It was as expressive as ever, "Bona nit!" And walked beside her.

Rosetta was more talkative. Where did it come?

What a coincidence, found two days! And he, trembling, as if the words cost him great effort,
he answered as usual: "D'there ... d'there ....»

The girl, who was actually as shy as he felt no desire to laugh but his embarrassment. She spoke
of her fear, the shocks during the winter went on the road; and Tonet, flattered by the service
they provide to the young man finally opened his mouth to tell it
often accompany her.

He always had his love affairs that required him to march through the meadow.

They said goodbye to the brevity of the previous day, but that night the girl stirred in bed,
restless, nervous, dreaming thousand foolish, seeing themselves in
a way black, very black, accompanied by a huge dog licked her hand
and had the same face Tonet. After out a wolf to bite, with a nose
vaguely reminiscent of the hated Pimento, and fought the two animals
with his teeth, and left his father with a club, and she cried as
if the back Soltan in the beatings he received his poor dog, and so
was yacketayakking your imagination, but always seeing the scenes
of his dream run over the grandson of Tomba, with blue eyes and her
face covered with a girl, blond hair, which was first sign of manhood.

It
is broken up, as if to come out of a delirium. That day was Sunday
and not go to factory. The sun came through the little window of her
bedroom and all the people of the cabin was and out of bed. Rosetta
began arranging to go to mass with her mother.

The devilish dream
was still upset. He felt another, with different thoughts, last night
as if it were a wall that divided his life into two parts.

Happy
as a bird sang, while he was removing clothes from the ark and placed
it on his bed still warm with the traces of his body.

Much liked
Sundays, with their freedom to get up later, their hours of idleness
and his little trip to Alboraya to hear Mass, but that Sunday was
better than the others, shone more sun, singing birds harder, went
through the little window air that smelled to glory: how to say! ...
in short, that the morning was for her something new and extraordinary.

It
had been taunted until then a female care for herself. Ten and six
years and who thought it was time to get ready. How stupid was to
laugh his mother was always calling her awkward! ...

And like a new
dress that I saw for the first time, Then he put over his head with
great care, if it were subtle lace, the skirt of calico every Sunday.
Then squeezed much the corset, and if you do not oppress one frame
still quite high shovels, a true corset styling, which cruelly crushed
chest rising, as in the Valencian garden is immodesty than singles
do not hide the seductive trappings of nature so that no sinfully
can mean in the future virgin motherhood.

For the first time in his
life was the spinner over a quarter of an hour before the middle span
mercury glass and painted pine frame that gave him his father had
a mirror in which to contemplate the face sections.

She was not much
he recognized, but were uglier to dozens in the garden. And without
knowing why, he delighted watching his eyes light green, mottled cheeks
of those freckles that the sun raises the skin toasted white blond
hair, with flaccid fineness of silk, the little nose of sheltering
a mouth quivering wings shaded the hair of a seasoned fruit, half
opened and the teeth showed a strong and equal, whiteness of milk,
which seemed to illuminate his face shine: a poor teeth.

His mother
had to wait. In vain the poor woman made haste, writhing impatiently
the cabin, as spurred by the bell sounded in the distance. Iban to
lose mass. While So calmly combing Rosetta, then undo your work soon
satisfied it
