 

Carare below appears to oppose, also beautiful river, whose golden sands serve curdled milk to
a gentle stream, deep and clear. And what of memories to see the mouth of the river! It was there
that Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, conquistador of the New Kingdom of Granada, entered in 1536, dominating
as supreme incredible difficulties and dangers, that history, to be fair, you should consider this
issue as the most heroic, the most extraordinary ever conquistador anyone has conducted and consummated.
If Yélez territories Relief and sent to her beautiful Magdalena
quota in the waters of the rivers Carare and opposition in both browsers
and delicious, the highlands of Tunja and Pamplona contribute their
abundant river Sogamoso or Colorado, which flows near the new port
of Barrancabermeja.

Here, Magdalena highly enriched with the wealth of so beautiful rivers, making grandiose proportions
that make it impressive, while the beautiful islands rising here and there, one very large (the
Morales), give the landscape, beautifully lit, an incredible resemblance to the lower Danube, judging
from the part that I visited. Below the State of Antioquia Sogamoso contribute (in addition to
the Honey and Nare rivers) with the romantic and beautiful river of the Scimitar, which recalls the
eternal storms that reign over the hills minerals in a range of the same name that separates
the region of Antioquia those of Simití and Majagual.

The rowers have a thousand extravagant concerns about the hidden river bed of gold dust and dark
and impenetrable woods, and have many legends, making the sign of the cross on the dangerous metal seekers
who, having gone into the course of River, have returned to look more in Mompos. The people of
San-Pablo, a village situated at a short distance from the confluence of the Scimitar, or are
liable to Mohan Huan, terrible god of the caves and the great wells of rivers, of the misdeeds committed
by the jaguars, snakes and the solid blacks to the detriment of the unwary prospectors. HOWEVER,
I must state that the Mohan such a character does not strike me as absurd as you might think, if you notice
that the bottom line is the Devil, but a devil poetic, highly romantic, and therefore superior, under
the artistic point of view and spiritual, the mundane and vulgar devil sends us believe the Holy
Mother Church.
