to face his curses and sought him, as aforesaid, for space seven days.

On the night of the seventh and three pilgrims came to the shelter in a cave to rest, when they
discovered the hermit himself, praying in the background. A lamp lit with flickering light and that

Hundred years that you expect. Wished for death, I could not die until you fulfill a duty that
has placed me king of the genii. I am the only scholar who still speaks and understands spoken
language rich in Babel before the confusion. Every word of this language is an effective spell
power and moves to the powers of hell to serve who would pronounce. The words of this language

imperfectísimos very poor and it is the most beautiful and complete language of the day. Science

contained in his lyrics the essence of the thing named and its hidden qualities. All things,
at being called by his real name, obey who calls them. Such was the power of the human race when
he had this language, which sought climb the sky, and would have undoubtedly achieved, if the
sky had not provided that the primitive language is forgotten.
