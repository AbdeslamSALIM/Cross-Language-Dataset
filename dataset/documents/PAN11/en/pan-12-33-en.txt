 Because its turn too tortuous,
used five or six days to climb it until San-Ignacio. Anything below the mouth of Tijamuchi
forms the Mamore a big bend, easy to avoid entering a marsh that occurs on the left bank, and
whose waters are almost always corrupted in some spot, causing intermittent fevers, while bearing
in some others, many magnificent plant groups called victory. A few miles away, the Mamore It is divided
into three branches, which are flooded islands, between which it travels with great difficulty,
encountering floating trees, uprooted by the currents. Somewhat later, is passed by in front of the ruined
mission of St. Peter, of which no traces have been more Some Cacahual. No longer have the banks
of the Mamore at this point, the savage beauty so remarkable about the confluence of the river
ITENE. Then appears in the east, at a distance quite large, but below the three arms of the Mamore,
the mouth of the river Aper, paragraph as a day of sailing of its tributary the river Saint-Joseph,
both rivers are navigable for ships of any burden, to the foot of the mountains. Ends on the same
side three or four miles below the river Yacuma, we will sail as above, and whose deep riverbed
is seventy to eighty yards wide, their margins, trimmed bushes, not contrast sharply with the
surrounding plains, which are quasi-nude boscage: three quarters of a mile later, we arrive at
the confluence of the river Rapulo, which not be narrower still offers the same facilities for
navigation, as time of the Jesuits he ascended to the mission of San-Borja. Finally, a little
above of the confluence, we present the mission of Santa Ana, located between these two rivers,
quarter of a mile distant from Yacuma.

SANTA ANA.
