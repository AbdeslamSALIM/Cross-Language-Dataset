 So he had taken breakfast with his uncle, began out, to begin to
put into practice what had been prescribed.

Before the rectory was the way that right and drove down to the people and left and drove up
to Lada, the same one he had brought. Behind was a declining little garden with vegetables
and fruit trees after a forest garden, also decline, which belongs to the meek of the parish
and called the Mata. It was a shock in the true meaning of the word, but formed a grove of trees
of various kinds, planted by the predecessor of the current pastor, and who would not have in existence
over forty years. Because of that, which grow slowly, such as oak, walnut, beech, etc., still
did not have the build that had to reach over time, whereas others had in the fullness of its development.
Bananas could be seen splendid proud with its wide branches Peak ruffled leaves, dark elms magnificent
carved art glass and needles cathedrals, and very thick and made of tiny leaves, large and sturdy-looking
brown patriarchal exuberant health and freshness, they sported alongside their white birch delicate
stems. Wild acacias were also contending with a weak pillar vast vault of leaves, numerous ash elegant
figure, representing in his bowl well cut classical neatness; Espinera wild yew, poplar, mulberry
and other various kinds of trees, all fraternizing in the piece of land jungle parish hobbies
the former priest had been assigned.

Andrew felt an irresistible desire ensotarse in the thicket.

Despite the vague terror of the unknown that always inspires a forest, especially when there
have been more than Retiro de Madrid, and the reasonable fear that the bugs tend to there lair,
entered it resolutely.

Vegetation had never seen such a powerful, dedicated entirely to itself, free to aggrandize whims and
strange and monstrous bear. The good priest had thrown a handful of germs land in that tissue.
Nature had answered the call with a jolt formidable internal forces, raising the turf on a
huge temple moving domes, a cathedral whose shafts vegetables of all colors and sizes lined indefinite
series of sight. And their high arches and thick, sometimes torn by a special treat for that saw
the sky, down more pleasant freshness, more silence religious craft of stone of our Gothic churches.
Light, entering with effort through the manifold to the lattice, fell on the grass discreet,
mysterious, full of exquisite sweetness, inviting deep emotions and soft.

Experienced a delicious confusion by putting the plant at that site.

The sharp, penetrating odor of the jungle, full of balmy emanations, product of the sweat of trees
and earth, intoxicated him sweetly. The infinite variety of lights and shadows danced unceasingly,
the contrast the various shades of green, from deep black to gold, he obfuscated. He sat, or
rather, he fell on the grass, and rushed at once with admiration, fear, welfare and surprise, turned
its sights around, contemplating the sublime temple of nature. Dared not even lift a finger
not to disturb the quiet majesty and peace of their craft. Forgot at one point of his life,
its pleasures and its pains: believed to be born again in other regions higher, purer, happier.
Those trees full of vigor, filled with health and strength, he seduced: August immobility, recollection
with their drinks, he caused a sensation depressing: the strength of his huge arms, which spread
through space firm and powerful, full of sap, he instilled awe and envy. The forest was offered to all
wild life and lush, with the verve and the pride of Youth: no decayed tree, no plant withered,
all male, all healthy, yet strong. Never has the weak nature of our young man felt so humiliated.
Along those athletes crass and replete who held his muscles effortlessly holding the mass of
their tops, felt so poor, so small that he was astonished to live.

But this humiliation, far from causing pain, seemed to regenerate. A strange joy penetrated in
his heart and was spreading through him, flooding in such a way that
caused her anguish.

It was a joy that was squeezing his throat and blood cooling. Never experienced sensation of pleasure
so pure and so deep a sense of beauty. For the first time He who had written so many thousands
of verses! came face to face poetry, the heart said it clearly. It was genuine poetry, radiant
and clear, without verses or consonants far from cuttings, which arises from the communication
of a sensitive soul with nature. Was poetry at that time expressed a Blackbird, which came
to rest nearby, with his notes pure and crystalline. The forest shuddered to hear the cry that
piping, that sweet and melodious song which reflected the freshness, the harmonies, the mysterious
spells forest, directing them to the Maker as a morning hymn of thanksgiving. Andrew also
suffered shock. The emotion that had been seizing gradually overflowed into tears through their
eyes. What I felt was so fresh, so sweet, coming to harm. Crying it cooled.

VII

Rang for the third time the bells of the church, responding with a
busy concert and unintelligible to clear and calm song of the blackbird.

Andrew stood up for mass. Was church not far from the rectory.

When he reached it, had not yet finished the Rosary in the villages on Sundays preceding the
bloodless sacrifice. But only attend Rosary women and the devotees, lucid minds, the temperaments
of the village Voltaireans stay on the porch smoking and talking loudly.

Sometimes the voices are so high that the healing is on accuracy out to impose silence. For
this reason, I always pronounced a speech in which calls, among other
things, scribes, but the recalcitrant parishioners offended do not
give, and receive Shepherd stones down the head with an ironic smirk.

Our young man entered the church, which was small and poor, and after making a genuflection
before the altar, went to the sacristy, even the poorest little room
to the church, a round window through which came the sun's rays.

A chest with handles as a desk occupied the entire bottom of the larger canvas wall, a crucifix
horribly bloody hung over the ark. The first thing he encountered was with Celeste, kneeling
at the door, praying the rosary. Scattered about the room, some sitting, some kneeling, were:
the schoolteacher, who was an effeminate young blonde with farmer in suit holiday, the clerk of the place,
who worked all week and come Saturday Lada afternoon to spend Sunday with his family, his thin
face, aquiline nose, aspect of fox; a gentleman named D. James, son of the people, who had
recently arrived from America: olive color, small eyes and sunken diseased liver, forty-five
to fifty years old, the clerk and two or three people, whose appearance represented the transition
between the farmer and the gentleman.

- Good morning, gentlemen.

- Santos and good ones you have.

The string ended at once.

D. Fermin entered the sacristy as haughty and furious the conquistador who sets foot in a city
surrendered, came with incredible arrogance saying and cruelty:

- This night is cold as in December, I do not think we will have fruit this year.

The bystanders nodded, they had no other recourse. However, the clerk dared to humbly point
would not miss more than the early fruit, the next morning still
could be achieved.

- Do you? - Said the priest, fixing his eyes fraught
with threats.

- Yes, sir - "said the clerk with great presence of
mind.

Against what might be presumed, Fermin did not fall like a thunderbolt on it. He took a huge
herbs handkerchief to blow and replied:

- Do not know what to tell you, D. Felix, now all the sap up and just dropped flower ...

- That's what!

... The pears are hard crust, and the chestnut and walnut trees same - said the clerk with
increasing boldness.

It looked terrifying by the priest.

- I shall be glad, D. Felix, I rejoice, my pear Marco have taken a flower cart that year ... I do not
wish for something good, that I lose the harvest ... And you, D. Felix how has your Pomarada?

The
priest, as he spoke, had thrown from the bonnet and began to get the dawn of canvas helped by
the teacher and the sexton.

D. Felix gave a detailed description of the state his farm: Some orchards had charged much, others,
however, did not have a single apple .-- Something strange is happening with the cider - ended
by saying while fixing a fold of dawn, the teacher and the sexton
had left a bad .-- Before the orchards produced a year and lay other.

Now they are content to give a handful of apples every year.

- Merear, Domine, et portare manipulum fletus Doloris - murmured the
priest, placing the handpiece left arm .-- Come, D. Felix, God does
not offend you with these complaints.

A man Gentlemen (turning to the bystanders), which last year collected thirty-seven pipes ...

-
So what does that matter?

I have collected thirty-seven pipes of cider and I have fifteen days
ox de Pomar, and D. Pedro Marin has no more than nine, and two years
ago got into Winery near fifty pipes.

- Redd mihi, Domine quam stolam
inmortalitatis perdidi, etc .-- murmured the priest put on his stole
.-- But tell me how you have paid to pipes and how they have paid
to Don Pedro.

- Hum, hum! - Growled the clerk, caught in the trap.

-
Hey ... How are you?

Me to tell you, gentlemen, that you tell - said the cure triumphantly, and without waiting
the reply that the clerk was meditating, he got with a single stroke the chasuble over his
head, took his hat, bowed deeply the Christ bloodied, and left the sacristy, please contact the
altar.

Great sound in the church to the appearance of the priest, the women kneel, most of men as well.
In the sacristy operates a movement of concentration towards the door. Don Ferm√≠n, within
the sanctuary, leaning deeply, begin to recite dark hollow voice the prayers of the Mass, a child
next to him replied. The teacher Celesto the clerk and open a huge red letters missal, place
it on the ark of dress, and with shrill voice begin to sing. Impossible to give more disharmonious
and devilish. Andrew, after having referred to a moment in terror, took refuge at the door and from
there began exploring the corners of the church. Was entirely occupied by people of the village,
all farmers, women in front, dressed most part of black serge cloth, tissue color to the throat
and head covered with a blanket flannel, the men behind green baize jacket or yellow corduroy breeches,
white woolen stockings garters subject of color. Every attended with deep devotion and meditation
the mass.

The young courtier, not very fervent, walked over and again his eyes distracted by the competition
now looking at a woman who pinched her son to watch was then in an old man who prayed with
his arms crossed, later in children who were entertained to get his head through the railings
of the altar. There were some pretty nice faces between women, fresh and rosy, which, though
appearing much attention and devotion, did not stop back often, and with obvious curiosity, to the pale
stranger who leaning on the doorway of the sacristy. There was, in particular, a dark, funny
slightly aquiline nose, mouth, tiny and fresh, not too big eyes either, but black and alive, narrow
forehead, and adorned with curls of black hair, who managed to draw your attention .-- Go salt
girl! - thought, devouring both eyes. A young villager also Andrew had to wonder, because he looked long
and fixedly at a good time, no matter none of the nagging curiosity of it. After I had examined
her taste, gave a very slight grimace with the lips and narrowed his eyes again to the altar.
The stranger, the perception clear and fine learned man, guessed by this face that had not liked.
The swarthy face never again to bow to his side throughout the duration of the mass. Instead, Andrew
a kind of magnetic attraction, just might take your eye. By moving the missal to read the Gospel,
she got up, took a wax taper before her, placed on a stick, and went to turn it into one of
the two candles burning at the foot of the gate the altar. Then our hero beheld a figure higher
than low, slender and graceful, a chest raised and ruled that, shall we say to the detriment
of its purity, was not the least impression did from the beginning.

Upon arrival at the Offertory, the priest was about to preach to his parishioners. Some of these,
closest to the door, got out, the women sat, in the sacristy, the
clerk also sat on a bench, took the silver snuff bottle and began
to roll a cigarette: were quick to go with some others.

Andrew, the teacher and D. James remained at the door.

- "I have to tell you one thing - began the priest in the cavernous tone he could assume I have
.-- to tell you that you are a true Pharisees, because aparent√°is
meet the requirements of Our Lord Jesus Christ and Our Holy Mother
the Church, and do, I understand you, mockery of them in secret.

You come to church, pray the rosary, you attend the processions, but because they do not cost you
any work. However, if a hand is, do not mind working in holiday, missing one of the first
commandments of the law of God, saying 'sanctify the parties ... " What are my parishioners in
times of grass, as now, is a true scandal, and is yielding to say, I understand you, all the
pious of the council. With the freshness up the grass on Sundays, load and go with the car screaming
by the middle of town, as if God did not look up, as if a key with your sin spine over the head
of our Redeemer. This is not good, not good, and I hope corrij√°is you, if you will not be whitewashed
tombs of the Gospel tells us, full rot, do you understand me, and filth inside and clean on the
outside ... that's ...

"But someone will say:" So, under no circumstances, you can work on Sundays? ... I will reply,
I have identified ... If Juan, Pedro and Diego, for instance, have tended grass in the field, and
fear that they will lose not put it in the tinada as soon as possible,
either because the day dawns cloudy and threatening rain, or do you
understand me, because it is dry few days or for any other reason,
if they seize the Sunday morning to put it, and effectively put, trying
not to give scandal ... do not sin ... But if John, Peter or Diego
are set to stir the pot or put it on a Sunday to be more unemployed
on Monday, or because you understand me, want to conclude the sooner
this work to begin another or that they have it in the tinada before
other neighbors, or any other cause that is not legitimate ... then
sin mortally.

"Therefore, you know ... You can not work on holidays without a cause that While those that are
heard at the door ... Without just cause! ... Those who work sin mortally and are doomed, if
not cleaned in the sacred tribunal of Penance, to eternal punishment hell.

"Therefore, you know ... The third commandment of the law of God is "sanctifying parties. "Everyone
is required, I understand you, to keep the holy days of obligation, not only for the good of
our soul, but for the example you give good behavior of others. Those who miss this sacred precept
without commit a grave sin.

God rested the seventh day when he made the universe, and wants us to rest also ...

"Therefore, you know ..."

The priest still continued good effort while dragging the car of the word, repeating the same
concepts, sometimes with the same words, looking at the knuckles, to rub gently, new ideas and
arguments. The voice was deep, particularly when periods ending: at first, but that deep twang.

The
faces of the parishioners expressed resigned boredom. Women sat on the floor, watching the priest
face to face with distracted eyes. Men door yawning, opening the
mouth to the jaw out of joint.

Andrew, the teacher and D. Jaime, tired to listen, also retreated
to the bench where he was the scribe.

He set a animated conversation about what the neighbors would collect for the feast parish I
was not far away. The clerk, D. Jaime and another claimed that there were the cause of the neighbors
were opposed to be taxed, saying the factory was still some funds: the teacher and Celeste
defended the priest.

At last he finished his talk, and continued the service. All returned to their original positions.
The singers were just as they now say but amen and et cum spiritu tuo, responding the priest.
When he, after singing Mass solemnly ite est, his blessing to people, the bystanders turned
on each other, saying a "good morning" and rushing amical to collect the hats. Some left, others, including
Andrew, were waiting for the cure he entered the sacristy mumbling Latin, downcast eyes and
folded hands. After took off his cassock, he greeted his friends with expansion.

When our young man left the church bells rang merrily. The sun bathed and all the valley.
