JOB, XXXIV

While at one end of the porch and laid out the scene occurred, took place in the opposite something
quite different. There were lively and interesting group of ladies Ilincheta together with the
two youngest of Gamboa, surrounded by a semicircle of knights that
Galante or admired.

All rise. The women supported their backs on the rail, and outstanding gentlemen Rosa Ilincheta
lips, in short, full of grace and graphic expression, describing the little incidents of travel,
his poor handling part the way, and his own impressions.

Leonardo smiled, clapped Cocco, Mateu the doctor was like pirouettes
and Meneses remained serious jealousy, because it grew with fans of
his beautiful lover.

Adela and Isabella, under the hands, listened and said nothing.

Suddenly someone pulled the skirt Adela out-side of the portico. She turned her face vividly
and saw a good black appearance, dressed very different from that
used other slaves on the farm.

- What do you want? - Asked Adela
pretty scared.

- Your worship excuse me, girl.

It came by your doctor.

(I could not see through the darkness and skirts Ladies' filed.)

-
And who are you?

- I'm the nurse, maid of his mercy.

- The nurse!

Adela repeated surprised.

- Yes, girl, nurse Maria Regla.

And his mercy is not the girl Adelita?

- The same dresses and shoes.

- Ah! cried the slave, gently squeezing the girl's feet, and another could not part of your body.
Heart told me. Yesterday I saw her pass by the window batey of nursing. I was in doubt what my
girl if the girl Carmen and her grace.

Much has changed! How beautiful it has been my daughter, Holy Virgin!

- Heart told me so cute, my daughter, Adela mimicked.

If I am your daughter, if I want so much, Why do not you come to
see me?

I warned you to Dolores.

Why do not you come out to speak?

I have very angry.

- Ay! cried the black.

Do not tell me this girl is killing me ... His beneficence was not
alone.

- No. Went with mom, Carmen, the wife and sister Moya Panchita.

What was so special?

- Pretty girl of my eyes.

- Speak, explain.

- I can not now, my
child.

- What!

You do not think my mom ask his blessing?

- Yes, girl. I, I want the soul, came ... From the point reached
by Ms. de La Habana, I run and throw myself at your feet ...

- Why
have not done so? Who has prevented you?

- Miss it.

- Mom? No, it
can be. You are wrong, you dream, Maria de Regla.

- I mistake not,
nor sleep, Adelita girl. Hopefully! Miss has banned your feet on this
house.

- How come I do not know about that? Who has been with such
a story?

- There was no story, Adelita girl
