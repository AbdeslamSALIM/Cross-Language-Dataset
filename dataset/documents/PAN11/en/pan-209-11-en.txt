 

Dona Ines dominated by that imperious creature, she got carried away.

Both came home in Juanita.

This, for Rafaela not see who entered his house accompanied someone
else opened the door with the key in his pocket.

The two women, quiet and toes, climbed to the upper room.

Missing and a few minutes to eight.

The bedroom where he slept Juanita had no light except that entering
through a round window, open on the bedroom door that led out into
the room.

In this, and not in the bedroom where there was room enough, washed, combed and dressed every
morning Juanita.

In the bedroom there was little other furniture than the bed, a nightstand, a closet for clothing
and three chairs.

Juanita Dona Ines was the bedroom.

- You, climb on a chair, that
little window you'll see what happens.

Did not have some what to admire and laugh about.

That said, Juanita left the bedroom and left it prey Dona Ines, closing
suddenly the door and throwing out the key.

- What are you doing?
- Said Dona Ines -.

What folly is yours? I enclose Why?

Juanita replied, laughing:

- To make sure you locked your neutrality. I do not want to ally, but to witness. Shut up and watch.

Doña
Inés, quite angry, replied yet:

- Abreme.

Will I regret you trust me?

What mockery is this?

- Forgive me, forgive me - Juanita said with a pleading voice and
sweet -. You are my godmother, my protector and I do not want nor
should I tease you. No doubt that it is what I do. Shut up, by God.
Be patient. Look and see without speaking. Shut up. I hear noise.
Our man has entered home. And climb the ladder. Hush! If he suspects
that someone here will give a scandal and make a nonsense.

Doña Inés
resigned and was silent.

A few seconds later Don Andrés Rubio entered
the room.
