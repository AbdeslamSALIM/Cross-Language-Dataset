 

When you factor should surrender the assets of the people for their management, the way to now they
have given to managers, with only the difference that had to deliver over priced and make their
values, but with the same intervention now have the mayor and steward of the people, keeping
each of the three keys each store, thus being not easy to find the qualities expressed factors,
and while bonds have to ensure the flow of management, would be risky thing putting in his
hand, with absolute freedom, this management.

For the factor is bent and seek every means imaginable useful and beneficial the factory, it was
convenient thing to point out, in lieu of salary, a percentage of annual profits of the factory,
but at the same time that the factory should Do not give anything for food and amenities, or
raised to allow any Indian or boy who was not paying his salary and giving the food, plus the
fact that was to be voluntary and not forced. With this decision is minoraría, and even extinguished,
the multitude of unnecessary employees in schools, and would go out to work on what was useful to
them and the people, will excuse the daily expenditure has grown now community as feeding not
only the manager and his family, but also those are caused by feeding stray few dealers and
even walk in these villages, therefore being at the expense of the factors to keep your table,
not so liberally franquearían everyone. Looking at the bills that have come from Buenos Aires
since the expulsion, see in them that most of what they contain are edible and utensils kitchen
and table, all managers have used and nothing has been spent relief of the Indians, and all
this was cut So everyone ate and was served at his expense.

Factor would be the responsibility of determining the tasks that should
keep the factory, preferring always affords greater profits.

The good condition of the rooms had to take the first attention, as they took hold in the main
livelihood of the people and which, being well served, yielding significant progress with its profits.
The yerbales culture that exist in all peoples, and that lack of care are badly deteriorated,
and even lost, would endeavor to restore the factor with the timely cultivation and replenishment
and growth of new plants, thus achieving good crop of grass, and the increase in value when
they would betray the people, because everything should assess depending on the status of receipt and
delivery. Also would serve to increase and good cotton and sugar cane, and to ensure abundant
crops to increase farm and values.

Can also undertaken many other tasks in the villages, and factors not be neglected to take
advantage of the proportions of the country.

Wood cutting and forwarding them to Buenos Aires, the construction of vessels, and to sell in Buenos
Aires to bustle them by the rivers, transporting the estates, the benefits of yerba mate plantations
in wild Paraná and Uruguay and by land and water the cattle to the fields raised cattle, and many
others which are practiced and have always practiced.

They can also invent other new jobs which offer many advantages such
as older established and well known: the cultivation and indigo, that
there has been exemplary benefited very good people, and I have notice
benefits in Paraguay by a particular its quite useful, and manioc
flour, farina pao known among the Portuguese, and starch, the two
species are estimated and consuming in Buenos Aires, and that is something
cinch the manufacture and abundant cassava in these villages.

Rice also offers much account in building refineries to clean, and a myriad of minutiae that
would help increased trade, occupation and income of the Indians.

Cultivation and processing of snuff, and the black as they call red, offers these crecidísimas peoples
benefits. This branch, which in the present state can not overtake extinct if the communities
could provide high magnification, is the planting and cultivation snuff cinch to any individual
who is devoted to agriculture, but the benefit after collecting the leaf is painful to those who were
not free, time and proportions This, and more the benefit of black
snuff for many tools that are needed.

Al same time the factory would be embarrassing to flood crops, cultivation and collection of
snuff, but it would be easy profit after papers were collected, and so what should was that the
Indians, and any other individuals, would go all the plantings in their own buy farms and in
deep leaf seasoned pagándosela cash at a price are regulated, so that remains a modest profit to the
factory, which, with appropriate tools, it would snap the benefits grow lots of black snuff and
red, applying to each class was best for her. Thus it was necessary stockpiles grew, then, almost
every Indian sown, as they are many, taking freedom to work on the land so fertile, it would
make good crops, which would increase by planting which in turn hiciese the factory, which should
also the had.

Plantings of all the fruit supply, such as wheat, corn and all kinds of beans, the Indians
would verify as they are accustomed to them, and they would buy the factory for the supply of
the village. Well is that, if necessary or helpful, could also make the factory.

To keep all these tasks, or those most accounts offer, should be in cahoots Indian laborers
who were necessary for applying to the children and old to occupations that they could comply.
These laborers should be voluntary, and they would weekly pay, governs
a very moderate wages, which in my mind enough not lacking for laborers
and who work hard, which in the hardest-working and applied are regulated
at 6 reales per week, 5, 4 and 3 to less activity, grading of each,
giving them all a hearty meal at noon, boys, girls old and old enough
that they reached the wages to dress and feed.

Although the inclination I know in all these Indians are not colluding and earn wages I have
certainly no lack few peons need the factory to their tasks, before
On the contrary, I believe that the factory would bring precision
to occupy other all, if my concept come out wrong in this part, and
the Indians are more applicable to their work colluding in particular
to the factory, no inconvenience is that the factory would reduced
its tasks only the most useful and accurate, and that they will oblige
weekly and in turn the necessary laborers, paying them their wages,
and that in case of non-Indians disengaged, because, having, them
and not others should make clear to work as idle and vagrant people.

Shall be most desirable that the factor can be in cahoots, and conchabo, few Spanish are presented,
or may be, for laborers of the rooms, chores yerbales, snuff and benefit for all occupations
to be good destinations for which, when mixed with the Indians at work, teach and encourage them to
work, and so it should be the cahoots some of these Spanish for foremen of the various tasks
to be undertaken, although the latter should be admitted to government approval, and not otherwise.

At
the end of each week should the Payment of wages that have accrued
pawns in a week, according to the ballots to be given them overseers,
who should be arranged and implementation assistance that each would
have had that week.

All stockpiles that were made in a fruit or effects should be made weekly in stores three keys
with the magistrate and butler intervention, and even the council, if it had fit, settling in a book
that should exist within the same store, entries, signing everyone in it, practicing the same with
the exits, and some as others should be made more in the stores, and the factor and Butler should
have books individuals that enter the same items, as well as a diary that target small items
in the speech of the week will be collecting or expending so that clearly stated and the purity
of this management.

Inside the main house should be allocated a piece on purpose to give it a store or grocery
store by a Spanish or Indian employee purpose, which is sold all kinds of edible offal of daily
need, delivering account all what there was to sell and collect the money every Saturday sales
surrender of the week, which should also be placed in the box store three keys, which should have
to book her ticket and outflows of cash, with the same formalities
as the of the fruits and effects, and every four months or when the
factor would fit, would final accounts of the grocery store to know
the status of her and her management, warning its result to the government.

For

this grocery store was stocked with everything you should care factor, for its part, and do to
look after the butler, that all the fat of cattle, and from those killed on farms and in the
people, serve candle which it was made there, as well as grease from
them.

That is kneaded bread, not lacking beans, corn and other edible the country produces and consumes
the Indians, as well as salt, sugar, honey, soap, so they lack nothing of what might be offered,
except for strong drink, they should be banned entirely, as they are by the law.

For prices of the sales hiciesen these retail grocery stores were not arbitrary the factors or store
owners should be given by government tariffs, the prices fixed that were established by other
duties, for purchases that would make the factory the Indians, so that selling retail could not
exceed 25 or 30 percent price increase that they had bought and sold
wholesale only half the retail.

The supply of meat should be in charge of a Spanish or Indian, arranged so that each res good
size utility left the factory weight of silver and leather value spending of manipulators and
pastors.

It would be convenient and very precise thing that the stores were stocked with adequate clothing
for these people, and of those called in Castile as the country, ensuring that in the factories
of paintings of peoples listadillos work, and all those who use and
crave the Indians, as also no lack of brakes, spurs and any giblets
know they are useful, and trying not to introduce useless and superfluous,
and only Saturdays, and with the assistance of the mayor, mayor and
some council, should be opened check stores and sale of these effects
are of daily necessity, and the amount drop it right there in the
box of three keys in the manner aforesaid, and separation other items.

These effects could increase cargársele on the main cost Buenos Aires, 40 or 50 percent, so
they bear the cost of driving, failure and impairments that may suffer, and excises to be paid,
and commanded to leave a good gain, for it serves in a common utility, scope and terms after
be said.

A no Spanish or Indian, established or employed in the towns, which should be allowed effects introduced
to sell, or even of its precise use, as everyone should buy the factory,
but it will be allowed to sell the necessary licenses to individuals
from outside the province to come and buy them out, even lowering
price something that is regularly sold at retail to those established
within it, thus increase the field of trade, and therefore the profits
of the factory.

While the factory and factor wages and employment should give all those who pidiesen, and compel the
justices through the idle to work, should also buy from the Indians, and even the Spanish settlers,
few fruits and effects acquire with their work and industry prices that the government had
established, even if There would have been any sale that they had
to do for it would be something highly desirable that everyone had
secured the sale of the product of their work.

Well is that the government would care to put tiny fruit prices and little effect necessary to
separate the Indians from the application useless things useful by tilting the through the
best prices and profits that they surrender, as we shall in the case
of government.

Butler would be in charge, with the intervention, guidance and care of the factor, buying few fruits
and giblets daily bring him to sell the Indians, paying in cash to set prices, to which should
be in possession of some money that he take account of the end of the week, receiving and storing
what they had bought, and giving enough money for the following week. This same foremen should
buy and pay the thread that the Indian hilasen and wanted to sell, fixing prices according to
their qualities, in my mind should be paid to 3 reales per pound of wick, 4 of thread Thick canvas,
7 the medium, 12 the fine and 16 the superfine, and sell them in the shop real half-pound
of cotton, or 10 reales the arroba, on the assumption that I buy a 8 reales the arroba of wishing
to sell their crops.

The thread that are collected could be used to canvas for your grades,
paying the weavers their work, as the rods and quality of parts.

The factor should be atahona to all who wished were milling wheat where so, without further payment
for milling that is deemed sufficient to keep peons atahonas mules and composure, and would likewise
mills, and all utensils for grinding benefit the sugarcane and honey and sugar, and, finally,
all those offices would not easy coastal poor, and that lack of them
or do not sow or plant those effects, the inability to benefit them
or lose them for lack of them.
