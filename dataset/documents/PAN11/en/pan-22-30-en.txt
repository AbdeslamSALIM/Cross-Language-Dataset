at the feet of his head, another Marine guard standing at his side also fell badly wounded, and
Uriarte was finally entirely alone in the castle, covered with dead and wounded.

Even then withdrew his view of the British ships or the movements of our artillery, and the impressive
aspect of the quarterdeck and poop, where his friends and subordinates were dying, did not
touch his manly chest and broke his strong resolution to hold fire until perish. Ah, I remember
after the serenity and stoicism D. Francisco Javier Uriarte, I could
understand everything they tell us about the heroic masters of antiquity.
