 When again,
the cops see the girl that answers a mufti of Cairo or some holy man Mecca with another sign
written in Arabic. Meanwhile, the frost has cleared tight covering the fields and grass and flowers,
as if they had been oppressed under that weight appear by magic. Anemone nemorosa is one of the
earliest to open there calyx to announce the Spring. But a thousand flowers, more fragrant and
no less beautiful, appear after calling and exiting the breeze to breathe the aromas they exhale.

The
breeze comes, like the bold prince fairy tale, and goes through the
elusive forest, and enters the palace silently, and goes to bed and
slept in the haunted princess, and gives a kiss of love.

Then he undoes the evil spell, silence and the rest are bartered for sudden death in movement,
music, excitement and life. As if they were to be held divine weddings, upholster and beautifies
everything. They open the treasures unfold finery, put tables and dressers of the royal banquet,
and looks over the wide thalamus cover of purple, emerald and gold. The guests have already said
that pilgrims come from far across the sky. Others who do not pilgrimage, awakening from long
sleep, are lined their richest robes, and go well. All as good subjects, they try to imitate
princes. And as the princes are in love and will marry, all fall in love and marry. It seems
that hardly any living being that does not get drunk with the juice of magical herbs or the perfume
of strange flowers, which move to love, delight and joy, inducing to life which would increase
and spread and open new ways of being.
