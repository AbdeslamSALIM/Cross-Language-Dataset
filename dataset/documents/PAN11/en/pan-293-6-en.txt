 But do not stop to look, to reflect the sun happens to the purple vapors horizon.
Light up the mountain again, but with softer glow. It seems that there hard rock under his robe-ray:
there is only a mirage, a light air: it seems that the superb mountain broke off from the land
and floats in the purity of heaven.

Thus the rarity of the air contributes to the higher regions to the beauty of the peaks to prevent
dirt from reaching the lower atmosphere to the summits, but also forces to the invisible vapors
coming out of the sea and the plains to condense and to engage as clouds on the slopes of
the mountain. Generally, water vapor suspended in layers lower air is not significant enough quantity
to become tag changed into rain and fall: the atmosphere in which the claims in the state fleet
of invisible gas. But as the layer of air up to heaven, taking the steam will cool gradually and soon
reveal the water condensed in different molecules. Seems at first puff almost imperceptible, a
white snowflake on a blue sky, but then are added to this snowflake others and constitute a
veil which allow tears to the eyes that penetrate deep space, and finally presented as thick
dough, rolled into cylinders or crowded in pyramids. Some of these clouds loom on the horizon
in the form of real mountains.
