 

Probably the last case of this kind has been to Carmen Marín, "the possessed or Spirit, "during
which the archbishop, priests and nuns, who was deeply moved society of Santiago de Chile, in the second
half of 1857, and is documented with reports of doctors and priests, by the "Revista Médica de Santiago",
October that year.

Under the horse's feet of an angel through it with his spear in the center of the church Villa del
Pilar, Paraguay, I have seen a devil in the form of a lizard, bat-winged, barbed seeded, huge big eyes
of owl and vulture claws with nails, and I thought with regret in the daytime nightmares and
sleepless nights that the sight of such a supernatural monster should lead to the unfortunate children
of the village.

We understand then that France, the pupil of the Jesuits in Cordoba, and Lopez, disciples France,
could wield with full effectiveness as political terror in a population morally depressed
by the religious terror, and it is understood the profound difference between the politics of South
America, where massacres and proscriptions were the main instrument of government and politics
of North America, where it never occurred to leader resort to any intimidation of their fellow citizens
to subjugate or carve prestige, because 200 years earlier bill had been tempered by tolerance infernal
horrors diet Christian churches that fed the predestined for heaven.

When the mental capacity of the mass of the population was expanded to scientific culture, the
descendants of those same Christians barbarians of yore have been able to retain less more
evil and Sermon on the Mount in its intellectual complexion widened, thereby has ceased chronic guillotine.
The same circumstance had ceased their diabolical operation the Puritan witch-burners of New
England, and his absence is to be the continuation of the massacres
of Jews in Russia and Christians in Turkey.

Sarmiento was in our country, contributing more effectively to sweep the Argentine spirit with the spread
of lights that public education, that lamentable moral garbage, which is the government for
fear of children and adults Cuckoo fear the devil. Vanished by the growing liberalism medieval
religious terrors, has correspondingly ceasing political terrorism,
and the Christian devil only retains his immense prestige and vast
role that created the visionaries of the Middle Ages, educated aristocratic
families in schools of monks and nuns, and in the remote campaigns,
by the crass ignorance.

What Christianity is superbly savage and barbaric, which has made some Sometimes men more cruel
and more unfortunate that these wild animals is conception of hell with eternal torments of the
devil, witches, goblins, ghosts, etc.. and so on. The appalling refinements of cruelty came Christian
of that school or spiritual atmosphere of wickedness and supernatural
horrors, pending on the existence of the believer as the sword of
Dionysus on the head of Damocles.

Because things, facts and ideas do not shock or scandalize us as far as they are monstrous, but
the extent to which out of the ordinary, no longer shock us when are or become regular, like
the idea of ??original sin and of doom with the devil, purgatory and hell, as with the burning of widows
in India, before British rule, as with the eunuchism in Muslim countries, with the Maffia and
the Camorra in southern Italy, with bullfights in Spain and lynchings
in America.

The influence of indoor environment is analogous to the external environment, and monstrosities
imaginary produce the same effects as real, although on a smaller
scale, also ranging with the temperament and education of the subject
that represents them, see them, know them or hear referred.

When the theological madness became the normal state of European societies, wisdom and human wisdom seemed
shocking monstrosities, and the wise sages were imprisoned, hanged or burned by theological
scholars. When you know, with the most complete certainty The dead were roasting by order of
God in purgatory and hell, and when this imaginary fact reached in the spirit of the people, by
the preaching of the Lord's ministers, the vividness of an actual fact, obvious and visible, through
the language the blasphemers with a red-hot iron, torturing those accused of religious offenses
and burn alive those convicted were made as regular as it is today the sentencing people to
prison or forced labor permanent or being killed in duel the educated man or without mourning
for the uneducated, or the burning of black in North America, where they all fall back on that
white was burned alive, being probably the idea of ??burning future of white outlaws which downplays
the spirit the village to the immediate burning black outlaws in anticipation of the simple
divine justice, for the double odium of crime and criminal color.

"We can only see out what we have inside," says Emerson, when we are full of spite, stupidity
or wickedness, are everywhere, and when we are full devils and ghosts, see and feel them everywhere,
because everywhere carry. And what has always been done with children, as an "educate them in
the belief of the seniors, "head has been filled with witches, goblins and demons and the result
is that every believer is haunted, possessed or "engualichado" by demons, witches or "gualicho"
he believes, and predisposed to believe the other zonceras of the same species, as jettatura and
thirteen, verbigracia.

The theory of divine powers and demonic powers to the metaphysical explanation of good and evil,
has been a prodigious fertility to mislead and disrupt intelligence human. The fragmentation
of the effects, involving fragmentation or grading of the causes, suggested the subdivision and location
of these on the people, things, words, in numbers, which came to be so, miraculously good or
bad in different miraculously measure; escalonáronse the first angels, saints, virgins, relics,
prayers, to the simple holy water, and second in the devils, witches,
elves, wizards, to the innocent owl.

Both powers were more fully materialized yet, so there was the smell of health and the smell
of the devil, they fell sambenito lot sulfur and ozone, resulting the condensation of oxygen from
the air by lightning. Naturally against particles evil power in spells, damage, spells and
curses were enough particles divine power contained in the blessings,
baptism, relics and scapulars, or fist in cross as the fist just against
jettatura horns or Fourteen against thirteen.

Of the same nature, origin, material, form and structure of the gods monstrously immoral horrible
and barbaric savage races, is the devil: scary, seductive, cunning, treacherous, hypocritical, damaging
trade, profession perverse, delighting in evil of children and adults, bound by the beliefs of
their elders to live in perpetual danger and guard Standing against their tireless pitfalls,
especially designed to spoil the good, to take them down, for the condemnation of God, a herd
of life sentences, having he reached the absolute impunity of their evil deeds have incurred from
further the first in the maximum punishment.

The ubiquitous Christian devil is the Assistant Director of iniquity the epitome of savagery
supernatural.

Eternal and indestructible by imaginary construction, rituals and magical ceremonies not are
more permanent than a defensive organization against their inexhaustible magic powers; saints
and angels are a kind of spiritual gendarmerie also effective to hurt and away, but powerless
to kill him, because he's dead.

We believe that impunity of the wicked is demoralizing, but there is bigger and more evil to go unpunished
of Satan and his legions, if our leaders have been fierce barbarians, it is because hell and not
heaven was the strongest component of the superstitions of his spirit.

Patterns in the atmosphere of barely literate, and completely illiterate servants and workers
that passed our childhood, all feared and no one had ever seen God, but all had seen, heard,
smelled or felt the devil prowls around the core or at their heels, night in a thousand circumstances
or even by day.

Too high, complex and intractable the first, has only fallen from the heights and has been left
very rarely seen by the prophets chosen to this end, and there in ancient times, the second, however,
eminently democratic, loose and without apparatus on earth, and be seen all over the world
figure of man or animal, without ceremony previous state of grace or disgrace, the free sowing fear and
terror. It is these two attributes, terror and fear, a fearful life that depress the spirit,
broth fat to make the bold and long harvest produce benefits of any kind for suppliers of condoms,
because "there is an ill wind that blows nobody good," as the saying,
and that there is both sincerely and ardently propagated and grown
by the beneficiaries, especially when they themselves are personally
immunized about him, because ideas purest and most sordid interests
tend to tie in the depths of the spirit secret links that go completely
unnoticed by most sincerely honest conscience.

In time and in the middle when I was a child and gullible, the spiritual condition of the Christian
child unit was the time of Rosas, as described by Velez Sarsfield. "I know he lived between terrors
"because the current intelligible and religion dealt with demons perverse and incastigables
on eternal torments of hell, of martyrs and saints, about good people,
who had previously cooked in purgatory to finish to win the bliss
with abstinence and the sufferings of his life miserable.

All of the "folk lore", ie all the intellectual and moral material circulating dealt basilisks, salamanders,
Salamanca, covens, witches and enchanted maidens on the Mandinga
pericana, witches, goblins, ghosts, visions that populate the space
to the gullible, and make them anxious the mere absence of light in
the darkness of night.

The women of the house that evening rueful gathered to pray aloud, did printing of the besieged busily
preparing to repel an attack of night enemy. The bearing of the allowance to a dying day parade
with lighted candles or lanterns, bells ringing in the middle of the street, people bewildered
that kneeling to pray sight or sound of eternity spent in the funeral procession led by the
priest, and the rest in the mortuary chapel of distressed home, they made the macabre impression
capital punishment in the public square, also priests, inmate on
death row, and marches funeral, and spectators moved.

Older people tended to be living repertories ridiculous procedures to prevent and to remedy evils
and dangers real and imagined. The yawning, crossing herself on mouth open wide, to prevent Satan
entered him for her advantage the global crisis and a cold person who sneezed, he was told the same
subject: "Jesus help him. "A notary, who was a specialist in false writing to deprive widows,
orphans and tiling, and bearer of all the guilds, knitting and walking in processions battleship
permanently with scapulars blessed, took his precautions against the devil in the table to draw
a cross on each bite prevention to be led to crop, and end of their mischief, cheating the
devil and hell, he went "straight to heaven" remorseful and contrite and "comforted by the rites
of the holy religion," as they prayed the obituaries.

Well, in fact, the classic way to be a devil with the devil was to get well God, qualify for the
Church, join guilds, entrusted to the saints and to provide of relics
and indulgences to make more mischief in cold blood and die "quand
même" odor of sanctity.

In village life, which characterized colonial society, the devil, with all its derivatives,
Domestic institutions were ubiquitous and protean, essentially malevolent
and haunting.

It was a hothouse of superstitions, by and benefit of a farmer and grower official ancestral fears of
withering joy of life in children and good humor adults, to save the soul.

Particularly at night, all unusual incidents were attributed to demonic powers. A combination of light
and shade that imagination lends its preconceived forms, a cat black, a strange dog that appears unexpectedly
in search of food waste, a owl food excursion, the terror of a horse, lights and sounds with no
known cause everything was attributed to the dangerous presence of unsuspecting souls poacher,
and buyer generous souls in trouble, ready to go where they call or name, and close treatment price
haggling, startling in its moments of good humor to good people,
disguised of "widow" as a few years ago in the Rosary, or "pork",
as in the suburbs of Buenos Aires, where she gave birth to the milonga
called "Run you run the pig", etc.

As the losing roulette, in Mar
del Plata, who attributed his bad luck to the "ducks" or onlookers
back, if the milk or cream were cut was because they had been watched
by one person from evil eye, if a tree is dried, it was because he
had been touched by a person bad blood, capturing snakes and spiders
live was a thing of witchcraft, etc.., etc. It was customary the tendency
to explain the common things for wonderful causes.

Just as the Chinese lit night light in the door of his house, scare away evil spirits, the
houses were in the bars of the window or door street a bunch of olive branches or palms blessed to
ward off demons, and all places where a man had been killed, without
giving him time to repent of his life to save his soul, had a niche,
in which lit candles at night, fearful of the souls in purgatory.

The fear of loneliness and darkness, there is no child-educated laity, and afflict children
raised "Christian" depressed adults also ignorant and superstitious, with the most dire consequences,
such as, eg, the case was referred by me my cousin Roberto Suárez. At the "The Brush" at the
foot of the mountain, in one night dark and stormy winter, were screams
of children.

Fourteen pawns present the house, not one, or all together, they were encouraged to accompany
him to go to his aid, claiming that should be the same demon who was crying to draw them into a trap, ending
by contagion its terrors to him, it was just a teenager and had been educated in Christian
the Jesuit school in Havana. The next day they found, in fact, a poor missing child, nestled
in the hollow of an old tree and died of cold.

We, who had seen, heard or observed many individuals who told us to be traces or events of the fateful
character, just, at last, meet the "Devil" in person and face to face.

It was in the department of San Vicente, today Belgrano, in the province of Mendoza. A boy neighborhood,
which was sent every afternoon to mow grass in a vineyard, taking you back, late at night,
for a lonely street, with his pack on his back, asked us to fear
acompañásemos to shrink our presence, we could only make us illegally,
returning inside the farm that stretched to the aforementioned lane,
and penetrating through the partition wall with a neighboring orchard.

A very dark night, my brother, who was in front by the back wall, stops and turning head, I
said quietly: "Let us turn, there's the devil." Where? I say, raising head above their shoulders,
to look ahead, and I had barely glimpsed, poncho and hat, one hand on his back in an attitude
of taking the knife from the waist and fuming at the mouth, nervousness
led us straight to the two slip and fall.

Get up and leave in the middle of the lane, and then the real center of the street as souls who run
the devil, to reach almost breathless and trembling with fear at our house to relate what happened,
was something of a hurry, which also seemed eternal.

Among the laborers, some suggested that they go together to verify the facts, but eventually none
dared, and only the next morning could be seen at the site of the apparition, in a gate closed
temporarily with sticks, had been cut with the knife leather restraints that held the horizontal
beams and robbed them.

It was easy to infer then, that the thief was smoking, in that circumstance, one of those
thick cigarette sting of snuff Tarija, with more sticks than sheet, and that therefore used
as a fire sparks fireplace.

That was the time that we experience on a wider scale called stupid and diabolically "the holy terror
of hell."

When the proportion of acetic acid in wine is very considerable, it is called vinegar and if
the same criteria we had to give the past the component name Main
spirit and human behavior, we should say that Satan was started end
up in America in 1810, the reign of the devil flared superstitious
among us from 1820 to 1852, to continue in an increasingly less pronounced
to date.
