 To
get into the hammock without falling while these enemies, it is necessary to raise the sheet
from the floor, only to get the precise dragging the body, while some hole through which to
enter, because if they come not stop fidgeting all night.

Not to be surprised by the infidels of the river, which are the Payaguá, and a nation that only be
seen in the river of Porrudos, always leave a soldier on guard defended in fence or bush,
which has many loaded guns at hand, in order to fire if he offer, while the other soldiers come.
On the ground can not easily be undertaken, by the impenetrable undergrowth of the mountain,

which they call Paraguay-mini arm, and makes the big island of Paraguay ten miles long, and
in my opinion, they called the old Island Orejones Argentina puts because the Xarayes below.
Sail, after emerging from the arm, by the Paraguay river, until they reached a narrow arm of the
Porrudos river, and to this arm narrow channel called Chan. In leaving it, sail the river of
Porrudos above, to enter the Cuiaba river coming from north to south. Finally navigate the
Cuiaba river above to the port city of the same name. The works to be navigation in such neat
pass by many rivers, and in weather so hot, it is easy to see will be many and great, but the
more often the ongoing war of mosquitoes not cease to bother at all hours.
