 Among those
letters, most insignificant things or reveal Ferpierre already known, there were some that the Prince
had written to his friend in the preliminaries of his love. Were such passionate and earnest
that it almost gave off a whiff of burning them: words sighing, singing, burning with flames.

"Light
of the world, the life of the soul, a smile of grace, port of salvation
will you hear what living ever heard?

Has never known anyone who I am. I have not had a mother, I had no sister. I do not regret it,
on the contrary, I am proud, because now I can reveal to my heart to you alone ... "

And he confessed to her, candidly, the said it was a sick child, a
madman needed care and love, that its apparent value hid a childhood
fear, that his pride was humble, that loved to hate, that when shed
tears of compassion, the smile of derision contained them, was going
from one extreme to another with painful anxiety, eagerly tormenting,
with the nostalgic need an unwavering serenity.

"Your love will be my salvation, peace, the port, the promised land, paradise lost and found
again. Love me as I need to be loved, as he loves children and animals, a love that is all forgiveness,
compassion, comfort, relief and relief ... "

have healed, but the meeting had occurred later, and if the Prince had forgotten for a short time
their inveterate habits of life and thought, soon had returned to them.
