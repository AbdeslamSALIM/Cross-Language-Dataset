 

Monsalud had not gone four steps inside the building when she was called from everywhere opposites.
He went where he had seen faces more to his liking, and after greeting several individuals sat
on the farthest table in the company of two subjects. One of them seemed Salvador have with
standing and close friendship as they greeted with much affection. Was median age and good
looks, was called Don Eugenio Aviraneta: his home had Guipúzcoa and had a very special talent
of the conversation quality is not rare in Spain, where they have made great careers know or
refer it to tell stories with art or raise issues and issues of all kinds. The other was younger,
fucking pale olive, hair and eyebrows of the greatest darkness, the sharp nose short and thick
mustache, modeling the knife in a unique manner under the most ridiculous fashion imaginable,
which was to draw two straight lines from the nostrils to extremes of the mouth, drawing a small
mustache and carefully carried the name triangular of mucus mustache. He also wore the olive character
a knob-tail rabbit and cheeks pin or short ribs, also shaped by the knife with a dedication
that almost came to the office of a rapist confused with the art of sculpture. This and the
short mechoncillos accompanied toupee over his ears were cries declaring that the auction and
crowning of this singular head had to be one of those huge helmets base narrow and extremely wide
cap, visor and chinstrap fine suspended copper sides faceplate. The Morion such immeasurable
was watching, yes, over the head of that good lord by force of analogy, but was discovered and
wear civilian clothes. But if a thread gets a ball, usually on one side also removed a Morion,
and thus could mouthful to say to our guy was more by token military and Ayacucho.

- I present to you my friend Captain Rufete - Aviraneta said putting his two relations comrades
-. Now tell us something, tell us what is in your life, man.

Then you are rich no one sees you.

Spoke at length of things in life, travel, hunting, disease, and without
knowing how magna stood on the question of the day, namely, that the
King did not die so soon as some crooks wanted, it was decided solemnly
swear Isabelita as heir to the throne, and the good-natured D. Carlos
was leaving for Portugal.

Filmed the conversation from idea to idea, until Aviraneta Salvador touched on the arm and said
mysteriously:

- If you want to take care of a delicate mission, there is no objection to confide.

- I know that conspire, "but by whom? - Salvador said laughing - Why
Cristina, D. Carlos or both at once?

- You know me and know that
my wings not to fly any bat.

I committed to explore the minds of liberal people to know under what conditions could have her
in case of a civil war.

- The free - ayacucho said with emphasis
- are and will always be next to the Princess Princess if you put
a pillow in her crib the best codes.

Free Calling the Liberals and the best codes to the Constitution of
12 constituted with many other phrases, a special style that has long
prevailed in all forms advanced literary party.

- Calle you, man,
for God's sake - said Aviraneta scolding with a gesture of spontaneity
Captain -.

The free, as you say, and liberals, as I call them, are as divided no two opinions you hear the
same if you talk to them.

There are plenty of fools who can not be started from the head as the best of the codes, there
are some crooks solemn than malice and having to face the mob, scream, if allowed, the constitution or death;
is the group of anilleros or scholars, who deny all if not given
the two Houses with Charter, French, and even think anyone wants to
see three houses, not to seem quite two.

Some ask who has a lot of religion while having freedom, while illuminated want to stop people from
burning cowl and convents, so that deleted nests not afraid that the birds return. I have both here
and there and I found roughness is not easy to soften, and antagonisms can not be beat. Martinez
de la Rosa Toreno, Burgos and refuse to masquerade as much as revolution, always agrees Palafox
with those of Calvo de Rozas, and Calvo de Rozas, together with Flores Estrada, has made a templadita
constitution. They want both, as good parents, if not preferred, say not count on them for anything.
Romero Alpuente and swear that exalted Constitution no more than the 12 across the globe, and make
them succeed, though he weighs. Come on, this is a menagerie, and I say the outbreak should
war and great danger might come to that then come together and touching so many wills to an
agreement on the final constitution, but had seven cameras and four bedrooms.

- The sovereign nation - said ayacucho speak speaking as Solon - will decide in its day best suited.
A free people is not wrong.

- With statements taken from the Gazettes, friend Rufete, low achievers. I see that the divisions
are deep, that the Liberal Party, being scattered and persecuted, not already have a fixed idea
common and nothing. The army, which before was a friend of the Constitution of 12, now goes
to I have, and it is realistic to count on Spain and Llauder tempered. However, in view of this confusion,
is not patriotic attempt reconciliation of all who hate tyranny? What do you think, Salvador,
is not patriotic, very patriotic?

- I feel so patriotic as possible
- said the questioning.

- I know my country, I know my countrymen,
I pressed different keys conspiracy times, I know the value of these
ideas, insignificant next to the value of passion, I know well that
the politicians of our land are almost always governed envy, and most
of them have an idea, just because the neighbor across the street
has the opposite idea.

- Pessimistic you - Aviraneta said severely.

Then he raised his finger to his mouth with a solemn air, and rose with a sign ordered his two friends
to follow him, which they did willingly Rufete and Savior, one by discipline of conspiracy and
one out of curiosity. Going through a little door with the counter was, went to a small room dark
and narrow, formed in the angled hole the staircase leading to terulias. A dilapidated bank
offered very hard and not very clean seat to the three individuals, and some coffee company dábanle
a long beak, empty boxes, huge brooms and buckets for different uses.

That was the chemical laboratory from which flowed the inventive
mixtures to which he owed his fortune the master of the establishment
(the which, incidentally, was fervientísimo patriot) was where the
growth is checked rations of milk, thank God created water, there
were made from various substances European and Asian Mocha coffee,
and there the pounds of sugar became arrobas from night to morning,
the same as a quidam becomes minister.

They sat in what looked more like niche that room, and as they had no light, were not seen
from outside and could see all that from the coffee went up to the highlands.

- Here we can talk comfortably - said Gipuzkoa - and explain my idea and no one knowing. To remedy
the serious evil that formerly indicated, I have determined to establish a joint secret ....

-
I thought that - Salvador said interrupting her laugh the exordium of his friend's grave -. In
that we had to stop.

- Shut up, do not judge what you do not know yet .... A secret society called The Elizabethan or
Elizabethan.

- I insist on my view that the Patriots call Elizabethan - ayacucho said, demonstrating his accent and
his hand stiffness strongly the importance he attached to the baptism of planned society.

- The name must be short and simple.

- We have the Mason on the ground - said Salvador - with its ridiculous
mysteries, their formulas and folly.

- No, no, son, there are no
mysteries.

- "Not initiation, or towers, or East?

...

- Not at all.

- "Not special vocabulary, or aprons?

- Nothing, nothing.

-
No more than the oath of intentionally submit to the sovereignty of
the nation - said Rufete.

- Here is all current.

No mystery. The partnership will work in silence, but without formula Masonic and call us by our
names, although the acts and documents adopted conventional sign
to designate them.

- So the company is already operating?

- Is being
formed.

We have not had a mass meeting of members .... How Many in the list, dear Rufete?

- Three hundred and twenty and one - said Ayacucho, who apparently played the roles of secretary.

- There has not been anything yet, has not gone to any commissioner
provinces.

It takes one confidence and clever, going to Paris and London come
to terms with the emigrants who left by and with people living abroad,
and because I can not name name them.

- Ya ... and this go-between
is needed ....

- Correveidile not, but agent, that agent is needed
you.

- Well, I swear - Salvador said the jovial way - that if or
Elizabethan society Elizabethan Patriots, as claimed by Mr. ... and
I figure that it intends to reason ....

- The idea of ??patriotism
- Rufete said unable to contain himself - is so fundamental, to be
take charge of all denominations, in order to save more and more on
people's minds.

- Well, he said - he went the other - if the company
hopes to expand and prosper I be your agent, the trial will end without
all the fruits that the country and you expect it.

Aviraneta mused, her cheek resting on his hand.

At every instant one heard the footsteps of climbing the ladder 7,
and as this was weak and was so close to the heads of all three subjects,
it seemed that they came over the house whenever a patriot would climb
the upper rooms.

- Damn! - Aviraneta said on the occasion coming
up three, four lads getting more noise altar boys in loud ringing
day -.

That's who spoil everything with their pranks.

Now the cute little angels, instead of sucking, are given in Flower
to play in the Masons and Carbonaro, and between jokes and laughter
are above their Cameras of honor and Horn, which makes several masquerades,
which must be reported to the police.

They are almost all little boys want to make more noise than studying.

And what's speeches Yours! Is that a brood of speakers, if I mistake not, has to give Spain more rants
that will Castilla chickpeas.

- These birds singing - Monsalud said
laughing - always come before the storms policy, announced his angelic
trills.

It is a phenomenon observed in the storm past and will repeat, do not doubt you, in those to come,
and so we will always that any policy of a progressive transformation is preceded by large
blooms children wisdom and speeches in the classroom.

- For great
will be the transformation - Aviraneta said - if it is to judge so
this bunch of poults screams .... Santa Monica, how many ups now,
and what have peak!

That voice ... you hear what so admirable body: it González Bravo,
a young man terrorist smarter than Cardona and with more venom than
a cobra .... But back to our case, we, in founding the Elizabethan
society, we aim to unify the thinking liberals and bring the army
into a common idea is a common precursor.

- The army is deeply divided
- Salvador said - because I know that the apostolic camp or pug, as
he now called, has recently made major acquisitions in the Royal Guard.

-
The military is liberal - said Rufete, which can not be silent any
longer took the floor with a crash on the first opportunity -.

The army is composed of free men they love the most perfect of codes and hate tyranny. Tell
Constitution, and the army respond Constitution.

And taking a little behind the hat, which should be shako of the inverted jar, put more yellow
and accompanied his facial alteration of these patriotic words:

- Many speak of the army without knowing it, and I, you know, I belong
to him, that I glory belong to him, I say that with the exception
of half a dozen of traitors, we are all liberalism, here and in America.

I've been in America, gentlemen, I have fought in those Colossal battles
of Chuquisaca and Cochabamba, and I can say that nothing we consoled
our deprivation and work like talking about the Constitution, to think
about it and write it our flags to bend the knee to the bravest Indians.

I remember well that after of the famous expedition of Jujuí, we got
the news of the triumph of the Constitution in Cabezas de San Juan,
and we went crazy with joy.

Wanted, or that we bring to Spain or take us beyond the blessed Code, and may not be neither
one thing nor the other, celebrate with parties, dances, poems and
snacks that great event.

The joy was general. Some we proclaim the draft Constitution in Peru but opposed Maroto traitor.
The free America wanted to adopt the system, but iron did not want
traitors and blood, and I wonder now what I've always wondered: who
is responsible for that lose the tremendous battle of Ayacucho?

Who? ...

- That question, dear Rufete - watching with disgust Aviraneta noted
that the historical muse his secretary was soaring too much - he has
missed his chance.

Soon we care know who did worst in America. As for the army, we know that is mostly liberal,
but you yourself have spoken of traitors, traitors were in America, and also in Spain.

- Here I have the list - said promptly Rufete doing besides taking
a role.

- No, you do not remove the list.

Nor do we care so much now .... Our company already has a brilliant civilian contingent of
characters.

- Wait a minute - stirring Rufete insisted their roles - here it is.

- No .... With a hundred thousand Palitroques! also we need now the list of Elizabethan. Sheathed
you their lists, man. What I want is to bring to our ranks this good friend, give a commission that
will play nicely.

Salvador made repeated head flags.

- We'll see - said Gipuzkoa -. Harder rocks have broken me. Do you have jobs?

- Those of my interests, not many.

- It is true that most are rich, bad business! Have you married?

- No.

- Is not ambition a high position?

- Do not aspire to anything higher than the bank, and what they call popular aura bothers me
more than the sadness of being alone.

- Yet - Aviraneta said - I think you will conquer.

And then stopped. Would willingly shed at the time of their services Rufete secretary, full
of lists to be alone with Monsalud and speak frankly and discovered Well known to the wily conspirator
had expressed his idea of ??a sick so enigmatic. But Rufete not move, and the dubious clarity
came in the fourth review was amusing their lists of traitors and their lists of Elizabethans.

-VII-

They
were still, therefore, the boring one, the other coming up with reasons to dismiss the Ayacucho
and flowing the third mode of passing a name of one role to another, when he entered the coffee a
cavalry commander, making the saber creeping, with heel spurs and big bang, that it seemed as
if a squadron had assaulted the facility. He wore boots mud and dust on the suit, stating therein,
as well as informality that went from table to table making news, who had just returned from
an expedition or perhaps of a battlefield. Was D. Rafael pseudocyst, exalted patriot first,
then indefinite then prosecuted and convicted conspirator gallows, but pardoned again and admitted
to the service through the influence of powerful relatives. After satisfy the curiosity of coffee,
and ran up, and upon entering the stairwell called his Aviraneta from its cache. Entered pseudocyst,
Salvador recognized, embraced, but had gained much good man tell
what he knew, who could not wait for the end of greetings, spoke thus:

-
We have already caught!

We have good hunting!

- What? What was it? ... "Volunteers scoured realistic?

- Yes, and half a dozen like this soon left the Nation sacristanes
clean .... You know you who went to the Bassa column heading to pursue
the lifting of eaglets Villaverde commanded by Colonel Campos traitor
.... At first we did to do ... that here, over there .... Total, gentlemen,
five leagues Alares them Navahermosa surprised praying the rosary,
I copamos ... did not escape one for seed servers.

- Do they shot
to?

- No orders to both.

The Government is conciliatory, or other pastry man, and one hand
has other disciplines and the plaster.

As I am not fond of walking with butter case of those people, I would have given them all a
little gun marrow.

On the other neighborhood are better than here .... But now is not
to shoot, they'll do when we caught underneath.

Overall, we brought them side by side, and the rascal is so cowardly Campos they began to mourn,
and no one asked it revealed all the ille diebus Carlist Madrid meeting, citing names one by
one.

At this time the traitor will be vomited all accusations to the police
and walk and doing prison.

Middle Madrid will warm to jail tonight.

I have found in the Puerta del Sol to a squad, do not lie, yes, a
police squad that went to the streets of Bethlehem, where it seems
there is a maximum council subdeacons with a knife and stole guerrillas.

Total, gentlemen, we have looked the Bassa, and tonight will be aired
many burrows.

With living Abur angelica and Gentlemen, I'm going up to dinner.

-
And I put the uniform on and run to the barracks - said rising hurriedly
Rufete -.

Is easy to alter the public peace tonight.
