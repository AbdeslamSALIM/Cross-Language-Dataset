it was the turn of Don Alvaro, who was not as friendly as that of Campóo his father, and under
this Act was an expression of greeting.

For very little more than these compliments he gave me the time because they had not yet sat
down again half the people there, when Don came word that everything was Sabas early in the
church and we waited. As we were very close and not exceed ten the funeral less than two hours,
and outsiders had to go home after lunch in mine, and evenings were very short, we started immediately,
accompanying Neluco and her sister Mari Pepa, much mourning. The old Marmitón not allow leave.
To have the table and direct and order all that was left was painted Lituca one for this and other
much more. Also Chisco and Pete stayed with two monsoon Salces my confidence, well aware of many

occurrence, or because I was inspired by a Women's eloquent look gray, to see how the house would
remain, without us, helpless and all but empty.

And walk toward the church, we saw pop up on the rocky hump of a man tall, stocky, beautiful
head, wrapped a broad-brimmed hat and a gray beard; came to hand with a brown jacket and trousers,
the same color, rolled up on a stout boots of sole and very muddy. He brought his hands in his
pockets coat, a paint stick and knotted under his left arm, and mouth smoked a pipe.

The first thing he saw was the lord of Provedaño, who was the most forward among us. He paused to watch
him singing with his hand over his forehead, and also stopped the other with dark eyes and impassive
upon him. Like two lions. Do not missed more than smell. Then came more, and shook the right
hands with stout shocks. Then I found two mountain twin oaks shaken by the breath of the same burst.
I do not know what they said or if they said something. Why?
