his wife and his last orders, respect and liaison with people and things from this mortal life,
the century and the land that sustains us. Nuno was Montilla, and delivered demure younger brother
secretly D. Alonso de Aguilar, a long letter, written by Dona Mencia, and said thus:

VII

"When I said goodbye a few days ago from the castle, back at
you and sending you free and making demands that recover, I had no
courage to say goodbye yet also of hope See You in this world, oh
my sweet young friend!

Was already taken and hidden in the center of my soul the firm resolve never to see you anymore,
but I did not tell so far. Now I'm telling you now that last time I will make my words come
to you, even from afar, God will forgive me if I am happy to remember my loss, not for weeping

words, perhaps from the first time I hablastes. Do not think I obfuscate, which blinded me and

give my heart and be all yours.

the man whom I had loved in my early youthful days, and who had wept long years after his death.
But I soon discarded this idea, considering you coward hypocrisy
with which my understanding, more subtle liar who was trying to mitigate
the powerful vicious attempt at my will.

No: I do not like D. Jaime, but a thousand times better than him. His image etched in my soul,
not faded and disappeared well did your image affixed to it, a seal and mark of slavery that makes
it yours forever.
