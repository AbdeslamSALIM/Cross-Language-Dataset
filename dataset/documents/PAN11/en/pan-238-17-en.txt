For the father Ortega was the family that was respect and love for tradition, respect and love
for our ancestors. "The family is a tradition, tradition glories, name, honors, virtues and
memories, and all that means one thing, love, esteem and respect for elders, that is, at most
generous and conservative is in the family. "On this occasion the speaker thundered against the
revolution, against the wind blowing from hell to destroy everything old and glorify it again,
against that contempt barbaric customs, laws, institutions, of the glories of our ancestors.
"The revolution is written on its flag: the greatest contempt. Why not, if the ancient beliefs,
ancient customs, the old institutions, the ancient aristocracies, despite what in them, as
in all things human, may lie on least, represent the work of our ancestors, intelligence, the
glory, the soul, the lives and hearts of our fathers? And if so, how revolutionary science cast
on all things old disdain their stupid, there was also launched on their rude ancestors contempt?
"A principle of family breakdown is the attack which is governed by the revolutionary school
property. This aggression is not only a direct attack against society, but an even more direct
attack against family. "The property, inheritance and heritage, what are they but the cult of the
ancestors and love to the children? The property is the present, past and future of the family;
is the place where it grows and expands over time, is the soil that ensured grandparents will,
as now under the soles of the seed that rises blessing. "

sacred bond of landed property and promised to fight for she heroically in the Senate oppose any
law that directly or indirectly would prejudice his integrity.

After the Piarist is repressed complied with smiles and shouts of enthusiasm. All spoke in
falsetto respecting the sacred enclosure.

Miss leathery that had asked before what would become of her if the father missing Ortega ran to
take the hand and kissed it repeatedly with outburst that changed a few looks of mockery bystanders.
The father withdrew abruptly with visible disgust. And rose again the gallery several ladies
and gentlemen, and executed, in every sense of the word, some Gounod's religious melodies.

At
last they left the chapel all those pious souls and went to the salon.

The Marquise de Alcudia, whose will could not ever be at rest, prepared
to meet what he had promised his nephew.
