 By a foot of snow more or less kept pepazo returning to
his home, far away that it was very dark and it was night; and not come back was a sign that
when he realized that it was snowing hard and thought about turning around, the snow depth and
did not lose half a yard, which could not have occurred, according to opinion of those who had
seen "the air of snow" that night, before half past eight or nine. Adding up the hours since
the beginning of the company of pepazo until then, measuring the walk that lead up the hill,
and infers the ziszás he would, probably, in their various attempts to "shortcut" down the slopes,
leaving fair account: if pepazo was not in the winter "Peñarroja" was in the "Cuevona" the "Pedregalón
of Escajeras" or had been gobbled up the wolf, which was not likely having mozallón near as
tasty beasts of flesh as he was chasing. Neither hunger or cold were able to finish in one night
alone with a life so hard to crack as the Pepazo. No one doubted, and the caravan began the ascent
of the mountains caring for nothing else that a firm step and save time. By God's mercy, the
day, although brown, are presented relatively calm, and only the snow sparkled at the time.

Three hours did rise more sour, and another step of the first ridge
along it.

Of these four hours, the second and third test was because there was in them all evil that
abounds in the forest during the snow gauge it: air-numbing, vortices which drown, disoriented
and stray mists, trails cleared, soil traitors franked roads with shovels or guessed by the most
expert, unexpected falls, funny many risks and some of them fatal, often scares and incessant toil
... The time that lasted the passage of the hollow between the first and the second hill was more
bearable. Al end of this basin, ie the beginning of the second hill is the Pedregalón with
open mouth a short distance from the ground and faced to the path that led the expedition.
