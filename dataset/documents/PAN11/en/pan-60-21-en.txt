 They sensed the coming of the enemy, and seeing without strength
or weapons for them to stand in a meeting and open resistance campaign, determined repaired with industry,
because they could not defend themselves with weapons.

In order to this they did to hide some narrow road next to a jungle where they had to pass the
enemies, and hidden here and waited until they came to this narrow way, against those who were
discovered after the trees, played his poisoned arrows except with poison so active, being wounded
to fall dead was very little happening.

Those who remained alive explored everywhere where it came from that storm, and then some time
fell into the trick, but then failing to avenge that otherwise injury
or death of peers, which saved her breasts revenge for another time,
against his will, had to go back.

Therefore, at the beginning of the following year they embarked on a body of the Paraguay River and
entered into the lagoon Mamoré provided and landed at the port of Itatines. Hence continued
their defeat by East-Midi, and sometimes through very thick forests, other very rugged mountains
rising (how can greed), leading to the settlements of the Taus, and made them fair game, went
to execute his revenge in Penoquíes that lost very confident, because although Rancheria Rancheria
in word spread up the people of San Francisco Xavier of the enemy came, they did not step in preventing
some defense, or at least to retire and take refuge in that reduction, and because they can would
not then when they wanted, they could not escape their lives, because
those wicked walking with industry to get rid of their poisoned arrows,
fell upon them unexpectedly.

Notwithstanding this, the mood had Penoquíes to expose to the defense as best they could and
resist the first encounter, but the enemies, cunning and shrewd, somewhat detained pretending
were preparing to fight, but it was just to make time for the fellow
hiciesen rearguard landowners on the other side and cogiesen the mob
of women and children.

They warned the Indians that when the enemy had made their attempt, they found themselves deceived
with the loss of clothing so loved, for whose defense had taken up arms, were discouraged completely,
which turns the back as best they could, they retreated to the forests without resistance of
the victors, who felt that the love of their blood the slaves would volunteer as in fact happened,
for which reason the victors did not put them in prison but treated them with kindness and
courtesy, and views of the chiefs of colorful costumes and ornaments, promising thousand joys
and happiness in San Pablo and thereby deceive and take them for
guidance to other lands and to arrive at the San Francisco Xavier
reduction, already had moved, transporting it to the other side of
the San Miguel River.

Came the news of this misfortune to the people of that was inexplicable Chiriguaná the grief
that had the P. Arce, seeing that the enemy like a whirlwind out
of the abyss, that razed his Paradise, which had cost both the plant
and the point was desalted to repair and defend the lives of their
neophytes.

To this end, not without great risk of his, wanted to register the
country to observe more closely steps of the enemy, and through the
villages of Boxos, partitions and Taus, was received of them with
pleasure.

Here those who had escaped him news of the designs of the Mamalucos, and taking during the storm
which threatened them, persuaded them came together in a body and sleeves a reduction in advantageous
place to fend off the incursions of those infernal beasts and what
before had been unable to collect petitions, putting them on the grounds
their eternal salvation; got it now the desire to save their lives.

Themselves together, then, all bathed in a river plain Jacopo, which was given shortly before
Reduction principle to San Rafael, well suited to defend themselves because of a very thick jungle,
where they had placed all their hopes, and removed his few Alhajuela there, no dared to shake from
that position until this storm calmed down with the Apostolic Father, who stood there for a few
days in order to penetrate the designs of the enemy, had occasion comfortable to baptize the
children and instruction in the mysteries of our holy faith to the large fear to whom slavery
was a wake Mamalucos to go out and of the devil, but the Father, warned that time would not
baptize them, reserving for a better opportunity to satisfy their desires, and encourage them
to perseverance, turned the Reduction San Francisco Xavier, and from here, with all haste, came
to Santa Cruz Sierra, to report to the Governor of the enemy's movements, and join encourage weapons
to people to take the field to fight with him and put to flight, which was not very to do
to move as innate piety of the Spanish who shines everywhere also that the value by making them
to take their trespasses Chiquitos Indians and defend himself with his own blood that new church,
namely that one could rightly fear that the pride of Mamalucos also dared to invade the city
if they did not saliesen the meeting to cut switchbacks or the steps.

Alistáronse therefore few hours in hundred and thirty soldiers, well armed with weapons and ammunition
and the main thing of value, and because time was not much room, they marched to long hours to the
town of San Francisco Xavier, which collected about three hundred highly skilled Indians playing
the bow and arrow, went looking for the enemy to the lands of believing Penoquís would find
there the quartered, when by means of spies knew they had entered in the town of San Francisco Xavier,
which they had abandoned and left shortly before, wherein like Mamalucos
have not found anything to steal were preparing to go to surprise
the city of Santa Cruz.

With this new joy was inexplicable that showed the value waiting in Spanish able to give their
due to those infamous, which was to be feared or predicted heart Captain ominous enemies, as seen
in San Francisco Xavier many footprints horses, suspected that the Spanish were ready and wanted
to turn back, which would implemented to some Indians had not told
the country that had recently been there the cattle Reduction San
Francisco Xavier.

Straightened, then, the march our army to where the enemies were encamped, and into the night
arrived near where they were and determined to await the morning
of Next, it was the glory of the Spanish martyr San Lorenzo, principal
lawyer and pattern that province, to present the battle.

With that the soldiers had some time to rest, and as he did not believe that the battle had to
be very bloody for both sides to have to fight with people so skilled
in use weapons, they wanted the most fine-God part of your consciousness,
for I heard the confession which six parents who had come from this
end there.

In this he spent much of the night, and having taken a bit of sleep,
at dawn to dawn touched up, sending officers arrayed soldiers, and
the gun point, move the sight of the enemy and if not surrender weapons,
attacked.

But God had taken his account of the punishment of the wickedness of those wicked, now did they
paid the penalty, and particularly the captains, who were here dead together once paying all debts
of the evils they had committed in the destruction of the peoples of the Holy Spirit Villarica
in the government of Paraguay, providing the victory was not at the expense of much blood on
both sides as previously thought but at the expense of ours and a lot of enemies because while
an Indian intimated the order to the enemy, anticipating certain
soldiers to receive the arms of the captains, a servant of these firing
a fusilazo stopped them, killing one of them.

He could not suffer this Andrew Florian valiant Spanish gentleman, and then responded with another
similar shot, that shot down in the ground at Ferraez Antonio de Araujo, and drawing his knife
attacked to Manuel Frias and he stabbed her to death, being the first step the two captains dead
enemies. With this being the Mamalucos without leaders, without government and without the strength,
they were troubled the everything, and threw his arms into the river
that they received, not for free as expected, but to bury them in
their current, already tired, how much effort they made, could not
escape.

Displaying the Spanish and obviously our neophytes that God was on their side, were with great
spirit in scope, and a storm of arrows and musket shot them, made them bloody havoc. Missionaries
also our wish to enter to the party in fact so great, assisting with the crucifix in hand, and
regardless of life went ahead with their spiritual weapons, not only
in support of the victors, but also the defeated, whom they sought
help.

The enemy only six escaped with their lives, including three badly
wounded, were prisoners.

Our casualties were few, and only eight dead, two Indians and six Spanish.

The party was amazing and joy of the Spanish and Indians as our signal victory obtained so little
cost, and it was common sense that God had fought with them against their enemies in defense of their
honor and this new Christianity.

So the soldiers His Majesty gave solemn thanks to the military, with repeated rifle fire and
muskets and the Indians with tournaments and games to their custom, they concluded the joy of
that day.

But it was not complied with the happy, because while trying to exterminate the rest of enemies
who had remained in the land of the Penoquís in the dam guard who rode more than fifteen hundred
souls, and completely clean the country, were born, I do not know from what source, some disagreements
between the ropes, with which it had the best advice and break camp
back to the city of San Lorenzo, where saliéronlos to receive the
governor, mayors and with the city council, were greeted with festive
ringing of the bells of all Many churches and artillery that fired
the castle, and for many days celebrated with great magnificence that
nothing short of miraculous victory.

Mamalucos The three who escaped, walked with the speed as possible following his escape and
took so sad news to his companions, who, knowing his hope against all the ultimate destruction of their
own, were stiff with fear, and as if they saw near him to the victors, they left in a hurry,
taking the more slaves they could, and shipped in the Paraguay River and Rowing vogue sailed
to San Pablo Road, when encountering a company of his own countrymen who went to the same
purpose of capturing pieces (as called here) or Indians, told them the incident referred to, but
those who came from St. Paul, heard the cause so unusual in that they gave back to their land
so lost morale, began to circumvent that such meetings were discouraged by both, with that and
shame, and with hope to remake the lost past, that changed his mind and joined with them, and
all Rancherías together gave about some Indians, which were rejected with bravery and value, for
which, against his will, with little more than empty hands, were
obliged to go to San Pablo.

As they crossed the pond Mamore Guarayos some great time that had militated his salary, his eyes
open and turning it upon themselves to ponder the little good and much bad that they did, and
that finally he could not expect more than a hazardous profession death miserable by the end
of an unhappy life, decided to drop out and find somewhere to live safely and rest, and using
the darkness of night retreated westward to a campaign, two days ahead of the lake, and no
women were found Curacanes friendships with, their neighbors on the side of the North. These,
then, not long after, wanting to get out of paganism and become Christians,
they came to live and make our home in San Juan Bautista Reduction.

Was a rewarding victory, because since then I have not risked more Mamalucos to set foot on
the contours of those reductions, and only planted in 1718 a fort on the banks of the Paragua
River, eighty miles distant from the town of San Rafael, that is expected to soon turned to God
for fifty or sixty thousand souls, as promised we hope, will prevent them from also doing corso
by that river, because neophytes by a singular privilege of our Catholic kings, may use firearms
that can easily break the pride of these pirates, as in the missions of Guarani, who never
ceased to bother until those people gave a great Mamalucos rotates
to five thousand who had gone to the final extermination of that Christianity.

CHAPTER

VI

With past events warms something holy faith: Father dies Antonio Fideli
and talk length of the work of missionaries.

Although the fortunes of this storm did not undo this new Christianity, however, moved slightly and
cut not the best time during prosperous new increases, because August, hopes to increase flowering
with a good number of souls Reduction San Francisco Xavier, and even found some in the Penoquís,
Quicmes Xamar and who were willing to enlist in the number of the
faithful, but rather of the accident came the destruction of Chiriguaná
the two reductions, even as distant and remote from danger.

No one spoke to the learned gentleman air Agustin de Arce, when he
said was lost in vain time and work with these people, and now I played
with the hands of the missionaries, to which those barbarians loved
only for what they pulled from their poverty.

Much as the Padres did not want to go to the Divine Office or hear
the Christian doctrine that upon entering the night was explained,
even wanted to give a boy to assist them in the estates of the house
and serve the church and cultivate a small little garden.

With all that the missionaries persevered suffering great inconvenience and will work easier
to tolerate was hoping to catch some fruit of patience, until angry the barbarians of so many
sermons and speeches that made them throw them in the country were determined pretext that
they were sent by Mamalucos to collect them and deliver them all in their hands as they had (as
they said) made with the Chiquitos, though there were between many
that this lie was seen by witnesses to have been serving the Spanish
referred to the war.

Divulgóse this voice for the people, and was by them or by malice of evil ploy of the devil losing
much in the conversion of the barbarians, the mob began to make many abuses the venerable P.
Knight and P. Lucas Felipe Suarez, rather than with detestable audacity verifications fire
to the church, where by this insult, they were obliged to go out and spend to a farm or cottage
not far, but even this could stop because the barbarians searched
everywhere armed with bows and clubs, and if not shattered hubiéranlos
had been waiting for their bosses because they were not very far away.

Viewing our things were in such a bad face, resolved in the dark of
the night retreat to Santa Cruz de la Sierra and hence pass to Pari,
where he had Reduction moved San Francisco Xavier
