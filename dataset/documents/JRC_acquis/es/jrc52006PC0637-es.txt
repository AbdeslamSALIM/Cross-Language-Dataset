La Comunicación de la Comisión titulada «Una Europa más amplia – Relaciones con los países vecinos: un nuevo marco para las relaciones con nuestros vecinos del Este y del Sur de Europa», de marzo de 2003[1], propuso la elaboración de planes de acción con los países socios. El 16 de junio de 2003, el Consejo acogió favorablemente esta Comunicación e invitó a la Comisión, en su caso en colaboración con el Alto Representante, a presentar propuestas de planes de acción para todos los países en cuestión, comenzando por Ucrania, Moldova y los socios del Sur del Mediterráneo con los que hay acuerdos de asociación en vigor.

Los días 16 y 17 de junio de 2005, el Consejo acogió con satisfacción la decisión de establecer planes de acción con los países antes mencionados. 
La Comisión, en estrecha colaboración con la Presidencia y el Alto Representante para las cuestiones relativas a la cooperación política y a la PESC, mantuvo con Azerbaiyán conversaciones preliminares, que condujeron a un acuerdo sobre un proyecto de Plan de Acción. El Plan abarca un periodo de cinco años Su ejecución contribuirá a cumplir lo dispuesto en el Acuerdo de Colaboración y de Cooperación y a estrechar aún más las relaciones con Azerbaiyán, lo que supone un importe grado de integración económica y una cooperación política más profunda. La ejecución del Plan de Acción representará un avance significativo en la aproximación entre la legislación y las normas de Azerbaiyán y de la Unión Europea. 
El Plan de Acción constituye un amplio instrumento de cooperación económica y política, que permitirá dar un paso más en la realización de los compromisos y objetivos enunciados en el Acuerdo de Colaboración y de Cooperación. 
De conformidad con las conclusiones del Consejo del 14 de junio de 2004, que estipulan que los planes de acción serán aprobados por el Consejo y, ulteriormente, por los Consejos de Asociación o Cooperación respectivos, la Comisión adjunta el texto de una propuesta de Decisión del Consejo relativa a la posición que adoptarán las Comunidades y sus Estados miembros en el Consejo de Cooperación UE-Azerbaiyán en lo que se refiere a la aprobación de una Recomendación sobre la ejecución del Plan de Acción adjunto.

ANNEXE EU-AZERBAIJAN ENP ACTION PLAN 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 has brought a historical shift for the Union in political, geographic and economic terms, further reinforcing the political and economic interdependence between the EU and Azerbaijan. It offers the opportunity for the EU and Azerbaijan to develop an increasingly close mutually beneficial relationship, going beyond co-operation, to involve a significant measure of economic integration and a deepening of political co-operation. The European Union and Azerbaijan are determined to make use of this occasion to enhance their relations and to promote stability, security and welfare. The approach is founded on partnership, joint ownership and differentiation. 
The European Neighbourhood Policy of the European Union sets ambitious objectives based on mutual commitments of the EU and its Member States and Azerbaijan to common values, including the respect of and support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of internationally recognised borders of each other and compliance to international and European norms and principles as well as support for effective implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms. Any breach to these norms and principles by either party to the Action Plan will result in the immediate suspension of its implementation. 
Azerbaijan is invited to enter into intensified political, security, economic and cultural relations with the EU, enhanced regional and cross border co-operation and shared responsibility in conflict prevention and conflict resolution. 
The level of ambition of the relationship will depend on the degree of Azerbaijan’s commitment to common values as well as its capacity to implement jointly agreed priorities. The pace of progress of the relationship will acknowledge fully Azerbaijan’s efforts and concrete achievements in meeting those commitments. 
This Action Plan is a first step in this process. The EU-Azerbaijan Action Plan is a political document laying out the strategic objectives of the cooperation between Azerbaijan and the EU. It covers a timeframe of five years. Its implementation will help fulfil the provisions in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) and will encourage and support Azerbaijan’s objective of further integration into European structures. The EU takes note of Azerbaijan’s expressed European aspirations. 
Implementation of the Action Plan will significantly advance the approximation of Azerbaijani legislation, norms and standards to those of the European Union . In this context, it will build solid foundations for further economic integration based on the adoption and implementation of economic and trade-related rules and regulations with the potential to enhance trade, investment and growth. It will furthermore help to devise and implement policies and measures to promote economic growth and social cohesion, to reduce poverty and to protect the environment, thereby contributing to the long-term objective of sustainable development. Azerbaijan and the EU will cooperate closely in implementing this Action Plan. 
The EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus will assist the relevant bodies in the implementation of this Action Plan in accordance with his mandate. 
2. NEW PARTNERSHIP PERSPECTIVES 
The European Neighbourhood Policy opens new partnership perspectives: 
- The perspective of moving beyond cooperation to a significant degree of integration, including through a stake in the EU’s Internal Market, and the possibility for Azerbaijan to participate progressively in key aspects of EU policies and programmes; 
- An upgrade in the scope and intensity of political cooperation, through further development of mechanisms for political dialogue and consultations on security issues that affect the interests of both sides; 
- Continuing strong EU commitment to support the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, drawing on the instruments at the EU’s disposal, including the EUSR, and in close consultation with the OSCE. The EU is ready to consider ways to strengthen further its engagement in conflict resolution and post-conflict rehabilitation; 
- Deepening trade and economic relations; providing the opportunity for convergence of economic legislation, the opening of economies to each other, and the continued reduction of non-tariff barriers to trade, which will stimulate investment and growth; 
- Increased financial support: EU financial assistance for Azerbaijan will be available to support the actions identified in the present document. The Commission is furthermore proposing a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) for this purpose, which will cover the main part of EU financial assistance and will include aspects of cross-border and trans-national cooperation. The Commission also intends to propose an extension of the EIB mandate to Azerbaijan as of 2007; 
- Possibilities of gradual opening of or reinforced participation in certain Community programmes, promoting cultural, educational, environmental, technical and scientific links; 
- Support including technical assistance and twinning to meet EU norms and standards, and targeted advice and support for legislative approximation through a mechanism such as TAIEX; 
- Establish a dialogue in accordance with the acquis on matters related to the movement of people between the EU and Azerbaijan; 
- Opening as soon as possible of a Commission Delegation in Azerbaijan. 
In light of the fulfilment of the objectives of this Action Plan and of the overall evolution of EU-Azerbaijan relations, consideration will be given in due time to the possibility of a new contractual relationship.

5. MONITORING 
The Action Plan will be submitted for formal adoption to the Co-operation Council between the EU and Azerbaijan. The Action Plan will guide the work between the EU and Azerbaijan. Should the need arise, on the EU side, for specific measures necessitating legally binding decisions, the Commission will recommend to the Council the adoption of the necessary negotiating directives. 
The joint bodies established under the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement will advance and monitor the implementation of the Action Plan. The structures under the relevant agreements, where appropriate, should be reviewed, to ensure that all priorities under the ENP are duly reflected. 
The Commission, in close cooperation with the Secretary-General/High Representative, as appropriate, will produce reports on the Action Plan’s implementation at regular intervals. It will invite Azerbaijan to provide information for these reports. The Commission will also work closely with other organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE, relevant UN bodies, and International Financial Institutions. 
A first review of the implementation of the Action Plan will be undertaken within two years of its adoption. 
The Action Plan can be regularly amended and/or updated based upon agreement of both sides to reflect progress in addressing the priorities.
