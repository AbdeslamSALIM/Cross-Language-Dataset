Commission Regulation (EC) No 992/2005 
of 29 June 2005 
opening and providing for the administration of an import quota for young male bovine animals for fattening ( 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [1], and in particular Article 32(1) thereof, 
Whereas, 
(1) The World Trade Organisation (WTO) schedule CXL requires the Community to open an annual import tariff quota for 169000 head of young male bovine animals for fattening. 
(2) Pending the results of the negotiations under Article XXIV.6 GATT in the context of the WTO following the Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (hereinafter referred to as the new Member States) certain of which were, together with Romania, the principal supplier countries within this quota in the last three quota years, it is appropriate to lay down in the detailed rules for the management of this tariff quota that for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 the available quantity should be phased over the year in a suitable manner within the meaning of Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999. 
(3) To take into account the traditional trade patterns between the Community and the supplier countries within this quota and the need to safeguard the equilibrium of the market, the quantity available is staggered over four quarters for the quota year 2005/2006. Once the ongoing XXIV.6 negotiations have been finalised and ratified, new management rules will be implemented. Those rules should take into account the results of those negotiations and the quantities already used within the quota hereby opened. 
(4) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, each application of import licences should respect a minimum and a maximum number of heads. 
(5) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import of a significant scale from third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 100 animals during the period 1 May 2004 to 30 April 2005 given that a consignment of 100 animals may be considered to be a commercial viable consignment. 
(6) If such criteria should to be checked, applications must be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register. 
(7) In order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2005 should be denied access to the quota and licences should not be transferable. 
(8) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and, where appropriate, once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied. 
(9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 [2] and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [3]. 
(10) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security. 
(11) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should not apply. 
(12) The application of this tariff quota requires effective checks on the specific destination of the imported animals. The animals should therefore be fattened in the Member State which has issued the import licence. 
(13) A security should be lodged to ensure that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units. The amount of the security should cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question. 
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. A tariff quota for 169000 young male bovine animals falling within CN code 01029005, 01029029 or 01029049 and intended for fattening in the Community is hereby opened for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006 subject to any reductions negotiated subsequently between the Community and its WTO partners within the framework of the negotiations under Article XXIV.6 GATT in the context of the WTO.
