98/235/EC: Commission Decision of 11 March 1998 on the advisory committees dealing with matters covered by the common agricultural policy 
COMMISSION DECISION of 11 March 1998 on the advisory committees dealing with matters covered by the common agricultural policy (98/235/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Whereas the Commission should seek the views of the economic sectors and consumers on matters arising in connection with the operation of the various common organisations of the market and other areas covered by the common agricultural policy; 
Whereas all the economic sectors directly involved in the operation of the market organisations and affected by agricultural policy decisions, as well as consumers, should have an opportunity to participate in drafting the opinions requested by the Commission; 
Whereas relevant economic federations and consumer groups in the Member States have set up organisations at European Union level, which are thus in a position to represent those concerned in all the Member States; 
Whereas several agricultural advisory committees have been set up by various Commission decisions (1) since 1962; 
Whereas, following the reform of the common agricultural policy in 1992, it has proved necessary to combine some committees and make provision for new ones; 
Whereas a study on the operation of the advisory committees has shown that there is scope for further improvements; whereas various procedures and definitions, the allocation of seats among the groups represented and the rules for renewing the committees should therefore be adjusted; 
Whereas the provisions relating to the agricultural advisory committees have been amended on several occasions and are contained in 27 different instruments; whereas they have therefore become difficult to apply and should be consolidated in a single Decision, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1

3. The chairman of each committee may propose on his own initiative or at the request of any of the interest groups represented that the Commission consult his committee on any matter within its competence. 
Article 2

In specific cases, representatives of other interests may be appointed. The composition of the committees shall be as set out in the Annexes hereto. 
Article 3 
Committees shall consist of a maximum of 40 members, depending on the size of the sector in question, apart from the Advisory Committees on the Common Agricultural Policy and on Rural Development, which shall have 60 members. The number of seats and their allocation to the various European organisations referred to in Article 4(1) shall be as set out for each committee in the Annexes hereto. 
Article 4 
1. Committee members shall be appointed by the Commission on proposals from the socioeconomic organisations established at Community level and listed in the Commission's register of interest groups. The socioeconomic organisations must be those that are most representative of the interests specified in Article 2 and their activities must be connected with the common agricultural policy, common market organisation or an other field concerned. 
2. At the invitation of the Commission, the socioeconomic organisations shall put forward three candidates of different nationalities for each seat to be filled. Their proposals shall take into account the various interests to be represented in their sector. 
3. Committee members shall be appointed for five years. Their appointments may be renewed. Members shall not be remunerated for their services. 
After expiration of the term, committee members shall remain in office until they are replaced or until their appointments are renewed.

4. A list of committee members shall be published by the Commission in the 'C` series of the Official Journal of the European Communities each time members are replaced.

2. At the request of an advisory committee, the mix of socioeconomic interest groups represented on a standing group may be altered by the Commission. 
3. At the request of an advisory committee, a group of experts may be set up. Such groups shall comprise experts in the field appointed by the Commission after consulting the socioeconomic organisations concerned.

In the event of a tie, the Commission shall provide a chairman on a temporary basis. 
The committee may provide for a change of chairmanship after half the term of office has elapsed. 
2. Each committee shall elect two vice-chairmen. The vice-chairmen shall be chosen from among the representatives of socioeconomic organisations to which the chairman does not belong. They shall be elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 1. 
Each committee may, in accordance with the same procedure, elect an executive comprising, in addition to the chairman, a representative of each socioeconomic organisation represented on the committee. 
The executive of the committee shall prepare and organise its work. One officer (the 'rapporteur`) shall produce a summary record after each committee meeting.

The list shall contain a number of names corresponding to the total of members representing the organisation or organisations in question, but not exceed ten persons. 
Where a replacement is designated, the committee secretariat must be notified at least three working days before the meeting. 
4. At the request of an organisation to which one or more seats on a committee or in a group are allocated, the chairman of the committee or group may, in agreement with the Commission staff, invite its general secretary to attend committee meetings as an observer. 
However, if the general secretary of an organisation is unable to attend, he may assign his observer's seat to another person designated by him. 
5. Observers shall not have the right to speak. They may, however, be invited to do so by the chairman in agreement with the Commission. 
6.

The Commission may, on its own initiative, invite any person suitably well qualified in one of the subjects on the agenda to take part in the deliberations of the committee or standing group as an expert.

If a committee reaches unanimous agreement on the opinion to be given, it shall formulate joint conclusions and attach them to the summary record. The Commission shall communicate the outcome of a committee's discussions to the Council if this is proposed by the committee. 
2. The views expressed by socioeconomic organisations represented on a committee shall be included in a report forwarded to the Commission. 
Article 12
