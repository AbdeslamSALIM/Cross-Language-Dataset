(2) The current text of paragraph 21A.163(c) of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1702/2003, regarding the privilege of an approved production organisation to issue an authorised release certificate (EASA Form 1) for products, gives rise to deviating interpretations and does not reflect its original intent which is to confer such privilege upon approved production organisations of products. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1702/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
