ML21 "Software", as follows: 
a. "Software" specially designed or modified for the "development", "production" or "use" of equipment or materials controlled by the EU Common Military List. 
b. Specific "software", as follows: 
1. "software" specially designed for: 
a. modelling, simulation or evaluation of military weapon systems; 
b. "development", monitoring, maintenance or updating of "software" embedded in military weapon systems; 
c. modelling or simulating military operation scenarios, not controlled by ML14; 
d. command, Communications, Control and Intelligence (C3I) or Command, Communications, Control, Computer and Intelligence (C4I) applications; 
2. "software" for determining the effects of conventional, nuclear, chemical or biological warfare weapons. 
3. "Software", not controlled by ML21.a, b.1 or b.2, specially designed or modified to enable equipment not controlled by the EU Common Military List to perform the military functions of equipment controlled by ML5, ML7.f, ML9.c, ML9.e, ML10.e, ML11, ML14, ML15, ML17.i., or ML18. 
ML22 "Technology" as follows: 
a. "Technology", other than specified in ML22.b, which is "required" for the "development", "production" or "use" of items controlled in the Common Military List of the European Union. 
b. "Technology" as follows: 
1. "technology""required" for the design of, the assembly of components into, and the operation, maintenance and repair of complete production installations for items controlled in the Common Military List of the European Union, even if the components of such production installations are not controlled; 
2. "technology""required" for the "development" and "production" of small arms even if used to produce reproductions of antique small arms; 
3. "technology""required" for the "development", "production" or "use" of toxicological agents, related equipment or components controlled by ML7.a to ML7.f; 
4. "technology""required" for the "development", "production" or "use" of "biopolymers" or cultures of specific cells controlled by ML7.g; 
5. "technology""required" exclusively for the incorporation of "biocatalysts", controlled by ML7.h.1, into military carrier substances or military material. 
Note 1 "Technology""required" for the "development", "production" or "use" of items controlled in the Munitions List remains under control even when applicable to any uncontrolled item. 
Note 2 ML22 does not control "technology" as follows: 
a. which is the minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking) and repair of those items which are not controlled or whose export has been authorised; 
b. which is "in the public domain", "basic scientific research" or the minimum necessary information for patent applications; 
c. for magnetic induction for continuous propulsion of civil transport devices.
