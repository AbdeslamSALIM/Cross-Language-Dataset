Commission Regulation (EC) No 1570/98 of 17 July 1998 amending Annexes I to IV to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (Text with EEA relevance) 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1570/98 of 17 July 1998 amending Annexes I to IV to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1569/98 (2), and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof, 
Whereas, since the adoption of the Regulation, the Annexes have been amended a number of times; whereas, by reason of their number, their complexity and their dispersal among various Official Journals, the texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation; whereas, they should therefore be consolidated; whereas on the same occasion the name or chemical description of some compounds should be rectified or made more precise and certain material errors should be corrected; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annexes I to IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex hereto. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 60th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 17 July 1998.
