Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. Grounds for and objectives of the proposal 
No change to the policy on eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses is envisaged by means of this proposal. By the present proposal, the Commission envisages updating some of the instruments that accompany Community policy on animal health by: 
– amending current procedures governing Community’s contribution to the financing of national programmes for the eradication monitoring and control of animal diseases as foreseen in Article 24 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC [1] of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field, 
– introducing the possibility for the Community to approve and finance multi-annual eradication, control and monitoring programmes for animal diseases and zoonoses, 
– updating the scope of the existing financial measures aimed at improving information policy on animal health and food safety in products of animal origin and the use of integrated computerized veterinary systems (TRACES). 
The attached proposal for amending Decision 90/424/EEC is therefore limited to three specific topics that need to be updated without delay to allow the Commission and the Member States to carry out in an efficient way their respective tasks regarding: 
– the amendments to article 24 of the Decision in order to allow the financing of multi-annual eradication, control and monitoring programmes for animal diseases and zoonoses, and the simplification of the financing procedures and of the procedures for the approval of the programmes, 
– the update of Article 37a of the Decision in order to take into account the fact that the ANIMO system has been technically adjusted and integrated in the new integrated computerized (IT) veterinary system TRACES (system for monitoring the movement of live animals and monitoring of imports into the EU), 
– the amendments to Article 16 of the Decision aimed at extending the scope of the information policy on animal protection to include all aspects of animal health and food safety in products of animal origin. 
1.1. General context for the proposal on multi-annual eradication, control and monitoring programmes for animal diseases and zoonoses 
Article 24 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC establishes that the Member States may receive financial contribution from the Community for their programmes for eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases. Article 29 provides for the financing of monitoring and control programmes for zoonoses under the same procedure laid down in Article 24. In both cases, although the Member States are entitled to submit programmes lasting more than one year, the Commission cannot approve the financing of such programmes for more that one year. 
The Community approval and financial support to the above referred programmes is currently granted following comitology procedure annually to programmes submitted by the Member States by 31 May every year. 
A list of 23 endemic animal diseases and 8 zoonoses or epizootics for which Community financial support may be granted is laid down in the annex to Council Decision 90/424/EEC. 
1.2. General context for the proposal on integrated computerized (IT) veterinary system TRACES 
Currently, Article 37 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC provides for Community financial assistance for computerization of veterinary import procedures. TRACES, which combines trade and import subjects for live animals and products of animal origin, was launched on 1 April 2004 and according to the Commission Decision 2004/292/EC, TRACES is compulsory for all Member states from 1st January 2005. 
1.3. General context for the proposal on information policy on animal health 
The comprehensive and integrated approach proposed in the White Paper on Food Safety [2] is aimed to provide a more coherent and effective framework on food safety policy ensuring a higher level of transparency. 
Information gathering and dissemination is a necessary step to allow better development and implementation of legislation. There is a pressing need to identify and facilitate the use of the relevant legislation throughout the Community in the wide field of animal health and food safety. It would also support the activity of the Commission and the Member States in the international framework by improving the understanding of our legislation and the transparency with our trade partners and especially with the candidate countries. 
At present, Article 16 provides for a financial contribution to the establishment of an information policy in the field of animal protection. The harmonization of requirements concerning animal health and the reinforcement of the information policy on animal health and food safety in product of animal origin would be better achieved by the creation of information tools, including a database to gather, store and disseminate any necessary information. 
2. Consistency with other policies 
The Commission has started a process of evaluation of the whole Community Animal Health Policy, which will include questions on the cost/effectiveness of the current financial instruments to cope with animal disease surveillance, control and eradication and on ways in which producers should be induced to take all appropriate measures. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, alternatives to the current way Community financial support is granted to the Member States might be proposed. 
The concerns that have induced the Commission to make an evaluation of the Community Animal Health Policy have been fully considered in the proposals on multi-annual programmes, TRACES and information policy on animal health and food safety. 
3. Justification and expected achievements 
3.1. Expected achievements of the proposal on on multi-annual programmes 
The present proposal aims at allowing the approval and financing of multi-annual programmes by the Commission. 
Approval and financing procedures are being simplified and in particular by the elimination of one of the two decisions needed under the current procedures. 
The multi-annual approach would provide for better management. These multi-annual programmes to be approved for a maximum duration of 6 years are finally aimed to make the objectives of the eradication programmes clearer and more auditable and to ensure effective use of Community funds, improving transparency. 
A shorter list of diseases will contribute to better prioritization. In order to guarantee better results in the Community’s eradication, control and monitoring policies in a transparent as well as efficient and effective way it is necessary to better define the priorities. The new list, reflecting the Community priorities, has been drawn up on the basis of the impact of the diseases on public health and the impact on international and intra-Community trade. 
To ensure consistency and efficiency, it is deemed appropriate to merge the lists of diseases and of zoonoses and foresee the same procedure for granting Community financial contribution. 
The drawing up of a shorter list of the diseases will lead to a prioritisation of the actions receiving Community financial support in order to guarantee that Community funds are used in a more effective and efficient way. Co-financing might be granted, within the Community budgetary limit, if the Member State priorities meet the Community priorities and where the individual Member State programme is consistent, if appropriate, with programmes being funded in other Member States. 
3.2. Expected achievements of the proposal on integrated computerized (IT) veterinary system (TRACES) 
Article 37a of Council Decision 90/424/EEC provides for Community financial assistance for computerization of veterinary import procedures as established in Decision 92/438/EEC (Shift project). Shift, and the corresponding computerized instrument linking veterinary authorities (Animo) made available by Commission Decision 91/398/EEC have been replaced by the integrated system Traces. 
The proposal aims at updating the wording of Article 37a in order to take into account the developments mentioned above and to explicitly provide for the financing of the hosting and maintenance cost of the integrated system. 
3.3. Expected achievements of the proposal on information policy on animal health and food safety in products of animal origin 
The comprehensive and integrated approach proposed in the White Paper on Food Safety [3] is aimed to provide a more coherent and effective framework on food safety policy ensuring a higher level of transparency. 
In the wide field of animal health and food safety, information gathering is necessary to allow better development and implementation of legislation. Improved information gathering and dissemination would also support the activity of the Commission and of the Member States in international fora by improving the understanding of our legislation and the transparency with our trade partners and especially with the candidate countries. 
At present, Article 16 of the Decision provides for a financial contribution to the establishment of an information policy in the field of animal protection. 
The draft proposal aims at extending the scope of these provisions to all aspects of animal health and food safety in products of animal origin. 
4. Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment 
4.1. Consultation of interested parties 
Multi-annual programming was discussed with the Member States in several working groups and in particular at the meeting of the Chief Veterinary Officers held on 22 September 2004. It was concluded that a multi-annual approach for the programmes of eradication, control and monitoring of animals diseases and zoonoses would ensure a more efficient and effective achievement of the objectives. The multi-annual approach to animal diseases and zoonoses eradication, control and monitoring programmes would also provide for better management. 
On TRACES, European Parliament Resolution A5-0396/2000, adopted in response to Court of Auditors Special Report No 1/2000 [4] on the outbreak of classical swine fever in 1997/98, asked that Animo (a computerised network linking veterinary authorities) be managed and developed under the full control of the Commission and that amendments be made in accordance with the Court’s observations. Furthermore, point 123 of Parliament report A5-0405/2002 on measures to control foot and mouth disease in the European Union in 2001 and future measures to prevent and control animal diseases in the European Union states that the Commission should without delay take measures to improve the existing system for monitoring the movement of live animals within the EU (Animo system). In addition, the system for the monitoring of imports into the EU (Shift system) should be introduced quickly. 
4.2. Collection and use of expertise 
For the multi-annual eradication, control and monitoring programmes: a reflection on the way to improve the management of these programmes has been carried out in recent years, without prejudice to the evaluation of the Community Animal Health Policy mentioned above. During this work the experience gained through the establishment of a Task Force for monitoring disease eradication in the Member States established in accordance with action 29 of the White Paper on Food Safety has also been taken into account. 
4.3. Impact assessment 
The proposal will not result in substantial economic, environmental and/or social impacts on a specific sector or several sectors, and will not have a significant impact on major interested parties. The proposal does not represent a policy reform but an update of existing provisions in this area aimed at better use of available resources. 
The minor technical changes in the proposal will only affect the Competent Authorities and other administrations that will beneficiate from the general simplification of the existing procedures. 
5. Legal elements of the proposal 
5.1 Legal basis 
Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof. 
5.2. Subsidiarity and proportionality principles 
The animal health measures laid down in this proposal fall under the competence of the Community. Furthermore, the harmonization of essential requirements concerning the protection of public health and animal health are in line with the subsidiarity principle. 
The modifications proposed are limited to what is indispensable to implement the necessary update of the existing provisions. The reporting requirements imposed on Member States by the new proposed wording of Article 24 do not imply any additional workload for the Member States. Such reporting requirements are in any event necessary in order to enable the Commission to monitor the correct implementation of the programmes benefiting from Community financing and ascertain that the provisions adopted by Member States for the implementation of those measures will contribute towards achievement of the objectives of these programmes. 
5.3. Choice of instruments 
The proposed instrument is a Decision. This proposal concerns amendments to existing provisions on expenditure in the veterinary field that are laid down in a Council Decision. The legal instrument chosen to amend those provisions is therefore another Council Decision. 
6. Budget implications 
6.1. Budget implications of the proposal on multi-annual eradication, control and monitoring programmes for animal diseases and zoonoses 
The envisaged changes would not entail additional costs for the Member States and the Community budget. 
6.2. Budget implications of the proposal on TRACES 
A Community financial measure of 300.000 € for the logistical support of the system TRACES intended to help users of the system has been already introduced by Commission Decision 2004/675/EEC [5] for an initial period of 15 months. 
The approximate additional costs for the Community budget per year as from 2006 could be anticipated as follows: 
– Hosting: 500.000 € 
– Development: 100.000 € 
6.3. Budget implications of the proposal on information policy on animal health and food safety in products of animal origin 
The costs for the Community budget should be included under “other veterinary measures” and would entail 200.000 € additional costs per year for the Community budget. 
7. Additional information 
7.1. Repeal of existing legislation 
The adoption of the proposal will lead to the repeal of Council Decision 90/638/EEC laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases [6]. The technical annexes to this Decision provide for the criteria that the programmes submitted by the Member States to the Commission must meet in order to be approved under the measures provided for in Article 24 of Decision 90/424/EEC. 
These criteria are purely technical requirements to ensure that the measures in the programmes are effective. It is therefore appropriate to lay down following comitology procedure these technical criteria, as well as detailed implementing rules on the format of the programmes and reports in a single Commission Decision. 
The intention of the Commission would be to adopt following comitology procedure by the same date of the entry into force of the Council Decision in the current proposal a Commission Decision laying down the criteria and the standard requirements for the content of the programmes as well as the standard reporting requirements. 
It would provide for simplification of the existing legislation and a reduction of the legislative burden for both the Member States and the Commission. 
7.2. European Economic Area 
The proposed act does not concern an EEA matter as financial instruments covered by Decision 90/424/EEC are not included in the EEA. 
2006/0098 (CNS) 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [7], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [8] 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [9] 
Whereas: 
(1) The Community co-finances activities of the Member States on animal disease and zoonoses eradication, control and monitoring on the basis of annual programmes approved in accordance with the requirements and procedure laid down in Article 24 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field [10]. 
(2) A review of the procedures for Community co-financing of animal disease and zoonoses eradication, control and monitoring programmes, taking into account in particular the experience gained from the work carried out by the Task Force for monitoring disease eradication in the Member States established in accordance with action 29 of the White Paper on Food Safety [11], has shown that a multi-annual approach for these programmes and a new list of diseases and zoonoses would lead to better results. A multi-annual approach for the programmes of eradication, control and monitoring of animal diseases and zoonoses would ensure a more efficient and effective achievement of the objectives of those programmes and would provide for better and more transparent management and increased auditability, thus making more effective the use of Community funds. Therefore, it is appropriate to amend the provisions governing those programmes so as to include the possibility to finance multi-annual programmes. 
(3) That review also showed that a list with a limited number of animal diseases and zoonoses eligible for co-financing would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the eradication, control and monitoring programmes. The list of diseases and zoonoses which reflects Community priorities and whose eradication benefits from the Community financial contribution should be established taking into account the potential impact of such diseases and zoonoses on public health and on international and intra-Community trade of animals or product from animal origin. The specific provisions for the control of zoonoses should therefore be deleted. 
(4) In order to simplify the procedure for the approval of the eradication, control and monitoring programmes submitted by the Member States to the Commission, provision should be made for a single decision approving the programmes qualifying for a Community financial contribution to replace the two decisions currently required, one listing the programmes qualifying for financial contribution and the second on the approval of the programmes. 
(5) In order to allow the Commission to monitor the implementation of the programmes, Member States should report regularly to the Commission on the activities carried out, on the results achieved and the expenditure incurred. 
(6) Council Decision 90/638/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases [12] lays down the technical and information requirements for the eradication, control and monitoring programmes for which Community financing is sought. Those technical requirements and information should be updated and adjusted in a regular and timely fashion in order to match technical and scientific progress and feedback from experience in the implementation of the programmes. It is therefore appropriate to enable the Commission to adopt, and update as necessary, those technical criteria. Council Decision 90/638/EEC should be repealed accordingly. 
(7) Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30 March 2004 on the introduction of the Traces system and amending Decision 92/486/EEC [13] establishes the integration of the pre-existing computerised systems (Animo and Shift) into the new system. It is therefore appropriate to take into account the technical developments achieved in the computerization of the veterinary procedures and to provide for the resources needed for the hosting, management and the maintenance of the integrated computerised veterinary systems. 
(8) Information gathering activities are necessary to allow better development and implementation of legislation in the fields of animal health and food safety. Moreover, there is a pressing need to disseminate as widely as possible information regarding animal health and food safety legislation throughout the Community. It is therefore desirable to extend the scope of Decision 90/424/EEC so as to include the financing of information policy in the field of animal protection to animal health and food safety in products of animal origin. 
(9) Decision 90/424/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term for the different proposed changes to the current legislation 
5.1.1 Multi-annual eradication programmes 
The change from annual into multi-annual programmes would insure a more efficient and effective achievement of the objectives of these programmes. 
5.1.2 Modification of the list of diseases and zoonoses that can benefit from a contribution for their eradication 
The reduction of the list of animal diseases and zoonoses eligible for co-financing would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the eradication, control and monitoring programmes. 
5.1.3 integrated computerized veterinary system 
A financial contribution to the introduction, development, management, hosting and maintenance of an integrated computerized veterinary system for trade and import of live animals and products of animal origin will guarantee the proper management thereof. 
5.1.4 gathering and distribution of information 
Harmonization of requirements concerning animal health, animal welfare and food safety will be better achieved by the creation of a database. 
5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
5.2.1 Multi-annual eradication programmes 
The change from annual into multi-annual programmes provides for a better management in order to make the objectives of the eradication programmes clearer and more auditable and to ensure a more effective use of the credits. 
5.2.2 Modification of the list of diseases and zoonoses that can benefit from a contribution for their eradication 
A shorter list of diseases will contribute to better prioritization and a more efficient use of the available credits. 
5.2.3 integrated computerized veterinary system
