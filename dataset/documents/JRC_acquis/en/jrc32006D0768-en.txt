Having regard to the Internal Agreement of 12 September 2000 between representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on the financing and administration of Community aid under the Financial Protocol to the Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the European Community and its Member States signed in Cotonou (Benin) on 23 June 2000 and the allocation of financial assistance for the overseas countries and territories to which part four of the EC Treaty applies [2], and in particular Article 8(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission drafted in agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB), 
Whereas:
