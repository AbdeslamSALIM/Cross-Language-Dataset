of 3 June 2003 
concerning the examination of variations to the terms of a marketing authorisation for medicinal products for human use and veterinary medicinal products granted by a competent authority of a Member State 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use(1), and in particular Article 35(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products(2), and in particular Article 39(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In the light of practical experience in the application of Commission Regulation (EC) No 541/95 of 10 March 1995 concerning the examination of variations to the terms of a marketing authorisation granted by a competent authority of a Member State(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1146/98(4), it is appropriate to simplify the procedure for varying the terms of a marketing authorisation. 
(2) Some of the procedures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 541/95 should therefore be adjusted but without departing from the general principles on which those procedures are based. 
(3) In consequence of the adoption of Directives 2001/82/EC and 2001/83/EC, which codified Community legislation in the field of veterinary medicinal products and medicinal products for human use respectively, references to provisions of that legislation should be updated. 
(4) This Regulation should continue to apply also to the examination of applications for variation of the terms of a marketing authorisation granted under Council Directive 87/22/EEC(5) repealed by Directive 93/41/EEC(6). 
(5) It is appropriate to provide for a simplified and rapid notification procedure to enable the introduction of certain minor changes, which do not affect the approved quality, safety or efficacy of the product, without prior evaluation by the reference Member State. However, for other types of minor variation evaluation of the submitted documentation by the reference Member State should still be required. 
(6) In cases where the evaluation procedure is maintained the reference Member State should evaluate the file on behalf of all Member States concerned in order to avoid duplication of work. 
(7) The various types of minor variation should be classified according to the conditions to be fulfilled in order to determine the procedure to follow; it is particularly necessary to give a precise definition of the type of minor variation for which no prior evaluation is needed. 
(8) It is necessary to clarify the definition of an %quot%extension%quot% to a marketing authorisation, although it should still be possible to submit a separate, full application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product which has already been authorised, but under a different name and with a different summary of product characteristics. 
(9) It is appropriate to allow national authorities of the reference Member States to reduce the evaluation period in urgent cases or to extend it in the case of a major variation entailing important changes. 
(10) The time-frame for the procedure to be followed where the competent authority imposes urgent safety restrictions should be clarified. 
(11) Further clarification should be introduced as regards revision of the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet/insert; nevertheless the procedures laid down in this Regulation should not apply to changes to the labelling or to the package leaflet/insert which are not consequential to changes to the summary of product characteristics. 
(12) For the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to replace Regulation (EC) No 541/95. 
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use and the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

ANNEX I 
LIST AND CONDITIONS FOR MINOR VARIATIONS (TYPE IA AND IB) TO A MARKETING AUTHORISATION AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLES 3 TO 5 
Introductory statements 
The titles of the variations are numbered and subcategories depicted by letters and numbers in smaller font. The conditions necessary for a given variation to follow either a type IA or a type IB procedure are outlined for each subcategory and listed below each variation. 
To cover any other changes, it is necessary to submit applications for any consequential or parallel variations, which may be linked to the change applied for, at the same time and to clearly describe the relation between these variations. 
For notifications including a certificate of suitability from the European pharmacopoeia and when the variation concerns the dossier submitted for the certificate, the documentation required for this change is to be submitted to the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM). If the certificate is revised following evaluation of this change, any marketing authorisation concerned must be updated. In many cases this can be done through a type IA notification. 
A biological medicinal product is a product, the active substance of which is a biological substance. A biological substance is a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and for which a combination of physico-chemical-biological testing and the production process and its control is needed for its characterisation and the determination of its quality. 
As a result, the following shall be considered as biological medicinal products: immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood and human plasma as defined in Articles 1(4) and 1(10) of Directive 2001/83/EC, respectively; immunological veterinary medicinal products as defined in Article 1(7) of Directive 2001/82/EC; medicinal products falling within the scope of part A of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93(1); advanced therapy medicinal products as defined in part IV of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC. 
A change in the manufacturing process of a non-proteinaceous component due to a subsequent introduction of a biotechnology step can be made in accordance with the provisions of variations type I No 15 or No 21 as appropriate. This specific variation is without prejudice to other variations listed in this Annex which can be applied in this particular context. Introduction of a proteinaceous component obtained through a biotechnology process listed in part A of the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 in a medicinal product fall within the scope of said Regulation. Community legislation applicable to specific groups of products(2) shall be complied with. 
There is no need to notify the competent authorities of an updated monograph of the European pharmacopoeia or a national pharmacopoeia of a Member State in the case that compliance with updated monograph is implemented within 6 months of its publication and reference is made to the %quot%current edition%quot% in the dossier of an authorised medicinal product. 
For the purposes of this document, test procedure has the same meaning as analytical procedure and limits have the same meaning as acceptance criteria. 
The Commission, in consultation with member states, the Agency and interested parties, will draw up and publish detailed guidance on the documentation to be submitted.

ANNEX II 
CHANGES TO A MARKETING AUTHORISATION LEADING TO AN EXTENSION APPLICATION AS REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2 
These changes, listed below, will be regarded as an %quot%extension%quot% application as referred to in Article 2. 
An extension to or a modification of the existing marketing authorisation will have to be granted by the competent authorities. 
The name of the medicinal product will be the same for the 'extension' as it is for the existing marketing authorisation of the medicinal product. 
The Commission, in consultation with Member States, the Agency and interested parties, will draw up and publish detailed guidance on the documentation to be submitted. 
Changes requiring an extension application 
1. Changes to the active substance(s): 
(i) replacement of the active substance(s) by a different salt/ester complex/derivative (with the same therapeutic moiety) where the efficacy/safety characteristics are not significantly different; 
(ii) replacement by a different isomer, a different mixture of isomers, of a mixture by an isolated isomer (e.g. racemate by a single enantiomer) where the efficacy/safety characteristics are not significantly different; 
(iii) replacement of a biological substance or product of biotechnology with one of a slightly different molecular structure. Modification of the vector used to produce the antigen/source material, including a new master cell bank from a different source where the efficacy/safety characteristics are not significantly different; 
(iv) a new ligand or coupling mechanism for a radiopharmaceutical; 
(v) change to the extraction solvent or the ratio of herbal drug to herbal drug preparation where the efficacy/safety characteristics are not significantly different. 
2. Changes to strength, pharmaceutical form and route of administration: 
(i) change of bioavailability; 
(ii) change of pharmacokinetics e.g. change in rate of release; 
(iii) change or addition of a new strength/potency; 
(iv) change or addition of a new pharmaceutical form; 
(v) change or addition of a new route of administration(1). 
3. Other changes specific to veterinary medicinal products to be administered to food-producing animals: 
change or addition of target species. 
(1) For parenteral administration, it is necessary to distinguish between intra-arterial, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and other routes. For administration to poultry, respiratory, oral and ocular (nebulisation) routes used for vaccination are considered to be equivalent routes of administration.
