ANNEX 
1. INTRODUCTION 
At its meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, the European Council decided that the Accession Partnership would be the key feature of the enhanced preaccession strategy, mobilising all forms of assistance to the candidate countries within a single framework. In this manner, the Community targets its assistance towards the specific needs of each candidate so as to provide support for overcoming particular problems with a view to accession. 
The first Accession Partnership for Romania was decided in March 1998. As provided for in Regulation (EC) No 622/98 (Article 2), the Accession Partnership was updated a first time in December 1999, and a second time in January 2002(1), taking into account further developments in Romania. In the Commission's communication on the roadmap for Romania, it was stated that the Commission would propose a revised Accession Partnership for Romania in the light of the findings of the 2002 regular report and roadmap. The communication also stated that short- and medium-term issues identified in the roadmaps would be further developed in the revised Accession Partnership to be presented next year, and that the Accession Partnership would continue to be the basis for programming preaccession assistance, but that priorities for assistance would also be drawn from the regular report, roadmap and revised national development plans to be prepared by Romania in line with Structural Funds requirements. It was stated that the Accession Partnership would complement the roadmap and, taken together, would be the main tools guiding Romania's work on preparation for accession to the EU. 
2. OBJECTIVES 
The purpose of the Accession Partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's 2002 regular report on the progress made by Romania towards membership of the Union and the roadmap, the financial means available to help Romania implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. The Accession Partnership provides the basis for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate States in their preparations for membership. These include, inter alia, the preaccession fiscal surveillance procedure, the preaccession economic programme, the preaccession pact on organised crime as well as the national development plans, the rural developments plans, a national employment strategy in line with the European employment strategy, and sectoral plans necessary for the participation in the Structural Funds after membership and for the implementation of ISPA (Instrument for structural policies for preaccession) and Sapard (Special accession programme for agriculture and rural development) before accession. Each of these instruments is different in nature and is prepared and implemented according to specific procedures and may be supported by preaccession aid. They are not an integral part of this Partnership but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it. 
3. PRINCIPLES 
The main priority areas identified for each candidate State relate to their ability to take on the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires: 
- that the candidate State has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities; 
- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union; 
- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. 
At its meeting in Madrid in 1995, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate States to adjust their administrative structures to ensure harmonious operation of Community policies after accession. At Luxembourg, in 1997, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient since it is also necessary to ensure that it is actually applied. The Feira and Gothenburg European Councils, in 2000 and 2001 respectively, confirmed the vital importance of the applicant countries' capacity to implement and enforce the acquis, and added that this required important efforts by the applicants in strengthening and reforming their administrative and judicial structures. The Copenhagen European Council in 2002 again underlined the importance of judicial and administrative reform, which would help bring forward Romania's overall preparation for membership. 
4. PRIORITIES 
The Commission's regular reports have highlighted, besides the progress already made, the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by candidate countries to prepare for accession. The 2002 regular reports concluded that Romania continues to fulfil the political criteria and although it has continued to make progress towards being a functioning market economy, it does not yet meet the Copenhagen economic criteria. In order to complete its preparations successfully, Romania needs to continue its efforts to transpose, implement and enforce the acquis. It also needs to continue the reform of public administration and the judiciary in order to have the necessary administrative and judicial capacity for this. 
The roadmap for Romania, which covers the period up to accession, indicates the main steps that it needs to take to be ready for membership. It is based on the commitments made in the negotiations and on what needs to be done to fulfil the Copenhagen and Madrid criteria for membership. The roadmap aims to support Romania's efforts to meet the remaining criteria for membership by identifying the tasks ahead and providing increased financial assistance. There is particular emphasis on administrative and judicial capacity necessary to implement the acquis and on economic reform. For the acquis chapters, the roadmaps provide benchmarks against which Romania's progress can be monitored. These cover both alignment of legislation and development of administrative capacity. 
This revised Accession Partnership complements the roadmap and, taken together, these are the main tools guiding Romania's work on preparation for accession to the EU. The Accession Partnership further develops the short and medium term issues identified in the roadmap, identifying priorities that it is realistic to expect that Romania can complete or take forward substantially over the period 2003-2004. The priorities in the Accession Partnership have been set in cooperation with the countries concerned. The achievement of these will condition the degree of assistance granted. 
It is also important that Romania fulfils the commitments of legislative approximation and the implementation of the acquis in accordance with the commitments made under the Europe Agreement, and in the context of the negotiation process. It should be recalled that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis. 
Drawing on the basis of the analysis of the Commission's 2002 regular report and the roadmap, the following priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for Romania. These priorities are presented in accordance with the structure of the regular report(2). 
Political Criteria 
Democracy and the rule of law 
Revise the 1999 framework law on civil servants, introduce necessary secondary legislation and establish implementation mechanisms and structures. 
- Adopt a comprehensive strategy for the reform of the civil service that clarifies the institutional responsibilities for administrative reform and that covers: (i) comprehensive pay reform to be agreed in full consultation with the international financial institutions, (ii) improved provisions for both initial and in-service training, (iii) the institution of a career structure based on transparent promotion and assessment, (iv) introduction of elements of modern human resource management and (v) strengthening of administrative structures in order to ensure that Romania has the capacity for fully effective use of Community funds. The strategy should both set out a programme of sequenced reforms and also provide a framework for multi-annual donor assistance. 
- Adopt a comprehensive strategy for the reform of the policy formulation process that will cover: (i) policy coordination and consultation procedures between ministries, (ii) consultation of stakeholders, (iii) screening all draft legislation for its budgetary implications and (iv) screening all draft legislation for compatibility with the Europe Agreement and the acquis communautaire. The strategy should both set out a programme of sequenced reforms and also provide a framework for multi-annual donor assistance. In order to implement the strategy a dedicated reform unit should be set up. 
- Reduce the reliance on ordinances, and emergency ordinances, as legislative instruments and clarify the circumstances under which these provisions can be used. 
- Adopt a comprehensive strategy for the management of the on-going process of decentralisation/deconcentration. The strategy should set out a programme of sequenced reforms and also provide a framework for multi-annual donor assistance. Particular attention should be paid to the issue of providing adequate resources to the local levels of government in a fully transparent and predictable manner in order to allow resources to match increased responsibilities. 
- Step up the fight against corruption by: (i) continued implementation of the anti-corruption strategy and programme, (ii) strengthening the autonomy of the National Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office, (iii) introducing the notion of criminal or administrative penal sanctions against legal persons in Romania, (iv) developing codes of ethics for key professions including law enforcement bodies and the judiciary and (v) ensuring effective prosecution. 
- Improve the enforcement of civil decisions and ensure that adequate resources are made available for processing these decisions. 
- Continue efforts to develop an effective probation system. 
- Develop and implement a strategy for the reform of the judiciary that will: 
(i) ensure full independence of the judiciary in particular by establishing a transparent system for recruiting and selecting magistrates, abolishing the provision allowing senior officials to be appointed judges without having to pass an exam and introducing transparent legal procedures for removing judges from office and for sanctioning them for misconduct; 
(ii) enhance the professionalism of the judiciary in particular by improving training programmes in the National Institute for the Magistracy (NIM), strengthening the ability of the Training Centre for Clerks to deliver both initial and in-service training and developing training for other legal professionals such as lawyers, notaries, bailiffs, court clerks and staff of the Ministry of Justice; 
(iii) improve the administration of courts in particular by modernising case management and filing systems, developing clear criteria for case assignment, systematic introduction of alternative dispute resolution, extending access to free legal aid and upgrading court equipment and infrastructure. 
- Continue the process of police reform and modernisation in particular by completing internal reorganisation, continuing efforts for police officers to fully respect basic human rights, broadening the use of community policing approaches and ensuring that an efficient system for examining complaints of police misconduct is established and functions properly. Access by Roma to this system should be ensured. 
- Revise those sections of the Penal Code dealing with verbal outrage, slander and offence against authorities in order to ensure that they comply with the provisions of, and the case law related to, the European Convention on Human Rights. 
- Strengthen the legal certainty within the Romanian legal order by circumscribing the right of the General Prosecutor to lodge extraordinary appeals (and in particular the appeal for cancellation) so as to ensure that this right can only be exerted in limited cases and according to objective legal criteria. 
Human rights and the protection of minorities 
- Continue alignment of the acquis on anti-discrimination and ensure its proper implementation by making the Romanian National Council for Combating Discrimination fully operational(3). 
- Continue the reform of the public child care system in accordance with the national strategy on the protection of children in difficulty, by focusing on closure of old-style institutions, de-institutionalisation and prevention of institutionalisation through provision of alternative social services for families and children. Ensure the full implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
- Develop adequate national standards for all child protection services, including the re-evaluation of sanitary standards, and improve the capacity of the National Authority to perform inspections at the local level. 
- Work towards closure of the existing special schools through the development of an inclusive education system. 
- Implement the national strategy on maternity hospitals, with a view to reducing the rate of abandonment of children in such hospitals. 
- Maintain the moratorium on international adoption in place until new legislation compatible with the best interests of the child and Romania's international obligations is in place and the administrative capacity to implement the new legislation is ensured.

5. PROGRAMMING 
For the period 2000 to 2006, in addition to Phare, financial assistance to Romania comprises support for preaccession measures for agriculture and rural development through the preaccession instrument Sapard (Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/99, OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 87) and support for infrastructure projects in the fields of environment and transport through the structural instrument ISPA (Council Regulation (EC) No 1267/99, OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 73), which gives priority to measures similar to the cohesion fund in the preaccession period. Under these national allocations, Romania can also fund part of its participation in community programmes including the Research and Technological Development Framework Programmes and programmes in the areas of education and enterprise. In addition Romania will have access to funding from multi-country and horizontal programmes directly related to the acquis. Joint financing by the candidate countries is systematically required for all investment projects. Since 1998 the Commission has worked with the European Investment Bank and the international financial institutions, in particular the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank, with a view to facilitating the co-financing of projects relating to preaccession priorities. 
6. CONDITIONALITY 
Community assistance for financing projects through the three preaccession instruments Phare, ISPA and Sapard is conditional on respect by Romania of its commitments under the Europe Agreement, further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and in particular progress in meeting the specific priorities of this revised Accession Partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98. 
7. MONITORING 
The implementation of the Accession Partnership and the roadmap is monitored in the framework of the Europe Agreement. As underlined by the European Council in Luxembourg, it is important that the institutions of the Europe Agreement continue to be the framework within which the adoption and implementation of the acquis can be examined. The Europe Agreement subcommittees provide the possibility to review implementation of the Accession Partnership priorities as well as progress as regards legal approximation, implementation and enforcement. The Association Committee discusses overall developments, progress and problems in meeting the Accession Partnership's priorities as well as more specific issues referred to it from the subcommittees. 
The Phare Management Committee ensures that actions financed under all three preaccession instruments, Phare, ISPA, and Sapard, are compatible with each other as well as with the Accession Partnerships as laid down in the Coordinating Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/99 (OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 68)). 
The Accession Partnership will continue to be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98.
