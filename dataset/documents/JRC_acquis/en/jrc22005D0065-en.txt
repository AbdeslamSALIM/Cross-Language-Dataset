The provisions of the Directive shall, for the purposes of the present Agreement, be read with the following adaptation: 
1. with a view to achieving a maximum degree of convergence in the application of a third-country regime for investment firms, the Contracting Parties shall exchange information as described in Articles 15(1) and 15(4) and consultations shall be held regarding matters referred to in Article 15(2) and 15(3), within the framework of the EEA Joint Committee and according to specific procedures to be agreed by the Contracting Parties; 
2. authorisations granted by the competent authorities of a Contracting Party to investment firms being direct or indirect subsidiaries of parent undertakings governed by the laws of a third country shall have validity in accordance with the provisions of this Directive throughout the territory of all Contracting Parties. However, 
(a) when a third country imposes quantitative restrictions on the establishment of investment firms of an EFTA State or imposes restrictions on such investment firms that it does not impose on Community investment firms, authorisations granted by competent authorities within the Community to investment firms being direct or indirect subsidiaries of parent undertakings governed by the laws of that third country shall have validity only in the Community, except where an EFTA State decides otherwise for its own jurisdiction; 
(b) where the Community has decided that decisions regarding authorisations of investment firms being direct or indirect subsidiaries of parent undertakings governed by the law of a third country shall be limited or suspended, any authorisation granted by a competent authority of an EFTA State to such investment firms shall have validity only in its own jurisdiction, except where another Contracting Party decides otherwise for its own jurisdiction; 
(c) the limitations or suspensions referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b) may not apply to investment firms or their subsidiaries already authorised in the territory of a Contracting Party; 
3. whenever the Community negotiates with a third country on the basis of Articles 15(2) and 15(3), in order to obtain national treatment and effective market access for its investment firms, it shall endeavour to obtain equal treatment for the investment firms of the EFTA States."; 
3. point 30b (Council Directive 93/22/EEC) shall be deleted with effect from 30 April 2006.
