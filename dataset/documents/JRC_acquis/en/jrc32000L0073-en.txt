adapting to technical progress Council Directive 93/92/EEC on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(1), as last amended by Directive 2000/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 16 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 93/92/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(3), and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 93/92/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the Community type-approval procedure introduced by Directive 92/61/EEC. The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to that Directive. 
(2) Developments in technology now permit an adaptation of Directive 93/92/EEC to technical progress. In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is therefore necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of the Directive concerned. 
(3) To this end, it should be specified that lighting devices type-approved for vehicles in categories M1 and N1, in accordance with the relevant directives, may also be installed on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles. Provision should also be made to permit the optional installation of front fog lamps, rear fog lamps, reversing lamps and hazard warning devices on three-wheel mopeds and light quadricycles. Directive 93/92/EEC should be supplemented with the appropriate instructions for installing these devices. The wording of certain points in the English and Dutch versions should be aligned on the corresponding points in the other language versions. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4), as last amended by Directive 2000/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

- refuse to grant EC type-approval for a type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle, or

if the installation of the lighting and light-signalling devices complies with the requirements of Directive 93/92/EEC, as amended by this Directive. 
2. With effect from 1 July 2002, Member States shall refuse to grant EC type-approval for any new type of two- or three-wheel motor vehicle on grounds relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices if the requirements of Directive 93/92/EEC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled. 
Article 3 
1. Member States shall adopt and publish, no later than 31 December 2001, the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
