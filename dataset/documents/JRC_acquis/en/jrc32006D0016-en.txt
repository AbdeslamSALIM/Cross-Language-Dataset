Commission Decision 
of 5 January 2006 
amending Annex B to Council Directive 88/407/EEC and Annex II to Decision 2004/639/EC as regards import conditions for semen of domestic animals of the bovine species 
(notified under document number C(2005) 5840) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/16/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species [1], and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 10(2), Article 11(2) and the second paragraph of Article 17 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 2003/43/EC [2] amended Directive 88/407/EEC, which made it necessary to recast Commission Decisions relating to the animal health conditions for imports into the Community of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species. 
(2) The Commission therefore adopted Decision 2004/639/EC of 6 September 2004 laying down the importation conditions of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species [3], which brought together the rules on imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species within a single act. 
(3) However, problems have arisen with imports of bovine semen from third countries owing to missing or incorrect information in Annex B to Directive 88/407/EEC and in Annex II to Decision 2004/639/EC, which should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) In order to enable economic operators to adapt to the new conditions set out in this Decision, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period in which under certain conditions semen of domestic animals of the bovine species complying with the conditions set out in the model veterinary certificate applicable before the date of application of this Decision may be imported into the Community. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Annex B to Directive 88/407/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision. 
Article 2 
Annex II to Decision 2004/639/EC is replaced by Annex II to this Decision.

(a) complies with the conditions set out in the model veterinary certificate in Annex II to Decision 2004/639/EC that was applicable before the date of application of the present Decision; and 
(b) is accompanied by such a certificate duly completed.
