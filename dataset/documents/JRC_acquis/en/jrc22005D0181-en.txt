Decision No 2/2005 of the ACP-EC Customs Cooperation Committee 
of 1 March 2005 
derogating from the concept of "originating products" to take account of the special situation of the ACP States regarding the production of preserved tuna and of tuna loins (HS heading ex 16.04) 
(2005/181/EC) 
THE ACP-EC CUSTOMS COOPERATION COMMITTEE, 
Having regard to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement signed at Cotonou on 23 June 2000, and in particular Article 38 of Protocol 1 to Annex V thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 38(1) of the said Protocol provides for derogations from the rules of origin to be granted whenever the development of an existing industry or the establishment of a new one warrants it. 
(2) Article 38(8) of the said Protocol provides that the derogations are granted automatically within an annual quota of 8000 tonnes for canned tuna and of 2000 tonnes for tuna loins. 
(3) On 28 October 2002 Decision No 2/2002 of the ACP-EC Customs Cooperation Committee derogating from the concept of "originating products" to take account of the special situation of the ACP States regarding the production of canned tuna and of tuna loins (HS heading ex 16.04) [1] was adopted. The derogation provided for in Article 1 of this Decision shall apply during the period of 1 October 2002 to 28 February 2005. 
(4) In view of the expiry of this provision the ACP States submitted on 8 November 2004 a request for a new global derogation from the rules of origin as contained in the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, for canned tuna and tuna loins, valid for all ACP States, and covering the full annual quantities, i.e. 8000 tonnes of canned tuna and 2000 tonnes of tuna loins, imported into the Community from 1 March 2005 onwards. 
(5) The derogation is requested under the relevant provisions of Protocol 1, particularly with regard to Article 38(8) and the requested quantities fall within the limits of the annual quota which is granted automatically upon request of the ACP States. 
(6) This Decision shall apply from 1 March 2005 until the end of 2007 pending the adoption of the new trading arrangements which shall enter into force by 1 January 2008 according to Article 37 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. 
(7) Decision No 2/2002 refers to "canned tuna", but actually applies to "preserved tuna". The term "preserved tuna" comprises canned tuna and tuna vacuum-packed in plastic bags or other containers. The Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities uses the term "preserved tuna" which encompasses "canned tuna". The same terminology should be used in this Decision. 
(8) The quantities for which a derogation is adopted should be managed by the Commission in collaboration with the customs authorities of the Member States and those of the ACP States. To that end, detailed rules should be adopted, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
