Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the accession of the Community to United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Regulation No. 107 on provisions concerning the approval of category M2 or M3 vehicles with regard to their general construction 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. General 
By Council Decision 97/836/EC of 27 November 1997, the EC became a contracting party to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's (UN/ECE's) Revised 1958 Agreement on 24 March 1998 and acceded to 78 regulations appended to that Agreement. That Decision took effect on 24 March 1998. 
Article 3(3) of that Decision foresees that the Community may decide to implement a regulation to which it had not acceded when it acceded to the revised Agreement if the Council approves that regulation by a qualified majority after receiving the assent of the EP. 
UN/ECE Regulation No. 107[1] on provisions concerning the approval of categoryM2 or M3 vehicles with regard to their general construction is aimed, in particular, at removing technical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles between the contracting parties while ensuring a high level of safety in the operation of vehicles. The Commission therefore considers that it would be desirable for the EC to accede thereto. 
It is also provided that the Regulation concerned shall become part of the type-approval system for motor vehicles because the scope of Directive 2001/85/EC is similar to Regulation No. 107. 
It should be stressed that the EC will take its decision regarding accession to this Regulation on the basis of the documents that are available in the official languages of the UN/ECE (English, French and Russian). As the EC has become party to the 1958 UN/ECE agreement, it is required to observe the procedures provided for in that agreement. Therefore only the French and English versions of Regulation No. 107 have been appended. Translations of this Regulation will be published before entering into force.
