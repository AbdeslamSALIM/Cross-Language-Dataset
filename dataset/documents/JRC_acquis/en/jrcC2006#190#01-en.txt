Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) of 13 June 2006 (reference for a preliminary ruling from the Tribunale di Genova (Italy)) — Traghetti del Mediterraneo SpA, in liquidation v Repubblica italiana 
(Case C-173/03) [1] 
Referring court 
Tribunale di Genova 
Parties to the main proceedings 
Applicant: Traghetti del Mediterraneo SpA, in liquidation 
Defendant: Repubblica italiana 
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Tribunale di Genova — Non-contractual liability of a Member State towards its nationals for errors committed by its own courts in the application of Community law, in particular the failure by a court adjudicating at last instance to refer a case to the Court in accordance with Article 234 EC 
Operative part of the judgment 
Community law precludes national legislation which excludes State liability, in a general manner, for damage caused to individuals by an infringement of Community law attributable to a court adjudicating at last instance by reason of the fact that the infringement in question results from an interpretation of provisions of law or an assessment of facts or evidence carried out by that court. 
Community law also precludes national legislation which limits such liability solely to cases of intentional fault and serious misconduct on the part of the court, if such a limitation were to lead to exclusion of the liability of the Member State concerned in other cases where a manifest infringement of the applicable law was committed, as set out in paragraphs 53 to 56 of the judgment in Case C-224/01 Köbler [2003] ECR I-10239.
