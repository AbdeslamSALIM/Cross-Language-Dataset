List of international control and supervisory agencies (hereafter referred to as "supervisory agencies") approved by the Member States under Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 
(2005/C 215/04) 
(This list replaces the list published in Official Journal of the European Communities C 295 of 18 October 2000, p. 2) 
1. GENERAL 
Under Article 16(1)(b) and (2)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 [1], supervisory agencies approved by the Member States are authorised to issue certificates certifying the unloading and importation of agricultural products qualifying for export refunds in third countries or, at least, their arrival at destination in third countries. 
The Member States are responsible for approving and monitoring these supervisory agencies. 
Approval of a supervisory agency by one Member State is valid in all Member States. This means that certificates issued by approved supervisory agencies may be used throughout the Community, irrespective of the Member State in which the agency issuing the certificate is based. 
For the information of Community exporters of agricultural products, the Commission periodically publishes a list of all the supervisory agencies approved by the Member States. The attached list was updated on 1 July 2005. 
2. NOTICE 
The Commission draws the attention of exporters to the following: 
- The fact that a particular supervisory agency appears on the list does not automatically guarantee that certificates issued by that agency are acceptable. Additional documentary evidence may be required. It may also become apparent later that certificates issued are inaccurate. 
- Agencies may be taken off the list at any time. Before settling on a particular agency, exporters are accordingly advised to check with the national authorities that it is still approved. 
- Exporters can obtain further information on any agency from the national authority which approved it.
