REGULATION No 1043/67/EEC OF THE COMMISSION of 22 December 1967 on detailed rules for fixing basic quotas for sugar 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 1009/EEC (1) of 18 December 1967 on the common organisation of the market in sugar, and in particular Article 23 (4) thereof; 
Whereas Article 23 of Regulation No 1009/67/EEC provides for the fixing of basic quotas for factories or undertakings, these quotas being established by multiplying their average annual sugar production during the 1961/62 to 1965/66 marketing years by a coefficient expressing the ratio of the relevant Member State's basic quantity to the average annual sugar production of that State during the same period; 
Whereas the term %quot%production%quot% as used in that Article must be defined; 
Whereas to simplify the administrative task of calculating average production, provision should be made for converting the different types of sugar into white sugar and for expressing the quotas granted in terms of white sugar; 
Whereas Member States should only make use of the possibilities offered by Article 1 of Council Regulation No 1027/67/EEC (2) of 21 December 1967 on the fixing of basic quotas for sugar to the extent that this is necessary; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar;
