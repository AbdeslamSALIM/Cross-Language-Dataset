2006/259/EC: Commission Decision of 27 March 2006 amending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards regionalisation for Argentina and the model certificates relating to the importation of bovine fresh meat from Brazil (notified under document number C(2006) 896) (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Decision 
of 27 March 2006 
amending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards regionalisation for Argentina and the model certificates relating to the importation of bovine fresh meat from Brazil 
(notified under document number C(2006) 896) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/259/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [1], and in particular points (1) and (4) of Article 8 and Article 9(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat [2] provides that imports of those animals and meat are to meet the requirements set out in the appropriate model certificates drawn up under that Decision. 
(2) Argentina has confirmed an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (type O) in the Province of Corrientes in the Department of San Luís del Palmar and has immediately informed the Commission on 8 February 2006. 
(3) It is necessary, in order to protect the health status of the Community, to take regionalisation measures temporarily suspending imports of de-boned meat coming from bovines originating from that Department and the surrounding Departments of Berón de Astrada, Capital, General Paz, Empedrado, Itati, Mbucuruyá and San Cosme. 
(4) The first notification of a suspicion of foot and mouth disease to the Argentinean veterinary authorities was on 4 February 2006. However, the veterinary authorities have suspended certification of exports of meat from animals slaughtered after the 4 January 2006. Consignments of such meat from bovines slaughtered on or after 4 January 2006 from those Departments should be suspended. However by way of derogation from that suspension consignments with a certification signed between 4 January to 4 February 2006 for de-boned and matured meat from bovines slaughtered during the period from 4 January 2006 to 4 February 2006 and already dispatched to the Community should be permitted to be imported into the Community. 
(5) Following a recent Commission mission to Brazil it appears that although the traceability systems have been substantially improved, some further improvements are necessary in order to avoid possible contacts between animals of different status. It is also necessary to improve the efficacy of foot and mouth disease vaccination and the ability to demonstrate lack of circulation of foot and mouth disease virus taking into account that only de-boned and matured bovine meat is imported into the Community. 
(6) It is appropriate as an additional measure to provide for supplementary guarantees concerning animal contacts, vaccination and surveillance. 
(7) Account needs to be taken of the non-vaccination foot and mouth policy in the State of Santa Catarina. 
(8) Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
The Annex to Decision 79/542/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision: 
Article 2 
This Decision shall apply from 31 March 2006. 
Article 3 
This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

Notes 
(a) Veterinary certificates shall be produced by the exporting country, based on the models appearing in Part 2 of Annex II, according to the layout of the model that corresponds to the meats concerned. They shall contain, in the numbered order that appears in the model, the attestations that are required for any third country and, as the case may be, those supplementary guarantees that are required for the exporting third country or part thereof. 
(b) A separate and unique certificate must be provided for meat that is exported from a single territory appearing in columns 2 and 3 of Part 1 of Annex II which is consigned to the same destination and transported in the same railway wagon, lorry, aircraft or ship. 
(c) The original of each certificate shall consist of a single page, both sides, or, where more text is required, it shall be in such a form that all pages needed are part of an integrated whole and indivisible. 
(d) It shall be drawn up in at least one of the official languages of the EU Member State in which the inspection at the border post shall be carried out and of the EU Member State of destination. However, these Member States may allow other languages, if necessary, accompanied by an official translation. 
(e) If for reasons of identification of the items of the consignment (schedule in point 8.3 of the model of certificate), additional pages are attached to the certificate, these pages shall also be considered as forming part of the original of the certificate by the application of the signature and stamp of the certifying official veterinarian, in each of the pages. 
(f) When the certificate, including additional schedules referred to in (e), comprises more than one page, each page shall be numbered — (page number) of (total number of pages) — at the bottom and shall bear the code number of the certificate that has been designated by the competent authority at the top. 
(g) The original of the certificate must be completed and signed by an official veterinarian. In doing so, the competent authorities of the exporting country shall ensure that the principles of certification equivalent to those laid down in Council Directive 96/93/EC are followed. The colour of the signature shall be different to that of the printing. The same rule applies to stamps other than those embossed or watermarked. 
(h) The original of the certificate must accompany the consignment at the EU border inspection post.
