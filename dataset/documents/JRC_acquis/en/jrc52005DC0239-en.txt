COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
Consolidation and expansion of the External Service 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The network of Delegations and the latest changes 
50 years after the establishment of the first representation abroad of the European Communities, the External Service has evolved into a very broad, consistent and coherent network. With the full implementation of the latest decisions concerning the evolution of the network, there are now 127 Delegations and other representations through which the Commission represents the Communities and promotes the European Union's interests throughout the world. All in all, the Commission is now represented in 155 countries, and it also has 5 Delegations to International Organisations. More than 1000 officials and 3800 other staff are currently serving abroad. 
In 2001, the Commission gave new impetus to the network of Delegations, launching a process of regionalisation and a review of the entire network, which led to a number of new openings, closures and other changes. In 2003, the Commission decided on further significant changes to increase the coherence of the network, including 2 new openings (in Yemen and in New Zealand) and 16 upgrades and name changes, which led to the conclusion of a number of Establishment Agreements and to the redeployment of officials from other Delegations in the region. Both Communications have been now entirely implemented. 
In parallel, a major effort took place to implement the deconcentration process, which is an essential part of the reform of the Commission[1]. Deconcentration to the majority of the 80 Delegations concerned has now been accomplished. This has required the mobilisation of very significant additional human and financial resources; at the end of this period (2000-2004) a total of 1561 staff (359 officials and 1202 external staff) had been mobilised to work in delegations. The financing of devolution has been secured through a mix of resources; the costs for officials have in particular been financed against the External Service former A-6 budget line. 
The above effort has imposed a very significant investment in human and financial terms. In that context, the Commission has striven to implement the latest changes to its network of Delegations within the budgetary limits of former title A-6 for 2004, through the redeployment of human and financial resources (see table below).

Total | 1.029.700 | 2.461.800 | 3 491 500 | 
The need to absorb the financial impact of these openings within the limits of the available resources has further stretched the limited resources of the External Service. 
2. DEVELOPMENT OF THE NETWORK 
2.1. Political priorities for next openings 
New political priorities for new openings have arisen since the adoption of these changes. The establishment of Delegations in Switzerland (Berne)[2] and Moldova (Chisinau)[3] is now envisaged. In addition, a regionalised Delegation is proposed at a later stage for Uzbekistan (Tashkent),[4] to be headed by a Chargé d’Affaires a.i . reporting to a non-resident Head of Delegation. Furthermore, given the evolution of EU-Sri Lanka relations and the longer-term EU response to the Tsunami in South-East Asia, it is proposed, as a matter of priority, to upgrade the regionalised Delegation in Sri Lanka to a fully fledged Delegation. Finally, the future opening of Delegations in Timor Leste and Iraq is also envisaged, as soon as the political and practical conditions allow. 
Most of these openings had already been mentioned in past proposals, which specified that they should be confirmed when the appropriate circumstances prevail. From an analysis of the current political situation and the advice of the relevant departments, it appears that this is now the case; very strong factors make these openings timely and necessary: 
- Despite the importance of EU- Switzerland relations, the Commission does not yet have a Delegation in Berne. The need for this opening is recognised both by the Swiss authorities and by the Commission. Many factors militate for the establishment of a Delegation in Berne: the unique geographical situation of the Helvetic Confederation; the closeness of our relations (no other third country has as many agreements with the EU as Switzerland); and the importance of our trade flows (Switzerland is the EU’s 4th largest commercial partner in absolute terms) are just a few of them. This question is becoming even more urgent as the overall bilateral relationship develops. 
- For Moldova , the growing economic and political bilateral relations militate in favour of a permanent presence in the country. Indeed, the Commission has already expressed its support in the past for such a presence as soon as the political situation allows. Moldova is the only country covered by a European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan where the Commission does not yet have a Delegation. The Action Plan will necessitate the opening of the Delegation by 2005 in order to implement the policies it endorses. Moldova is also keen to see greater EU involvement in the settlement of the Transnistria issue; with a delegation, the Commission will be in a better position to support this process. 
- It is also envisaged given the evolution of the Western Balkans countries to open a Liaison Office in Montenegro. 
- In view of the evolution of bilateral relations, and as part of the longer-term European Union response to the natural cataclysm in South-East Asia, the regionalised Delegation in Sri Lanka should become a fully fledged Delegation, in support of the European Union's longer-term effort to help repair the damage suffered. 
- Openings in Uzbekistan and in Timor Leste are also envisaged, subject to the fulfilment of the necessary political and practical requirements, and provided the appropriate resources are available, which is currently not the case. These openings must be seen, respectively, in the context of the growing importance of our strategic interests in Central Asia and in the framework of the accession of East Timor to the EU-ACP Cotonou Agreement. 
- Similarly, when the appropriate political and practical requirements are met, a Delegation in Iraq should also be established, to contribute to the EU's efforts to bring greater stability to that country. At the moment the necessary resources are not available. 
- Finally, a liaison office in Kosovo has also been set up as a priority, to meet the current political circumstances in the area. For Montenegro such an opening is justified from a political point of view by the pressing need to strengthen the EU presence in the Region and from an assistance point of view by the need to replace the EAR. It is envisaged to open the Montenegro office as soon as possible, according to the availability of resources. The preparation of ad hoc systems for representation in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (Montreal) and in the Council of Europe (Strasbourg) is also underway. 
2.2. Timing envisaged 
In view of the political priorities, DG Relex is aiming to upgrade the Sri Lanka Delegation by May 2005 and to open the Delegation in Moldova in the first half of 2005, to be followed by the opening of a Delegation in Switzerland later on in the year. 
2.3. Human and budgetary resources 
As soon as the political priorities above were identified, the Commission started work on identifying the necessary resources for these openings. However, due to conflicting priorities, appropriations for these openings could not be entered in the 2005 budget proposal. It has therefore been necessary to consider alternative means of funding these openings by making savings elsewhere. 
It needs to be borne in mind that, as the network is already over-stretched and the previous openings were already implemented by reassigning priorities within the allocated appropriations, only very limited opportunities for savings have been identified to date, which makes it necessary to prioritise the timing of these openings. 
Notwithstanding these budgetary problems, the above-mentioned political priorities make these openings necessary and timely; they will therefore have to be put into effect with what resources as are currently available. This is to be accomplished mainly through redeployment of existing human resources - in particular from other Delegations in the region - and via the redistribution of budgetary resources from the entire network in order to cover the running costs, infrastructure, personnel and other expenses. This will involve a process of further rationalisation of available resources. 
In the light of all the points set out above, the following table provides a guide as to the basic cost estimates and the preliminary timetable for the openings: 
Table 2 - Foreseen impact and timetable 
Delegation/ Concept | Personnel | Costs | Tentative Opening date | 
Officials (1) | Other staff (1) | Total Estimated Start-upcosts (2) | Total Estimated Yearly costs (1) | Total costs | 
Sri Lanka(4) (upgrade) | 3A 2B 1C | 1 AL III (admin) | 678.000 | 718.536 | 1.396.536 | May/June 2005 | 
Moldova(4) | 2A 1B 1C | 1 AL II 1 AL III 1 AL IV(3) | 583.500 | 308.376 | 891.876 | July 2005 | 
Switzerland | 1A 1B 1C | 1 AL II 1 AL III 1 AL IV | 528.000 | 875.988 | 1.403.988 | October 2005 | 
Total | 6A 4B 3C | 2 AL II 3 AL III 2 AL IV | 1.789.500 | 1.902.900 | 3.692.400 | 
(1) only additional costs linked to the openings/upgrades are listed here, as staff will be re-deployed. (2) all costs will be covered by existing resources within the 2005 budget through a review of priorities. (3) when Contract Agents are introduced, 1 secretary and 1 informatics officer are foreseen for Moldova. (4) the necessary staff for the cooperation/aid and finances-contracts sections will be determined at a later stage with DG Aidco. 
3. CONCLUSIONS 
The new openings described above will be implemented as a matter of priority. The necessary financial and human resources will be covered by restructuring the current network, redeploying posts and reducing costs elsewhere. These reductions should not compromise the quality of the network, either at the new Delegations or in the Delegations subject to reductions in their resources to allow for the new openings. Hence the gradual timetable proposed above. 
This effort also needs to be seen in the context of the preparatory work for the implementation of the Constitutional Treaty, subject to its ratification by the Member States. The Treaty, which was signed by the Heads of State and/or Government in Rome on 29 October 2004, includes a number of provisions which will deeply affect the structure and organisation of the external relations of the European Union and therefore of the External Service. The Treaty provides, among other things, for European Union Delegations to represent the Union in third countries and in international organisations. 
Against this backcloth, it must be borne in mind that, although they are hierarchically part of the Commission structure, in practice Delegations serve the interests of the European Union as a whole, as described by the Commission in its Communication of 3 July 2001[5]. They do so by publicising, explaining and implementing EU policy, analysing the policies of the countries where they are accredited, and conducting negotiations in accordance with the mandate they have been given. 
The measures described in this Communication will contribute to the consolidation and expansion of a more coherent network, able to take on the additional obligations and duties from the new Constitutional Treaty.

5. DESCRIPTION ET JUSTIFICATION 
5.1 Nécessité d'une intervention communautaire[6] 
5.1.1 Objectifs poursuivis 
Afin de mieux gérer les relations économiques et politiques de la Commission avec la Suisse et la Moldavie il est considéré nécessaire à ce stade d’ouvrir des délégations de la Commission dans ces pays. Dans le cas du Sri Lanka, il est nécessaire d’adapter la structure de la délégation pour faire face à l’évolution des relations avec ce pays ainsi de gérer la réponse de la Communauté au désastre naturel qui a eu lieu dans la région. 
5.1.2 Dispositions prises relevant de l’évaluation ex ante 
L’ouverture des n ouvelles délégations est décidée sur base des nécessités en termes de l’évolution des relations économiques et politiques de la Communauté avec les pays en question et en étroite collaboration avec tous les services et autres Directions générales concernés. 
5.1.3 Dispositions prises à la suite de l’évaluation ex post 
Les délégations en questions feront partie du « network » des délégations de la Communautés et ainsi seront l’objet de contrôle dans le cadre des visites de l’Inspection des délégations ainsi que du service de Contrôle Interne du Service Extérieur. 
5.2 Actions envisagées et modalités de l'intervention budgétaire 
Il s’agit des dépenses administratives liées à l’ouverture de deux nouvelles délégations et l’upgrade d’une délégation régionalisée à une délégation normale. Les dépenses supplémentaires de l’exercice 2005 seront financées à partir des crédits existants en faisant des économies sur d’autres dépenses. Ces actions amèneront à une amélioration des relations politiques et économiques avec les pays en question et permettront à la Commission de mieux gérer ses activités dans ces pays. 
5.3 Modalités de mise en œuvre 
Comme pour toutes les dépenses administratives des délégations la gestion sera en mode directe par la Commission en utilisant du personnel statutaire et externe (agents locaux).
