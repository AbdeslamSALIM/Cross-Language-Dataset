COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 93/79/EEC of 21 September 1993 setting out additional implementing provisions for lists of varieties of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants, as kept by suppliers under Council Directive 92/34/EEC 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/34/EEC of 28 April 1992 on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production (1), as amended by Commission Decision 93/401/EEC (2), and in particular Article 9 (6) thereof, 
Whereas a system of description of varieties already exists at an international level; whereas the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) has developed such a system; 
Whereas it is desirable to base the Community system on the experience gained at international level; 
Whereas suppliers whose activity is confined to the placing on the market of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants should be subject to less onerous requirements; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Propagating Material and Plants of Fruit Genera and Species, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
This Directive establishes additional implementing provisions for lists of varieties of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants as kept by suppliers pursuant to Article 9 (2) (ii) of Directive 92/34/EEC. 
Article 2 
1. The lists kept by suppliers shall include the following: 
(i) the name of the variety, together with its commonly known synonyms, where appropriate; 
(ii) indications as to the maintenance of the variety and propagation system applied; 
(iii) description of the variety at least on the basis of the characteristics and their expressions as specified in the Annex hereto; 
(iv) if possible, indications as to how the variety differs from the other varieties most closely resembling it. 
2. Subparagraphs (ii) and (iv) of paragraph 1 shall not apply to any supplier whose activity is confined to the placing on the market of fruit plant propagating material or fruit plants. 
Article 3 
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive not later than 30 June 1994. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 
When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be adopted by the Member States. 
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of domestic law they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 
Article 4 
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
