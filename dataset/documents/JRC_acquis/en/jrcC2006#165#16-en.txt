Operative part of the judgment 
The Court: 
1. In the assessment of an application for authorisation for processing under customs control pursuant to Article 133(e) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2000, account must be taken not only of the market for the finished products but also of the economic situation of the market for the raw materials used to produce those products. 
2. The criteria to be taken into consideration when assessing %quot%processing activities to be created or maintained%quot% within the meaning of Article 133(e) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 2700/2000, and Article 502(3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 993/2001 of 4 May 2001, may include the criterion relating to the creation of a minimum number of jobs on account of the processing activities envisaged, but is not limited to that criterion. Those criteria depend on the nature of the processing activity concerned, and the national customs authority responsible for examining the economic conditions under those provisions must make an overall assessment of all the relevant factors, including those concerning the number of jobs created, the value of the investment made and the permanence of the activity envisaged. 
3. The validity of conclusions of the Customs Code Committee issued in accordance with Article 133(e) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 2700/2000, cannot be examined within the framework of Article 234 EC. 
4. The Customs Code Committee's conclusion is not binding on national customs authorities when they are determining an application for authorisation for processing under customs control.
