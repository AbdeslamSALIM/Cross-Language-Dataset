Notice of initiation of an expiry review of the antidumping measures applicable to imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People's Republic of China 
Notice of initiation of an expiry review of the antidumping measures applicable to imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People's Republic of China 
(2006/C 167/04) 
Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry [1] of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i) originating in the People's Republic of China, ("country concerned"), the Commission has received a request for review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community ("the basic Regulation") [2], as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2117/2005 [3]. 
1. Request for review 
The request was lodged on 18 April 2006 by the Community Federation of Lighting Industry of Compact Fluorescent Lamps Integrated (2 CFL-i) ("the applicant") on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Community production of integrated electronic compact fluorescent lamps (CFL-i). 
2. Product 
The product under review is electronic compact fluorescent discharge lamps with one or more glass tubes, with all lighting elements and electronic components fixed to the lamp foot or integrated in the lamp foot originating in the People's Republic of China ("the product concerned"), currently classifiable within CN code ex85393190. This CN code is given only for information. 
3. Existing measures 
The measures currently in force are definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1470/2001 [4]. 
4. Grounds for the review 
The request is based on the grounds that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a continuation of dumping and injury to the Community industry. 
In view of the provisions of Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation, the applicant established normal value for the People's Republic of China on the basis of the price in an appropriate market economy country, which is mentioned in point 5.1(d). The allegation of continuation of dumping is based on a comparison of normal value, as set out in the preceding sentence, with the export prices of the product concerned when sold for export to the Community. 
On this basis, the dumping margin calculated is significant. 
The complainant has provided evidence that imports of the product concerned from the People's Republic of China have increased overall in absolute terms and in terms of market share. 
It is also alleged that the volumes and the prices of the imported product concerned have continued, among other consequences, to have a negative impact on the market share held, the quantities sold and the level of prices charged by the Community industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance, the financial situation and the employment situation of the Community industry. 
In addition, the applicant alleges that any increase of imports at dumped prices from the country concerned would likely lead to further injury to the Community industry should measures be allowed to lapse. 
5. Procedure 
Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an expiry review, the Commission hereby initiates a review in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. 
5.1. Procedure for the determination of likelihood of dumping and injury 
The investigation will determine whether the expiry of the measures would be likely, or unlikely, to lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury. 
(a) Sampling 
In view of the apparent number of parties involved in this proceeding, the Commission may decide to apply sampling, in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. 
(i) Sampling for exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all exporters producers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known by contacting the Commission and providing the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the formats indicated in point 7: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers and contact person, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in units of the product concerned sold for export to the Community during the period 1 July 2005 until 30 June 2006, 
- the turnover in local currency and the volume in units of the product concerned sold to other third countries during the period 1 July 2005 until 30 June 2006, 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the production of the product concerned and the production volume in units of the product concerned, the production capacity and the investments in production capacity during the period 1 July 2005 until 30 June 2006,

- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of exporters/producers, the Commission will, in addition, contact the authorities of the exporting country, and any known associations of exporters/producers. 
(ii) Sampling for importers 
In order to enable the Commission to decide whether sampling is necessary and, if so, to select a sample, all importers, or representatives acting on their behalf, are hereby requested to make themselves known to the Commission and to provide the following information on their company or companies within the time limit set in point 6(b)(i) and in the formats indicated in point 7: 
- name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers and contact person, 
- the total turnover in EUR of the company during the period 1 July 2005 until 30 June 2006, 
- the total number of employees, 
- the precise activities of the company with regard to the product concerned, 
- the volume in units and value in â&#x201A;Ź of imports into and resales made in the Community market during the period 1 July 2005 until 30 June 2006 of the imported product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China, 
- the names and the precise activities of all related companies [5] involved in the production, importing and/or selling of the product concerned, 
- any other relevant information that would assist the Commission in the selection of the sample, 
- by providing the above information, the company agrees to its possible inclusion in the sample. If the company is chosen to be part of the sample, this will imply replying to a questionnaire and accepting an on-the-spot investigation of its response. If the company indicates that it does not agree to its possible inclusion in the sample, it will be deemed to not have co-operated in the investigation. The consequences of non-cooperation are set out in point 8 below. 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for the selection of the sample of importers, the Commission will, in addition, contact any known associations of importers. 
(iii) Final selection of the samples 
All interested parties wishing to submit any relevant information regarding the selection of the sample must do so within the time limit set in point 6(b)(ii). 
The Commission intends to make the final selection of the samples after having consulted the parties concerned that have expressed their willingness to be included in the sample. 
Companies included in the samples must reply to a questionnaire within the time limit set in point 6 (b)(iii) and must co-operate within the framework of the investigation. 
If sufficient co-operation is not forthcoming, the Commission may base its findings, in accordance with Articles 17(4) and 18 of the basic Regulation, on the facts available. A finding based on facts available may be less advantageous to the party concerned, as explained in point 8. 
(b) Questionnaires 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the Community industry and to any association of producers in the Community, to the sampled exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China to any association of exporters/producers, to the sampled importers, to any association of importers named in the request or which co-operated in the investigation leading to the measures subject to the present review, and to the authorities of the exporting country concerned. 
(c) Selection of the market economy country 
In the previous investigation Mexico was used as an appropriate market economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People's Republic of China. The Commission envisages to use Mexico again for this purpose. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this country within the specific time limit set in point 6(c). 
5.2. Procedure for the assessment of Community interest 
In accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation and in the event that the likelihood of a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury is confirmed, a determination will be made as to whether to maintain, or repeal the anti-dumping measures would not be against the Community interest. For this reason the Community industry, importers, their representative associations, representative users and representative consumer organisations, provided that they prove that there is an objective link between their activity and the product concerned, may, within the general time limits set in point 6(a)(ii), make themselves known and provide the Commission with information. The parties which have acted in conformity with the previous sentence may request a hearing, setting the particular reasons why they should be heard, within the time limit set in point 6(a)(iii). It should be noted that any information submitted pursuant to Article 21 will only be taken into account if supported by factual evidence at the time of submission. 
6. Time limits
