Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the position to be taken by the Community concerning the proposal to amend the International Convention on the Harmonisation of Frontier Controls of Goods 1982 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. The International Convention on the Harmonisation of Frontier Controls of Goods (the Harmonisation Convention), signed at Geneva on 21 October 1982, was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1262/84 of 10 April 1984[1] and entered into force on 12 September 1987. There are currently 45 Contracting Parties to the Convention, including the European Community and its Member States. 
2. The Harmonisation Convention introduced measures designed to facilitate, and so develop, international trade through the harmonisation (where appropriate) of the various frontier controls that are applied to the movement of goods. However, the rapidly changing political scene in Central and Eastern Europe made it necessary, in particular, to consider ways to rationalise other border crossing formalities. 
3. The UN/ECE Inland Transport Committee decided at its February 1999 session that the Harmonisation Convention should be revised to include provisions to facilitate the border crossing of vehicles carrying perishable goods under the provisions of the ATP Agreement[2] The UN/ECE Working Party on Customs Questions affecting Transport, with the assistance of an ad hoc expert group, has subsequently produced draft proposals to add a new annex to the Harmonisation Convention in order to complement the existing provisions. 
4. The purpose of the draft annex is to facilitate international trade by reducing, harmonising and co-ordinating procedures and paperwork in connection with the border control of goods, in particular live animals and perishable goods. The draft annex essentially contains obligations that aim at reducing delays at border crossing points in respect of live animals and perishable goods (through, by example, the use of "one stop" technology to enable joint controls between neighbouring countries 24 hours a day, and the separation of traffic flows to give priority to the movement of these goods), improving the operation of border crossing points, as well as technical matters relating to the mutual recognition of international vehicle inspection and weight certificates. 
5. The facilitation of international trade and the removal of technical obstacles to trade is an objective of the common commercial policy and thus falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The measures set out in the draft annex are consistent with Community legislation. 
6. In the light of the above, the Commission proposes that the Council adopts the annexed decision.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133, in conjunction with Article 300 (2), sub paragraph two thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) The International Convention on the Harmonisation of Frontier Controls of Goods, 1982 (the Harmonisation Convention) was approved by Council Regulation (EEC) No1262/84, of 10 April 1984[3] and entered into force in the Community on 12 September 1987, 
(2) Article 22 of the Harmonisation Convention, in conjunction with its Annex 7, provides that the Administrative Committee can propose and adopt amendments to the Convention. These amendments are to be accepted unless a Contracting Party objects within 12 months of the United Nation's communication of the proposed amendment to the Contracting Parties, 
(3) The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) Inland Transport Committee decided at its February 1999 session that the Harmonisation Convention should be revised to include provisions to facilitate the border crossing of vehicles, 
(4) The UN/ECE Working Party on Customs Questions affecting Transport subsequently produced draft proposals to add a new Annex 8 to the Harmonisation Convention in order to complement the existing provisions, 
(5) The purpose of the draft annex is to facilitate international trade by reducing, harmonising and co-ordinating procedures and paperwork in connection with the border control of goods, in particular live animals and perishable goods. The draft annex essentially contains obligations that aim at reducing delays at border crossing points in respect of live animals and perishable goods (through, by example, the use of "one stop" technology to enable joint controls between neighbouring countries 24 hours a day, and the separation of traffic flows to give priority to the movement of these goods), improving the operation of border crossing points, as well as technical matters relating to the mutual recognition of international vehicle inspection and weight certificates, 
(6) The facilitation of international trade and the removal of technical obstacles to trade is an objective of the common commercial policy and thus falls under the exclusive competence of the Community, 
(7) Administrative Committee has been asked to adopt the proposed amendment at its June 2005 session, 
(8) The Community position concerning the proposed amendment should be determined.

ANNEX 
Annex 8 
FACILITATION OF BORDER CROSSING PROCEDURES 
FOR INTERNATIONAL ROAD TRANSPORT 
Article 1 
Principles 
Complementing the provisions of the Convention and in particular those provided in Annex 1, the present Annex intends to define the measures that need to be implemented in order to facilitate border crossing procedures for international road transport. 
Article 2 
Facilitation of visa procedures for professional drivers 
1. The Contracting Parties should endeavour to facilitate the procedures for the granting of visas for professional drivers engaged in international road transport in accordance with national best practice for all visa applicants and national immigration rules as well as international commitments. 
2. The Contracting Parties agree to regularly exchange information on best practices with regard to the facilitation of visa procedures for professional drivers. 
Article 3 
International road transport operations 
1. In order to facilitate the international movement of goods, the Contracting Parties shall regularly inform all parties involved in international transport operations in a harmonized and co-ordinated manner on border control requirements for international road transport operations in force or planned as well as on the actual situation at borders. 
2. Contracting Parties shall endeavour to transfer, to the extent possible and not only for transit traffic, all necessary control procedures to the places of origin and destination of the goods transported by road so as to alleviate congestion at the border crossing points. 
3. Referring in particular to Article 7 of this Convention, priority shall be given to urgent consignments, e.g. live animals and perishable goods. In particular, the competent services at border crossing points: 
(i) shall take the necessary measures to minimize waiting times for ATP-approved vehicles transporting perishable foodstuffs or for vehicles transporting live animals, as from their time of arrival at the frontier until their regulatory, administrative, Customs and sanitary controls; 
(ii) shall ensure that the required regulatory controls are carried out as quickly as possible; 
(iii) shall allow, as far as possible, the operation of the necessary refrigerating units of vehicles carrying perishable foodstuffs during the time of crossing the border, unless this is impossible as a result of the required control procedure; 
(iv) shall co-operate, in particular through advance information exchange, with their counterparts in other Contracting Parties in order to accelerate border crossing procedures for perishable goods and live animals, in case these loads are subject to sanitary inspections. 
Article 4 
Vehicle inspection 
1. The Contracting Parties, not yet Parties to the Agreement Concerning the Adoption of Uniform Conditions for Periodical Technical Inspections of Wheeled Vehicles and the Reciprocal Recognition of such Inspections (1997), should endeavour, in line with relevant national and international laws and regulations, to facilitate the crossing of road vehicles across borders by accepting the International Technical Inspection Certificate as provided for in this Agreement. The Technical Inspection Certificate, as contained in the Agreement as of 1 January 2002, is contained in Appendix 1 to this Annex. 
2. With a view to identifying ATP-approved vehicles carrying perishable foodstuffs, the Contracting Parties may utilize the distinguishing marks affixed to the relevant equipment and the ATP certificate or plate of approval provided for in the Agreement on the International Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and the Special Equipment to be used for such Carriage (1970). 
Article 5 
International Vehicle Weight Certificate 
1. In order to accelerate border crossings, the Contracting Parties, in line with relevant national and international laws and regulations, should endeavour to avoid repetitive vehicle weighing procedures at border crossings by accepting and mutually recognizing the International Vehicle Weight Certificate as contained in Appendix 2 to this Annex. In case the Contracting Parties accept such certificates, no further weight measurements shall be carried out apart from random checks and controls in the case of supposed irregularities. Vehicle weight measurements recorded in such certificates shall take place only in the country of origin of international transport operations. The results of such measurements shall be duly reflected and certified in such certificates. 
2. Each Contracting Party, accepting the International Vehicle Weight Certificate, shall cause to be published a list of all weighing stations in their country authorized in accordance with international principles as well as any modification thereto. This list as well as any modification thereto shall be transmitted to the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UNECE) for distribution to each Contracting Party and to the international organizations referred to in Annex 7, Article 2 to this Convention. 
3. The minimum requirements for authorized weighing stations, the principles of authorization and the basic features of weighing procedures to be applied are contained in Appendix 2 to this Annex. 
Article 6 
Border crossing points 
In order to ensure that the required formalities at border crossing points are streamlined and accelerated, the Contracting Parties shall meet, as far as possible, the following minimum requirements for border crossing points open for international goods traffic: 
(i) facilities enabling joint controls between neighbouring States (one-stop technology), 24 hours a day, whenever justified by trade needs and in line with road traffic regulations; 
(ii) separation of traffic for different types of traffic on both sides of the border allowing to give preference to vehicles under the cover of valid international Customs transit documents (TIR, T) or carrying live animals or perishable foodstuffs; 
(iii) off-lane control areas for random cargo and vehicle checks; 
(iv) appropriate parking and terminal facilities; 
(v) proper hygiene, social and telecommunications facilities for drivers; 
(vi) assistance in the establishment of forwarding agents at border crossings with adequate facilities, offering services to transport operators on a competitive basis. 
Article 7 
Reporting mechanism 
With regard to Articles 1 to 6 of this Annex, the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UNECE) shall carry out, every second year, a survey among Contracting Parties on progress made to improve border crossing procedures in their countries.

Appendix 2 to Annex 8 to the Convention 
INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE WEIGHT CERTIFICATE 
1. The objective of the International Vehicle Weight Certificate (IVWC) is to facilitate border crossing procedures and, in particular, to avoid repetitive weight measurements of goods road vehicles en route in the Contracting Parties. Duly filled-in certificates, accepted by the Contracting Parties, shall be accepted as bearing valid weight measurements by the competent authorities of Contracting Parties. Competent authorities shall refrain from requiring additional weight measurements apart from random checks and controls in the case of supposed irregularities. 
2. The International Vehicle Weight Certificate, which shall conform to the model reproduced below in this Appendix, shall be issued and used under the supervision of a designated Governmental authority in each Contracting Party (accepting such certificates) in line with the procedure described in the annexed certificate. 
3. The use of the certificate by transport operators is optional. 
4. The Contracting Parties, accepting such certificates, shall approve authorized weighing stations to fill-in, together with the operator/driver of the goods road vehicle, the International Vehicle Weight Certificate in accordance with the following minimum requirements: 
1. Weighing stations shall be equipped with certified weighing instruments. For performing the weight measurements, the Contracting Parties accepting such certificates may select the method and instruments they consider appropriate. The Contracting Parties accepting such certificates shall ensure the competence of the weighing stations, such as by accreditation or assessment, use of appropriate weighing instruments, qualified personnel, documented quality systems and testing procedures. 
2. The weighing stations and their instruments shall be well maintained. The instruments shall be regularly verified and sealed by the relevant authorities responsible for weights and measures. The weighing instruments, their maximum permissible errors and usage shall comply with the Recommendations established by the International Organisation for Legal Metrology (OIML). 
3. Weighing stations shall be equipped with weighing instruments corresponding to either: 
4. - OIML Recommendation R 76 “Non-automatic weighing instruments” accuracy class III or better; 
5. - OIML Draft Recommendation “Automatic instruments for weighing road vehicles in motion”, accuracy classes 0.5, 1, 2, or better, resulting in maximum permissible errors of ± 2%, 1% and 0.5% or less. 
Higher error values may apply in case of individual axle weight measurements. 
5. In exceptional cases and, particularly when irregularities are suspected, or at the demand of the transport operator/driver of the respective road vehicle, the competent authorities may re-weigh the vehicle . In case a weighing station produces several mistaken measurements, observed by the control authorities in a Contracting Party accepting such certificates, the competent authorities of the country of the weighing station shall take appropriate measures in order to ensure that such events will not occur again. 
6. The model of the certificate may be reproduced in any of the languages of the Contracting Parties accepting such certificates provided that the layout of the certificate and the placing of the items therein are not modified. 
7. Each Contracting Party accepting such certificates, shall publish a list of all weighing stations in their countries authorized in accordance with international principles as well as any modifications thereto. This list as well as any modification thereto shall be transmitted to the Executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UNECE) for distribution to each Contracting Party and to the international organisations referred to in Annex 7, Article 2 to this Convention. 
8. (Transitional provision) Since only very few weighing stations are equipped at present with weighing instruments able to provide individual axle weight or axle group measurements, the Contracting Parties, accepting such certificates, agree that, during a transitional period, expiring 12 months following the entry into force of this Annex, gross vehicle weight measurements as provided for under item 7.3 in the International Vehicle Weight Certificate shall be sufficient and shall be accepted by the competent national authorities.

INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE WEIGHT CERTIFICATE (IVWC) LEGAL BASIS The International Vehicle Weight Certificate has been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of Annex 8 – Facilitation of Border Crossing Procedures for International Road Transport – to the International Convention on the Harmonization of Frontier Controls of Goods, 1982. OBJECTIVE The International Vehicle Weight Certificate is designed to avoid repetitive weight measurements of goods road vehicles en route in international transport, particularly at border crossings. The use of this certificate by transport operators is optional. PROCEDURE If Contracting Parties accept[10] the International Vehicle Weight Certificate duly filled-in by (a) the operator of an approved weighing station and (b) the transport operator(s)/goods road vehicle driver(s), it shall be accepted and recognized as bearing valid weight measurements by the competent authorities of the Contracting Parties. As a general rule, competent authorities shall accept the information contained in this Certificate as valid and shall refrain from requiring additional weight measurements. To prevent abuse, the competent authorities may however, in exceptional cases, and particularly when irregularities are suspected, carry out an examination of the vehicle weight in accordance with national regulations. Weight measurements in order to establish this certificate shall be made, upon the request of the transport operator(s)/goods road vehicle driver(s) whose vehicle is registered in one of the Contracting Parties accepting such certificates, by approved weighing stations at costs which shall be limited to the services rendered. For the purposes of this certificate, approved weighing stations shall be equipped with weighing instruments corresponding to either: - OIML Recommendation R 76 “Non-automatic weighing instruments” accuracy class III or better; or - OIML Draft Recommendation “Automatic instruments for weighing road vehicles in motion”, accuracy classes 0.5, 1, 2, or better, resulting in maximum permissible errors of ± 2%, 1% and 0.5% or less. Higher error values may apply in case of individual axle weight measurements. SANCTIONS Transport operator(s)/goods road vehicles driver(s) are subject to the national legislation for any false declaration made in the International Vehicle Weight Certificate. In determining the legal value of the weight measurement(s), an estimation of the possible weighing error must be made for each weighing system. This error value, consisting of the intrinsic error of the weighing equipment and the error due to external factors, must be deducted from the measured weight in order to ensure that a possible overweight measurement is not caused by the inaccuracy of the weighing equipment and/or the weighing procedure used. As a consequence, fines shall not be imposed on transport operators utilizing this certificate unless the weight measurement(s) inscribed in this certificate minus the maximum possible weighing error (i.e. 2 per cent maximum or 800 kg in case of a 40 tonne vehicle) exceed(s) the maximum permissible weight(s) as prescribed by the national legislation. |
