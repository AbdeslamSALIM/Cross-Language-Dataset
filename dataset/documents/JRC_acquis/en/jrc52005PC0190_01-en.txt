… 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. JUSTIFICATION FOR, AND OBJECTIVE OF, THE PROPOSAL 
In the European Union there are now 20 decentralised bodies which can be categorised as Community agencies on account of their common features: establishment on a legal basis, legal personality, administrative and financial autonomy, clearly-defined sphere of responsibility and action, etc. 
The head of each Community agency usually has the title director and in some cases is assisted by one or more deputies. The director’s term of office is generally 4-5 years. Most of the basic Regulations nevertheless provide for the director’s term of office and, where applicable, that of the deputies, to be extended for one or more further periods. The conditions governing appointment and term of office are laid down in each basic Regulation for each agency. 
Until recently, the body responsible for appointment simply adopted a decision extending an incumbent director’s term of office. Having examined the basic Regulations in more detail, however, the Commission has concluded that this practice poses a legal problem. 
Apart from Regulation (EEC) No 1360/90 establishing a European Training Foundation and, more recently, Regulation (EC) No 851/2004 establishing a European Centre for disease prevention and control, the basic Regulations for the Community agencies use the term “renewal” to refer to extending the director’s term of office. 
In the Treaty establishing the European Community, Article 214(1) (on appointing Commission Members) and Articles 223 and 225 (on appointing Court of Justice Judges) contain the same provision. Yet in both cases it is agreed that the possibility of renewal does not mean that a simplified procedure is applicable or that the term of office may be extended without complying with the appointment procedure laid down in the Treaty. 
Under these conditions, the fact that the term of office is renewable must be interpreted as meaning that, when the term of office ends, the incumbent has to apply for a new term. 
Applied to the agencies, this interpretation leads to the conclusion that the possibility of renewing the director’s term of office does not exempt the incumbent from following the appointment procedure laid down in the basic Regulation. 
Moreover, agency directors and their deputies are not only office-holders but also agency staff members employed under temporary contracts and subject to the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities. 
The appointment procedure must therefore include publication of the post in all Member States and a selection process in compliance with the rules deriving from the basic Regulations and the Conditions of employment of other servants. 
These procedures are generally lengthy and relatively expensive. They may also slow up or hamper the agency’s work during this period, if the incumbent director decides to reapply. 
Given the agencies’ special needs and the practice in past years, it therefore does not seem appropriate to conduct a full selection procedure each time that the first term of office for a director’s or other relevant person’s post comes to an end. The appointing bodies responsible should have the option of either extending the current term of office or launching a new selection procedure. 
Account should likewise be taken of the fact that an agency director is not only an administrative manager but also plays an important role in conducting the agency’s work and achieving its objectives. The appointing authority’s decision must take both these aspects into account: the need to ensure continuity in the agency’s administrative management while at the same time fostering new ideas and policies. 
That is why a decision to extend an incumbent director’s term of office must be based on a prior assessment of their performance and of the agency’s needs, conducted by the authority proposing candidates to the appointing authority, and extension may be authorised only once and for a limited period not exceeding that stipulated for the initial term of office. 
In total, amendment of the articles relating to appointment is proposed in respect of 18 agencies – resulting in the presentation of 18 proposals for Regulations amending the basic Regulation for each agency. 
The Regulations establishing two agencies do not require amendment: Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 of 5 December 2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction[1] and Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency[2]. Because of these agencies’ limited lifespan, these Regulations do not provide for a director’s term of office to be renewed. 
Similarly, no proposals have been presented for amendment of the acts setting up agencies and other bodies under the second and third pillars. 
Lastly, regarding the two agencies in respect of which a proposal for a Regulation has already been presented and is being examined or is in the process of being adopted (the European Chemicals Agency[3] and the Community Fisheries Control Agency[4]), the Commission will as necessary present proposals for amendments with a view to harmonising the texts for all the Community agencies. 
2. LEGAL BASIS AND ADOPTION PROCÉDURE 
Each Regulation establishing an agency is in principle based on the Treaty article corresponding to that agency’s sphere of responsibility and action, from which the applicable adoption procedure likewise derives. 
That is why it has proved necessary to amend each Regulation establishing an agency. 
The procedure for adopting the Regulations should be in accordance with the rules in force when the agency was established, while taking into account any relevant changes which have taken place since the establishing Regulation was adopted – such as European Parliament powers introduced by the Treaty or amendments relating to the legal basis. 
This particularly applies in the case of the European Environment Agency, but also in respect of five Regulations whose legal basis has been amended and for which Article 308 of the Treaty has been replaced by the legal basis for those agencies’ sphere of action. 
The agencies in question here are: the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (the establishing Regulation is currently being consolidated and the Commission has accepted the Council’s view that from now on Article 152 should be used as the legal basis); the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Article 150); the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (Article 137(1)(a) and (b)); the European Training Foundation (Article 150); and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (Article 137(1)(a)). 
3. WORDING OF THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS 
3.1 The three recitals, which are common to all the proposed Regulations, are worded as follows: 
“It is necessary to harmonise the rules on the conditions and procedures applicable to extending the term of office of the Director, Deputy Director or President, as appropriate, of certain Community agencies. 
Provision should be made to extend this term of office once, after adequate evaluation. 
Regulation ... [title of the basic Regulation establishing the agency] should therefore be amended,”. 
3.2 For each of the amended Regulations, the proposed standard wording is: 
“The [Agency/Centre/Office/Authority] shall be headed by a Director appointed by the management board* on a proposal from the Commission** for a five-year period which, on a proposal from the Commission** and after evaluation, may be extended once for a period of not more than five years. 
In the evaluation the Commission** shall assess in particular: 
- the results achieved in the first term of office and the way in which they were achieved; 
- the [Agency/Centre/Office/Authority]’s duties and requirements in the coming years.” 
* the Council in the case of the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) and the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM); the Commission in the case of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) and the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions (EUROFOUND);
