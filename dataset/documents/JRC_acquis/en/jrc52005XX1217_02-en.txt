Criteria for the assignment of cases to Chambers 
(2005/C 322/09) 
On 30 November 2005, in accordance with Article 4 of Annex I to the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 12 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance, the Tribunal decided, for an initial period, from the day of publication in the OJ of the decision of the President of the Court of Justice recording that the Civil Service Tribunal has been constituted in accordance with the law to 30 September 2006, as follows: 
- the First Chamber shall hear all cases, with the exception of those principally concerning questions of recruitment, assessment/promotion and termination of service, which shall be heard by the Second Chamber; 
- a number of cases shall be assigned to the Third Chamber, regardless of the subject-matter involved, at regular intervals to be determined at a meeting of the full Tribunal; 
- derogations from the above rules for assignment may be made for reasons of connections between cases and to ensure a balanced and reasonably diversified workload within the Tribunal.
