Operative part of the judgment 
Articles 48 and 52 of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Articles 39 and 43 EC) concerning, respectively, freedom of movement for workers and freedom of establishment, and Article 14c(b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, as amended and updated by Council Regulation (EC) No 118/97 of 2 December 1996, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1606/98 of 29 June 1998, must be interpreted as not precluding Netherlands legislation which includes, in the basis for calculating social security contributions, interest such as that paid, in the case in the main proceedings, by a company established in the Netherlands to a Netherlands national resident in Belgium who is subject, under that regulation and taking into account the nature of his occupational activities, to the social security legislation of both those Member States.
