Notice of termination of the safeguard investigation initiated on 6 July 2005 under Council Regulations (EC) No 3285/94 and (EC) No 519/94, concerning imports of frozen strawberries 
Notice of termination of the safeguard investigation initiated on 6 July 2005 under Council Regulations (EC) No 3285/94 and (EC) No 519/94, concerning imports of frozen strawberries 
(2006/C 80/03) 
Further to a request from Poland, a safeguard investigation under Council Regulations (EC) No 3285/94 and (EC) No 519/94, published in Notice 2005/C 165/02 and concerning imports of frozen strawberries was initiated on 6 July 2005. 
In accordance with the applicable provisions under Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 and Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94, the Commission commenced an investigation procedure seeking to determine whether imports of the product in question are causing, or threatening to cause, serious injury to the Community producers concerned. Whilst the Commission procedure for seeking the information deemed necessary from importers, traders, producers, users and exporters is still ongoing, no conclusion may be drawn at the present stage of the investigation. 
On 23 December 2005, Poland withdrew its request for safeguard measures. The withdrawal of the request coincided with the lodging of an anti-dumping complaint made on 5 December 2005, against imports of the same product originating in China. 
Considering that the request for safeguard measures has been withdrawn and taking into account the outcome of the consultation with the Member States, the Commission sees no reason to further pursue the present investigation. The safeguard investigation concerning imports of frozen strawberries, initiated on 6 July 2005, shall hereby be terminated.
