Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
concerning the conclusion of an Agreement between the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the European Community on market access 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
On 9 October 2004, the European Community concluded bilateral negotiations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam regarding its accession to the WTO. The results provide important commitments on both goods and services of benefit to EC business. The Vietnamese government also expressed its interest in pursuing an “early harvest agreement” which would bring forward the implementation of certain commitments in the interest of both partners. 
On 3 December 2004, representatives of the Commission and of the Vietnamese government initialled the enclosed Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Vietnam. 
The Agreement provides for the following undertakings by Vietnam: 
- Vietnam commits to reduce its customs duties for EC imports of yarns to 5%. 
- Vietnam commits to reduce its customs duties for EC imports of wines and spirits to 65%. 
- Vietnam commits to provide treatment no less favourable to EC investors and service providers than that provided to US investors and service providers on the basis of the provisions of US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement. 
- Vietnam commits to provide treatment no less favourable to EC investors than that provided to Japanese investors through the Japan-Vietnam Bilateral Investment Agreement. 
- Vietnam will introduce a number of liberalisation measures in other sectors: 
- From 1.1.2005, it will allow EC operators to invest in the sector of cement and clinker production on the same terms as Vietnamese industry. 
- From 1.1.2005, it will allow existing EC operators in the telecommunications sector, currently operating in Vietnam on the basis of Business Co-operation Contracts with Vietnamese operators, to have the option either to renew current arrangements or to convert them into another form of establishment, under conditions no less favourable than those they currently enjoy. 
- From 1.1.2005, it will remove all restrictions regarding the customers to whom existing European Community suppliers of computer services, construction services, engineering, integrated engineering, architectural services and urban planning services, currently operating in Vietnam, may provide these services. 
- From 1.1.2005, European Community operators may be granted licences to establish 100% European Community-owned enterprises in Vietnam to provide computer services, construction services, engineering, integrated engineering, architectural services and urban planning services, without restrictions on the customers to whom these services are provided. 
- From 1.1.2005, it will issue 4 licences to European Community pharmaceutical firms allowing them to carry out toll manufacturing in Vietnam without requiring the transfer of licenses to Vietnamese partners, while also retaining any existing authorization which they may have to market the imported products. 
- From 1.1.2005, it will permit joint ventures to be established between European Community companies and Vietnamese partners in order to invest in construction of office buildings and apartments for sale and lease, without a limitation on the European Community capital contribution. 
- By 31.3.2005, it will provide one licence to a European Community distributor to establish a 100% European Community-owned enterprise in Vietnam. 
- By 31.03.2005, it will issue an additional life insurance licence to a European Community firm. 
- By 31.03.2005, European Community shipping lines will be authorised to enter into joint ventures with Vietnamese partners with 51% EC capital contribution. 
- By 31.03.2005, one European Community shipping line will be authorised to establish a 100% European Community invested enterprise to carry out all activities for its shipping line, which is currently not permitted for non-Vietnamese firms. 
- By 31.03.2005, it will grant a licence to one European Community service supplier to provide computer reservation system services in Vietnam. 
- By 31.03.2005, it will introduce a tariff quota for the import of motorbikes and scooters of EC origin, while ensuring that at least 50% of this quota is allocated specifically to agents officially authorised by European Community manufacturers. 
- By 31.12.04, the list of pharmaceutical molecules which are prohibited from being imported into Vietnam will be reduced to a maximum of 7. By 31.12.2005, this list will be completely abolished for European Community manufacturers. 
- During the period of 2005-2006, a total of 3 licences will be granted to European Community suppliers of environmental services to operate in Vietnam as 100% European Community-owned enterprises, for the purpose of providing environmental services, in the following sub-sectors: cleaning services of exhaust gases, noise abatement, refuse disposal services, sewage services. 
- It will permit those European Community distributors which are already legally operating in Vietnam to open a maximum of 4 additional stores between them during 2005, and two further stores in 2006. 
- During 2006, one licence will be allocated to a European Community distributor to operate in Vietnam as a 100% European Community-owned enterprise. 
In exchange, the EC will suspend all textile and clothing quotas currently imposed on Vietnam. The intention is to allow Vietnam to enjoy equivalent treatment to existing WTO members and to compete on the same basis. 
The Agreement contains provisions according to which the EC can re-impose the textile quotas in the case that Vietnam does not comply with its obligations. 
The Agreement takes into account the termination of the ATC agreement and the capacity of other important WTO members in this sector, hence the suspension of quotas for Vietnam is not expected to have a significant negative impact on the interests of the European textile and clothing sector.
