THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine [1], and in particular Annex A (II) (7) and Annex D (I) (E) thereto, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals [2], and in particular Annex A, Chapter 1, point II thereto, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 93/52/EEC of 21 December 1992 recording the compliance by certain Member States or regions with the requirements relating to brucellosis (B. melitensis) and according them the status of a Member State or region officially free of the disease [3] lists the regions of Member States which are recognised as officially free of brucellosis (B. melitensis) in accordance with Directive 91/68/EEC. 
(2) In the Regions of Marche and Piemonte, at least 99,8 % of the ovine or caprine holdings are officially brucellosis-free holdings. In addition, those Regions have undertaken to comply with certain other conditions laid down in Directive 91/68/EEC concerning random checks to be carried out following recognition of the concerned provinces as brucellosis-free. 
(3) The Regions of Marche and Piemonte should therefore be recognised as officially free of brucellosis (B. melitensis) as regards ovine or caprine holdings. 
(4) The lists of regions of Member States declared free of bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and enzootic bovine leukosis are set out in Commission Decision 2003/467/EC of 23 June 2003 establishing the official tuberculosis, brucellosis and enzootic-bovine-leukosis free status of certain Member States and regions of Member States as regards bovine herds [4]. 
(5) Italy submitted to the Commission documentation demonstrating compliance with the appropriate conditions provided for in Directive 64/432/EEC as regards the provinces of Alessandria, Asti, Biella, Novara, Verbania and Vercelli in the Region of Piemonte in order that those provinces may be declared officially free of brucellosis as regards bovine herds. 
(6) Italy also submitted to the Commission documentation demonstrating compliance with the appropriate conditions provided for in Directive 64/432/EEC as regards the Region of Piemonte in order that this Region may be declared officially free of enzootic bovine leukosis as regards bovine herds. 
(7) Following evaluation of the documentation submitted by Italy, the provinces of Alessandria, Asti, Biella, Novara, Verbania and Vercelli in the Region of Piemonte should be declared officially free of bovine brucellosis and the Region of Piemonte should be declared officially free of enzootic bovine leukosis. 
(8) Decisions 93/52/EEC and 2003/467/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
