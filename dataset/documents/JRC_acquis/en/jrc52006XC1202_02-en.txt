Title of aid scheme : Programme d'appui à la création et à la transmission des exploitations en agriculture (PACTE-agriculture): volet investissements matériels — (PACTE-agriculture: aid programme for the creation and transfer of agricultural holdings, material investment 
Articles 4 et 8 du règlement (CE) no 1/2004 de la Commission 
Articles 4 à 9 du règlement (CE) no 1257/1999 du Conseil 
Articles 9.2.4, 9.2.5 et 9.3.2 du plan de développement rural national (décision de la Commission C 3948 du 7 octobre 2004) 
Aide N 184/2003 — France: programme pour l'installation et le développement des initiatives locales (PIDIL)

Délibération no 01.24 du Conseil régional du 22 juillet 2005 
Annual expenditure planned under the scheme : EUR 670000 
The aid scheme will take the form of overall support for set-up plans submitted by candidates — whether outside or within a farming family structure (duly substantiated [1]) — who are setting up their first holding, are under 40, already have or are in the process of acquiring the requisite professional capacity, and who are submitting a viable plan in the Languedoc-Roussillon region. 
PACTE-agriculture requires signature of a global installation contract, which includes, in particular, 
aid of 30 % for investments over EUR 15000 excluding tax up to a ceiling of EUR 4600 
a repayable advance of 35 % for investments under EUR 15000 
Technical and financial monitoring is implemented across the board. 
Date of implementation : Following acknowledgement of receipt by the European Commission. 
Duration of scheme : Unlimited, subject to budget resources 
Objective of aid : 
The objective is, in accordance with Articles 4 and 8 of the Regulation (EC) No 1/2004, to encourage the creation of small and medium agricultural enterprises in the region by young farmers starting up. The region hopes in this way to ease the generational transition in agriculture by maintaining the number of active farmers and thus boosting the local economy. With agriculture employing 6 % of the working population in the area, it is an economic sector to be sustained and developed. PACTE-agriculture will support competitiveness in rural areas and will therefore contribute to maintaining and creating jobs in these areas. 
The investment section of PACTE-agriculture aims to sustain the financial start-up of holdings by allowing investment in heavy equipment necessary for installation purposes. 
PACTE-agriculture's conditions of access are defined by the national criteria for access to installation aid. In this way, assistance from the State and the Regional Council will be harmonised. 
For investment aid over EUR 15000 the conditions outlined in scheme N 184/2003 notified by France will be respected. 
Material investments less than EUR 15000 are key to installation and designed to improve working conditions on the holding. Aid will take the form of a repayable advance, of which the grant equivalent will be at most EUR 190. Failure to repay the advance will lead to the regional authority ordering full repayment of aid received under PACTE-agriculture. 
Systematic checking of each application is implemented with the DDAFs (Departmental Agriculture and Forestry Directorates) in order to avoid any double-funding, in particular for investment aid. In this way, if an investment aid application is made to the State for an amount higher than 15000 under the PIDIL programme, any application for an equivalent amount of aid under PACTE-agriculture will be rejected, and vice versa. 
Sectors(s) concerned : All of the candidates for installation in the Languedoc-Roussillon region, all areas and all production sectors.

[1] The relevant situation is that before the holding is taken over. If the farm has not attained the viability criteria before this but the candidate demonstrates that modernisation/adaptation/enlargement will allow these criteria to be achieved within three years, viability will be deemed to be achievable.
