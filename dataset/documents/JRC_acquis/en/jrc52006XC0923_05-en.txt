Report from the Commission on food irradiation for the year 2003 
Report from the Commission on food irradiation for the year 2003 
(2006/C 230/07) 
SUMMARY 
According to Article 7 (3) of Directive 1999/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation, the Member States shall forward to the Commission every year 
- the results of checks carried out in the irradiation facilities, in particular regarding the categories and quantities of products treated and the dose administered and 
- the results of checks carried out at the product marketing stage and the methods used to detect irradiated foods. 
In 2003, irradiation facilities had approval in eight Member States. All Member States except two provided the information requested with respect to food categories treated, quantities or doses. 
In 2003, eleven Member States performed checks on foods placed on the market, whereas 4 did not perform analytical checks during the period covered. In total, about 5600 food samples have been checked in 2003. About 2,1 % of products (without dietary supplements) on the market were found to be irradiated and not labelled. These products are herbs and spices or compound foods containing herbs and spices, frog legs, aquatic animal products, mushrooms, fresh fruits, tea, coffee, sauces and similar products. In 2003, special attention was brought to dietary supplements. It showed that this category of products should be particularly monitored — as 16 % of the products checked had been found irradiated. 
On the basis of the available information, the Commission concludes that overall the situation has not changed much compared to 2002 even if the number of Member States carrying out controls has increased. 
1. LEGAL BASIS AND BACKGROUND 
According to Article 7 (3) of Directive 1999/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning foods and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation [1], the Member States shall forward to the Commission every year: 
the results of checks carried out in the irradiation facilities, in particular regarding the categories and quantities of products treated and the dose administered 
and 
the results of checks carried out at the product marketing stage and the methods used to detect irradiated foods. 
The Commission has to publish the results in annual reports in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This report covers the period from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2003. 
Information on general aspects of food irradiation is available on the website of the Directorate-General Health and Consumer Protection of the European Commission [2]. 
1.1. Irradiation facilities 
According to Article 3 (2) of Directive 1999/2/EC food may only be irradiated in approved irradiation facilities. For facilities in the EU, approval is given by the competent authorities of the Member States [2]. The Member States have to inform the Commission about their approved irradiation facilities (Article 7 (1)). 
The list of authorised facilities in the Member States has been published by the Commission [3]. 
1.2. Irradiated foods 
The irradiation of dried aromatic herbs, spices and vegetable seasonings is authorised in the EU (Directive 1999/3/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 February 1999 on the establishment of a Community list of food and food ingredients treated with ionising radiation [4]). In addition, five Member States have notified that they maintain national authorisations for certain foods in accordance with Article 4 (4) of Directive 1999/2/EC. The list of national authorisations has been published by the Commission [5]. 
According to Article 6 of Directive 1999/2/EC, any irradiated food or any irradiated food ingredient of a compound food must be labelled with the words %quot%irradiated%quot% or %quot%treated with ionising radiation%quot%. 
For the enforcement of the correct labelling or to detect non-authorised products, several analytical methods have been standardised by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), following a mandate given by the European Commission.

3.4. Denmark 
In 2003 the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DFVA) examined herbal food supplements and herbal raw materials for food supplements. A total of 106 samples were taken from manufacturers and importers in Denmark. The results of analysis showed that 11 of them had been irradiated or contained irradiated ingredients. Another four showed signs of a minor ingredient that had been irradiated. None of the products examined bore a label mentioning irradiation. 
In addition, Danish undertakings are themselves obliged to carry out checks to ensure that the rules are complied with. Their self-monitoring activities are verified by the DVFA through documentary checks. 
In 2003, as in previous years, regular microbiological tests were also carried out on foodstuffs marketed in Denmark. However, the results gave no reason to suspect irradiation, and for this reason no samples were collected for analysis.

3.5. Spain 
No analytical checks were performed in 2003. 
3.6. Finland 
There are two food authorities carrying out checks on the irradiation of foods: 
- The National Food Agency in Finland included checks on the irradiation of foods at the product marketing stage in its programme for the official control of foodstuffs for the year 2003. The checks focused on seafood products. Altogether 30 samples of seafood products were analysed. No samples were found to contain irradiated material. 
- The checks carried out by the Customs authorities focused on dried spices and herbs. A total of 141 samples of dried spices and herbs were analysed. Three spice samples were found to contain irradiated material. None of the three positive samples were adequately labelled.

3.7. France 
As part of the control of units, a request was systematically made for an investigation to be carried out at the customers that used treated foodstuffs, in order to check compliance with the provisions on the labelling of ionised foodstuffs. 
A confectioner using ionised nuts and two enterprises using ionised mechanically recovered meat without mentioning this on the label were given formal notice to change their labelling. 
No sampling of foodstuffs was carried out for 2003 at the product marketing stage in order to look for treatment with ionising radiation. 
3.8. Greece 
17 samples were taken and checked at the border. One sample of cocoa was found to be irradiated.

3.12. The Netherlands 
Samples were taken in retail shops on the market. All analysis were carried out in the laboratory of the Inspectorate of Health Protection in Zutphen. In 2003, according to a planned programme 700 samples were taken and analysed according to the methods mentioned in the table. From these 700 samples, 37 samples proved to be irradiated. None of the irradiated samples were labelled as such. As a result, the producers received an official report for the offences. The results of all the analyses of the different products and the methods used are shown in table.

3.14. Sweden 
To uphold the knowledge of the method for analysis the National Food Administration Sweden has performed a control on irradiated food. During the year 2003 seven samples were taken. Five samples were taken in shops selling meat, mainly meat from birds, and two samples of cheese. The method used to analyse irradiated food is the method in European standard EN 1784. 
The seven samples analysed were not irradiated. 
3.15. The United Kingdom 
The Food Standards Agency is aware of 415 products that were sampled by local enforcement authorities in 2003 and analysed using standardised detection tests for irradiated food. Of these 415 samples, 44 were found to be irradiated. It should be noted that 25 samples are reported as %quot%inconclusive%quot% because they were identified as intermediate using CEN method EN13751:2002 and are inconclusive because they were not analysed further. 
Irradiated dietary supplements were found on sale in the UK. Thirteen of the twenty-nine irradiated dietary supplements contained an irradiated component. In three of these thirteen, the irradiated component was minor and the irradiated ingredient was estimated at less than a few percent of the total product.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
4.1. Results of checks carried out in the irradiation facilities 
Directive 1999/2/EC requires the Member States to inform the Commission about results of checks in irradiation facilities, about the categories and quantities of foods irradiated and about the average doses applied. 
In 2003, irradiation facilities had approval in eight Member States. All Member States except Italy and Denmark, were the facility has ceased irradiation activities during 2003, provided the information requested with respect to food categories treated, quantities or doses. 
The notified amount of foods irradiated in the EU during 2003 is 17164 tonnes. 
4.2. Results of checks carried out at the product marketing stage 
In 2003, 11 Member States performed analytical checks and submitted the requested data. Four Member States did not perform analytical checks during the period covered by the present report. Spain, Italy and Luxembourg have no analytical capability and France decided to perform no analytical check in 2003. 
The situation in 2003 is similar to 2002. Few products on the market were found to be irradiated and not labelled (3,5 %). As regards dietary supplements, some Member States (DE, DK, IRL, NL et UK) decided to check this sector in particular, because of the high percentage of products found irradiated and not labelled in 2002 (29,5 %). In 2003, 524 samples have been controlled, 82 have been found irradiated (16 %). 
In total, about 5000 food samples have been checked of which about 2,1 % (excluding the irradiated dietary supplements in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands) were irradiated but not labelled. This is an increase of 0,7 % in comparison to 2002. This may be accounted for by a more targeted nature of the sampling and the fact that more Member States do now perform analytical checks. 
4.3. Deadline for the submission of results of checks for the report 2004 
The deadline for the submission of results of checks to the Commission performed in 2004, according to Article 7 (3) of Directive 1999/2/EC, is 30 April 2005.
