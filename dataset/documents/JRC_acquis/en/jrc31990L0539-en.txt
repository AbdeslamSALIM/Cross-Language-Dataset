Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (90/539/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 
thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas poultry, being live animals, and hatching eggs, being animal products, are included in the list of products in Annex II to the Treaty; 
Whereas, in order to ensure the rational development of poultry production, thereby increasing productivity in that sector, certain animal health rules governing intra-Community trade in poultry and hatching eggs must be laid down at Community level; 
Whereas the breeding and rearing of poultry is included in the farming sector; whereas it constitutes a source of income for part of the farming population; 
Whereas disparities as regards animal health conditions in the Member States should be eliminated in order to encourage intra-Community trade in poultry and hatching eggs, thus contributing to the completion of the internal market; 
Whereas, in order to encourage the harmonious development of intra-Community trade, a Community system should be laid down to govern import from third countries; 
Whereas the provisions of this Directive should not, in principle, apply to specific trade such as exhibitions, shows and contests; 
Whereas this Directive should cover trade in quails, pigeons, ducks, pheasants and partridges reared for breeding or consumption; 
Whereas, in view of the nature of modern poultry farming, the best way to promote the harmonious development of intra-Community trade in poultry and hatching eggs is to monitor production establishments; 
Whereas it should be left to the competent authorities of the Member States to approve establishment which satisfy the conditions laid down in this Directive and to ensure that the conditions are applied; 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 of 29 October 1975 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3987/87 (5), provides for the granting of a distinguishing registration number to each production establishment and for the marking of hatching eggs; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1868/77 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1351/87 (7), lays down detailed rules for the application 
of the said Regulation; whereas, for practical reasons, the same criteria for identifying production establishments and marking hatching eggs should be adopted for the purposes of this Directive; 
Whereas, in order to be the subject of intra-Community trade, poultry and hatching eggs must satisfy certain animal health requirements, so as to avoid the spread of contagious diseases; 
Whereas, however, it is appropriate to postpone laying down the control rules applicable to combating avian influenza and Newcastle disease; 
Whereas transport conditions should be laid down for the same reason; 
Whereas provision should be made for allowing the Commission to approve certain additional requirements in the light of the progress made by a Member State in eradicating certain poultry diseases, provided that those requirements in no case exceed those applied nationally by the Member State concerned; whereas, in this context, it could prove desirable to determine the status of the Member States or regions thereof with regard to certain diseases likely to affect poultry; 
Whereas, although intra-Community trade transactions in very small quantities cannot, for practical reasons, be subject to all the Community requirements, certain essential rules should be complied with; 
Whereas, to ensure that the prescribed requirements are satisfied, provision must be made for the issue by an official veterinarian of a health certificate to accompany the poultry and hatching eggs to their destination; 
Whereas, in respect of the organization of, and the follow-up to, the checks to be carried out by the Member State of destination and the safeguard measures to be implemented, reference should be made to the general rules laid down in Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (8); 
Whereas provision should be made for checks to be carried out by the Commission in cooperation with the competent authorities of Member States; 
Whereas defining Community arrangements applicable to imports from third countries requires a list to be drawn up of third countries or parts of third countries from which poultry and hatching eggs may be imported; 
Whereas the choice of these countries must be based on criteria of a general nature such as the state of health of the 
poultry and other livestock, the organization and powers of the veterinary services and the health regulations in force; 
Whereas, in addition, importation of poultry and hatching eggs should not be authorized from countries which are infected with contagious poultry diseases presenting a risk to Community livestock or which have been free from such diseases for too short a period; 
Whereas the general conditions applicable to importation from third countries must be supplemented by special conditions drawn up on the basis of the health situation in each of them; whereas, owing to the technical nature and the diversity of the criteria on which these special conditions depend, recourse must be had, in order to define them, to the Standing Veterinary Committee; 
Whereas the presentation of a standard form of certificate upon importation of poultry and hatching eggs constitutes an effective means of verifying that the Community rules are being applied; whereas such rules may include special provisions which may vary according to the third country concerned; whereas this must be taken into account in drawing up the standard forms of certificate; 
Whereas Commission veterinary experts should be responsible for verifying that the rules are observed in third countries; 
Whereas the checks carried out upon importation must cover the origin and the state of health of the poultry and hatching eggs; 
Whereas Member States must be allowed, on the arrival of poultry and hatching eggs in the territory of the Community and during transit to their place of destination, to take all measures, including slaughter and disposal, required for the purpose of safeguarding public and animal health; 
Whereas the rules and general principles governing checks on poultry and hatching eggs will be determined later as part of the measures to be taken to bring about the internal market; 
Whereas every Member State must have the right to place an immediate prohibition on imports from a third country when such imports may be dangerous for human and animal health; whereas, in such a case, coordination of the attitudes of the Member States with regard to that third country must be ensured without delay, without prejudice to possible amendments to the list of countries authorized to export to the Community; 
Whereas the constant development of poultry-rearing techniques means that periodic changes in the methods of poultry-disease control will have to be made; 
Whereas the provisions of this Directive should be revised in connection with the completion of the internal market; 
Whereas provision should be made for a procedure establishing close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Veterinary Committee, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER III Disease surveillance programme 
Without prejudice to health measures and to Articles 13 and 14, disease surveillance programmes must, as a minimum, comprise surveillance of the infections and species listed below. 
A. Salmonella pullorum, Salmonella gallinarum and Salmonella arizonae infections 
1. Species concerned 
(a) S. pullorum et gallinarum: fowls, turkeys, guinea fowls, quails, pheasants, partridges and ducks. 
(b) 
S. arizonae: turkeys. 
2. Disease surveillance programme 
(a) Serological and/or bacteriological tests must be used to determine whether an infection is present. 
(b) 
Samples for testing must be taken, as appropriate, from blood, second-grade chicks, down or dust taken from hatchers, swabs taken from the walls of the hatchery, litter or water from a drinker. 
(c) 
When blood samples are taken from a flock for serological testing for S. pullorum or S. arizonae, prevalence of infection in the country concerned and its past incidence in the establishment must be allowed for in determining the number of samples to be taken. 
Flocks must be inspected during each laying period at the best time for detecting the disease. 
B. 
Mycoplasma gallisepticum and Mycoplasma meleagridis infections 
1. Species concerned 
(a) Mycoplasma gallisepticum: fowls and turkeys. 
(b) 
Mycoplasma meleagridis: turkeys. 
2. Disease surveillance programme 
(a) Presence of infection must be tested by serological and/or bacteriological testing and/or by the presence of air sacculitis lesions in day-old chicks and turkey poults. 
(b) 
Samples for testing must be taken, as appropriate, from blood, day-old chicks and turkey poults, sperm, or swabs taken from the trachea, the cloaca or air sacs. 
(c) 
Tests for detecting M. gallisepticum or M. meleagridis must be performed on a representative sample in order to allow continous surveillance of the infection during rearing and laying, i.e. just before the start of laying and every three months thereafter. 
C. 
Results and measures to be taken 
If there are no reactors, the test is deemed negative. Otherwise, the flock is suspect and the measures specified in Chapter IV must be applied to it. 
D. 
In the case of holdings which consist of two or more separate production units, the competent veterinary authority may derogate from these measures as regards healthy production units on a holding which is infected provided that the authorized veterinarian has confirmed that the structure and size of these production units and the operations carried out there are such that the production units provide completely separate facilities for housing, keeping and feeding, so that the disease in question cannot spread from one production unit to another. 
CHAPTER IV Criteria for suspending or withdrawing approval of an establishment 
1. Approval granted to an establishment must be suspended: 
(a) when the conditions laid down in Chapter II are no longer met; 
(b) 
until an investigation appropriate to the disease has been completed: 
- if avian influenza or Newcastle disease are suspected at the establishment, 
- if the establishment has received poultry or hatching eggs from an establishment with suspected or actual infection by avain influenza or Newcastle disease, 
- if contact liable to transmit the infection has occurred between the establishment and the site of an outbreak of avian influenza or Newcastle disease; 
(c) 
until such time as new tests are performed, if the results of surveillance carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in Chapters II and III for infection by S. pullorum, S. gallinarum, S. arizonae, M. gallisepticum or M. meleagridis give cause to suspect infection; 
(d) 
until completion of the appropriate measures required by the official veterinarian, if the establishment is found not to conform with the requirements of Chapter I, paragraph 1 (a), (b) and (c). 
2. Approval must be withdrawn: 
(a) if avian influenza or Newcastle disease occurs at the establishment; 
(b) 
if a second test of an appropriate type confirms the presence of infection by S. pullorum, S. gallinarum, S. arizonae, M. gallisepticum or M. meleagridis; 
(c) 
if, after a second notice served by the official veterinarian, action to bring the establishment into line with the requirements of Chapter I, paragraph 1 (a), (b) and (c), has not been taken. 
3. Conditions for restoring approval: 
(a) if approval has been withdrawn because of an occurrence of avian influenza or Newcastle disease, it may be restored 21 days after cleansing and disinfection if sanitary slaughter has been carried out; 
(b) 
if approval has been withdrawn because of infection caused by: 
i(i) Salmonella pullorum et gallinarum, or Salmonella arizonae, it may be restored after negative results have been recorded in two tests performed with an interval of at least 21 days on the establishment and after disinfection following sanitary slaughter of the infected flock; 
(ii) Mycoplasma gallisepticum or Mycoplasma meleagridis, it may be restored after negative results have been recorded in two tests performed on the entire flock with an interval of at least 60 days. 
ANNEX III
