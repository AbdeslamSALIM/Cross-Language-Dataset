2. For cuts of meat, a sample of approximately 2 g of skeletal muscle to be taken, containing little fat and, where possible, near to bones or tendons. 
(c) Method 
1. (i) Complete pools (100 samples at a time) 
Approximately 1 g of sample shall be taken from each of the 100 individual samples from the pigs. The pooled sample is put once through the mincer. 
The minced meat shall be placed in the 3 litre Erlenmeyer flask together with 7 g of pepsin, approximately 2 litres of tap-water heated to about 40 to 41 °C and 25 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture shall be shaken to dissolve the pepsin. 
The pH of the solution will be about 1,5 to 2. 
- For digestion, the Erlenmeyer flask shall be incubated at 40 to 41 °C for approximately four hours. The flask shall be regularly shaken during the time of incubation, at least twice every hour. 
- The digested solution shall be filtered through the sieve into the conical 2 litre separation funnel and left undisturbed on the stand for at least one hour. 
- A total volume of approximately 45 ml should be run off into a measuring cylinder and divided between three Petri dishes, the bottoms of which should be marked off into squares, with 15 ml in each dish. 
- Each Petri dish shall be minutely examined for larval trichinae under the stereo-microscope. 
- Where larval counting basins are employed, the 45 ml shall be distributed between two larval counting basins and examined under the trichinoscope. 
The larvae appear as identifiable organisms in the deposit and often, when the water is lukewarm, rolling and unrolling movements of the %quot%spiral%quot% may be observed. 
- Digests should be examined as soon as they are ready. Under no circumstances should examination be postponed until the following day. 
If the digests are unclear or not examined within 30 minutes of their preparation, they should be clarified as follows. The final sample of 45 ml is poured into a measuring cylinder and allowed to stand for 10 minutes. At the end of this time, 30 ml of supernatant fluid is removed by suction and the remaining 15 ml is made up to 45 ml with tap-water. After a further settling period of 10 minutes, 30 ml of supernatant fluid is removed by suction and the remaining 15 ml is poured into a Petri dish or larval counting basin for examination. The measuring cylinder should be washed with 10 ml of tap-water and these washings should be added to the sample in the Petri dish or larval counting basin for examination. 
(ii) Pools of less than 100 samples 
Up to 15 single samples could be added to a total pool of 100 samples and be examined together with these samples. If more than 15 samples and less than 100 samples are examined, the digestion fluid should be reduced proportionately. 2. In the case of a positive or doubtful result following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above. The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above. In this way samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined. When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above.'

(c) Method 
1. Digestion procedure 
(i) Complete pools (100 samples at a time) 
- The Stomacher Lab-blender 3 500 should be fitted with a double plastic bag and the temperature control set at 40 to 41 °C 
- One and a half litres of water preheated to about 32 to 35 °C is poured into the inner plastic bag and the water heated to 40 to 41 °C. 
- 25 ml of 17,5 % hydrochloric acid is then added to the water in the Stomacher. 
- 100 samples of approximately 1 g each (at 25 to 30 °C) taken from each of the individual samples, in accordance with (b), are then added. 
- 6 g pepsin is finally added. This order of addition should be strictly adhered to in order to avoid decomposition of the pepsin. 
- The Stomacher is then allowed to pound the content of the bag for 25 minutes. 
- The pastic bag is then removed from the Stomacher and the digestion fluid is filtered through the sieve into a 3 litre beaker. 
- The plastic bag is washed with approximately 100 ml of water, which is then used to rinse the sieve and finally added to the filtrate in the beaker. 
Up to 15 single samples could be added to a total pool of 100 samples and be examined together with these samples. 
(ii) Smaller pools less than 100 samples 
- The Stomacher Lab-blender 3 500 should be fitted with a double plastic bag and the temperature control set at 40 to 41 °C. 
- A digestion fluid is prepared by mixing about one and a half litres of water and 25 ml of 17,5 % hydrochloric acid. 6 g of pepsin is added and the whole mixed at a temperature of 40 to 41 °C. This order of addition should be strictly adhered to in order to avoid decomposition of the pepsin. 
- Of the digestion fluid, a volume corresponding to 15 ml per gram of sample is measured (e.g. for 30 samples the volume required is 30 × 15 ml or 450 ml) and transferred to the inner of the two plastic bags together with the meat samples of approximately 1 g (at 25 to 30 °C) taken from each of the individual samples in accordance with (b). 
- Water at a temperature of approximately 41 °C is poured into the outer bag to a total volume in the two bags of one and a half litres. 
- The Stomacher is then allowed to pound the content of the bag for 25 minutes. 
- The plastic bag is then removed from the Stomacher and the digestion fluid is filtered through the sieve into a 3 litre beaker. 
- The plastic bag is washed with approximately 100 ml of water, which is then used to rinse the sieve and finally added to the filtrate in the beaker. 
2. Recovery of larvae by sedimentation 
- Ice (300 to 400 g of ice flakes, scaly ice or crushed ice) is added to the digestion fluid, bringing its volume up to about 2 litres. The digestion fluid is then stirred until the ice has melted. 
In the case of smaller pools (see 1 (ii)), the amount of ice should be reduced correspondingly. 
- The chilled digestion fluid is transferred to a 2 litre separation funnel, equipped with a vibrator in an extra clamp. - Sedimentation for 30 minutes, during which time the sedimentation funnel is vibrated intermittently, i.e. one minute vibration followed by one minute pause. 
- After 30 minutes, a 60 ml sample of the sediment is quickly run off into a 100 ml measuring cylinder. (The funnel is rinsed with detergent solution after use). 
- The 60 ml sample is allowed to stand for at least 10 minutes, after which time the supernatant should be withdrawn by suction, leaving a volume of 15 ml to be examined for the presence of larvae. 
- For suction, a disposable syringe can be used, equipped with a plastic tube. 
The length of the tube should be such that 15 ml will remain in the measuring cylinder when the flanges of the syringe rest on the cylinder's rim. 
- The remaining 15 ml is poured into a larval counting basin or two Petri dishes and examined using a trichinoscope or stereo-microscope respectively. 
- Digests should be examined as soon as they are ready. Under no circumstances should examination be postponed until the following day. 
If the digests are unclear, or are not examined within 30 minutes of their preparation, they should be clarified as follows. The final sample of 60 ml is poured into a measuring cylinder and allowed to stand for 10 minutes. At the end of this time, 45 ml of supernatant fluid is removed by suction and the remaining 15 ml is made up to 45 ml with tap-water. After a further settling period of 10 minutes, 30 ml of supernatant fluid is removed by suction and the remaining 15 ml is poured into a Petri dish or larval counting basin for examination. The measuring cylinder should be washed with 10 ml of tap-water and these washings should be added to the sample in the Petri dish or the larval counting basin for examination. 
3. In the case of a positive or doubtful result, following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above. The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above. In this way, samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined. When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above. 
V. THE MECHANICALLY ASSISTED POOLED SAMPLE DIGESTION METHOD/%quot%ON FILTER ISOLATION%quot% TECHNIQUE 
(a) Apparatus and reagents 
Those indicated in method IV (a). 
Supplementary equipment to the abovementioned: 
- 1 litre Gelman funnel, complete with filter holder (diameter 45 mm), 
- filter discs; the filter discs consist of: 
a circular stainless steel mesh with an aperture of 35 microns (the diameter of the disc should be 45 mm), 
two rubber rings made of 1 mm thick rubber (the external diameter should be 45 mm and the internal diameter 38 mm), 
the circular mesh is placed between the two rubber rings and bonded to them using a two-component glue suitable for the two materials, 
- an Erlenmeyer flask with a capacity of 3 litres and fitted with a side tube for suction, 
- a filter pump, 
- plastic bags with a capacity of at least 80 ml, 
- equipment for sealing the plastic bags, 
- rennilase, strength 1: 150 000 soxhlet units per gram. 
(b) Collection of specimens 
See method IV (b). (c) Method 
1. Digestion procedure 
(i) Complete pools (100 samples at a time) 
See method IV (c) (1) (i). 
(ii) Smaller pools less than 100 samples 
See method IV (c) (1) (ii). 
2. Recovery of larvae by filtration 
- Ice (300 to 400 g of ice flakes, scaly ice or crushed ice) is added to the digestion fluid, bringing its volume up to about 2 litres. 
In the case of smaller pools, the amount of ice should be reduced correspondingly. 
- The digestion fluid is then stirred until the ice has melted. The chilled digestion fluid is then left for at least three minutes to let the larvae coil. 
- The Gelman funnel, fitted with a filter holder and filter disc, is mounted on the Erlenymeyer flask connected to a filter pump. 
- The digestion fluid is poured into the Gelman funnel and filtered. Towards the end of filtration, the passage of the digestion fluid through the filter can be assisted by applying suction with the filter pump. Suction should cease before the filter becomes dry, i.e. when 2 to 5 ml of fluid are left in the funnel. 
- When all the digestion fluid has been filtered, the filter disc is removed and placed in an 80 ml capacity plastic bag, together with 15 to 20 ml of rennilase solution. The solution of rennilase is made by adding 2 g of rennilase to 100 ml of tap-water. 
- The plastic bag is sealed twice and placed in the Stomacher between the inner and outer bag. 
- The Stomacher is allowed to pound for three minutes, e.g. while it is working on a complete or incomplete pool. 
- After three minutes, the plastic bag, complete with filter disc and rennilase solution, is removed from the Stomacher and opened with scissors. The liquid contents are poured into a larval counting basin or Petri dish. The bag is washed out with 5 to 10 ml of water which is then added to the larval counting basin for examination by trichinoscope or to the Petri dish for examination by stereo-microscope. 
- Digests should be examined as soon as they are ready. Under no circumstances should examination be postponed until the following day. 
Note 
Filter discs should never be used when not completely clean. Unclean discs should never be allowed to dry out. 
Filter discs can be cleaned by leaving them in rennilase solution overnight. Before use, they should be washed in fresh rennilase solution using the Stomacher. 
3. In the case of a positive or doubtful result, following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above. The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above. In this way, samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined. When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above.

2. For cuts of meat, a sample of approximately 2 g of skeletal muscle to be taken, containing little fat and, where possible, near to bones or tendons. 
(c) Method 
1. (i) Complete pools (100 samples at a time) 
- 100 samples of approximately 1 g each, taken from each of the individual samples in accordance with (b), are chopped in the Moulinette blender. The blender should be operated three to four times for approximately one second each time. 
- The chopped meat is transferred to a 3 litre beaker and sprinkled with 10 g of pepsin. 2 litres of tap-water, preheated to 46 to 48 °C, is poured into the beaker, together with 16 ml of hydrochloric acid. 
- The mincing insert of the Moulinette blender is immersed repeatedly in the digestion fluid in the beaker to remove any meat still adhering. 
- The stirring rod is placed in the beaker and the beaker is covered with aluminium foil. - The beaker is placed on the preheated heating plate of the magnetic stirrer and the stirring process started. Before starting the stirring process, the magnetic stirrer should be adjusted so that it maintains a constant temperature of 44 to 46 °C throughout the period of operation. During the stirring process, the digestion fluid should rotate at a sufficiently high speed to create a deep whirl without splashing. 
- The digestion fluid is stirred for 30 minutes, at the end of which the stirrer is switched off and the digestion fluid is poured through the sieve into the sedimentation funnel. 
- The digestion fluid is allowed to stand in the funnel for 30 minutes. 
- After 30 minutes, a 40 ml sample of digestion fluid is quickly run off into the measuring cylinder or centrifuge tube. 
- The 40 ml sample is allowed to stand for 10 minutes, at the end of which time 30 ml of supernatant is withdrawn by suction, leaving a volume of 10 ml. 
- The remaining 10 ml sample of sediment is poured into a larval counting basin or Petri dish. 
- Then the cylinder or centrifuge tube is rinsed with about 10 ml of tap-water which has to be added to the sample in the larval counting basin or Petri dish. Subsequently, the sample is examined by trichinoscope or stereo-microscope respectively. 
- Digests should be examined as soon as they are ready. Under no circumstances should examination be postponed until the following day. 
If the digests are not examined within 30 minutes of their preparation, they should be clarified as follows. The final sample of about 40 ml is poured into a measuring cylinder and allowed to stand for 10 minutes, after which time 30 ml of the supernatant fluid is removed leaving a volume of 10 ml. This volume is made up to 40 ml with tap-water. After a further settling period of 10 minutes, 30 ml of the supernatant fluid is withdrawn by suction leaving a volume of 10 ml for examination in a Petri dish or larval counting basin. The measuring cylinder should be washed with 10 ml of tap-water and these washings should be added to the sample in the Petri dish or the larval counting basin for examination. 
If the sediment is found to be unclear on examination, the sample should be poured into a measuring cylinder and made up to 40 ml with tap-water and then the above procedure should be followed. 
(ii) Pools of less than 100 samples 
When needed, up to 15 samples of 1 g each may be added to a total pool of 100 samples and examined together with these samples according to (c) (1) (i). More than 15 samples should be examined as a complete pool. For pools up to 50 samples, the digestion fluid may be reduced to 1 litre. 
2. In the case of a positive or doubtful result following the examination of a collective sample, a further 20 g sample should be taken from each pig in accordance with (b) above. The 20 g samples from five pigs should be pooled and examined by the method described above. In this way samples from 20 groups of five pigs will be examined. When trichinellae are detected in a pooled sample from five pigs, further 20 g samples should be collected from the individual pigs in the group and each should separately be examined using the method described above.'
