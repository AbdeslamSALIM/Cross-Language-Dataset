THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy [1], and in particular Articles 5(c) and 20a(3) thereof,

(3) The frequency of deployment of intermediary marking buoys should be revised by taking account of the specific conditions prevailing in different Community fishing areas. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery and Aquaculture,
