(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2004/37/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(1), and in particular Article 11 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in Serbia and Montenegro to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community. 
(2) The above conditions do not pertain to Kosovo, as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, which is the subject to international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). It is therefore not possible to include the imports of fishery products from Kosovo in this Decision. 
(3) The requirements in the legislation of Serbia and Montenegro on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC. 
(4) In particular, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of the Republic of Montenegro (MAFWM), is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force. 
(5) The MAFWM has provided official assurances regarding compliance with the standards for health controls and monitoring of wild, whole fresh seawater fishery products as set out in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC and regarding the fulfilment of hygienic requirements equivalent to those laid down by that Directive. 
(6) It is appropriate to lay down detailed provisions concerning fishery products imported into the Community from Serbia and Montenegro, in accordance with Directive 91/493/EEC. These provisions should include that only wild, whole fresh seawater fishery products may be authorised for imports into the Community. 
(7) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board certain vessels in accordance with Article 3(1)(a)(i) of Directive 91/493/EEC(2). Those lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the MAFWM to the Commission. 
(8) It is appropriate for this Decision to be applied 45 days after its publication providing for the necessary transitional period. 
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
