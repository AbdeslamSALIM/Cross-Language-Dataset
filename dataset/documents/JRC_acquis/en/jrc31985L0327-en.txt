amending Directive 77/99/EEC on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products 
(85/327/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),

Whereas Chapter II (17) of Annex A to Directive 77/99/EEC lays down in particular that a medical certificate must be required of every person working on fresh meat or meat products and that the certificate must be renewed annually;
