(2) Certain Member States have experienced some technical difficulties when attempting to apply Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001. The Regulation should therefore, for the sake of transparency and in order to avoid confusion, be clarified. 
(3) In particular, the references to suspensive customs procedures pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), and the references to Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should be updated.

(4) Regulation (EEC) No 1788/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The need for adaptation to the amended models of the certificate and of the extract calls for a transitional period during which the previous models may be used. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,
