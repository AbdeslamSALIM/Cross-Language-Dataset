Notice to proposed exporters from the European Union in 2006 of controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council on "substances that deplete the ozone layer" [1] 
(2005/C 168/06) 
This Notice is addressed to undertakings that intend to export the following substances from the European Union during the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2006. 
Group I: | CFC 11, 12, 113, 114 or 115 | 
Group II: | other fully halogenated CFCs | 
Group III: | halon 1211, 1301 or 2402 | 
Group IV: | carbon tetrachloride | 
Group V: | 1,1,1 trichloroethane | 
Group VI: | methyl bromide | 
Group VII: | hydrobromofluorocarbons | 
Group VIII: | hydrochlorofluorocarbons | 
Group IX: | bromochloromethane | 
Exports of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane and hydrobromofluorocarbons and bromochloromethane or products and equipment, other than personal effects containing those substances or whose continuing function relies on the supply of these substances, are prohibited. Note that exceptions to this prohibition are exports of: 
- Controlled substances produced under Article 3(6) to satisfy the Basic Domestic Needs of Parties operating under Article 5(1) of the Montreal Protocol; 
- Controlled substances produced under Article 3(7) to satisfy Essential or Critical Uses; 
- Products and equipment containing controlled substances produced under Article 3(5) or imported under Article 7(b) of the Regulation; 
- Products and equipment containing HCFCs to be exported to countries where the use of HCFCs in such products is still permitted, according to Article 5(5) of the Regulation; 
- Recovered, recycled and reclaimed halon stored for critical uses in facilities authorised or operated by the competent authority to satisfy critical uses listed in Annex VII until 31 December 2009, and products and equipment containing halon to satisfy critical uses listed in Annex VII; 
- Controlled substances to be used for feedstock and processing agent applications; 
- Used products and equipment that contain rigid insulating foam or integral skin foam which have been produced with chlorofluorocarbons. This exemption does not apply to: 
- Refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment and products; 
- Refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment and products which contain chlorofluorocarbons, or whose continuing function relies on the supply of chlorofluorocarbons used as refrigerants, in other equipment and products; 
- Building insulation foam and products. 
Under Article 4(2), production and import of methyl bromide for non-QPS uses is prohibited. 
Under Article 11(2), export of: 
- Methyl bromide to any state not party to the Protocol is prohibited. 
Under Article 11(3), export of: 
- Hydrochlorofluorocarbons to any State not Party to the Protocol is prohibited from 1 January 2004, unless the Party meets the criteria set out in Decision XV/3 of the Montreal Protocol. 
Article 12 requires the authorisation of exports of the substances listed under Groups I to IX of Annex I to this Notice (cf. also Annex I of the Regulation). Such export authorisations should be issued by the European Commission after verification of compliance to Article 11 [2]. 
For the purposes of the Regulation, quantities are measured in ODP kilograms to reflect the ozone-depleting potential of the substance [3]. 
A user that wishes to export controlled substances listed under Group I to IX of Annex 1 of this Notice for the period from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2006, should make itself known to the European Commission, preferably no later than 2 September 2005.

Other applicants that have been issued with an export authorisation in 2005 should complete and submit the relevant form(s) according to the export substance(s) on the ODS website http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/ods/index.htm in order to receive an Export Authorisation Number (EAN). 
A copy of the application should also be sent to the competent authority of the Member State (cf. Annex II). 
An EAN will be provided and the applicant notified providing the application meets the eligibility criteria for an Export Authorisation Number. A user may export the controlled substances listed in Annex I to this Notice during the course of 2006 only if it is in possession of an EAN issued by the European Commission. The European Commission reserves the right to withhold issuing an EAN where it is not satisfied with the information provided.

[2] Amended by Regulation (EC) 1804/2003, published in OJ L 265 of 16 October 2003, p. 1. 
[3] For mixtures: only the quantity of the controlled substances in the mixture should be included in the quantity. 1,1,1-trichloroethane is always put on the market with stabilisers. Exporters should establish from their supplier what is the percentage of stabiliser to be deducted before calculating the weighted tonnage.
