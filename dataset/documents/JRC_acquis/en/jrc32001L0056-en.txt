Directive 2001/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 relating to heating systems for motor vehicles and their trailers, amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Council Directive 78/548/EEC 
Directive 2001/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 27 September 2001 
relating to heating systems for motor vehicles and their trailers, amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Council Directive 78/548/EEC 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 78/548/EEC of 12 June 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to heating systems for the passenger compartment of motor vehicles(4) was adopted as one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5). Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 78/548/EEC. 
(2) In particular, under Article 3(4) and Article 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC each separate directive is to be accompanied by an information document incorporating the relevant items of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI thereto in order that type-approval may be computerised. 
(3) In the light of technical progress, combustion heaters, usually fuelled by diesel, petrol or liquefied petroleum gas, are now fitted to many types of vehicle in order to provide heat for the passenger compartment (e.g. of buses), the load area (e.g. of trucks and trailers) or the sleeping compartment (e.g. of trucks and motor caravans) so that heat can be provided efficiently and without the noise and gaseous emissions associated with running the propulsion engine when the vehicle is parked. For reasons of safety, it is necessary to extend the scope to include requirements for combustion heaters, and for their installation. Such requirements should correspond to the highest standards consistent with current technology. 
(4) It is necessary to provide for type-approval for combustion heaters as components and for vehicles in which a combustion heater is installed. 
(5) It will be necessary to supplement this Directive with additional safety requirements for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) combustion heaters by the addition of an Annex. 
(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6). 
(7) For reasons of clarity it is advisable to repeal Directive 78/548/EEC and replace it by this Directive,

ANNEX IV 
TEST PROCEDURE FOR AIR QUALITY 
1. In the case of complete vehicles the following test shall be carried out: 
1.1. Operate the heater for one hour at maximum output in conditions of still air (wind speed %amp%lt;= 2 m/s), with all windows closed and, in the case of a combustion heater, the propulsion engine switched off. If, however, having selected the maximum output the heater switches off automatically in less than an hour, the measurements may be made before switch-off. 
1.2. The proportion of CO in the ambient air shall be measured by taking samples from: 
(a) a point outside the vehicle as close as possible to the heating air inlet, and 
(b) a point inside the vehicle less than 1 m from the heated air outlet. 
1.3. Readings shall be taken for a representative time of 10 minutes. 
1.4. The reading from position (b) shall be less than 20 ppm CO higher than from position (a). 
2. In the case of combustion heaters as components the following test shall be carried out after the tests of Annexes V, VI and item 1.3 of Annex VII. 
2.1. The primary circuit of the heat exchanger shall be subjected to a leakage test to ensure that polluted air cannot enter the heated air intended for the passenger compartment. 
2.2. This requirement shall be considered to be fulfilled if, at a gauge pressure of 0,5 hPa, the leakage rate from the heat exchanger is %amp%lt;= 30 dm3/h. 
ANNEX V 
TEST PROCEDURE FOR TEMPERATURE 
1. Operate the heater for one hour at maximum output in conditions of still air (wind speed %amp%lt;= 2 m/s), with all windows closed. If, however, having selected the maximum output the heater switches off automatically in less than an hour, the measurements may be made earlier. If the heated air is drawn from outside the vehicle the test shall be carried out at an ambient temperature of not less than 15o C. 
2. The surface temperature of any part of the heating system likely to come into contact with the driver of the vehicle during normal road use shall be measured with a contact thermometer. No such part or parts shall exceed a temperature of 70 ¬∞C for uncoated metal or 80 ¬∞C for other materials.

3.1. In the case of vehicles of categories M1 and N, no part of the system likely to come into contact with seated passengers during normal road use of the vehicle, with the exception of the outlet grille, shall exceed a temperature of 110 ¬∞C. 
3.2. In the case of vehicles of categories M2 and M3, no part of the system likely to come into contact with passengers during normal road use of the vehicle shall exceed a temperature of 70 ¬∞C for uncoated metal or 80 ¬∞C for other materials. 
4. The temperature of the heated air entering the passenger compartment shall not exceed 150 ¬∞C to be measured at the centre of the outlet. 
ANNEX VI 
TEST PROCEDURE FOR EXHAUST EMISSIONS 
1. Operate heater for one hour at maximum output in conditions of still air (wind speed %amp%lt;= 2 m/s) and an ambient temperature of 20 ¬± 10o C. If, however, having selected the maximum output the heater switches off automatically in less than an hour, the measurements may be made before switch-off. 
2. The dry and undiluted exhaust emissions, measured using an appropriate meter, shall not exceed the values indicated in the following table: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
3. The test shall be repeated in conditions equivalent to a vehicle speed of 100 km/h. Under these conditions the CO value must not exceed 0,2 % vol. If the test has been carried out on the heater as a component, then it need not be repeated in the case of the vehicle type in which the heater is installed.

2.7.2. The air outlet must be so positioned or guarded that blocking by rubbish or luggage is unlikely. 
2.8. Automatic control of the heating system 
The heating system must be switched off automatically and the supply of fuel must be stopped within five seconds when the vehicle's engine stops running. If a manual device is already activated, the heating system can stay in operation.
