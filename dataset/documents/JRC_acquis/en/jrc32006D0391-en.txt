amending Decision 2006/346/EC concerning certain protection measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany 
(notified under document number C(2006) 2058) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/391/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever [2] and in particular Article 11(1)(f) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [3], and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Following outbreaks of classical swine fever in Germany, protection and surveillance zones were immediately established around outbreak sites in Germany in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 2001/89/EC. 
(2) In addition, Commission Decision 2006/346/EC of 15 May 2006 concerning certain protection measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany and repealing Decision 2006/274/EC [4] was adopted in order to maintain and extend the measures taken by Germany pursuant to Directive 2001/89/EC. 
(3) The provisions for the use of a health marking on fresh meat are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [5]. However, pursuant to Council Directive 2001/89/EC, that health mark may not be used for marking the fresh meat from pigs originating from a holding located in a surveillance zone. 
(4) Pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive 2002/99/EC, Germany has submitted a request for a derogation concerning the health marking provided for in Directive 2001/89/EC and the use of pigmeat from pigs kept on holdings situated in the surveillance zones established in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and slaughtered, subject to a specific authorisation issued by the competent authority. 
(5) Based on the epidemiological situation as regards classical swine fever in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the pattern of the earlier spread of the disease, the risk of the spread of that disease should not be affected by applying the health marking, laid down in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004, on fresh meat from pigs from a surveillance zone located in certain areas of North Rhine-Westphalia in accordance with the conditions and testing of the pigs laid down in this Decision. It may also be considered that protection from the risk of the spread of that disease should not be affected by marketing the fresh meat without further processing or treatment under those conditions. 
(6) Based on the information provided by Germany, it is appropriate to review protective measures relating to classical swine fever in Germany as regards the duration of the measures in the protection and surveillance zones established around an outbreak site pursuant to Directive 2001/89/EC. 
(7) It is also necessary to reintroduce the prohibition for Member States to send pigs to slaughterhouses in the areas of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany where outbreaks of classical swine fever were notified that was revoked by Decision 2006/346/EC. 
(8) Decision 2006/346/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
