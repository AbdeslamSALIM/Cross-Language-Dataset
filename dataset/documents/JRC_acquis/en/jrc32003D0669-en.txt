THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Decision 97/132/EC of 17 December 1996 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products(1), as last amended by Decision 2002/957/EC(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Annex V to the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (%quot%the Agreement%quot%) recognises the sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand.

(2) Commission Decision 2003/56/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2003/385/EC(4), lays down the certification requirements and provides models for official health certificates to be used for the importation from New Zealand of live animals and animal products.

(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 650/2003(6), provides for special certification requirements for animals and products of animal origin to prevent the spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. 
(4) Annex I to Decision 2003/56/EC should be amended to take into account recent amendments to Regulation (EC) No 650/2003 and to reflect recent further acknowledgements of equivalence of sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand. 
(5) Decision 2003/56/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
