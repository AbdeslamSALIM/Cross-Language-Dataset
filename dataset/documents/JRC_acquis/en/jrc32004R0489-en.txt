of 16 March 2004 
amending Regulation (EC) No 20/2002 laying down detailed rules for implementing the specific supply arrangements for the outermost regions introduced by Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the French overseas departments, amending Directive 72/462/EEC and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 525/77 and (EEC) No 3763/91 (Poseidom)(1), and in particular Article 22 and the second paragraph of Article 26 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Azores and Madeira and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 (Poseima)(2), and in particular Article 34 and the second paragraph of Article 38 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (Poseican)(3), and in particular Article 20 and the second paragraph of Article 24 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 16(1) and Article 17(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 20/2002(4) concern respectively the French overseas departments and the Azores and Madeira and lay down that processors can export processed products containing raw materials that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements in the context of regional trade or dispatch them in the context of traditional trade flows, within annual quantity limits to be set by the Commission. 
(2) The annual maximum quantities that can be exported or dispatched from the French overseas departments and the Azores and Madeira should therefore be fixed in Regulation (EC) No 20/2002. 
(3) Using in particular geographical proximity as the criterion, the third countries to which exports can be sent in the context of regional trade from the French overseas departments and the Azores and Madeira should be established, and the appropriate measures for monitoring such operations and applying the penalties required should be laid down. 
(4) In accordance with Article 16(2), Article 17(2) and Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 20/2002, the authorisation to export or dispatch processed products not containing raw materials that have benefited from the specific supply arrangements is subject to an attestation from the processor. The processor declares in this attestation that the processed products for export or dispatch do not contain raw materials imported or introduced under specific supply arrangements. The penalties for making a false declaration should be laid down. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 20/2002 should therefore be amended. 
(6) The measures laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of all the Management Committees concerned,
