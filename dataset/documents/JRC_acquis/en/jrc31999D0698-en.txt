ANNEX 
FRAMEWORK 
In order to be awarded an eco-label, the portable computer shall comply with the criteria of this Annex, which are aimed at promoting: 
- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of energy (global warming, acidification, depletion of non-renewable resources) by reducing energy consumption, 
- the reduction of environmental damage related to the use of natural resources by encouraging the exchangeability of components, and the recyclability and maintainability of the computer, 
- the reduction of environmental damage or risks related to the use of hazardous substances by reducing the use of such substances. 
Additionally, the criteria encourage the implementation of best practice and enhance the environmental awareness of consumers. 
Furthermore, the marking of plastic components encourages their recycling. 
The Competent Bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex. (Note: 
it is not required to implement such management schemes). 
KEY CRITERIA 
1. Energy savings 
The portable computer shall have a maximum sleep-mode power consumption of 5 W. 
The portable computer shall have a maximum off-mode power consumption of 3 W. 
The default mode-change time from operation to sleep shall be %amp%lt;= 15 minutes of inactivity. The manufacturer must enable this feature, but the user may disable it. 
2. Lifetime extension 
The manufacturer shall offer a commercial guarantee to ensure that the portable computer will function for at least three years. This guarantee shall be valid from the date of delivery to the customer. 
The availability of compatible replacement parts and service shall be guaranteed for five years from the time of shipment. 
In addition, the portable computer shall meet the following criteria. 
1. It shall have a modular design, allowing components to be easily accessible. 
2. Upgradability shall be ensured for the random access memory. Exchangeability shall be ensured for at least the processor, the hard disk and, if available, the CD-ROM drive. The processor may be exchanged by replacing the whole motherboard. 
3. One or more empty slots shall be available. 
BEST PRACTICE CRITERIA 
3. Take-back and recycling 
The manufacturer shall offer, free of charge, the take-back for recycling of the portable computer and the components being replaced, except for items contaminated by users (e.g. in medical or nuclear applications). 
In addition, the portable computer shall meet the following criteria. 
1. One qualified person, alone, shall be able to dismantle it. 
2. The manufacturer shall check the disassembly of the system unit and provide a disassembly report. Among others, the report shall confirm that joints are: 
- easy to find and accessible 
- as standardised as possible 
- accessible with commonly available tools. 
3. Incompatible and hazardous materials shall be separable. 
4. 90 % (by volume) of plastic and metal materials in the housing and chassis shall be technically recyclable. Recycling in this context refers to reuse, material recycling, or chemical recycling (e.g. pyrolysis, gasification). Metallisation of plastic parts is allowed. 
5. If labels are required, they shall be easily separable or inherent. 
6. Plastic parts shall: 
- have not lead or cadmium intentionally added, 
- be of one polymer or compatible polymers, except for the cover, which shall consist of no more than two types of polymers which are separable, 
- contain no metal inlays that cannot be separated. 
7. Plastic parts heavier than 25 g, cables, and plastics for moulding of power supplies, batteries or other peripheral equipment, shall: 
(a) not contain the following flame retardants: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
(b) not contain flame redardant substances or preparations containing substances, that are assigned or may be assigned any of the risk phrases R45 (may cause cancer), R46 (may cause heritable genetic damage), R50 (very toxic to aquatic organisms), R51 (toxic to aquatic organisms), R52 (harmful to aquatic organisms), R53 (may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment), R60 (may impair fertility) or R61 (may cause harm to the unborn child), as defined in Council Directive 67/548/EEC(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 98/98/EC(2); 
(c) have a permanent marking identifying the material, in conformity with ISO 11469. Excluded from this criterion are extruded plastic materials and the light-guide of flat panel displays.
