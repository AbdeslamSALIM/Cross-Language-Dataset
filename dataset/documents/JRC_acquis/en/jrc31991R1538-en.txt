Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1538/91 of 5 June 1991 introducing detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 on certain marketing standards for poultry 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1538/91 of 5 June 1991 introducing detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 on certain marketing standards for poultry 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 of 26 June 1990 on certain marketing standards for poultry (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof, 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 enacted certain marketing standards for poultry, the application of which requires the adoption of provisions concerning in particular the list of those poultry carcases, parts thereof and offals to which the said Regulation applies, classification by conformation, appearance an weight, types of presentation, the indication of the name under which the products in question are to be sold, the optional use of indications concerning chilling methods and the type of farming, conditions for storage and transport of certain types of poultrymeat and the supervision of these provisions in order to ensure their uniform application throughout the Community; 
Whereas, in order to provide for the marketing of poultry in different classes according to conformation and appearance, it is necessary to lay down definitions relating to species, age and presentation in the case of carcases, and anatomical conformation and content in the case of poultry cuts; whereas in the case of the product known as 'Foie gras' the high value and consequent risk of fraudulent practices make it necessary to lay down especially precise minimum marketing standards; 
Whereas it is not necessary for these standards to be applied to certain products and presentations which are of local or otherwise limited importance; whereas, however, names under which such products are sold should not be likely to mislead the consumer to a material degree by causing him to confuse these products with products which are subject to these provisions; whereas, similarly, additional descriptive terms used to qualify the names of such products should also be subject to this provision; 
Whereas storage and handling temperature is of crucial importance to the maintenance of high standards of quality; whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to lay down a minimum temperature at which forzen poultrymeat products are to be kept; 
Whereas the provisions of this Regulation and in particular those relating to surveillance and enforcement must be applied uniformly throughout the Community; whereas detailed rules adopted to those ends must also be uniform; whereas it is therefore necessary to lay down common measures in the matter of sampling procedures and tolerances; 
Whereas it is necessary, both in order that the consumer be provided with sufficient, unequivocal and objective information concerning such products offered for sale, and in order to secure the free movement of such products throughout the Community, to ensure that poultrymeat marketing standards take into account as far as is paracticable the provisions of Council Directive 76/211/EEC of 20 January 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making-up by weight or by volume of certain prepackaged products (2), as amended by Directive 78/891/EEC (3); 
Whereas among the indications which may optionally be ued on the labelling are those concerning the method of chilling and particular types of farming; whereas the use of the latter, in the interest of consumer protection, needs to be subordinated to the respect of closely-defined criteria concerning both husbandry conditions and quantity thresholds for stating certain criteria such as age at slaughter or length of fattening period and content of certain foodstuff ingredients; 
Whereas it is appropriate for the Commission to exercise permanent surveillance of the compatibility with Community law, including the marketing standards, in particular of any national measures adopted in pursuance of these provisions; whereas particular provision should also be made for the registration and regular inspection of undertakings authorized to use terms referring to particular types of farming; whereas such undertakings must therefore be obliged to maintain regular and detailed records for this purpose; 
Whereas, in view of the specialized nature of these inspections, responsibility for them may be delegated by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned, subject to the appropriate supervision and safeguards, to properly qualified and duly licensed outside bodies; 
Whereas operators in third countries may wish to make use of optional indications concerning chilling methods and types of farming; whereas provision should be made for them to do so, subject to appropriate certification by the competent authority of the third country concerned, and which appears on a list established by the Commission; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committe for Poultrymeat and Eggs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: Article 1

- prepackages containing one poultry carcass, or 
- prpackages containing one or several poultry cuts of the same type and species 
as defined in Article 1. 
2. All prepackages shall in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 bear and indication of the weight of the product known as 'nominal weight' which they are required to contain. 
3. Prepackages of frozen or quick-frozen poultrymeat may be classified by categories of nominal weights as follows: 
- carcases %lt% 1 100 g: classes of 50 g (1 100 - 1 050 - 1 000 etc.), 
- carcases %gt% 1 100 g: classes of 100 g (1 100 - 1 200 - 1 300 etc.), 
- cuts: 250 g - 500 g - 750 g - 1 000 g - 1 500 g - 2 000 g - 2 500 g - 3 000 g - 5 000 g. 
4. Prepackages referred to in paragraph 1 shall be made up in such a way that they satisfy the following requirements: 
- the actual contents shall not be less, on average, than the nominal weight, 
- the proportion of prepackages having a negative error greater than the tolerable negative error laid down in paragraphs 9 and 10 shall be sufficiently small for batches of prepackages to satisfy the requirements of the tests specified in paragraph 11, 
- no prepackage having a negative error greater than twice the tolerable negative error given in paragraphs 9 and 10 shall be marketed. 
The definitions of nominal weight, actual content and negative error laid down in Annex I to Directive 76/211/EEC shall apply to this Regulation. 
5. Regarding responsibility of the packer or importer of frozen or quick-frozen poultrymeat and checks to be carried out by competent authorities, points 4,5 and 6 of Annex I to Directive 76/211/EEC apply mutatis mutandis. 
6. The checking of prepackages shall be carried out by sampling and shall be in two parts: 
- a check covering the actual content of each prepackage in the sample, 
- a check on the average actual contents of the prepackages in the sample. 
A batch of prepackages shall be considered acceptable if the results of both these checks satisfy the acceptance criteria referred to in paragraphs 11 and 12. 
7. A batch shall be made up of all the prepackages of the same nominal weight, the same type and the same production rund, packed in the same place, which are to be inspected. 
The batch size shall be limited to the quantities laid down below: 
- when prepackages are checked at the end of the packing line, the number in each batch shall be equal to the maximum hourly output of the packing line, without any restriction as to batch size; 
- in other cases the batch size shall be limited to 10 000. 
8. A sample consisting of the following numbers of prepackages shall be drawn at random from each batch to be inspected: 
Batch size Sample size 100 to 500 30 501 to 3 200 50 %gt% 3 201 80 
For batches of fewer than 100 prepackages, the non-destructive test, within the meaning of Annex II to Directive 76/211/EEC, where carried out, shall be 100 %. 
9. In the case of prepackaged individual carcases, the following tolerable negative errors are permitted: 
(in g) 
Nominal weight Tolerable negative error less than 1 100 25 1 100 and more 50 
10. In the case of prepackaged poultry cuts, the following tolerable negative errors apply: 
Nominal weight (in g) Tolerable negative error (in g) (in %) 250 9 500 15 750 15 1 000 1,5 1 500 1,5 2 000 1,5 2 500 1,5 3 000 1,5 5 000 1,5 
11. For the checking of the actual content of each prepackage in the sample, the minimum acceptable content shall be claculated by subtracting the tolerable negative error for the contents concerned from the nominal weight of the prepackage. 
The prepackages in the sample whose actual contents are les than the minimum acceptable content shall be considered defective. 
The batch of prepackages checked shall be considered acceptable or rejected, if the number of defective units found in the sample is less than or equal to the acceptance criterion or equal to or greater than the criterion for rejection shown below: 
Number in sample Number of defective units Acceptance criterion Rejection criterion 30 2 3 50 3 4 80 5 6 
12. For the checking of the average actual contents, a batch of prepackages shall be considered accpetable, if the average actual content of the prepackages forming the sample is greater than the acceptance criterion shown below: 
Sample size Acceptance criterion for average actual content 30 x ' Qn 0,503s 50 x ' Qn 0,379s 80 x ' Qn 0,295s x = average actual content of prepackages, Qn = nominal quantity of the prepackage, s = standard deviation of the actual contents of the prepackages in the batch. 
The standard deviation shall be estimated as set out under point 2.3.2.2 of Annex II to Directive 76/211/EEC. 
13. The provisions of Article 4 (4) of Directive 76/211/EEC apply. Article 9
