Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of bilateral Agreements laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services between the European Community and the Republic of Bulgaria, the European Community and Romania 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 
Prior to the 2004 enlargement of the EU and on the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council on 21.10.2002, the Commission negotiated bilateral Agreements laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on information society services between the European Community and ten former candidate countries (the Republic of Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Slovak Republic and the Republic of Slovenia). This resulted in the adoption of two Council Decisions on the conclusion of bilateral Agreements with the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Hungary (Council Decision 2004/299/EC of 24 November 2003)[1] and with the other eight former candidate countries (Council Decision 2004/330/EC of 22 September 2003)[2]and the subsequent conclusion of Agreements with several former candidate countries prior to 1 May 2004. 
The negotiating mandate adopted in 2002 also covered the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania, with whom the Commission has negotiated identical bilateral Agreements. 
The text of these two Agreements and their Annexes is exactly the same as those previously negotiated with the former candidate countries prior to 1 May 2004. 
A proposal for a Council Decision is attached. The proposal concerns the adoption and signature of the two bilateral Agreements. Consequently, it foresees that the Council approves these bilateral Agreements. 
Signature is required by each of the two candidate countries for the adoption of its bilateral Agreement. It is accordingly proposed that the President of the Council be authorised to designate the persons empowered to sign the Agreements on behalf of the Community. 
The Commission therefore proposes that the Council adopt the attached Decision. 
The text of these two Agreements and their Annexes are attached to this proposal and the following provides an assessment of the Agreements in the light of the negotiating directives approved by the Council. 
2. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL 
2 .1. Summary of the proposed agreements 
The Agreements provide for the participation of the above mentioned two candidate countries in the notification procedure, which was introduced at Community level by Directive 83/189/CEE (amended several times, then codified by Directive 98/34/EC, and subsequently amended by Directive 98/48/EC) [3]. 
Both bilateral Agreements contain exactly the same articles. In accordance with the negotiating mandate, the scope of the Agreements is exactly the same as that provided for in Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. Furthermore, the definition of technical regulations and rules on information society services is identical with the definitions contained in Article 1 of Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
As regards the system of exchange of information, in accordance with the negotiating mandate, the Community is responsible for communicating to the countries concerned the draft technical regulations and draft rules on information society services notified to the Commission by the Member States in application of Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
Each of the two candidate countries with which a bilateral Agreement has been drawn up is responsible for communicating to the Community its draft technical regulations and draft rules on information society services. 
In accordance with the negotiating directives, the three-month standstill period provided for in Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC, has been included in each Agreement. During this three-month standstill period the Community has the right to make comments on the drafts notified by each of the two candidate countries with whom a bilateral Agreement has been drawn up; and each of the two candidate countries has the right to make comments on the drafts thus notified by the Member States. 
Finally, as stated in the negotiating directives, the two candidate countries have to submit information in one of the official Community languages. 
2.2 Explanation article-by-article 
The Agreement 
An article-by-article assessment follows (given that the articles are the same in all agreements, the description given below applies to both bilateral Agreements): 
Preamble. This sets out the basic objective of the Agreement, that is to extend the notification procedure to the candidate country concerned. 
Article 1: Definitions. This is self-explanatory. The definitions are exactly the same as the ones used in Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
Article 2: Exception from scope. Like in Directive 98/34/EC, as amended byDirective 98/48/EC, it is foreseen that measures taken by the Member States or the candidate country concerned for the protection of persons (and in particular workers), when products are used, do not fall under the scope of the Agreement. However, it is specified that if such measures affect the products, then notification is required. 
Article 3: System of exchange of information. This article stipulates that the Community is responsible for transmitting the notifications of the Member States to the candidate countries concerned. In the same way, the notifications of the candidate country concerned are to be transmitted to the Community. In accordance with Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC, where a technical regulation simply transposes the full text of an international or a European standard, it is not necessary to send the text of that standard, given that these texts are easily available to the Commission. In this case, it is sufficient to transmit the exact reference of the standard concerned. 
Article 4: Language of transmission. It is specified that the draft technical regulations have to be submitted in a full translation into one of the official languages of the European Community. 
Article 5: Basic texts and risk analysis. As foreseen in Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC, basic texts have also to be submitted where this is necessary in order to assess the implications of the draft technical regulations notified. Furthermore, in certain cases risk evaluations, where these are available, have to be transmitted. 
Article 6: Notification in case of significant changes. This Article provides that a new notification has to be made if the Member States or the candidate country concerned modify their previously notified drafts. The definitions of what constitutes a significant change are identical with the ones of Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
Article 7: Further information. This stipulates that each contracting party has the right to ask for further information on the notified drafts where this is considered necessary for their evaluation. 
Article 8: Comments. It is specified that each contracting party may make comments on the drafts notified by the other contracting party. 
Article 9: Standstill period. A uniform standstill period of three months applies to the drafts notified by each contracting party. No extension of this standstill period is possible. 
Article 10: Urgency procedure. This Article stipulates that where urgent reasons are invoked the three-month standstill period shall not apply. The definition of urgency of this Article is identical with the one of Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
Article 11: Final text and administrative arrangements for transmission. It is foreseen that the final text has also to be transmitted. This is because for some notifications, it is useful to be able to compare the notified text with the finally adopted one. The same article also refers to Annex III of the Agreement (see below) which lays down some general rules as to the administrative arrangements for communication of information under the Agreement. 
Article 12: Exceptions to notification obligation. This Article stipulates the cases in which notification is not required. These exceptions are identical to those listed inDirective 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. With regard to international agreements concluded by the candidate country concerned, it is foreseen that it does not have to notify those laws, regulations and administrative provisions arising out of the obligations of an international agreement that applies in the candidate country and in the entire European Community. The reason for this is that the same provisions will apply in the candidate country and in the European Community, as the candidate country and all the Member States have transposed the international agreement. 
On the other hand, if the candidate country adopts laws, regulations or administrative provisions arising out of an international agreement that applies in the candidate country and a third country, or that applies in the candidate country and only a part of the European Community, then notification is required, given that in these two cases, the provisions may create barriers to trade, as these two types of international agreement do not apply in the whole territory of the two contracting parties. 
Article 13: Confidentiality. Information provided under the bilateral Agreement is in principle not confidential, however each contracting party has the possibility to ask for confidentiality. 
Article 14: Management of the Agreement. For the management of the Agreement, it is foreseen that on the one hand, regular consultations shall take place between experts of the European Community and the candidate country concerned and on the other, candidate countries shall participate in the Standing Committee established under Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
Article 15: Territorial clause. This is a standard provision defining the geographical application of the Agreement. 
Article 16: Entry into force. This is a standard provision that provides the arrangement for the entry into force. 
Article 17: Expiry. It is self-explanatory that the Agreement will expire on the date of accession of the candidate country. 
Article 18: Languages of the Agreement. This is a standard provision that the Agreement is drawn up in all Community languages and the language of the candidate country. 
The Annexes to the Agreement 
There follows an assessment of the content of the annexes. 
Annex I: Information society services. This Annex provides a further clarification of the concept of information society services, as defined in point 2 of Article 1 of the Agreement. The Annex is identical with Annex V of Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC and provides an indicative list of services which fall outside the definition of information society services. 
Annex II: Financial services. This Annex gives an indicative list of the financial services which are excluded from the scope of the Agreement (see Article 1, point 5, third subparagraph of the Agreement). The Annex is identical with Annex VI of Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
Annex III: Administrative procedure for transmission of information. This Annex lays down some general rules as to the administrative arrangements for communication of information under the Agreement. These arrangements are in principle identical with the ones currently in force with the EFTA countries signatory to the EEA Agreement.

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
For the purpose of this Agreement, the following definitions apply: 
1. “product”: any industrially manufactured product and any agricultural product, including fish products;

For the purposes of this definition: 
- “at a distance”: means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present, 
- “by electronic means”: means that the service is sent initially and received at its destination by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data, and entirely transmitted, conveyed and received by wire, by radio, by optical means or by other electromagnetic means,

This Agreement shall not apply to: 
- radio broadcasting services, 
- television broadcasting services covered by point (a) of Article 1 of Directive 89/552/EEC[8]. 
3. “technical specification”: a specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards the name under which the product is sold, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling and conformity assessment procedures. 
The term “technical specification” also covers production methods and processes used in respect of agricultural products as referred to Article 38(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, products intended for human and animal consumption, and medicinal products as defined in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC[9], as well as production methods and processes relating to other products, where these have an effect on their characteristics. 
4. “other requirements”: a requirement, other than a technical specification, imposed on a product for the purpose of protecting, in particular, consumers or the environment, and which affects its life cycle after it has been placed on the market, such as conditions of use, recycling, reuse or disposal, where such conditions can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing; 
5. “rule on services”: requirement of a general nature relating to the taking-up and pursuit of service activities within the meaning of point 2, in particular provisions concerning the service provider, the services and the recipient of services, excluding any rules which are not specifically aimed at the services defined in that point.

The Republic of Bulgaria shall draw up such a list and forward it to the Commission the first day of the first month following entry into force of this Agreement. 
The same procedure shall be used for amending this list. 
7. “draft technical regulation”: the text of a technical specification or other requirement or of a rule on services, including administrative provisions, formulated with the aim of enacting it or of ultimately having it enacted as a technical regulation, the text being at a stage of preparation at which substantial amendments can still be made.

Article 10

- for urgent reasons, occasioned by serious and unforeseeable circumstances relating to the protection of public health or safety, the protection of animals or the preservation of plants and, for rules on services, also for public policy, notably the protection of minors, the competent authorities are obliged to prepare technical regulations in a very short space of time in order to enact and introduce them immediately without any consultations being possible or

1. “product”: any industrially manufactured product and any agricultural product, including fish products; 
2. “service”: any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services. 
For the purposes of this definition: 
- “at a distance”: means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present,

An indicative list of services not covered by this definition is set out in Annex I. 
This Agreement shall not apply to: 
- radio broadcasting services, 
- television broadcasting services covered by point (a) of Article 1 of Directive 89/552/EEC[25]. 
3. “technical specification”: a specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards the name under which the product is sold, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling and conformity assessment procedures. 
The term “technical specification” also covers production methods and processes used in respect of agricultural products as referred to Article 38(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, products intended for human and animal consumption, and medicinal products as defined in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC[26], as well as production methods and processes relating to other products, where these have an effect on their characteristics. 
4. “other requirements”: a requirement, other than a technical specification, imposed on a product for the purpose of protecting, in particular, consumers or the environment, and which affects its life cycle after it has been placed on the market, such as conditions of use, recycling, reuse or disposal, where such conditions can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing; 
5. “rule on services”: requirement of a general nature relating to the taking-up and pursuit of service activities within the meaning of point 2, in particular provisions concerning the service provider, the services and the recipient of services, excluding any rules which are not specifically aimed at the services defined in that point. 
This Agreement shall not apply to rules relating to matters which are covered by European Community legislation in the field of telecommunications services, defined as “services whose provision consists wholly or partly in the transmission and routing of signals on a telecommunications network by means of telecommunications processes, with the exception of radio broadcasting and television.” [27]

With the exception of Article 11, this Agreement shall not apply to rules enacted by or for regulated markets within the meaning of Directive 2004/39/EC[28] or by or for other markets or bodies carrying out clearing or settlement functions for those markets. 
For the purposes of this definition: 
- a rule shall be considered to be specifically aimed at Information Society services where, having regard to its statement of reasons and its operative part, the specific aim and object of all or some of its individual provisions is to regulate such services in an explicit and targeted manner, 
- a rule shall not be considered to be specifically aimed at Information Society services if it affects such services only in an implicit or incidental manner. 
6. “technical regulation”: technical specifications and other requirements or rules on services, including the relevant administrative provisions, the observance of which is compulsory, de jure or de facto, in the case of marketing, provision of a service, establishment of a service operator or use in one of the Member States of the European Community or a major part thereof, or in Romania or a major part thereof, as well as laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the Member States of the European Community or of Romania, except those provided for in Article 12, prohibiting the manufacture, importation, marketing or use of a product or prohibiting the provision or use of a service, or establishment as a service provider. 
De facto technical regulations include: 
- laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a Member State of the European Community or Romania which refer either to technical specifications or to other requirements or to rules on services, or to professional codes or codes of practice which in turn refer to technical specifications or to other requirements or to rules on services, compliance with which confers a presumption of conformity with the obligations imposed by the aforementioned laws, regulations or administrative provisions, 
- voluntary agreements to which a public authority is a contracting party and which provide, in the general interest, for compliance with technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services, excluding public procurement tender specifications, 
- technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services which are linked to fiscal or financial measures affecting the consumption of products or services by encouraging compliance with such technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services; technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services linked to national social security systems are not included.

Romania shall draw up such a list and forward it to the Commission the first day of the first month following entry into force of this Agreement. 
The same procedure shall be used for amending this list. 
7. “draft technical regulation”: the text of a technical specification or other requirement or of a rule on services, including administrative provisions, formulated with the aim of enacting it or of ultimately having it enacted as a technical regulation, the text being at a stage of preparation at which substantial amendments can still be made.

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS 
5.1. Need for Community intervention 
5.1.1. Objectives pursued 
The objective is for the two candidate countries with which the agreements have been negotiated to participate, before their accession to the European Union, in the notification system for technical regulations established by Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC. 
This Directive provides for the prior notification of draft regulations related to the products of all types and information society services of each of the 25 Member States of the European Community in order to avoid technical barriers to trade before they appear. According to the Directive, a standstill period (of at least three months) is provided during which the notified draft cannot be adopted at national level. A simplified notification system (with a maximum standstill period of three months and the possibility to make comments only) applies to the countries of the European Economic Area and, as of 1 January 2001, to Turkey also. 
The mechanism envisaged by these agreements reproduces this simplified system so it can be applied to the candidate countries in order to: 
- avoid new barriers to trade between the European Union and the candidate countries; 
- prepare these countries as early as possible for accession to the European Union as regards the notification procedure; 
- and thus strengthen the spirit of dialogue and mutual understanding. 
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation 
The ex ante evaluation revealed the following: 
- It is in the interests of the European Community and of its Member States to conclude such agreements in that the system envisaged will allow them to be kept regularly informed of the regulatory initiatives under preparation in the candidate countries and, then, where appropriate, to make comments on drafts which would have serious legal and economic implications, particularly from the point of view of the free movement of products and information society services (among other matters, for example, for Community subjects or enterprises operating in the candidate countries). 
- Furthermore, the application, in simplified form, of a procedure which will apply fully from accession will enable all the parties to prepare for that accession and thus to implement Community obligations correctly 
5.1.3. Measures taken following ex post evaluation 
None . 
5.2. Actions envisaged and budget intervention arrangements 
The objective of the agreements with the candidate countries is that they should participate prior to their accession to the European Union in the notification system that was put in place at Community level in 1983. This system should prevent the emergence of new barriers to trade between the Community and the candidate countries. 
The geographical coverage is limited to the 2 candidate countries with whom agreements have been negotiated. The draft regulations will be exchanged between the Commission, the candidate countries and the Member States within the framework of the administrative mechanism provided for by Directive 98/34/EC, and which has already been operational at EC level since 1984. 
A maximum of around 20 drafts per year can reasonably be expected from the two candidate countries. This figure is based on the fact that: 
- the candidate countries are concentrating their legislative activities more on incorporating the acquis communautaire (measures that are not covered by this planned notification procedure) than on strictly unilateral initiatives. 
Participation in the notification procedure of 2 candidate countries at the same time should result in 5 notifications per candidate country for the remaining period up to accession (i.e. 6 months, assuming enlargement takes place on January 1 2007). This figure is confirmed by experience with the EFTA countries. 
5.3. Methods of implementation 
Action 1 
The computer application necessary for the automatic transmission of texts from the Community Member States to the candidate countries and vice versa is already in place due to the previous exercise with former candidate countries prior to May 1 2004 (See COM(2003) 203 final. No additional funding is, therefore, needed. 
Action 2 
In line with the notification procedure established with the European Economic Area countries, the candidate countries will have to make their notifications in one of the official Community languages. It can be reasonably expected that most notifications will be in English. 
Similarly, as with the European Economic Area countries, notifications will be translated only into English, French and German. 
Based on 10 notifications for 6 months until accession (cf. point 5.2.) with an average of 20 pages per notification, 200 pages of translation, can be expected. This figure has to be doubled with regard to both Bulgarian and Romanian notifications, because a text notified in English, for example, will be translated into French and German (5 x 20 x 2 = 200 pages). The cost is therefore estimated at € 14 000 (400 pages at € 35 / page). This amount will be funded from DG Enterprise and Industry’s existing budget (02.0301), which already provides for a slight increase in translation costs for 2006 in view of the preparation for enlargement. 
Action 3 
DG Enterprise and Industry will be responsible for: 
- coordinating the analysis of the drafts by the other departments concerned within the Commission; 
- coordinating with the Member States comments on the candidate countries' texts and the replies to the comments from the candidate countries on the Member States' texts; 
- managing the database and translations, and forwarding of messages. 
The staff required for this will be paid for out of DG Enterprise and Industry's financial resources.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION 
8.1. Follow-up arrangements 
The candidate countries' notifications will be integrated in the existing database system (TRIS) for the notification procedure. This system will allow a "day by day" follow-up of the candidate countries' notifications, the Community's reactions to these notifications, and also the reactions of the candidate countries to the Member States' notifications. 
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for evaluation 
The data supplied by TRIS will be used to evaluate annually the impact of the Community intervention.
