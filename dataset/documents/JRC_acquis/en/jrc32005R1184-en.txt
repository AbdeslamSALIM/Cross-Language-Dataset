Council Regulation (EC) No 1184/2005 
of 18 July 2005 
imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons impeding the peace process and breaking international law in the conflict in the Darfur region in Sudan 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60, 301 and 308 thereof, 
Having regard to Common Position 2005/411/CFSP of 30 May 2005 concerning restrictive measures against Sudan [1], 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) In its Resolution 1591 (2005) of 29 March 2005, the UN Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, and deploring strongly that the Government of Sudan and rebel forces and all other armed groups in Darfur have failed to comply with their commitments and the demands of the Security Council, decided to impose certain additional restrictive measures in respect of Sudan. 
(2) Common Position 2005/411/CFSP provides, inter alia, for implementation of the freezing of funds and economic resources of those persons designated by the competent United Nations Sanctions Committee, who impede the peace process, constitute a threat to stability in Darfur and the region, commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities, violate the arms embargo or are responsible for certain offensive military flights in and over the Darfur region. These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary to implement them as far as the Community is concerned. 
(3) For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community should be deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty. 
(4) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication. 
(5) The Treaty, in Articles 60 and 301, empowers the Council to take, under certain conditions, measures aimed at the interruption or reduction of payments or movement of capital and of economic relations with regard to third countries. The measures laid down in this Regulation, targeted also at individual persons not directly linked to the government of a third country, are necessary to attain this objective of the Community and Article 308 of the Treaty empowers the Council to take such measures if no other specific powers are provided for in the Treaty, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

1. By way of derogation from Article 2 the competent authorities of the Member States, as listed in Annex II, may authorise the release of certain frozen funds or economic resources or the making available of certain frozen funds or economic resources, under such conditions as they deem appropriate, after having determined that the funds or economic resources concerned are:

provided that any such interest, other earnings and payments are frozen in accordance with Article 2(1). 
2.

Article 8 
The Commission and Member States shall immediately inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and shall supply each other with any other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation, in particular information in respect of violation and enforcement problems and judgments handed down by national courts.
