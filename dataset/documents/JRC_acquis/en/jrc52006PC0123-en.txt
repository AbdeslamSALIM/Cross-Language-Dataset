Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on control of San José Scale 
(Codified version) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In the context of a people’s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying Community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen, thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him. 
This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules. 
For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if Community law is to be clear and transparent. 
2. On 1 April 1987 the Commission therefore decided[1] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that the Community rules are clear and readily understandable. 
3. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. 
Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal Community legislative procedure. 
Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 
4. The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 69/466/EEC of 8 December 1969 on control of San José Scale[3] . The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bringing them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. 
5. The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation , in all official languages, of Directive 69/466/EEC and the instrument amending it, carried out by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, by means of a data-processing system . Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex II to the codified Directive.

on control of San José Scale 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles Ö 37 Õ and Ö 94 Õ thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[5], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[6], 
Whereas : 
ê 
1. Council Directive 69/466/EEC of 8 December 1969 on control of San José Scale[7] has been substantially amended[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 1 
2. The production of woody dicotyledonous plants and their fruit occupies an important place in Community agriculture. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 2 
3. The yield of that production is constantly threatened by harmful organisms. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 3 
4. Through the protection of such plants against such harmful organisms, not only should productive capacity be maintained but also agricultural productivity increased. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 4 
5. Protective measures to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into individual Member States would have only a limited effect if such organisms were not controlled simultaneously and methodically throughout the Community and were not prevented from spreading. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 5 
6. One of the organisms most harmful to woody dicotyledonous plants is San José Scale ( Quadraspidiotus perniciosus Comst.). 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 6 
7. This pest has occurred in several Member States and there are contaminated areas within the Community. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 7 
8. There is a permanent risk to the cultivation of woody dicotyledonous plants throughout the Community if effective measures are not taken to control this pest and prevent it from spreading. 
ê 69/466/EEC Recital 8 (adapted) 
9. To eradicate this pest, minimum provisions Ö should Õ be adopted for the Community. Member States Ö should Õ be able to adopt additional or stricter provisions where necessary. 
ê 
10. This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B, 
ê 69/466/EEC 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
