Whereas Article 2 (1) and Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3597/90 contain the rules relating to the determination of the value at which, respectively, missing quantities and quantities which do not meet the conditions laid down for storage are to be reimbursed to the EAGGF in the public storage accounts; whereas, in certain cases, provision should be made for the possibility of increasing that value, in particular when the market price is found to be substantially higher than the intervention price or the intervention buying-in price; 
Whereas certain regulations referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3597/90 have been amended or repealed since the adoption of the latter; whereas, therefore, certain references in Regulation (EEC) No 3597/90 should be amended;
