Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of a Protocol amending the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part, on tariff quotas for sugar and sugar products originating in Croatia or in the Community 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part, (hereinafter referred to as “the SAA”) was signed in Luxembourg on 29 October 2001 and entered into force on 1 February 2005. An Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters was applied since January 2002. 
On 28 February 2005 the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations with the Republic of Croatia to amend the preferential arrangements as regards imports of sugar originating in the Republic of Croatia into the Community under the SAA, so as to replace the current duty-free access for unlimited quantities with an annual duty-free tariff quota. 
On 14 March 2006, the Commission concluded negotiations with Croatia on a duty-free tariff quota for sugar. This new arrangement, applicable from January 2007 will permit Croatia to export sugar to the EC under a tariff quota and replaces the current arrangements under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. 
The new arrangement sets a duty-free tariff quota for EC imports of sugar from Croatia at a level of 180 000 tonnes and incorporates a reciprocal concession to the Community giving preferential access to the Croatian market for 80 000 tonnes of sugar at reduced duty and under some conditions. 
Consequently, the Council is asked to approve the appropriate amendments to the SAA in the form of a Protocol amending the SAA.

(1) OBSERVATIONS: This arrangement is without new impact on the EU sugar market balance and also without any financial impact as regards the export refunds. On the other hand, regarding agricultural duties, taking into account that the quantity of recent sugar imports from Croatia is lower than the quantity established in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, for which the duty is set at ‘0’, no financial impact is foreseeable on budgetary income. |
