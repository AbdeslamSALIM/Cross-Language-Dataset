THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC [1], 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC and in particular Article 18(7) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22(6) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) By Commission Decision 2004/614/EC of 24 August 2004 concerning protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in the Republic of South Africa [3] the Commission adopted protection measures in relation to avian influenza in ratite flocks in South Africa.
