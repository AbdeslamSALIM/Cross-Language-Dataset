COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 15 July 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters (80/777/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas the laws of the Member States define natural mineral waters ; whereas differing definitions are adopted in this connection within the Community ; whereas these laws lay down the terms on which natural mineral waters are recognized as such and govern the conditions for exploiting the springs ; whereas they furthermore stipulate specific rules for marketing the waters in question; 
Whereas the differences between these laws hinder the free movement of the natural mineral waters, creating disparate competitive situations, and consequently directly affect the establishing and functioning of the common market; 
Whereas, in this particular case, the elimination of these barriers may be achieved both by an obligation on each Member State to allow the marketing in its territory of the natural mineral waters recognized as such by each of the other member States and by laying down common rules concerning in particular the microbiological requirements to be fulfilled and the conditions in which specific names must be used for certain of the mineral waters; 
Whereas, pending the conclusion of agreements on mutual recognition of natural mineral waters between the Community and third countries, the terms should be laid down on which, until implementation of the said agreements, similar products imported from third countries may be allowed to enter the Community as natural mineral waters, 
Whereas care should be taken to ensure that natural mineral waters retain at the marketing stage those characteristics which enabled them to be recognized as such ; whereas, therefore, the containers used for packaging them should have suitable closures; 
Whereas, in respect of labelling, natural mineral waters are subject to the general rules laid down by Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of (1)OJ No C 69, 11.6.1970, p. 14. (2)OJ No C 45, 10.5.1971, p. 5. (3)OJ No C 36, 19.4.1971, p. 14. foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (1) ; whereas, accordingly, this Directive may be limited to laying down the additions and derogations which should be made to those general rules; 
Whereas, in order to simplify and speed up the procedure, the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting technical implementing measures, and in particular defining the procedure for taking samples and the methods of analysis necessary to check the composition of natural mineral waters; 
Whereas, in all cases in which the Council entrusts the Commission with responsibility for implementing rules laid down concerning foodstuffs intended for human consumption, provision should be made for a procedure establishing close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs, set up by Decision 69/414/EEC (2), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

ANNEX I 
I. DEFINITION 
1. %quot%Natural mineral water%quot% means microbiologically wholesome water, within the meaning of Article 5, originating in an underground water table or deposit and emerging from a spring tapped at one or more natural or bore exits. 
Natural mineral water can be clearly distinguished from ordinary drinking water: (a) by its nature, which is characterized by its mineral content, trace elements or other constituents and, where appropriate, by certain effects; 
(b) by its original state, 
both characteristics having been preserved intact because of the underground origin of such water, which has been protected from all risk of pollution. 
2. These characteristics, which may give natural mineral water properties favourable to health, must have been assessed: 
(a) from the following points of view: 1. geological and hydrological, 
2. physical, chemical and physico-chemical, 
3. microbiological, 
4. if necessary, pharmacological, physiological and clinical; 
(b) according to the criteria listed in Section II; 
(c) according to scientific methods approved by the responsible authority. 
The analyses referred to in (a) (4) may be optional where the water presents the compositional characteristics on the strength of which it was considered a natural mineral water in the Member State of origin prior to the entry into force of this Directive. This is the case in particular when the water in question contains, per kg, both at source and after bottling, a minimum of 1 000 mg of total solids in solution or a minimum of 250 mg of free carbon dioxide. 
3. The composition, temperature and other essential characteristics of natural mineral water must remain stable within the limits of natural fluctuation ; in particular, they must not be affected by possible variations in the rate of flow. 
Within the meaning of Article 5 (1), the normal viable colony count of natural mineral water means the reasonably constant total colony count at source before any treatment, whose qualitative and quantitative composition taken into account in the recognition of that water is checked by periodic analysis. 
II. REQUIREMENTS AND CRITERIA FOR APPLYING THE DEFINITION 
1.1. Requirements for geological and hydrological surveys 
There must be a requirement to supply the following particulars: 1.1.1. the exact site of the catchment with indication of its altitude, on a map with a scale of not more than 1 : 1 000; 
1.1.2. a detailed geological report on the origin and nature of the terrain; 
1.1.3. the stratigraphy of the hydrogeological layer; 
1.1.4. a description of the catchment operations; 
1.1.5. the demarcation of the area or details of other measures protecting the spring against pollution. 
1.2. Requirements for physical, chemical and physico-chemical surveys 
These surveys shall establish: 1.2.1. the rate of flow of the spring; 
1.2.2. the temperature of the water at source and the ambient temperature; 
1.2.3. the relationship between the nature of the terrain and the nature and type of minerals in the water; 
1.2.4. the dry residues at 180 ยบC and 260 ยบC; 
1.2.5. the electrical conductivity or resistivity, with the measurement temperature having to be specified; 
1.2.6. the hydrogen ion concentration (pH); 
1.2.7. the anions and cations; 
1.2.8. the non-ionized elements; 
1.2.9. the trace elements; 
1.2.10. the radio-actinological properties at source; 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0013777%quot%%gt% 1.2.12. the toxicity of certain constitutent elements of the water, taking account of the limits laid down for each of them. 
1.3. Criteria for microbiological analyses at source 
These analyses must include: 1.3.1. demonstration of the absence of parasites and pathogenic micro-organisms; 
1.3.2. quantitative determination of the revivable colony count indicative of faecal contamination: (a) absence of Escherichia coli and other coliforms in 250 ml at 37 ยบC and 44 75 ยบC; 
(b) absence of faecal streptococci in 250 ml; 
(c) absence of sporulated sulphite-reducing anaerobes in 50 ml; 
(d) absence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 250 ml. 
1.3.3. determination of the revivable total colony count per ml of water: (i) at 20 to 22 ยบC in 72 hours on agar-agar or an agar-gelatine mixture, 
(ii) at 37 ยบC in 24 hours on agar-agar. 
1.4. Requirements for clinical and pharmacological analyses 1.4.1. The analyses, which must be carried out in accordance with scientifically recognized methods, should be suited to the particular characteristics of the natural mineral water and its effects on the human organism, such as diuresis, gastric and intestinal functions, compensation for mineral deficiencies. 
1.4.2. The establishment of the consistency and concordance of a substantial number of clinical observations may, if appropriate, take the place of the analyses referred to in 1.4.1. Clinical analyses may, in appropriate cases, take the place of the analyses referred to in 1.4.1 provided that the consistency and concordance of a substantial number of observations enable the same results to be obtained. 
III. SUPPLEMENTARY QUALIFICATIONS RELATING TO EFFERVESCENT NATURAL MINERAL WATERS 
At source or after bottling, effervescent natural mineral waters give off carbon dioxide spontaneously and in a clearly visible manner under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. They fall into three categories to which the following descriptions respectively shall apply: (a) %quot%naturally carbonated natural mineral water%quot% means water whose content of carbon dioxide from the spring after decanting, if any, and bottling is the same as at source, taking into account where appropriate the reintroduction of a quantity of carbon dioxide from the same water table or deposit equivalent to that released in the course of those operations and subject to the usual technical tolerances; 
(b) %quot%natural mineral water fortified with gas from the spring%quot% means water whose content of carbon dioxide from the water table or deposit after decanting, if any, and bottling is greater than that established at source; 
(c) %quot%carbonated natural mineral water%quot% means water to which has been added carbon dioxide of an origin other than the water table or deposit from which the water comes. 
ANNEX II CONDITIONS FOR THE EXPLOITATION AND MARKETING OF NATURAL MINERAL WATER 
1. Exploitation of a natural mineral water spring shall be subject to permission from the responsible authority of the country where the water has been extracted, after it has been established that the water in question complies with the provisions laid down in point 1 of Annex I. 
2. Equipment for exploiting the water must be so installed as to avoid any possibility of contamination and to preserve the properties, corresponding to those ascribed to it, which the water possesses at source. 
To this end, in particular: (a) the spring or outlet must be protected against the risks of pollution; 
(b) the catchment, pipes and reservoirs must be of materials suitable for water and so built as to prevent any chemical, physico-chemical or microbiological alteration of the water; 
(c) the conditions of exploitation, particularly the washing and bottling plant, must meet hygiene requirements. In particular, the containers must be so treated or manufactured as to avoid adverse effects on the microbiological and chemical characteristics of the natural mineral water; 
(d) the transport of natural mineral water in containers other than those authorized for distribution to the ultimate consumer is prohibited. 
However, point (d) need not be applied to mineral waters exploited and marketed in the territory of a Member State if, in that Member State at the time of notification of this Directive, transport of the natural mineral water in tanks from the spring to the bottling plant was authorized. 
3. Where it is found during exploitation that the natural mineral water is polluted and no longer presents the microbiological characteristics laid down in Article 5, the person exploiting the spring must forthwith suspend all operations, particularly the bottling process, until the cause of pollution is eradicated and the water complies with the provisions of Article 5. 
4. The responsible authority in the country of origin shall carry out periodic checks to see whether: (a) the natural mineral water in respect of which exploitation of the spring has been authorized complies with Section I of Annex I; 
(b) the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3 are being applied by the person exploiting the spring.
