Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2001 
of 24 April 2001 
laying down detailed rules of application concerning the documents accompanying the carriage of wine products and the records to be kept in the wine sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2) and in particular Article 70(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In view of the establishment of the single market in the Community, which entails the abolition of boundaries between Member States, the authorities responsible for supervising the stocking and marketing of wine products must have the necessary means to carry out effective checks in accordance with uniform rules laid down at Community level. 
(2) Under Article 70(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, wine products may be put into circulation within the Community only if accompanied by an officially checked accompanying document. Under Article 70(2) natural or legal persons who hold wine products are to be obliged to keep goods inwards and outwards registers in respect of those products. 
(3) Steps towards tax harmonisation within the Community have been taken by Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products(3), as last amended by Directive 2000/47/EC(4) and Commission Regulations (EEC) No 2719/92 of 11 September 1992 on the accompanying administrative document for the movement under duty-suspension arrangements of products subject to excise duty(5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2225/93(6), and (EEC) No 3649/92 of 17 December 1992 on a simplified accompanying document for the intra-Community movement of products subject to excise duty which have been released for consumption in the Member State of dispatch(7). In order to establish uniform rules applicable within the Community and to simplify administrative formalities for businesses and individuals, the Community rules should be reviewed in the light of experience and of the requirements of the single market. In particular, documents accompanying the carriage of wine products for tax purposes should also be used to guarantee the authenticity of the products concerned. 
(4) The abovementioned provisions concerning the drawing up of accompanying administrative documents and the simplified accompanying document refer to rules on the certification of the origin and quality of certain types of wine. The rules for such certification should therefore be laid down. Rules must also be laid down for the certification of the origin of certain wines for carriage not subject to tax formalities, in particular for export. In order to simplify administrative formalities for individuals and to remove the burden of routine tasks from the competent authorities, provision should be made for the latter to authorise consignors fulfilling certain conditions to enter the wording certifying the origin of the wine in the accompanying document, without prejudice to completion of the relevant checks. 
(5) The carriage of wine products not subject to the abovementioned tax formalities should be accompanied by a document to enable the competent authorities to monitor the movement of such products. Any commercial document containing the details necessary for identifying the product and for tracking its movements may be recognised for that purpose. 
(6) The monitoring of wine products transported in bulk requires particular care since such products are more susceptible to fraudulent practices than are labelled, bottled products fitted with a non-reusable closing device. Additional information and prior validation of the accompanying document should be required in such cases. 
(7) In order to avoid needlessly complicating administrative formalities, no document should be required for carriage meeting certain criteria. 
(8) The documents accompanying the carriage of wine products and the relevant entries made in the registers constitute a whole. In order to ensure that by consulting the registers the competent authorities are able effectively to monitor the movement and stocking of wine products, in particular in the course of cooperation between those authorities in the different Member States, the rules concerning the keeping of records should be harmonised at Community level. 
(9) The substances used in certain oenological practices, especially enrichment, acidification and sweetening, are particularly open to the danger of fraudulent use. Records must therefore be kept concerning those substances to enable the competent authorities to supervise their movement and use. 
(10) The accompanying document for the carriage of wine products laid down by Community rules is a very useful source of information for the bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with Community and national rules in the wine sector. Member States should be allowed to lay down additional rules for the purpose of applying this Regulation for carriage beginning on their own territory. 
(11) Article 18(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2238/93 of 26 July 1993(8) on the documents accompanying the carriage of wine products and the records to be kept in the wine sector, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1592/1999 of 20 July 1999(9), introduces the possibility for the Member States to lay down additional or specific provisions for the products in question in circulation on their territory. One of those provisions stipulates that details of the density of grape may be replaced, for a transitional period, by a reference to the density expressed in degrees Oechsle. That transitional period originally expired on 31 August 1996 and was extended until 31 July 2000. This traditional practice is used mainly by small agricultural producers who still need several years to adopt the new rules on density. The date in question should therefore be replaced by 31 July 2002. 
(12) The Italian version of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2238/93 as published in the Official Journal in 1993 contains an error. The first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of the Italian version of the Regulation refers to Article 9 of Directive 92/12/EEC rather than to Directive 92/12/EEC in its entirety. The Italian authorities applied the Italian version of the Regulation and in order to permit them to take the steps necessary to apply the new, corrected text without creating difficulties for operators, Article 4(2) of this Regulation should enter into force six months later in Italy. 
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 4 
Notwithstanding Article 3(1), no document shall be required to accompany: 
1. in the case of wine products in containers of a nominal volume of more than 60 litres, consignments of:

Article 5 
1. Where the competent authority finds that a natural or legal person, or a group of such persons, who transports a wine product or causes a wine product to be transported has committed a serious infringement of Community rules in the wine sector or national provisions adopted pursuant thereto, or where that authority has a justified reason for suspecting such an infringement, it may require the following procedure to be applied: 
The consignor shall complete the accompanying document and request validation by the competent authority. Validation, when granted, may be linked to conditions on the future use of the product. It shall comprise the stamp, the signature of the official of the competent authority and the date. 
The above procedure shall also apply for the transport of products the production conditions or composition of which do not conform to Community or national rules. 
2. For all carriage within the customs territory of the Community of third country products released into free circulation, the accompanying document shall include: 
- the number of the VI 1 document, completed in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 883/2001(10), 
- the date on which the document was completed, 
- the name and address of the authority of the third country having completed the document or authorised its completion by a producer. 
3. All persons or bodies completing accompanying documents for transport of a wine product and persons who have held such products shall keep a copy of such documents. 
Article 6 
1. The accompanying document shall be considered duly completed when it includes the information laid down in Article 3(1) of this Regulation. Where a document conforming to Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92 or Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92 is used, it shall, in addition, contain all the information laid down in Article 3(1) of this Regulation. In addition, for the transport to a distillery of wine fortified for distillation, the accompanying administrative document or the simplified accompanying document or the commercial documents in place of the two latter documents must satisfy the requirements of Articles 68(2)(a) and 70(2)(e) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms(11). 
2. The accompanying document may be used only for a single transport operation. 
A single accompanying document may be completed to accompany the transport in a single consignment from one and the same consignor to one and the same consignee of: 
- two or more batches of the same category of product, or 
- two or more batches of different categories of product provided they are put up in labelled containers of a nominal volume of 60 litres or less and fitted with a recognised non-reusable closing device bearing an indication enabling the bottler to be identified. 
3. The documents accompanying the consignment of wine products must indicate the date on which transport commences. 
In the case referred to in Article 5(1) or where the document accompanying the consignment is completed by the competent authority, the document shall be valid only if transport commences not later than the fifth working day following the date of validation or the date on which it is completed, as appropriate. 
4. When products are transported in separate compartments of the same transport container or are mixed during carriage, a document must be completed to accompany each portion, whether transported separately or as a mixture. Such documents shall mention, in accordance with the rules laid down by each Member State, the use of the product of mixing. 
However, consignors or empowered persons may be authorised by Member States to complete a single accompanying document for the whole product of mixing. In such cases the competent authority shall give appropriate instructions as to how proof is to be furnished concerning the category, origin and quantity of the various loads. 
5. Where it is found that a consignment which must be accompanied by a document is being transported without such a document or under cover of a document containing false, erroneous or incomplete particulars, the competent authority of the Member State where this is discovered or any other agency responsible for ensuring compliance with Community and national rules in the wine sector shall take the measures necessary: 
- to regularise such transport, either by correcting any material errors or by completing a new document, 
- where appropriate, to penalise any irregularities in proportion to their seriousness, in particular by applying Article 5(1). 
The competent authority or other agency referred to in the first subparagraph shall stamp documents corrected or completed under that provision. Regularisation of irregularities may not delay the transport operation in question for longer than is strictly necessary. 
In the event of serious or repeated irregularities, the competent regional or local authority for the place of unloading shall inform the competent regional or local authority for the place of loading. In the case of transport inside the Community, such information shall be forwarded in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2729/2000 of 14 December 2000 laying down detailed implementing rules on controls in the wine sector(12). 
6. Where it is impossible to regularise transport operations within the meaning of the first subparagraph of paragraph 5, the competent authority or the agency that discovered the irregularity shall hold up the transport. It shall inform the consignor that the transport is being held up and of the consequences incurred. These measures may include a ban on marketing the product. 
7. Where part or all of a product carried under cover of an accompanying document is refused by the consignee, the latter shall write the words %quot%refused by the consignee%quot% on the back of the document, together with the date and the consignee's signature, plus, where appropriate, an indication of the quantity refused, in litres or kilograms. 
In that case the product may be returned to the consignor under cover of the same accompanying document or may be kept on the premises of the carrier until a new document is completed to accompany the product when it is redispatched. 
Article 7 
1. Accompanying documents shall be regarded as certifying the designation of origin of quality wines psr or the provenance of table wines entitled to a geographical indication when duly completed: 
- by consignors who are themselves the producer of the wine transported and who neither acquire nor sell wine products obtained from grapes harvested in wine-growing areas other than those whose names they use to designate wine obtained from their own production, 
- by consignors not covered by the first indent, provided that the accuracy of the particulars has been certified on the accompanying document by the competent authority on the basis of the information contained in the documents accompanying previous consignments of the products in question, 
- under Article 5(1), provided the following requirements are met: 
(a) (i) the accompanying document is completed in accordance with the model laid down for: 
- the accompanying administrative document given in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92, or 
- the simplified accompanying document given in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92, or 
- the accompanying document set out in Annex III to this Regulation; or 
(ii) where transport does not cross the territory of another Member State, one of the documents referred to in Article 3(2)(b); 
(b) the following is entered in the appropriate place on the accompanying document: 
- for quality wines psr: %quot%This document certifies the origin of the quality wines psr set out herein%quot%, 
- for table wines entitled to a geographical indication: %quot%This document certifies the provenance of the table wines set out herein%quot%; 
(c) the entries referred to in (b) are validated by the competent authority by means of its stamp, the date and the signature of the person responsible, as applicable: 
- on copies 1 and 2 where the model referred to in the first and second indents of (a)(i) is used, or 
- on the original of the accompanying document and on a copy where the model set out in Annex III or another document as referred to in Article 3(2)(b) is used; 
(d) the reference number of the accompanying document has been assigned by the competent authority; 
(e) in the case of consignments from a Member State which is not the producer Member State, the accompanying document under cover of which the product is consigned shall certify the designation of origin or the geographical indication where it indicates: 
- the reference number, 
- the date on which it was completed, 
- the name and address of the authority referred to on the documents under cover of which the product was transported before being redispatched and in which the designation of origin or the geographical indication has been certified. 
Member States may make the certification of the designation of origin of quality wines psr and the provenance of table wines produced on their territory compulsory. 
2. The competent authorities of each Member State may permit consignors satisfying the conditions set out in paragraph 3 to fill in themselves, or have pre-printed, the certification of designation of origin or of provenance on the accompanying document, provided such certification: 
(a) is validated in advance by the stamp of the competent authority, the signature of the person responsible and the date, or 
(b) is validated by the consignors themselves by means of a special stamp authorised by the competent authority and conforming to the model set out in Annex IV; the stamp may be pre-printed on the forms provided they are printed by a print-shop approved for that purpose. 
3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 2 shall be granted only to consignors: 
- who regularly dispatch quality wines psr and/or table wines entitled to a geographical indication, and 
- after it is ascertained, following an initial request, that the inward and outward registers are kept in accordance with Title II and thus enable the accuracy of the particulars in the documents to be checked. 
The competent authorities may refuse to authorise consignors not offering such guarantees as those authorities consider appropriate. They may cancel the authorisation, in particular where consignors no longer meet the requirements laid down in the first subparagraph or no longer offer the guarantees required. 
4. Consignors to whom the authorisation referred to in paragraph 2 is granted shall be obliged to take all necessary steps to safeguard the special stamp or the forms bearing the stamp of the competent authority or the special stamp. 
5. In trade with third countries, only accompanying documents completed in accordance with paragraph 1 on export from the Member State of production shall certify: 
- for quality wines psr, that the designation of origin of the product complies with the relevant Community and national provisions, 
- for table wines designated under Article 51(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, that the geographical indication of the product complies with the relevant Community and national provisions. 
However, in the case of exports from a Member State which is not the producer Member State, the accompanying document completed in accordance with paragraph 1 under cover of which the product is exported shall be considered to certify the designation of origin or the geographical indication where it indicates: 
- the reference number, 
- the date on which it was completed, and 
- the name and address of the authority referred to in paragraph 1 indicated on the documents under cover of which the product was transported before being exported and on which the designation of origin or the geographical indication has been certified. 
6. The accompanying document shall be considered to certify the designation of origin of imported wine where that document is completed in accordance with Article 5(2) using one of the models referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1. 
Article 8 
1. Where the consignee is established within the territory of the Community, the following rules shall apply to use of the accompanying document: 
(a) where the product transported is exempt from excise duty (point 1.5, general remarks, of the explanatory notes annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2719/92); 
(b) where a product transported within the Community is subject to excise duty and has already been released for consumption in the Member State of departure (point 1.5, general remarks, of the explanatory notes annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 3649/92); 
(c) in cases not covered by (a) or (b): 
(i) where an accompanying document as required for transport as referred to under (a) and (b) is used: 
- copy No 1 shall be kept by the consignor, 
- copy No 2 shall accompany the product from the place of loading to the place of unloading and be handed to the consignee or his representative; 
(ii) where another accompanying document is used: 
- the original of the accompanying document shall accompany the product from the place of loading and be handed to the consignee or his representative, 
- a copy shall be kept by the consignor. 
2. Where the consignee is established outside the customs territory of the Community, the original and a copy or, where appropriate, copies No 1 and No 2, of the document accompanying the consignment shall be presented in support of the export declaration at the competent customs office of the exporting Member State. The customs office shall ensure that the type, date and number of the document presented are indicated on the export declaration and that the type, date and number of the export declaration are indicated on the original of the accompanying document and on the copy, or, where appropriate, copies No 1 and 2 of the accompanying document. 
The customs office at the point of exit from the customs territory of the Community shall enter one of the following on the two copies of the latter document and stamp as authentic: 
%quot%EXPORTÉ%quot%, %quot%UDFØRSEL%quot%, %quot%AUSGEFÜHRT%quot%, %quot%EXPORTED%quot%, %quot%ESPORTATO%quot%, %quot%UITGEVOERD%quot%, %quot%ΕΞΑΧΘΕΝ%quot%, %quot%EXPORTADO%quot%, %quot%EXPORTERAD%quot%, %quot%VIETY%quot%, 
and shall hand the stamped copies bearing the above wording to the exporter or his representative. The latter shall ensure that one copy accompanies carriage of the exported product. 
3. The references referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 2 shall specify at least the type, date and number of the document and, as regards the export declaration, the name and address of the authority competent as regards exports. 
4. Wine products which are temporarily exported under the outward processing arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(13) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(14) to one of the Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) to undergo storage, ageing and/or packaging operations shall be accompanied by the information sheet laid down by the recommendation of the Customs Cooperation Council of 3 December 1963. This sheet shall show in the boxes reserved for the description of the product, the description in accordance with Community and national rules and the quantities of wine carried. 
This information shall be taken from the original of the accompanying document under cover of which the wine was transported to the customs office where the information sheet is issued. The type, date and number of the document referred to above which accompanied the consignment previously shall also be noted on the information sheet. 
Where the information sheet is duly drawn up by the competent EFTA customs office for a product as referred to in the first subparagraph being brought back into the customs territory of the Community, that document shall be regarded as equivalent to the accompanying document for transport as far as the customs office either of destination in the Community or of release for home use, provided that the document contains, in the box %quot%Description of goods%quot%, the information specified in the first subparagraph. 
The relevant customs office in the Community shall stamp a copy or photocopy of the document delivered by the consignee or his representative and return it to him for the purposes of this Regulation. 
5. For quality wines psr and table wines entitled to a geographical indication exported to third countries under cover of an accompanying document in accordance with this Regulation, the said document, equivalent to a certificate of origin or provenance of the products, must be presented in support of any other documents, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, when such wines are placed in free circulation in the Community, where the wine in question does not meet the conditions in paragraph 2 or constitute goods returned within the meaning of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 and its implementing provisions. Provided that the supporting documents are deemed satisfactory the customs office concerned shall endorse a copy or photocopy of the certificate of designation of origin furnished by the consignee or his representative and return it to him for the purposes of this Regulation.
