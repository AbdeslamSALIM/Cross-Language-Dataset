Regulation (EC) No 2061/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 October 1996 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatized wines, aromatized wine-based drinks and aromatized wine- product cocktails 
REGULATION (EC) No 2061/96 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 8 October 1996 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of aromatized wines, aromatized wine-based drinks and aromatized wine-product cocktails 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3), 
Whereas to take account of certain traditional practices in some Member States it is necessary to lay down that aromatized wines may also be prepared from fresh grape must with fermentation arrested by the addition of alcohol, referred to in Annex I, point 5, of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (4); 
Whereas the provision on the minimum proportion of wine present in an aromatized wine in the case of enriched wines coming from different production zones is nearly impossible to monitor; whereas it is therefore necessary to adjust this provision; 
Whereas the definition of a traditional product such as Glühwein must take account of certain developments in the sector; whereas the addition of water must therefore be forbidden, without prejudice to addition of water as a result of any sweetening; 
Whereas the wording of the provision concerning the processes which may be used in the preparation of the various products needs to be clarified, given that, in the absence of Community rules, Member States may apply specific rules in this area in so far as such rules are compatible with Community law; 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1601/91 (5) should be amended accordingly, and adapted in some technical respects in the light of experience, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
