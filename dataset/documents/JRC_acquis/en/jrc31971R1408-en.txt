Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community 
REGULATION (EEC) No 1408/71 OF THE COUNCIL of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 2, 7 and 51 thereof; 
Having regard to the proposals from the Commission drawn up after consultation with the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers [1]; 
[1] OJ No 194, 28.10.1966, p. 3333/66 and OJ No C 95, 21.9.1968, p. 18. 
Having regard to the Opinions of the European Parliament [2]; 
[2] OJ No C 10, 14.2.1968, p. 30 and OJ No C. 135, 14.12.1968, p. 4. 
Having regard to the Opinions of the Economic and Social Committee [3]; 
[3] OJ No 64,5.4.1967,p.1009/67 and OJ No C 21,20.2.1969, p. 18. 
Whereas the need for a general revision of Council Regulation No 3 [4] on social security for migrant workers has become progressively more apparent, both in the light of the practical experience of its implementation since 1959 and as a result of amendments made to national legislations; 
[4] OJ No 30, 16.12.1958, p. 561/58. 
Whereas the existing provisions for co-ordination can, as a whole, be developed, improved and to some extent simplified at the same time, taking into account the considerable differences existing between national social security legislations; 
Whereas it is appropriate at this time to bring together in a single legislative instrument all the basic provisions for implementing Article 51 of the Treaty for the benefit of workers, including frontier workers, seasonal workers and seamen; 
Whereas the considerable differences existing between national legislations as regards the persons to whom they apply make it preferable to establish the principle that the Regulation applies to all nationals of Member States insured under social security schemes for employed persons; 
Whereas the provisions for co-ordination of national social security legislations fall within the framework of freedom of movement for workers who are nationals of Member States and should, to this end, contribute towards the improvement of their standard of living and conditions of employment, by guaranteeing within the Community firstly equality of treatment for all nationals of Member States under the various national legislations and secondly social security benefits for workers and their dependents regardless of their place of employment or of residence; 
Whereas these objectives must be attained in particular by aggregation of all the periods taken into account under the various national legislations for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the right to benefits and of calculating the amount of benefits, and by the provision of benefits for the various categories of persons covered by the Regulation regardless of their place of residence within the Community; 
Whereas the provisions for co-ordination adopted for the implementation of Article 51 of the Treaty must guarantee to workers who move within the Community their accrued rights and advantages whilst not giving rise to unjustified overlapping of benefits; 
Whereas to this end, persons entitled to benefits for invalidity, old age and death (pensions) must be able to enjoy all the benefits which have accrued to them in the various Member States; whereas, however, in order to avoid unjustified overlapping of benefits, which could result in particular from the duplication of insurance periods and other periods treated as such, it is necessary to limit the benefits to the greatest amount which would have been due to a worker from one of these States if he had spent all his working life there; 
Whereas, in order to secure mobility of labour under improved conditions,it is necessary henceforth to ensure closer co-ordination between the unemployment insurance schemes and the unemployment assistance schemes of all the Member States; whereas it is therefore particularly appropriate, in order to facilitate search for employment in the various Member States, to grant to an unemployed worker, for a limited period, the unemployment benefits provided for by the legislation of the Member State to which he was last subject; 
Whereas it seems desirable to improve the system under Regulation No 3 governing family benefits in cases of separated families, both as regards the categories of persons to be entitled to such benefits and as regards the machinery for awarding them; 
Whereas, taking into account the problems relating to unemployment, it is appropriate to extend entitlement to family benefits to members of the families of unemployed workers residing in a Member State other than the one which is responsible for payment of the unemployment benefit; 
Whereas, moreover, the current restrictions on the granting of family benefits should be abolished, and whereas in order to ensure payment of benefits for the maintenance of the members of separated families, leaving aside those benefits aimed largely at encouraging an increase in population, it would be preferable to lay down rules common to all the Member States and efforts should continue to this end; but in the face of great variations between national legislations a solution should be adopted to take this situation into account: payment of family benefits of the country of employment in respect of five countries, and payment of family allowances of the country of residence of members of the family where the country of employment is France; 
Whereas by analogy with the solutions contained in Council Regulation (EEC) 1612/68[5] of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community, it is desirable to bring together in an Advisory Committee representatives of workers and employers to examine the problems dealt with by the Administrative Commission; 
[5] OJ No 259, 19.10.1968, p. 2. 
Whereas the present Regulation may replace the arrangements provided for in Article 69 (4) of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community;

(a) the institution shall calculate the theoretical amount of benefit that the person concerned could claim if all the insurance periods completed under the legislations of the Member States to which he has been subject had been completed in the State in question and under the legislation administered by it on the date the benefit is awarded. If, under that legislation, the amount of the benefit does not depend on the length of the insurance periods, then that amount shall be taken as the theoretical amount referred to in this subparagraph; 
(b) the institution shall then establish the actual amount of the benefit on the basis of the theoretical amount referred to in the preceding subparagraph and in the ratio which the length of the insurance periods completed before the materialisation of the risk under the legislation administered by that institution, bears to the total length of the insurance periods completed before materialisation of the risk under the legislations of all the Member States concerned; 
(c) if the total length of the insurance periods completed under the legislations of all the Member States concerned before the materialisation of the risk is longer than the maximum period required by the legislation of one of these States for receipt of full benefit, the competent institution of that State shall, when applying the provisions of this paragraph, take into consideration this maximum period instead of the total length of the periods completed; this method of calculation must not result in the imposition on that institution of the costs of a benefit greater than the full benefit provided for by the legislation which it administers; 
(d) the procedure for taking into account duplicate periods when applying the rules of calculation laid down in this paragraph, shall be laid down in the implementing Regulation referred to in Article 97.

4. When in a case of invalidity, old age or survivors' pensions, the total of the benefits due from two or more Member States, under the provisions of a multilateral social security convention referred to in Article 6 (b), is lower than the total which would be due from such Member States under paragraphs 1 and 3, the person concerned shall benefit from the provisions of this Chapter.

(c) where, under the legislation of a Member State, benefits are calculated on the basis of a standard wage or salary or a fixed amount, the competent institution shall consider the wage or salary or fixed amount to be taken into account by it in respect of insurance periods completed under the legislations of other Member States as being equal to the standard wage or salary or fixed amount or, where appropriate, to the average of the standard wages or salaries or fixed amounts corresponding to the insurance periods completed under the legislation which it administers; 
(d) where, under the legislation of a Member State, benefits are calculated for some periods on the basis of the amount of wages or salaries and, for other periods, on the basis of a standard wage or salary or a fixed amount, the competent institution shall, in respect of insurance periods completed under the legislations of other Member States, take into account the wages or salaries or fixed amounts determined in accordance with the provisions of (b) or (c) or, as appropriate, the average of these wages or salaries or amounts; where benefits are calculated on the basis of a standard wage or salary or a fixed amount for all the periods completed under the legislation which it administers, the competent institution shall consider the wage or salary to be taken into account in respect of the insurance periods completed under the legislations of other Member States as being equal to the notional wage or salary corresponding to that standard wage or salary or fixed amount.

ANNEX V 
(Article 89 of the Regulation) 
Special procedures for applying the legislations of certain Member States 
A. BELGIUM 
1. The provisions of Article 1 (a) (i) of the Regulation shall not apply to self-employed persons or to other persons receiving medical treatment under the law of 9 August 1963 on the establishment and organisation of a compulsory sickness and invalidity insurance scheme, unless they receive the same protection as employed persons in respect of such treatment. 
2. For the application of the provisions of Chapters 7 and 8 of Title III of the Regulation by the competent Belgian institution, a child shall be considered to have been brought up in the Member State in whose territory he resides. 
3. For the purposes of Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, old-age insurance periods completed under Belgian legislation before 1 January 1945 shall also be considered as insurance periods completed under the Belgian legislation on the general invalidity scheme and the mariners' scheme. 
B. GERMANY 
1. (a) Where no provision is already made under German legislation for accident insurance, German institutions shall also provide compensation, in accordance with that legislation, for accidents at work (and occupational diseases) which occurred in Alsace-Lorraine before 1 January 1919, the responsibility for the cost of which has not been assumed by French institutions in pursuance of the Decision of the Council of the League of Nations of 21 June 1921 (Reichsgesetzblatt, p. 1289) where the person concerned or his survivors are residing in a Member State; 
(b) Article 10 of the Regulation shall not affect the provisions under which accidents (and occupational diseases) occurring outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, and periods completed outisde that territory, do not give, rise to payment of benefits, or only give rise to payment of benefits under certain conditions, when those entitled to them reside outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
2. (a) In order to determine whether periods considered by German legislation as interrupted periods (Ausfallzeiten) or supplementary periods (Zurechnungszeiten) should be taken into account as such, compulsory contributions paid under the legislation of another Member State and insurance under the pensions' insurance scheme of another Member State shall be treated as compulsory contributions paid under German legislation and as insurance under the German pension insurance scheme. 
When calculating the number of calendar months which have elapsed between the date of entry into the insurance scheme and the materialisation of the risk, periods taken into consideration under the legislation of another Member State which fall between those two dates shall not be taken into account, neither shall periods during which the person concerned has been in receipt of a pension. 
(b) Subparagraph (a) shall not apply to the standard interrupted period (pauschale Ausfallzeit). This shall be determined exclusively on the basis of insurance periods completed in Germany. 
(c) The taking into account of an additional period (Zurechnungszeit) in pursuance of German legislation on pension insurance for miners shall, moreover, be subject, to the condition that the last contribution paid under German legislation was paid into the pension insurance for miners. 
(d) For the purpose of taking into account German substitute periods (Ersatzzeiten), only German national legislation shall apply. 
(e) By way of derogation from the provision laid down in subparagraph (d), the following provision shall apply to persons insured under the German pension insurance scheme who were residing in German territories under Netherlands administration during the period from 1 January 1948 to 31 July 1963; for the purpose of taking into account German substitute periods (Ersatzzeiten) within the meaning of Article 1251 (2) of the German social security law (RVO) or corresponding provisions, payment of contributions to Netherlands insurance schemes during that period shall be treated as equivalent to having been employed or having pursued an activity coming under compulsory insurance within the meaning of German legislation. 
3. Where payments to be made into German sickness insurance funds are concerned, compulsory payment of the contributions referred to in Article 26 (2) of the Regulation shall be suspended until a decision is made concerning pensions claims. 
4. In order to determine whether a child is receiving an orphan's pension, receipt of one of the benefits referred to in Article 78 or of another family benefit granted under French legislation for a minor residing in France shall be treated as the receipt of an orphan's pension under German legislation. 
5. If application of this Regulation or of subsequent social security Regulations involves exceptional expenses for certain sickness insurance institutions, such expenses may be partially or totally reimbursed. The Federal Association of Regional Sickness Funds, in its function of liaison agency (sickness insurance) shall decide on such reimbursement by common agreement with the other Central Associations of Sickness Funds. The resources needed for effecting such reimbursements shall be provided by taxes imposed on all sickness insurance institutions in proportion to the average number of members during the preceding year, including retired persons. 
6. If the competent institution for granting family benefits in accordance with Title III Chapter 7 of the Regulation is a German institution, a person compulsorily insured against the risk of unemployment or a person who, as a result of such insurance, obtains cash benefits under sickness insurance or comparable benefits shall be considered as a worker (Article 1 (a) of the Regulation). 
C. FRANCE 
1. (a) The allowance for elderly employed persons shall be granted under the conditions laid down for French workers by French legislation, to all workers who are nationals of other Member States and who, at the time of making their claim, were residing in French territory. 
(b) the same shall apply to refugees and stateless persons; 
(c) the provisions of the Regulation shall not affect the provisions of French legislation under which only periods of work as employed persons or periods treated as such which are completed in the territories of the European departments and the overseas departments (Guadeloupe, Guiana, Martinique and Réunion) of the French Republic shall be taken into consideration for acquisition of the right to the allowance for elderly employed persons. 
2. The special allowance and cumulative indemnity provided for by the special legislation for social security in the mines shall be provided only for workers employed in French mines. 
3. Law No 65-655 of 10 July 1965 which grants to French nationals who are pursuing, or who have pursued, a professional or trade activity abroad the right to join the voluntary old-age insurance scheme, shall apply to nationals of other Member States under the following conditions: 
- the professional or trade activity giving rise to voluntary insurance under the French system should not be, or have been, pursued either on French territory or on the territory of the Member State of which the worker is a national; 
- the worker must produce evidence, when making his claim, either that he has resided in France for at least ten consecutive years, or that he has been continuously subject to French legislation on a compulsory or optional basis for the same length of time. 
4. Within the meaning of Article 73 (3) of the Regulation, the expression 'family benefits' shall include: 
(a) prenatal allowances provided for in Article L 516 of the Social Security Code;
