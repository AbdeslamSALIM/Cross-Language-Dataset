THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(1), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(2) and in particular Article 8(3) thereof, 
(1) Whereas Commission Decision 1999/301/EC(3) provides for a suspension of imports of fresh bovine meat including offal for human consumption coming from or originating in the United States of America with effect from 15 June 1999; whereas it is necessary in the interval that fresh bovine meat including offal imported from the United States of America does not contain any residues of growth promoting hormones; 
(2) Whereas in application of Article 8 of Directive 90/675/EEC the reduction in the frequency of physical checks for certain products from third countries are laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision 94/360/EC(4); whereas the presence of certain xenobiotic growth promoting hormones, and abnormally high levels of residues of natural hormones, has been detected in fresh bovine meat including offal, other than bison meat including offal, from the United States of America and it is therefore necessary to intensify harmonised checks on such meat; 
(3) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
