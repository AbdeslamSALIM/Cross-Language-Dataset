ANNEX I 
DEFINITIONS OF HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND FORMER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS, PENSIONS FROM INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PLANS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PENSION PLANS, TOTAL GROSS AND DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, TOTAL DISPOSABLE HOUSEHOLD INCOME BEFORE SOCIAL TRANSFERS (EXCEPT OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS' BENEFITS; INCLUDING OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS' BENEFITS) AND GROSS/NET INCOME COMPONENTS 
1. HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND FORMER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS 
1.1. Household membership(1) 
Subject to the further and specific conditions shown below, the following persons must, if they share household expenses, be regarded as household members: 
1. persons usually resident, related to other members; 
2. persons usually resident, not related to other members; 
3. resident boarders, lodgers, tenants; 
4. visitors; 
5. live-in domestic servants, au-pairs; 
6. persons ususally resident, but temporarily absent from the dwelling (for reasons of holiday travel, work, education or similar); 
7. children of the household being educated away from home; 
8. persons absent for long periods, but having household ties: persons working away from home; 
9. persons temporarily absent but having household ties: persons in hospital, nursing homes or other institutions. 
Further conditions for inclusion as household members are as follows: 
(a) Categories 3, 4 and 5: 
Such persons must currently have no private address elsewhere; or their actual or intended duration of stay must be six months or more. 
(b) Category 6: 
Such persons must currently have no private address elsewhere and their actual or intended duration of absence from the household must be less than six months. 
Categories 7 and 8: 
Irrespective of the actual or intended duration of absence, such persons must currently have no private address elsewhere, must be the partner or child of a household member and must continue to retain close ties with the household and must consider this address to be his/her main residence. 
(c) Category 9: 
Such person must have clear financial ties to the household and must be actually or prospectively absent from the household for less than six months. 
Shares in household expenses 
Shares in household expenses include benefiting from expenses (e.g. children, persons with no income) as well as contributing to expenses. If expenses are not shared, then the person constitutes a separate household at the same address. 
%quot%Usually resident%quot% 
A person shall be considered as a usually resident member of the household if he/she spends most of his/her daily rest there, evaluated over the past six months. Persons forming new households or joining existing households shall normally be considered as members at their new location; similarly, those leaving to live elsewhere shall no longer be considered as members of the original household. The abovementioned %quot%past six month%quot% criteria shall be replaced by the intention to stay for a period of six months or more at the new place of residence. 
%quot%Intention to stay for a period of six months or more%quot% 
Account has to be taken of what may be considered as %quot%permanent%quot% movements in or out of households. Thus a person who has moved into a household for an indefinite period or with the intention to stay for a period of six months or more shall be considered as a household member, even though the person has not yet stayed in the household for six months, and has in fact spent a majority of that time at some other place of residence. Similarly, a person who has moved out of the household to some other place of residence with the intention of staying away for six months or more, shall no longer be considered as a member of the previous household. 
%quot%Temporarily absent in private accommodation%quot% 
If the person who is temporarily absent is in private accommodation, then whether he/she is a member of this (or the other) household depends on the length of the absence. Exceptionally, certain categories of persons with very close ties to the household may be included as members irrespective of the length of absence, provided they are not considered members of another private household. 
In the application of these criteria, the intention is to minimise the risk that individuals who have two private addresses at which they might potentially be enumerated are not double-counted in the sampling frame. Similarly, the intention is to minimise the risk of some persons being excluded from membership of any household, even though in reality they belong to the private household sector. 
1.2. Former household member 
The term %quot%former household member%quot% refers to a person who is not a current member of the household and was not recorded as a household member in that household in the previous wave, but who lived in the household for at least three months during the income reference period. 
The former household members shall be included only in the EU-SILC longitudinal component. 
2. GROSS INCOME COMPONENTS

2.2. Self-employment income 
Self-employment income is defined as the income received, during the income reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of their current or former involvement in self-employment jobs. Self-employment jobs are those jobs where the remuneration is directly dependent upon the profits (or the potential for profits) derived from the goods and services produced (where own consumption is considered to be part of profits). The self-employed person makes the operational decisions affecting the enterprise, or delegates such decisions while retaining responsibility for the welfare of the enterprise. (In this context, %quot%enterprise%quot% includes one-person operations). The remuneration of hobbies shall be regarded as self-employment. 
If the income collected or compiled corresponds to a time period earlier than the reference period, basic adjustments shall be applied to update the data to the income reference period. 
The self-employment income is broken down into: 
1. Gross cash profits or losses from self-employment (including royalties) (PY050G); 
2. Value of goods produced for own consumption (PY070G). 
2.2.1. Gross cash profits or losses from self-employment (including royalties) (PY050G) 
It includes: 
- net operating profit or loss accruing to working owners of, or partners in, an unincorporated enterprise, less interest on business loans, 
- royalties earned on writing, inventions and so on, not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises, 
- rentals from business buildings, vehicles, equipment, etc., not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises, after deduction of related costs such as interest on associated loans, repairs and maintenance and insurance charges. 
It does not include: 
- directors' fees earned by owners of incorporated enterprises (which are included under %quot%Gross cash or near-cash employee income%quot% (PY010G)), 
- dividends paid by incorporated enterprises (which are included under %quot%Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business%quot% (HY090G)), 
- profits from capital invested in an unincorporated enterprise in which the person does not work (%quot%sleeping partners%quot%) (these profits are included under %quot%Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business%quot% (HY090G)), 
- rent from land and receipts from boarders or lodgers (which are included under %quot%Income from rental of a property or land%quot% (HY040G)), 
- rentals from dwellings not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises (which are included under %quot%Income from rental of a property or land%quot% (HY040G)). 
Income from self-employment shall be calculated as: 
- market output (gross revenue to turnover, including the value of goods produced by the enterprise but consumed by the self-employed person or his/her household), 
- plus market value of goods and services bought for the unincorporated enterprise but consumed by the entrepreneur and his/her household members, 
- plus property income received in connection with financial and other assets belonging to the enterprise, 
- minus intermediate consumption (raw material costs, costs of sales, distribution costs, maintenance costs, administrative expenses, etc.), 
- minus compensation of employees (wages, salaries and social security contributions for employees), 
- minus taxes on production and import taxes, 
- minus interest paid on business loans, 
- minus rents paid on land and other non-produced tangible assets rented by the enterprise,

In practice if the self-employed person or business prepares annual accounts for tax purposes, the gross income benefits/losses shall be calculated as net operating benefits/losses shown on this tax account for the most recent 12-month period, before deduction of taxes on income and compulsory social insurance contributions. 
In the absence of annual accounts, either for tax purposes or as a business account, the alternative approach to measure self-employment income shall be to collect the amount of money (and goods) drawn out of the business for personal use (for consumption or saving, including the market value of goods produced or purchased by the business but taken for personal use). 
2.2.2. Value of goods produced for own consumption (PY070G) 
The value of goods produced for own consumption refers to the value of food and beverages produced and also consumed within the same household. 
The value of goods produced for own consumption shall be calculated as the market value of goods produced deducting any expenses incurred in the production. 
The value of food and beverages shall be included when they are a significant component of the income at national level or they constitute a significant component of the income of particular groups of households. 
This value does not include: 
- value of household services, 
- any production for sale and any withdrawals from a business by a self-employed person (these values are included under %quot%Gross income benefits or losses from self-employment%quot% (including royalties) (PY050G)). 
2.3. Imputed rent 
2.3.1. Imputed rent (HY030G) 
The imputed rent refers to the value that shall be imputed for all households that do not report paying full rent, either because they are owner-occupiers or they live in accommodation rented at a lower price than the market price, or because the accommodation is provided rent-free. 
The imputed rent shall be estimated only for those dwellings (and any associated buildings such a garage) used as a main residence by the households. 
The value to impute shall be the equivalent market rent that would be paid for a similar dwelling as that occupied, less any rent actually paid (in the case where the accommodation is rented at a lower price than the market price), less any subsidies received from the government or from a non-profit institution (if owner-occupied or the accommodation is rented at a lower price than the market price), less any minor repairs or refurbishment expenditure which the owner-occupier households make on the property of the type that would normally be carried out by landlords. 
The market rent is the rent due for the right to use an unfurnished dwelling on the private market, excluding charges for heating, water, electricity, etc. 
2.4. Property income 
Property income is defined as the income received less expenses accruing, during the income reference period, by the owner of a financial asset or a tangible non-produced asset (land) in return for providing funds to or putting the tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of another institutional unit. 
The property income is broken down into: 
1. Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business (HY090G); 
2. Income from rental of a property or land (HY040G). 
2.4.1. Interest, dividends, profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business (HY090G) 
Interest (not included in the profit/loss of an unincorporated enterprise), dividends and profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business refer to the amount of interest from assets such as bank accounts, certificates of deposit, bonds, etc., dividends and profits from capital investment in an unincorporated business in which the person does not work, received during the income reference period, less expenses incurred. 
2.4.2. Income from rental of a property or land (HY040G) 
Income from rental of a property or land refers to the income received, during the income reference period, from renting a property (for example renting a dwelling not included in the profit/loss of unincorporated enterprises, receipts from boarders or lodgers or rent from land) after deducting costs such as mortgage interest repayments, minor repairs, maintenance, insurance and other charges. 
2.5. Current transfers received 
2.5.1. Social benefits 
Social benefits(3) are defined as current transfers received by households during the income reference period(4) and intended to relieve them from the financial burden of a number of risks or needs, made through collectively organised schemes, or outside such schemes by government units and NPISH. 
It includes the value of any social contributions and income tax payable on the benefits by the beneficiary to social insurance schemes or to tax authorities. 
In order to be included as a social benefit, the transfer must meet one of two criteria: 
- coverage is compulsory (under law, regulation or a collective bargaining agreement) for the group in question, 
- it is based on the principle of social solidarity (i.e. if it is an insurance-based pension, the premium and entitlements are not proportional to the individual exposure to risk of the people protected). 
Social benefits are broken down into: 
1. Family/children-related allowances (HY050G); 
2. Housing allowances (HY070G); 
3. Unemployment benefits (PY090G);

(1) Those Member States using in EU-SILC the common household definition defined in their national statistical system, shall be allowed to define the %quot%household membership%quot% according to that definition. 
(2) If any goods or services are provided for both private and work use, then private use as a proportion of total use has to be estimated and applied to the total value. 
(3) The social benefits included in EU-SILC, with the exception of housing benefits, are restricted to cash benefits. 
(4) In order to get a closer measure of the well-being of the household, the lump-sum benefits received during the income reference period shall be treated according to Eurostat technical recommendations. In the same way, lump-sums received before the income reference period could be taken into account and imputed according to Eurostat recommendations. 
ANNEX II 
DELIVERY OF INCOME DATA 
1. A key objective of EU-SILC is to deliver robust and comparable data on total disposable household income, total disposable household income before transfers (other than old-age and survivors' benefits; including old-age and survivors' benefits), total gross income and gross income at component level. 
2. This objective is to be reached in two steps, in that Member States will be allowed to postpone the delivery of some of the above data until after the first year of their operations. The only data for which delivery will not be compulsory as from the first year of the operation are as follows: 
- non-monetary components of employee income (with the exception of company cars, that is to be calculated as from the first year of the operation) and self-employed income, imputed rent and interest payments. These will be optional from the first year of the operation and compulsory from 2007, 
- gross employers' social insurance contributions will be included from 2007 onwards, if results of feasibility studies are positive. 
3. By way of exception to paragraph 2, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal are permitted not to deliver any gross income data as from the first year of their operation. These countries will, however, do their utmost to deliver these data as soon as possible and in any case no later than 2007. 
In the meantime, the Commission will carry out in-depth feasibility studies on this topic in cooperation with countries, and provide technical assistance initially to help countries meet this gross data requirement. 
Countries shall report each year on their progress in performing net/gross conversion in their quality reports. 
4. Should Greece, Spain, France, Italy or Portugal be unable to deliver a gross income data component as from the first year of their operation, the corresponding net income component will be required. 
In this way, an income component will always be recorded in the same form (gross, net of tax on income at source and social contributions, net of tax on income at source, net of social contributions) according to the usual specification for this income component in the country.
