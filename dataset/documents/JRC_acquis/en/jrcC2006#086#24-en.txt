Case C-61/06: Action brought on 3 February 2006 by the Commission of the European Communities against the Italian Republic 
Action brought on 3 February 2006 by the Commission of the European Communities against the Italian Republic 
An action against the Italian Republic was brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 3 February 2006 by the Commission of the European Communities, represented by B. Schima and D. Recchia, acting as Agents. 
The Commission claims that the Court should: 
1. declare that by failing to submit its national annual report on the promotion of biofuels before 1 July 2004, the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) of Directive 2003/30/EC [1] of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport; 
2. order the Italian Republic to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The report referred to in Article 4(1) of the directive should have been sent to the Commission before 1 July 2004. To date, the Commission has not received any information from the Italian authorities. 
The Commission therefore maintains that as matters now stand Italy has not communicated the report on the promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport required under Article 4(1) of the directive.
