Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas the prices and guarantees represented by the machinery introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (4) encourage the growth of cereals production at a rate which is no longer in line with the absorption capacity of the market; whereas, in order to avoid a succession of increasingly serious crises, the current policy should be radically reformed; whereas that implies that the support provided by the market organization should be reorientated in such a way that it no longer depends solely on guaranteed prices; 
Whereas the new orientation of the common agricultural policy must lead to better market equilibrium and to a better competitive position for Community agriculture; whereas that objective can be achieved by lowering the target price to a level representing an anticipated rate on a stabilized world market; whereas, so as not to encourage producers to opt for one particular crop, the target price should be the same for the major cereales; 
Whereas the loss of income resulting from the drop in prices is offset by direct aid per hectare introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 (5); 
Whereas the structure of guaranteed prices must permit disposal of surpluses within the Community; whereas an intervention price should therefore be fixed at a lower level and a threshold price at a higher level than the target price; 
Whereas the new structure of guaranteed prices leads to the elimination of the current provisions on derived prices; 
Whereas the aid scheme provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 replaces those for durum wheat and certain minor cereales; whereas those aids should therefore be discontinued; 
Whereas the intervention agencies must be able, in special circumstances, to take intervention measures suited to those circumstances; whereas, however, so that the required uniformity of intervention systems may be maintained, those special circumstances should be assessed and the appropriate measures determined at Community level; 
Whereas the intervention prices and threshold prices should, in the course of the marketing year, be subject to a certain number of monthly increases in order to take account, to some extent, of storage costs and interest charges for storing cereals in the Community and of the need to ensure that the disposal stocks conforms to market requirements; 
Whereas potatoes intended for the production of starch are in direct competition with cereals intended for the production of starch; whereas, in view of the reform measures envisaged for cereals and to ensure equal treatment between the lines of production in question, similar measures should be adopted with regard to potatoes intended for the production of starch; 
Whereas the creatin of a single Community market for cereals involves, apart from a system of guaranteed prices, the introduction of a single trading system at the external frontiers of the Community; whereas a trading system including levies and export refunds, combined with intervention measures, also serves to stabilize the Community market, in particular by preventing price fluctuations on the world market from affecting prices ruling within the Community; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for charging a levy on imports from third countries and for the payment of a refund on exports to those countries, both being designed to cover the difference between prices ruling outside and within the Community; whereas, moreover, in respect of products processed from the cereals to which this Regulation applies, account should be taken of the need to ensure a measure of protection for the Community processing industry; 
Whereas, in addition to the system described above, and to the extent necessary for its proper working, provision should be made for regulation or, when the situation on the market so requires, prohibiting totally or partially the use of 'inward processing arrangements`; 
Whereas the competent authorities must be in a position to monitor trade movements in order to assess market trends and to apply the measures laid down in this Regulation as necessary; whereas, to that end, provision should be made for the issue of import and export licences accompanied by the provision of security guaranteeing that the transactions for which such licences are requested are effected; 
Whereas the levy system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external frontiers of the Community; whereas, however, the common price and levy machinery may, in exceptional circumstances, prove defective whereas, in such cases, so as not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances, the Community should be enabled to take all necessary measures without delay; 
Whereas, in a situation of high prices on the world market, provision should be made for appropriate measures to be taken in order to safeguard Community supplies and to stabilize prices on Community markets; 
Whereas the establishment of a single market based on a common price system would be jeopardized by the granting of certain aids; whereas, therefore, the provisions of the Treaty which allow the assessment of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of those which are incompatible with the common market should be made to apply to cereals; 
Whereas the common organization of the market in cereals must include the products of primary processing which contain cereals or certain products which do not contain cereals but which are directly interchangeable in their use with cereals or with products obtained from cereals; 
Whereas, in order to facilitate implementation of the proposed measures, a procedure should be laid down for establishing close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within a Management Committee; 
Whereas the common organization of the market in cereals must take appropriate account, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 and 110 of the Treaty; 
Whereas the expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising out of the application of this Regulation falls on the Community in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) no 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1); 
Whereas the cut in common prices from the time of the entry into force of this Regulation is liable to disrupt the internal market; whereas provision should therefore be made for the possibility for the Commission to take any appropriate measures to avoid such disruptions; 
Whereas, since their consolidation by Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, several provisions concerning the organization of the market in cereals have been amended a number of times; whereas, by reason of their number, their complexity and their dispersal among various Official Journals, these texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation; whereas they should, therefore, be updated,

Differences in quality shall be expressed in coefficients of equivalence. 
3. Where free quotations on the world market are not a determining factor for the offer price and where this price is lower than world market prices, a special cif price calculated on the basis of the offer price shall be substituted for the cif price solely for the imports in question.

(c) fixed, for products which do not contain any basic products listed in Article 1 (1) (a), with reference to market conditions for those Article 1 products which are in competition with them; 
B. A fixed component designed to protect the processing industry. 
2. Where actual offers from third countries of products referred to in Article 1 (1) (d) do not correspond to the price which results from the price of basic products used in their manufacture plus processing costs, an amount fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 may be added to the levy fixed in accordance with paragraph 1. 
3. The Commission shall fix the levies specified in paragraph 1. 
4. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. 
Article 12 
1. The levy to be charged shall be that applicable on the day of importation. 
2. However, as regards imports of products listed in Article 1 (1) (a) and (b), the levy applicable on the day on which application for a licence is lodged, adjusted on the basis of the threshold price which will be in force during the month of importation, shall be applied to an import to be effected during the period of validity of the licence, if the applicant so requests when applying for the licence. In this case, a premium, fixed at the same time as the levy, shall be added to the levy. 
3. A decision may be taken, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23, to apply the provisions of paragraph 2, in whole or in part, to any of the products listed in Article 1 (1) (c) and (d).

5. Where examination of the market situation shows that the application of the provisions concerning the advance fixing of the levy has given rise, or may give rise, to difficulties, a decision may be taken, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 to suspend the application of those provisions for the period strictly necessary. 
In cases of extreme urgency, the Commission may, after examination of the situation on the basis of all the information available to it, decide to suspend advance fixing for a maximum of three working days.

1. To the extent necessary to enable the products listed in Article 1 to be exported in the state referred to therein or in the form of goods listed in Annex B on the basis of quotations or prices for those products on the world market, the difference between those quotations or prices and prices in the Community may be covered by an export refund. 
2. The refund shall be the same for the whole Community. It may be varied according to use or destination. 
The refund shall be granted on application. 
Refunds shall be fixed at regular intervals in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. 
Where necessary the Commission may, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, alter the refunds in the intervening period. 
3. The amount of the refund applicable to exports of products listed in Article 1 and of goods listed in Annex B shall be that applicable on the day of exportation. 
4. However, in the case of products listed in Article 1 (1) (a) and (b), the refund applicable on the day on which application for the licence is lodged, adjusted for the threshold price which will be in force during the month of exportation, shall be applied to an export to be effected during the period of validity of the licence if the applicant so requests when applying for the licence. 
A corrective amount may be fixed. It shall be applied to refunds fixed in advance. The corrective amount shall be fixed at the same time as refund according to the same procedure; however, where necessary the Commission may, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, alter the corrective amounts in the intervening period. 
The provisions of the first and second subparagraphs may be applied, in whole or in part, to any of the products listed in Article 1 (1) (c) and (d) and to any products listed in Article 1 which are exported in the form of goods specified in Annex B.

5. Insofar as is necessary to take account of the particular features of the production of certain spirituous beverages obtained from cereals, the criteria for granting the export refunds referred to in paragraph 1 and the supervision procedures may be adapted to this particular situation. The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 shall lay down the detailed rules needed for this adaptation. 
6. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. Annex B shall be amended in accordance with the same procedure.

2. The detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. 
Article 17 
1. If, by reason of imports or exports, the Community market in one or more of the products listed in Article 1 experiences, or is threatened with, serious disturbances which may endanger the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty, appropriate measures may be applied in trade with third countries until such disturbance or threat of disturbance has ceased. 
2.
