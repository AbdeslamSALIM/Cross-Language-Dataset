Council Regulation (EC) No 1928/2004 
of 25 October 2004 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 fixing for 2004 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 [2] lays down an interim fishing effort limitation and additional conditions for monitoring, inspection and surveillance in the context of the recovery of certain fish stocks. Since then the Council has adopted Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks [3]. It is appropriate to align the provisions of Annex V to those in Regulation (EC) No 423/2004. Moreover the implementation of Annex V has shown that certain of its provisions need to be either clarified or made more flexible, in order to improve its applicability and effectiveness. It is necessary to ensure that any change to the scheme does not result in a lesser conservation value for the measures in question. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 shall be replaced by the text appearing in the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Luxembourg, 25 October 2004. 
For the Council 
The President 
R. Verdonk
