(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
BACKGROUND TO THE PROPOSAL | 
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal Need for extended services hours for certain groups of personnel of the European Institutions. Commitment of the Commission to present a report to the Council on the use of Regulations 300/76 (shift work), 495/77 (standby duty) and 1799/72 (arduous working conditions) and, if necessary, to make modification proposals. | 
120 | General context Council Regulation 300/76 of 9 February 1976 limits shift work allowance under the operating appropriations to personnel employed in a computer centre, a security department, a telex service or involved in the dispatch of the Official Journal of the EC. This exhaustive list does not allow to cover other services for which a confirmed and obvious need for extended service hours equally exists: Technical help desks, telephone switchboards, reception desks in buildings, and others. | 
130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Regulation 300/76 of 9 February 1976 determining the categories of officials entitled to allowances for shift work, and the rates and conditions thereof, last modified by Council Regulation 860/2004 of 29 April 2004. | 
141 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | 
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | 
Consultation of interested parties Measure concerning personnel of EU institutions only. | 
Collection and use of expertise | 
229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 
230 | Impact assessment No alternatives - besides the option not to offer such extended service hours. Marginal social and economic, no environmental impact. | 
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 
305 | Summary of the proposed action Grant access to shift work allowance to other services of the European institutions having a confirmed need for extended or continuous working hours. | 
310 | Legal basis Article 56a of the Staff Regulations of Officials and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities laid down in Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) no 259/68 of 29 February 1968, last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 31/2005 of 20 December 2004, stating: "Acting on a proposal from the Commission submitted after consulting the Staff Regulations Committee, the Council shall determine the categories of officials entitled to such allowances, and the rates and conditions thereof.". | 
329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal concerns an area that falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. The principle of subsidiarity therefore does not apply. | 
Proportionality principle Extension of an existing measure to other services. | 
Choice of instruments | 
341 | Proposed instrument: regulation. | 
342 | Other instruments would have been inappropriate for the following reasons: Modification of an existing Council Regulation. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS |
