Article 251(2), third subparagraph, point (c) of the EC Treaty provides that the Commission shall deliver an opinion on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at second reading. The Commission's opinion regarding the two amendments proposed by the European Parliament is set out below. 
2. Background

3. PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSAL 
This proposal is one of three Directives concerning the installation of safety belts in all commercial vehicles, with the exception of city buses. It supplements the adoption of Directive 2003/20/EC extending the compulsory use of safety belts to all vehicles. 
Owing to technical reasons linked to the construction method for commercial vehicles, Directive 74/408/EEC relating to seats and head restraints must be amended. In order for safety belts to offer users a high level of protection, it is important to ensure that the seats are sufficiently resistant and capable of absorbing impact energy. The proposal inlcudes a ban, in the interests of user safety, on the lateral positioning of seats. 
4. Commission opinion on the amendments proposed by the European Parliament 
At the plenary session of 26 May 2005, the European Parliament rejected amendments 1 to 4 and adopted amendments 5 and 6. The aim of these amendments is to authorise the installation of side-facing seats in certain types of coach for a period of five years. 
The Commission accepts the amendments adopted by the European Parliament. 
5. Conclusion 
Under Article 250(2) of the EC Treaty, the Commission amends its proposal in accordance with the above.
