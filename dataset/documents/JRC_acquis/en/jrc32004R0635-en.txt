Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(3), and in particular the second sentence of Article 4(3) thereof, 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2550/2001 of 21 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2529/2001 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat as regards premium schemes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001(4), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 18a thereof,

Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98, the operative event for the exchange rate for aid for energy crops referred to in Title IV, Chapter 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003(6) is 1 January of the year in respect of which the aid is granted. 
(2) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98, the operative event for the exchange rate for amounts of a structural or environmental character is 1 January of the year in which the decision to grant the aid is taken. 
(3) In accordance with Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2808/98, the exchange rate to be used is the average of the exchange rates applicable during the month preceding the date of the operative event, calculated pro rata temporis. 
(4) In accordance with Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 293/98 of 4 February 1998 determining the operative events applicable to products in the fruit and vegetables sector, to processed fruit and vegetable products and partly to live plants and floricultural products and to certain products listed in Annex II to the EC Treaty, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1445/93(7), the exchange rate applicable for the conversion each year into national currency of the maximum aid per hectare to improve the quality and marketing of nuts and locust beans is the average of the exchange rates applicable during the month before 1 January of the annual reference period, calculated pro rata temporis. 
(5) In accordance with Article 18a of Regulation (EC) No 2550/2001, the operative event for the exchange rate to be applied to the premiums and payments in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector is established at the start of the calendar year in respect of which the premium or payment is granted.

In accordance with Article 43 of that regulation, premiums and payments in the beef sector are converted into national currency on the basis of the average of the exchange rates applicable in the month of December preceding the year of allocation, calculated pro rata temporis.
