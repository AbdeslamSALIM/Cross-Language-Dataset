- the proposal for the technical parameters of the trip (length, gear, exploration regions etc.). 
The Government of the Kingdom of Morocco shall organise a dialogue regarding the technical aspects with the European Commission, on the one hand, and the shipowners concerned, on the other, if it considers it necessary. 
Before the start of the trip, the vessel owners shall submit to the Moroccan authorities and to the European Commission: 
- a declaration of the catches already on board, 
- the technical characteristics of the fishing gear to be used during the trip, 
- an assurance that they comply with the Moroccan fisheries legislation. 
During the exploratory fishing trip, the owners of the vessels concerned shall: 
- send the Moroccan authorities and the European Commission a weekly report detailing the daily catches made and, for each haul, specifying the technical parameters of the trip (position, depth, date and time, catches and other observations or comments), 
- communicate the vessel's position, speed and heading by VMS, 
- ensure that a Moroccan scientific observer or an observer chosen by the Moroccan authorities is on board. The role of the observer will be to gather scientific information from the catches, as well as to sample the catches. Observers shall be treated in the same way as a ship's officer and the shipowner shall cover their living costs during their stay on the vessel. The decision on the observer's time on board, the length of their stay and the boarding and landing harbour will be fixed in agreement with the Moroccan authorities. Unless there is agreement between the parties to the contrary, the vessel will never be obliged to put into harbour more than once per two months, 
- submit their vessel to an inspection before it leaves Moroccan waters if the Moroccan authorities so request, 
- comply with the Kingdom of Morocco's fisheries legislation. 
Catches, including by-catches, made during the scientific trip shall remain the property of the shipowner, provided they comply with the provisions adopted to this end by the Joint Committee. 
The Moroccan authorities shall designate a contact person responsible for addressing any unforeseen problems that might hinder the development of the exploratory fishing.

4. The position of vessels shall be determined with a margin of error of less than 500 metres and a confidence interval of 99 %. 
5. When a vessel which is fishing under the Agreement and is the subject of satellite-tracking under Community legislation enters the Moroccan fishing zones, the subsequent position reports (vessel identification, longitude, latitude, course and speed) shall be transmitted immediately by the Control Centre of the flag state to Morocco's Fisheries Monitoring and Control Centre (FMC) at intervals of no more than two hours. The messages concerned shall be identified as position reports. 
6. The messages specified in point 5 shall be transmitted electronically in X.25 format, or any other secure protocol. They shall be communicated in real time in the format set out in Table II. 
7. Where the continuous satellite-tracking equipment installed on board a fishing vessel develops a technical fault or breaks down, the master of the vessel shall transmit the information specified in point 5 to the Control Centre of the flag State and to Morocco's FMC by fax in good time. In those circumstances a global position report shall be sent every four hours. This global position report shall include the position reports as recorded by the master of the vessel on a two-hourly basis in accordance with the requirements laid down in point 5. 
The Control Centre of the flag State shall send these messages immediately to Morocco's FMC. The faulty equipment shall be repaired or replaced within a period of not more than one month. After this deadline, the vessel in question must leave the Moroccan fishing zones or return to a Moroccan port. 
8. The Control Centres of the flag States shall monitor the movements of their vessels in Moroccan waters at hourly intervals. If the vessels are not being monitored in accordance with the conditions laid down, the Moroccan FMC shall be informed immediately and the procedure laid down in point 7 shall apply. 
9. If the Moroccan FMC establishes that the flag State is not transmitting the information specified in point 5, the competent European Commission departments shall be informed immediately. 
10. The surveillance data communicated to the other party in accordance with these provisions is intended solely for the Moroccan authorities for the purposes of controlling and monitoring the Community fleet fishing under the EC/Morocco Fisheries Agreement. Such data may not under any circumstances be communicated to other parties. 
11. The satellite-tracking system software and hardware components shall be reliable and shall not permit the input or output of false positions or be capable of being manually overridden.

1. Masters of vessels shall use the logbook specially designed for fishing in Morocco's fishing zone and keep this logbook up-to-date in accordance with the provisions of the explanatory note for that logbook. 
2. Shipowners shall send a copy of the logbook to their competent authorities no later than 15 days before the end of the third month following the month to which it relates. These authorities shall forward the copies immediately to the Delegation, which shall send them to the Department before the end of the third month following the month to which they relate. 
3. Failure by shipowners to comply with the obligations provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall entail automatic suspension of the fishing licence until such obligations have been met. 
(2) Quarterly catch declarations 
1. By the end of the third month of each quarter the Delegation shall notify the Department of the quantities caught in the previous quarter by all Community vessels. 
2. This information should be broken down by month, by type of fishing, by vessel and by species specified in the logbook. 
3. This data shall also be sent to the Department in a computer file in a format compatible with software used by the Ministry. 
(3) Reliability of data 
The information in the documents referred to in points 1 and 2 above must reflect the actual fishing situation in order to constitute one of the bases for monitoring changes in stocks. 
CHAPTER VII 
EMBARKING MOROCCAN SEAMEN 
1. Shipowners with fishing licences under this Agreement shall take on board, for the entire period of their presence in Moroccan waters, Moroccan seamen as follows: 
(a) pelagic trawlers 
- of less than 150 GT: voluntary embarkation of Moroccan seamen, 
- of less than 5000 GT: six seamen, 
- equal to or greater than 5000 GT: eight seamen. 
However, if these vessels operate for less than one month per year in the Moroccan fishing zone, they shall be exempted from the obligation to embark Moroccan seamen. 
Furthermore, if the fishing licences of these vessels are renewed for a period of more than one month a year, the shipowners concerned shall pay the lump sum provided for in point 10 of this Chapter for the first month. From the first day of the second month of the fishing licence, they shall be required to comply with their obligation to embark Moroccan seamen;

3. The fishermen's employment contracts shall be drawn up between the shipowners or their representatives and the fishermen. 
4. The shipowner or agent shall inform the Department of the names of the Moroccan seamen taken on board the vessel concerned, mentioning their position in the crew. 
5. The International Labour Organisation's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by Community vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
6. Moroccan seamen's employment contracts, a copy of which shall be given to the signatories, shall be drawn up between the shipowners' agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the competent Moroccan authorities. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life insurance and sickness and accident insurance. 
7. Shipowners or their agents shall send, within two months of the issue of the licence, a copy of that contract duly signed by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned direct to the Department. 
8. Moroccan seamen's wages shall be paid by the shipowners. They shall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement between the shipowners or their agents and the Moroccan seamen concerned or their representatives. However, the wage conditions granted to Moroccan seamen shall not be lower than those applied to Moroccan crews and shall comply with ILO standards and under no circumstances be below those standards. 
9. If one or more seamen employed on board fail to report at the time agreed for the vessel's departure, the vessel shall be permitted to start the planned trip after informing the competent authorities in the port of embarkation of the shortfall in the number of seamen required and having updated its crew list. These authorities shall inform the Department thereof. 
The shipowner shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the number of seamen required by this Agreement sign on the vessel by the next trip at the latest. 
10. Where no Moroccan seamen are taken on board for reasons other than that specified to in the previous point, shipowners shall be obliged to pay as soon as possible a flat-rate amount of EUR 20 per day of fishing in the Moroccan fishing zone per seaman within a maximum of three months. 
This sum shall be used for training Moroccan fishermen and shall be paid into the account specified in point 5 of Chapter I. 
11. Twice a year, on 1 January and 1 July, the Delegation shall send the Department a list of Moroccan seamen taken on board Community vessels, with details of their registration as crew members and the vessels concerned. 
12. Except as provided for in point 9, repetitive failure by shipowners to comply with the embarkation of the requisite number of Moroccan seamen shall result in automatic suspension of the vessels' fishing licence until such obligations have been met. 
CHAPTER VIII 
MONITORING AND OBSERVATION OF FISHING 
A. Observation of fishing 
1. Vessels authorised to fish in Moroccan fishing zones under the Agreement shall take on board observers appointed by Morocco on the terms set out below. 
1.1. 25 % of authorised vessels over 100 GT shall take on board observers each quarter. 
1.2. Industrial pelagic vessels shall take a scientific observer on board for the entire period of activity in Moroccan waters. 
1.3. Other Community fishing vessels of a tonnage not exceeding 100 GT shall be observed during a maximum of ten trips per year and per category of fishing. 
1.4. The Department shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board and a list of appointed observers. These lists shall be sent to the Delegation as soon as they have been drawn up. 
1.5. The Department shall inform the shipowners concerned, through the Delegation, of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board their vessel at the time the licence is issued, or no later than 15 days before the observer's planned embarkation date. 
2. Observers shall be on board pelagic trawlers on a permanent basis. For the other categories of fishing, observers shall spend at one trip per vessel on board. 
3. The conditions under which observers are taken on board shall be agreed between shipowners or their agents and the Moroccan authorities. 
4. Observers shall be taken on board at a port chosen by the shipowner at the beginning of the first voyage in Moroccan waters after notification of the list of designated ships. 
5. Within two weeks and giving 10 days' notice, the shipowners concerned shall make known at which Moroccan ports and on what dates they intend to take observers on board. 
6. Where observers are taken on board in a foreign port, their travel costs shall be borne by the shipowner. Should a vessel with a Moroccan observer on board leave the Moroccan fishing zone, all measures must be taken to ensure the observer's return to Morocco as soon as possible at the expense of the shipowner. 
7. In the event of wasted journeys by scientific observers, due to failure by shipowners to comply with their commitments, shipowners shall pay their travelling expenses, and daily allowances, equal to those received by Moroccan national officials of an equivalent grade, for the days of inactivity by the observers. Similarly, in the event of a delay in embarkation which is down to the shipowner, the shipowner shall pay the scientific observer the daily allowances described above. 
Any amendment to the rules and regulations concerning daily allowances shall be notified to the Delegation no later than two months before its entry into force. 
8. If the observer is not present at the time and place agreed and during the twelve hours following the time agreed, the shipowner shall be automatically absolved of his obligation to take the observer on board. 
9. Observers shall be treated as officers. They shall carry out the following tasks: 
9.1. observe the fishing activities of the vessels; 
9.2. verify the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations; 
9.3. perform biological sampling in the context of scientific programmes; 
9.4. note the fishing gear used; 
9.5. verify the catch data for Moroccan waters recorded in the logbook; 
9.6. verify the percentages of by-catches and assess the quantity of discards of species of marketable fin-fish, crustaceans and cephalopods; 
9.7. report fishing data by fax or by radio, including the quantity of catches and by-catches on board. 
10. Masters shall do everything in their power to ensure the physical safety and welfare of observers during performance of their duties. 
11. Observers shall be offered every facility needed to carry out their duties. Masters shall facilitate their access to the means of communication needed for the discharge of their duties, to documents directly concerned with the vessel's fishing activities, including in particular the logbook and the navigation log, and to those parts of the vessel necessary to facilitate the exercise of their tasks as observer. 
12. While on board, observers shall: 
12.1. take all appropriate steps to ensure that the conditions of their boarding and presence on the vessel neither interrupt nor hamper fishing operations, 
12.2. take care of the material and equipment on board and respect the confidentiality of all documents belonging to that vessel. 
13. At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, observers shall draw up an activity report to be transmitted to the competent authorities in Morocco, with a copy to the Delegation of the European Commission. They shall sign it in the presence of the master, who may add or cause to be added to it any observations considered relevant, followed by the master's signature. A copy of the report shall be handed to the master when the observer is put ashore. 
14. Shipowners shall bear the cost of accommodating observers in the same conditions as the officers on the vessel. 
15. The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the competent Moroccan authorities. 
16. In order to reimburse Morocco for the costs arising from the presence of observers on board vessels, in addition to the fee payable by shipowners, "costs of scientific observers" shall be payable at the rate EUR 3,5 per GT per quarter per vessel fishing in Moroccan fishing zones. 
These costs shall be paid at the same time as the quarterly payments in accordance with the provisions of point 5 of Chapter I of the Annex. 
17. Failure by the shipowner to comply with the obligations laid down in point 4 shall result in automatic suspension of the fishing licence until such obligations have been met. 
B. Joint monitoring of fishing 
The contracting parties shall set up a system of joint monitoring and observation of checks on landings, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of control so as to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. 
To this end, the competent authorities of each contracting party shall designate a representative to attend checks on landings and observe the arrangements for conducting such checks, notifying their name to the other contracting party. 
The representative of the Moroccan authority shall attend inspections on landings by vessels which have operated in the Moroccan fishing zones carried out by the national inspection authorities of the Member States as an observer. 
The representative shall accompany national inspection officials in their visits to ports, on board vessels, in dock, to auctions, fish wholesalers' shops, coldstores and other premises for landing fish before it is placed on the market, and shall have access to the documents which are the subject of these inspections. 
The representative of the Moroccan authority shall draw up and submit a report detailing the inspections attended. 
The Department shall invite the Delegation to attend inspection visits scheduled in the ports of landing giving 10 days' notice. 
At the request of the European Commission, Community fishing inspectors may attend as observers inspections carried out by the Moroccan authorities on landing operations by Community vessels in Moroccan ports. 
The practical arrangements for these operations will be laid down by mutual agreement between the competent authorities of the two parties. 
CHAPTER IX 
MONITORING 
1. The European Community shall keep an up-to-date list of the vessels to which a fishing licence has been issued under this Protocol. This list shall be notified to the Moroccan authorities responsible for fisheries inspection as soon as it is drawn up and each time it is updated. 
2. Technical inspection 
2.1. Once a year and after any alteration in tonnage or changes to the fishing category necessitating the use of a different type of gear, Community vessels covered by point 1 above shall report to the Moroccan port to undergo the inspections required by the legislation in force. Such inspections shall take place within 48 hours of the vessel's putting into port. 
2.2. Once the inspection has been completed satisfactorily, the captain of the vessel shall be issued with a certificate having the same period of validity as the licence and which shall be automatically extended in the case of vessels renewing their licence within the year. However, the maximum validity may not exceed one year. This certificate must be kept on board at all times. 
2.3. The technical inspection shall verify that the vessel's technical characteristics and gear conform to the provisions of the Agreement and that the provisions relating to its Moroccan crew have been complied with. 
2.4. The cost of the inspection shall be borne by the shipowner at the rates laid down by Moroccan law. It may not be greater than the amount normally paid by other vessels for the same services. 
2.5. Failure by the shipowner to comply with points 2.1 and 2.2 above shall result in automatic suspension of the fishing licence until such obligations have been met. 
3. Entering and leaving the zone 
3.1. Community vessels shall notify the Department at least four hours in advance of their intention to enter or leave the Moroccan fishing zones. 
3.2. When notifying leaving, vessels shall also communicate their position and the volume and species in catches kept on board. This information should preferably be communicated by fax or, for vessels not equipped with a fax, by radio, the details of which are set out in Appendix 8. 
3.3. A vessel found to be fishing without having informed the Department shall be regarded as a vessel without a licence. 
3.4. Vessels shall also be informed of the fax and telephone numbers and e-mail address when the fishing licence is issued. 
4. Control procedures 
4.1. Masters of Community fishing vessels engaged in fishing activities in Moroccan waters shall allow and facilitate boarding and the discharge of their duties by any Moroccan official responsible for the inspection and control of fishing activities. 
4.2. These officials shall not remain on board for longer than is necessary for the discharge of their duties. 
4.3. Once the inspection has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel. 
5. Boarding 
5.1. The Department shall inform the European Commission, within no more than 48 hours, of all boardings of and penalties imposed on Community vessels in Moroccan waters. 
5.2. The European Commission shall at the same time receive a brief report of the circumstances and reasons leading to the boarding. 
6. Statement of boarding 
6.1. After the Moroccan authorities responsible for inspection have drawn up a statement, the master of the vessel shall sign it. 
6.2. This signature shall not prejudice the rights of the master or any defence which he may make to the alleged infringement. 
6.3. The master shall take the vessel to the port indicated by the Moroccan authorities responsible for inspection. The vessel in breach of the Moroccan sea fishing legislation in force shall be kept in port until completion of the usual administrative formalities relating to boarding. 
7. Settlement of boarding 
7.1. Before any judicial procedure, an attempt shall be made to resolve the presumed infringement through a compromise procedure. This procedure shall end no later than three working days after the boarding. 
7.2. In the event of an amicable settlement, the amount of the fine shall be determined in accordance with Moroccan fisheries legislation. 
7.3. If the case cannot be settled by amicable procedure and has to be brought before a competent judicial body, a bank security set to take account of the boarding costs and the fines and compensation payable by the parties responsible for the infringement shall be paid by the shipowner into a bank account specified by the competent Moroccan authorities. 
7.4. The bank security shall be irrevocable until the legal proceedings have been concluded. It shall be released once legal proceedings end without a conviction. Similarly, in the event of a conviction leading to a fine of less than the security lodged, the balance shall be released by the competent Moroccan authorities. 
7.5. The vessel shall be authorised to leave the port: 
- once the obligations arising under an amicable settlement have been fulfilled, or 
- when the bank security referred to in point 7.3 has been lodged and accepted by the competent Moroccan authority, pending completion of the legal proceedings. 
8. Transhipment 
8.1. Any transhipment at sea of catches shall be prohibited in the Moroccan fishing zone. However, Community pelagic trawlers wishing to tranship catches in Moroccan waters shall do so in a Moroccan port or other place designated by the competent Moroccan authorities, after authorisation by the Department. Such transhipment shall take place under the supervision of the observer or of a representative of the sea fisheries delegation and the control authorities. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties provided for by Moroccan law. 
8.2. Before any transhipment, the owners of these vessels must notify the following information to the Department at least 24 hours in advance: 
- the names of the transhipping fishing vessels; 
- the names of the cargo vessels, their flags, registration numbers and call signs; 
- the tonnage by species to be transhipped; 
- the destination of catches; 
- the date and day of transhipment. 
The Moroccan party reserves the right to refuse transhipment if the carrier vessel has carried out illegal, undeclared or unregulated fishing inside or outside the maritime areas under Moroccan jurisdiction. 
8.3. Transhipment shall be considered as an exit from the Moroccan fishing zone. Vessels must therefore submit their catch declarations to the Department and state whether they intend to continue fishing or leave the Moroccan fishing zone. 
Masters of Community pelagic trawlers engaged in landing or transhipment operations in a Moroccan port shall allow and facilitate the inspection of such operations by Moroccan inspectors. Once the inspection has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel. 
CHAPTER X 
LANDING OF CATCHES 
The contracting parties, aware of the benefits of increased integration with a view to joint development of their respective fisheries sectors, have agreed to adopt the following provisions concerning landing a proportion of the catches made by Community vessels in Moroccan waters in Moroccan ports. 
The proportion of the catch subject to compulsory landing shall be as indicated in the datasheets annexed to the Agreement. 
Financial incentives: 
1. Community tuna vessels which opt to land their catches in a Moroccan port shall benefit from a reduction on the fee indicated on datasheet No 5 of EUR 2,50 per tonne fished in Moroccan waters. 
An additional reduction of EUR 2,50 per tonne shall be granted where fisheries products are sold in fish markets. 
This mechanism shall apply, for all Community vessels, up to a maximum 50 % of the final statement of catches (as defined in Chapter II of the Annex) from the first year of this Protocol. 
Community pelagic vessels which choose to land a quantity above the 25 % of compulsory catches laid down in datasheet No 6 in a Moroccan port shall benefit from a reduction of 10 % of the fee for each tonne landed on a voluntary basis. 
2. Fish markets shall complete a weighing slip for landing operations, as a basis for product traceability. 
A statement of sales and deductions shall be drawn up for sales in fish markets. 
Copies of the above weighing slips and statements shall be sent to the sea fisheries delegation in the port of landing. Once they have been approved by the Department, the shipowners concerned shall be informed of the amounts that will be refunded to them. These amounts shall be deducted from the fees due for future licence applications. 
3. Assessment 
The level of the financial incentives shall be adjusted within the Joint Committee, in accordance with the socio-economic impact of landings in the year concerned.

The bag of the pelagic or semi-pelagic trawl may be strengthened with a piece of netting with a minimum mesh size of 400 mm of stretched mesh and by straps placed at least 1,5 metres apart, except for the strap at the back of the trawl which may not be placed less than 2 metres from the window in the bag. The strengthening or doubling of the bag for any other reason is prohibited and the trawl may in no case target species other than the small pelagic species authorised. | 
By-catches | Maximum: 3,5 % of other species. The catch of cephalopods, crustaceans and other demersal and benthic species is strictly prohibited. | 
Industrial processing | Industrial processing of catches into fishmeal and/or fish oil is strictly prohibited. However, damaged or spoiled fish and the waste resulting from handling catches may be processed into fishmeal or fish oil without exceeding the maximum threshold of 5 % of total allowable catches. | 
Comments | The vessels fall into three categories: Category 1: gross tonnage not exceeding 3000 GT, ceiling of 12500 tonnes per year per vessel; Category 2: gross tonnage exceeding 3000 GT but not exceeding 5000 GT, ceiling of 17500 tonnes per year and per vessel; Category 3: gross tonnage exceeding 5000 GT, ceiling of 25000 tonnes per year and per vessel. | 
Number of vessels/fees: | Maximum number of vessels authorised to fish at the same time: 18. Shipowner's fees per tonne of allowable catch: EUR 20 per tonne. Shipowner's fees per tonne in excess of allowable catch: EUR 50 per tonne. | 
The fishing conditions for each category shall be agreed each year before the issue of licences.
