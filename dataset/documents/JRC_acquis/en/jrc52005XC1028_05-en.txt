- Activities relating to the manufacture, processing and marketing of goods listed in Annex 1 to the EC Treaty 
- Aid for export-related activities 
- Aid which is conditional on the use of indigenous products rather than imported goods. 
- Aid to the steel, synthetic fibres, motor vehicle and shipbuilding industries 
Since special rules apply to agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture and transport and since even small amounts of aid to those sectors might fulfil the criteria of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, the sectors in question are excluded from the scheme. 
The steel, synthetic fibres, motor vehicle and shipbuilding industries are excluded owing, among other things, to the fact that appropriate measures have been agreed in relation to regional investment aid
