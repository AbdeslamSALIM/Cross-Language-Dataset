ANNEX 
Part C of the Annex to Directive 76/372/EEC is replaced by the following: 
'C. Observations concerning Methods A and B 
1. Defatting 
Samples containing more than 5 % fats must be defatted with light petroleum (bp 40 to 60 °C) after the preparations indicated in 5.1. 
In such cases, the analytical results must be expressed in terms of the weight of the non-defatted sample. 
2. Reproducibility of the results for Method A 
The reproducibility of the results, i.e. the variation between the results obtained by two or more laboratories on the same sample has been estimated at: 
± 50 % of the mean value for mean values of aflatoxin B, from 10 and up to 20 mg/kg; 
± 10 mg/kg on the mean value for mean values greater than 20 and up to 50 mg/kg; 
± 20 % of the mean value for mean values above 50 mg/kg.'
