This explanatory note provides the exact design of the tables together with a precise explanation of each question, as announced in Commission Decision 92/446/EEC of 27 July 1992 concerning questionnaires relating to directives in the water sector. It also includes, as requested by Article 6, Directive 91/692/EEC Committee, examples showing how to answer the questions, and the agreed modifications and fine-tuned versions of questions. 
Member States may add their comments to the answers to individual questions if they so wish. 
Answers to the questionnaire will need to take into account the dates of accession by the Member States (1) and the fact that Member States are entitled to demonstrate compliance either with limit values (LVs) or with Environmental quality objectives (EQOs) as set out in Article 6 (3) of Directive 76/464/EEC; the questionnaire does not affect the provisions for List I substances. Questions A3/A4, A5/A6 and A8 shall be answered as far as possible in the light of that provision and the conditions given in Appendix I. 
Explanation to text of the heading: 
1. Standardized reports on data systems 
For collection of specific data and information for incorporation into a data system, corresponding procedures and formats will be provided at a later stage if applicable. 
2. Regionalizing of information 
If the surface waters mentioned in Annex I of Decision 77/795/EEC do not represent all major river basins of a Member State; all its surface waters or river basins which are necessary to cover the entire territory, should be added. Other regional divisions, e. g. counties, administrative territories are also permitted, if applicable. 
For further clarification, orohydrographical or geographical schemes should be attached to the returns. 
Explanations to A1/A2: 
The information to be given under A1 and A2 should provide an overview of the number of all permitted discharges (directly into surface water or indirectly via sewer) for the industrial sectors/processes mentioned in Appendix 2. Double counting of discharges can be avoided by clear assignment to either A1 or A2. Municipal waste water treatment plants are not covered by part A questions, even if they discharge List I substances originating from discharges into sewers (no double-counting). 
The assignment to questions concerning A1 and A2 does not depend on the operator of a treatment plant (municipal or industrial), but is a question of whether a certain kind of purification of industrial waste water including municipal waste water is applied. Should any doubts arise, these authorizations should be assigned to A1. Question A1/A2 focuses on the notion that discharges are covered intentionally by prior authorization to control and reduce the emissions of the dangerous substances concerned. The use of sum parameters or indicators does not, a priori, interfere with that. It has then to be explained and justified in A3 and A4. 
Double counting may occur in enumeration of industrial sectors or processes, e. g. No point 4.1 with 12.1, 4.3 with 13.1 and 13.2, 4.4 with 13.4. This information is to be indicated in the tables in a suitable form by giving precise indications of the number of double or multiple countings. 
Information on most discharges should be reduced to those cases exceeding the given thresholds in the specific daughter directive, see Appendix 2. 
Explanation and example to A3/A4: 
Chosen information on emission standards corresponding to provisions of Directive 82/176/EEC: this example is not appropriate in the case where different emission standards are set for an industrial sector/process. One should summarize the range of emission standards permitted. 
If the precise EEC limit values apply, no further description is needed at this stage. In this case, indicate only 'EC' and mark, where applicable, corresponding deviations which may have occurred when the limit values were brought into force and/or the monitoring was initiated. For the EQOs approach concerned, give a summary of limit values only. 
Example for NB (a) and (b): 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Example for NB (c): 
The given emission standard is derived using the best technical means available, in accordance with Article 6 (1) of Directive 76/464/EEC. 
Example for NB (d): 
Definition of emission standard 
(1) Applicable to the total quantity of mercury present in all mercury-containing water discharged from the site of the industrial plant. 
(2) Applicable to the mercury present in effluent discharged from the chlorine production unit. 
(3) The maximum permitted water consumption corresponds in principle to 10 m3/t permitted production capacity and the emission factor is 0,5 g/t (produced), derived from the best technical means available. However, because the concentration of mercury in effluents depends upon the volume of water involved, which is different for different processes and plants, the limit values expressed in terms of quantity of mercury discharged in relation to installed chlorine production capacity given in the table must be observed in all cases. 
(4) The daily average limit values are four times the corresponding monthly average limit values. 
Monitoring 
In order to check whether the discharges comply with the emission standards which have been fixed in accordance with the limit values laid down in this Annex, a monitoring procedure must be instituted. This procedure must provide for: 
- the taking each day of a sample representative of the discharge over a period of 24 hours and the measurement of the mercury concentration of that sample, and 
- the measurement of the total flow of the discharge over that period. 
The quantity of mercury discharged during a month must be calculated by adding together the quantities of mercury discharged each day during that month. This total must then be divided by the installed chlorine (monthly) production capacity. (For the purpose of clarification, 'monthly' has to be added, although it is not mentioned in Directive 82/176/EEC). 
Method of measurement 
EEC - reference method of measurement - see description in Annex III Directive 72/176/EEC. 
Explanation for A6: 
This question refers to all discharges mentioned under A1 and A2 and requires a calculation of the sum of all quantities of substances discharged as authorized in the permits. This represents the maximum quantity of discharged substances to be expected. If values for actual emissions are available, they should be indicated in brackets. Indicate also the sum of the authorized values for discharges into sewers and, as far as available, an estimation of the emission into surface waters after further treatment. 
Explanation for A7: 
The question focuses on both the substance discharged and the discharger and is source-oriented. Thus one discharger can be first on both the mercury list and the cadmium list. 
The quantity of the discharges and thus their ranking are to be determined by the size of the annual load permitted (see limit values in A3 and A4). 
For the limit values concerning the concentration and quantity discharged in relation to production capacity/quantity used, indicate, as appropriate, daily, monthly or annual reference periods. 
Details on the location should include information on major river basins/coastal zones or administrative regions concerned as applicable in A1 to A6 and should provide the geographical coordinates. 
Explanation and example for A9: 
The information on the total number of monitoring stations for the aquatic environment should be provided in form of the chart given in A9 where, if needed, further columns have to be added. 
The selection of the monitoring stations for the communication of monitoring results should cover the international measurement network referred to in Council Decision 77/795/EEC (1) completed, as the case might be, by monitoring stations which are not comprised herein of major river basins/coastal zones or inner surface waters, estuaries, inner coastal waters other than estuaries and territorial sea waters in analogy to question A8. 
Explanation for B3/B4: 
The emission standards to be indicated refer to national or regional compulsory or recommended values given by the competent/legislative/statutory authorities (see B1), not to the values set in the permit given by competent/local authorities. Where numerous individual standards exist, it is not necessary to record the individual values of the authorizations given by the competent authority, but to summarize the range of emission standards contained in such authorizations. 
The information requested in NB (c) indent 2 has to be seen in the light of the discretionary power given to the competent authority under Article 7 (4) to take into account the latest economically feasible technical developments. 
The description of emission standards indicated in the table are examples following Article 5 for List I substances, Directive 76/464/EEC. Indicate other valid national/regional definitions if applicable and explain as necessary. 
If the emissions permitted are given in g/t production capacity/-quantity used, indicate the period of time to which this value is related. 
Explanation for B6: 
It can be assumed that not all information on such discharges can be made available from a centralized data base. Unlike in part A, municipal waste water treatment plants are not excluded from this 'inventory' if they discharge large amounts of the substances concerned. If values for actual emissions are available, they should be indicated in brackets. Indicate also the sum of the authorized values for discharges into sewers and, where available an estimation of the emission into surface waters after further treatment. Double counting of emission to surface water and/or sewers must be avoided by careful consideration. To answer question B6, only the discharges of large emitters of main substances are to be added up. 
The question covers those emitters: 
- discharging more than 50 kg/a of one substance, and 
- which are subjected to national/regional emission standards or water protection programmes. 
It is particularly recommended that data on the following substances are provided: 
- copper, zinc, lead, arsenic, chromium, nickel, trifluralin, endosulfan, simazine, atrazine, tributyltin compounds, triphenyltin compounds, azinphos-ethyl, azinphos-methyl, fenitrothion, fenthion, malathion, parathion, parthion-methyl, dichlorvos, trichlorethane, 
- 1,2-dichlorethylene, vinyl chloride, benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylene, isopropylbenzene. 
Explanation for B7: 
Please refer to A8. The same is valid here. 
Explanation for B8: 
The required information is equivalent to A9, i. e. information provided via the monitoring stations of the international measurement network only complemented by representative stations for the areas not covered. The explanations to A9 are equivalent here, measurement results for sediment and biota as far as available. 
Explanations for Appendix 2: 
Footnote (1) indicates, in accordance with the stipulated low thresholds in the daughter directives of Directive 76/464/EEC, where simplified monitoring procedure for certain industries/processes are set up. In that case information on the discharges should be restricted to those exceeding the given thresholds. 
Footnote (2) shall make it clear where meanwhile Member States will set emission standards independently, in accordance with Directive 76/464/EEC.
