2005/559/: Decision No&amp;nbsp;2/2005 of the EC-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit of 17 June 2005 amending the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure 
Decision No 2/2005 of the EC-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit 
of 17 June 2005 
amending the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure 
(2005/559/EC) 
THE JOINT COMMITTEE, 
Having regard to the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure [1], and in particular Article 15(3)(a) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The identity and nationality of means of transport at departure is regarded as mandatory information that has to be entered in box 18 of a transit declaration. 
(2) At container terminals that have high levels of traffic it may occur that the details of the road means of transport to be used for the transport are unknown at the time when the transit formalities are carried out. Nevertheless, the identification of the container in which the goods subject to the transit declaration will be carried is available and is already indicated in box 31 of the transit declaration. 
(3) Under these circumstances and considering that the goods can be controlled on this basis, an appropriate degree of flexibility should be offered by allowing the box 18 of the transit declaration not to be completed, in so far as it can be ensured that the proper details will be subsequently entered in the relevant box. 
(4) The Convention should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
Annex A7 of Appendix III to the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision. 
Article 2 
This decision shall enter into force on the day it is adopted. 
It shall apply from 1 July 2005. 
Done at Bern, 17 June 2005.

-------------------------------------------------- 
ANNEX 
In Annex A7 to Appendix III, Title II, Point I of the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure, the following shall be inserted as a second subparagraph in the explanatory note for box 18: 
"However, where goods are carried in containers that are to be transported by road vehicles, competent authorities may authorise the principal to leave this box blank where the logistical pattern at the point of departure may prevent the identity and nationality of the means of transport to be provided at the time of establishment of the transit declaration, and where they can ensure that the proper information concerning the means of transport shall be subsequently entered in box 55."
