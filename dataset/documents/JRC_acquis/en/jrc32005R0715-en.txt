Commission Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;715/2005 of 12 May 2005 opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 02062991 (1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006) 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 715/2005 
of 12 May 2005 
opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 02062991 ( 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [1], and in particular Article 32(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The WTO schedule CXL requires the Community to open an annual import quota of 53000 tonnes of frozen beef covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 02062991 (order number 09.4003). Implementing rules should be laid down for the quota year 2005/06 starting on 1 July 2005. 
(2) The 2004/05 quota was managed in conformity with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1203/2004 of 29 June 2004 opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 02062991 ( 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005) [2]. That Regulation introduced a method of administration based on an import performance criterion ensuring that the quota is allocated to professional operators able to import beef without undue speculation. 
(3) The experience obtained from the application of that method shows that there are positive results and therefore it is appropriate to maintain the same method of administration for the quota year 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006. 
(4) It is appropriate to determine a reference period for eligible imports which is long enough to provide for a representative performance while also sufficiently recent to reflect the latest development in trade. 
(5) For control reasons, applications for import rights should be submitted in the Member States where the operator is entered in the national VAT register. 
(6) In order to prevent speculation, a security relating to import rights should be fixed for each applicant under the quota. 
(7) To oblige operators to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, it should be established that such obligation constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products [3]. 
(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [4] and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 [5] should be applicable to import licences issued under this Regulation, save where derogations are appropriate. 
(9) The Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not given an opinion within the time limit set by its President, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. A tariff quota totalling 53000 tonnes expressed in weight of boneless meat is hereby opened for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 02062991 for the period 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2006.

Article 6 
1. In order to be admissible, the application for import rights must be accompanied by a security of EUR 6 per 100 kilograms boneless equivalent.
