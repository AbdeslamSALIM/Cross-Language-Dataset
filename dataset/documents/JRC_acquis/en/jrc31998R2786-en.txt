Whereas Directive 70/524/EEC provides that new additives or uses of additives may be authorised, taking account of advances in scientific and technical knowledge; 
Whereas a provisional authorisation of new additives or uses of additives may be given for a period of five years, if, at the level permitted in feedingstuffs, it does not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment, nor harm the consumer by altering the characteristics of livestock product, if its presence in feedingstuffs can be controlled, and it is reasonable to assume, in view of the available results, that it has a favourable effect on the characteristics of those feedingstuffs or on livestock production when incorporated in such feedingstuffs; 
Whereas research into various additives referred to in Article 9i(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC and transferred to Chapter III of Annex B to this Directive which can accordingly be authorised provisionally at national level until 30 November 1998 has not yet been completed; whereas, therefore, the period of authorisation of these substances should be extended for a determined period; 
Whereas the Commission has consulted the Scientific Committee for animal nutrition concerning the authorisation of the antibiotics and the coccidiostats included in the Annex to the present Regulation; whereas this Committee delivered an opinion with regard to the efficacy, the safety and the controllability of these substances; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs,
