Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the position to be adopted by the European Community and its Member States within the Association Council established by the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Tunisia, of the other part, with regard to the adoption of a Recommendation on the implementation of the EU-Tunisia Action Plan 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The 2002 Copenhagen European Council, closing accession negotiations with ten applicant States, recognised that enlargement presented an important opportunity to take forward relations with neighbouring countries based on shared values, and stated that the Union remained determined to avoid new dividing lines in Europe and to promote stability and prosperity within and beyond the new borders of the Union. 
The Commission Communication “Wider Europe - Neighbourhood: A New Framework for Relations with our Eastern and Southern Neighbours” of March 2003[1] proposed the establishment of Action Plans with partner countries. On 16 June 2003, the Council welcomed this Communication and invited the Commission, with the contribution, where appropriate, of the High Representative, to present proposals for Action Plans for all countries concerned as appropriate, commencing with Ukraine, Moldova, and Southern Mediterranean partners with Association Agreements. 
On 14 June 2004, the Council welcomed the Commission Communication “European Neighbourhood Policy – Strategy Paper”[2]. The Council also welcomed the Commission proposal to pursue the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) through Action Plans to be agreed jointly with the neighbouring countries concerned and invited the Commission to propose such Action Plans. Action Plans should have a minimum duration of three years and be subject to renewal by mutual consent. They should be based on common principles but be differentiated, as appropriate, taking into account the specificities of each neighbour, its national reform processes and its relations with the EU. Action Plans should be comprehensive but at the same time identify clearly a limited number of key priorities and offer real incentives for reform. Action Plans should also contribute, where possible, to regional cooperation. The Council also defined how to advance and monitor implementation of action plans. 
The Commission, in close cooperation with the Presidency and the High Representative on issues related to political cooperation and the CFSP, has held exploratory talks with Tunisia which have resulted in agreement on a draft Action Plan. It covers a timeframe of three to five years. Its implementation will help fulfil the provisions in the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement and will contribute to an increasingly close relationship with Tunisia, involving a significant degree of economic integration and a deepening of political co-operation. Implementation of the Action Plan will significantly advance the approximation of Tunisia’s legislation, norms and standards to those of the European Union. 
The Action Plan is a broad tool for economic and political co-operation, carrying to a further stage the commitments and objectives contained in the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement. 
In accordance with the Council Conclusions of 14 June 2004, stipulating that the Action Plans will be approved by the Council and subsequently endorsed by the respective Association or Co-operation Councils, the Commission attaches the text of a proposal for a Council Decision on the position to be taken by the European Community and its Member States within the EU-Tunisia Association Council with regard to the adoption of a Recommendation on the implementation of the Action Plan in annex. 
The Commission therefore requests the Council to adopt the attached proposal for a Council Decision.

ANNEX 
EU/TUNISIA ACTION PLAN 
1. Introduction 
The enlargement of the European Union, which became fact on 1 May 2004, has profoundly altered the political, geographical and economic situation of the Union, providing the opportunity to consolidate and deepen its relations with the neighbouring countries to the East and South. The European neighbourhood policy will go beyond existing ties to offer the EU's neighbours the prospect of a significant measure of economic integration through gradual integration in the internal market and deepening of political, cultural and social cooperation. 
The European Union and Tunisia are determined to seize this opportunity in order to strengthen the ties between them and promote stability, security and prosperity on the basis of a partnership based on solidarity and common interests. The approach is founded on partnership, joint ownership and differentiation. 
Tunisia and the EU want to give a new dimension to every aspect of the Association Agreement through the deepening of their political, economic, social, cultural and scientific ties and cooperation on security and environmental questions. Cross-border, transnational and inter-regional cooperation and shared responsibility for conflict prevention, conflict resolution and disaster management also form part of the new European neighbourhood policy. 
This EU neighbourhood policy sets ambitious goals based on the mutually recognised acceptance of common values such as democracy, the rule of law, good governance, respect for human rights, market economics, free trade, sustainable development, poverty alleviation and the strengthening of political, economic, social and institutional reforms. 
The level of ambition of the future relationship will depend on the degree of commitment of both parties to common values and their capacity to implement undertakings made. The rate of progress of the relationship will acknowledge fully the efforts and concrete achievements in meeting jointly agreed priorities. 
Rapprochement with the Union represents a constant and a fundamental foreign policy choice for Tunisia which will continue to strive, in parallel, towards promoting integration in the Maghreb region and strengthening its ties with Arab, Mediterranean and African countries. The neighbourhood policy will allow Tunisia to reinforce the strategic foundation of this choice whilst respecting its national identity and characteristics. 
This Action Plan is the first step in a process covering a timeframe of three to five years. It will enable a more targeted implementation of the instruments provided for in the Association Agreement between the EU and Tunisia with a view to bringing Tunisian economic, social and science structures more into line with those of the Union. The process also advances and supports the approximation of Tunisian legislation, norms and standards with those of the Union in the areas covered by the plan. 
It will lay foundations for economic integration based on the adoption and implementation of trade-related rules and regulations with the potential to enhance trade, competitiveness, investment and growth in line with the objectives of regional economic integration. 
The Action Plan, which by virtue of its flexibility can be adapted to Tunisia's needs and specificities, will also support the development and implementation of policies designed to promote economic growth, employment and social cohesion, reduce poverty and protect the environment, thereby contributing to the long-term objective of sustainable development. 
This Action Plan and the priorities it contains will be jointly prepared by Tunisia and the European Union who will work together in close cooperation on its implementation, evaluation and any necessary adaptations. 
Implementation of the Action Plan will take account of the necessary balance between speeding up the process of opening and modernising the Tunisian economy and the imperative of sustainable socio-economic development. 
New partnership perspectives 
The European Neighbourhood Policy opens new partnership perspectives: 
- the prospect of moving beyond the existing relationship to a significant degree of integration, including offering Tunisia a stake in the internal market and the possibility of participating progressively in key aspects of EU policies and programmes; 
- an upgrade in the scope and intensity of political cooperation through enhanced political dialogue; 
- the opportunity for convergence of economic legislation, the opening of economies to each other, and the continued reduction of trade barriers, which will stimulate investment and growth; 
- increased financial support: the EU will grant additional financial assistance to Tunisia to support implementation of the Association Agreement and of the operations identified in the Action Plan, in particular to enhance the economy’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and to strengthen institutional capacity as well as investments and infrastructure. Furthermore, the Commission will be proposing a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which will also cover the key issue of cross-border and transnational cooperation between Tunisia and the EU so as to promote integration and economic and social cohesion and lessen development gaps between regions. The EIB will also help support infrastructure investment and private sector development and partnership through the FEMIP facility; 
- the possibility of gradually opening access to or increasing participation in certain Community fora and programmes, particularly in the areas covered by the Action Plan; 
- support, including targeted technical assistance and twinning schemes, with a view to approximation with EU legislation through a mechanism such as TAIEX in the areas covered by the Action Plan; 
- deepening trade and economic relations which will be progressively extended to cover the sectors of agriculture and services and to create favourable conditions for an increase in investment and export; 
- strengthening administrative and judicial cooperation; 
- enhanced cooperation between administrations participating in institutionalised thematic subcommittees. 
In light of the fulfilment of the objectives of this Action Plan and of the overall evolution of EU - Tunisia relations, consideration will be given to the possibility of a new contractual relationship. The Commission has suggested that this could take the form of a European Neighbourhood Agreement. Tunisia has indicated its support for the Commission's suggestion. The advisability of any new contractual arrangement will be considered in due time in the context of the European Neighbourhood Policy. 
Priority actions 
This Action Plan sets out a broad range of priorities in areas falling within the scope of the Association Agreement. Among these priorities, all of which are important, particular attention should be given to: 
- the pursuit and consolidation of reforms which guarantee democracy and the rule of law; 
- enhancing political dialogue and cooperation in areas such as democracy and human rights, foreign and security policy, cooperation in the fight against terrorism, whilst promoting respect for human rights; 
- the development of conditions conducive to foreign direct investment, growth and sustainable development; 
- improving the climate and conditions for the development of competitive businesses and entrepreneurship; 
- the development of scientific research, higher education, education in general and training as the cornerstones of the knowledge society; 
- cooperation on labour issues and social policy and the gradual approximation of Tunisian legislation to EU rules and regulations; 
- facilitating trade in goods and services, including through the negotiation of free trade agreements; 
- the approximation of technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures; 
- development of the transport sector based on safety, security and reinforcement of national and regional infrastructures and their inter-connection with the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T); 
- with a view to the gradual integration of the Maghreb energy markets into the EU internal energy market, implementing the Memorandum of Understanding on the gradual integration of the electricity markets of the Maghreb countries into the EU's internal electricity market; development of networks; 
- effective management of migration flows, including the possibility of concluding a readmission agreement with the European Community; 
- facilitating the movement of persons within existing structures in accordance with the acquis, by looking in particular at possibilities of relaxing short-stay visa formalities for certain categories of persons. 
- Progress in meeting the priorities contained in the Action Plan will be jointly monitored in sub-committees established by the Association Agreement. On this basis, the EU and Tunisia will review the content of the Action Plan and decide on any adaptations and updates required. After three years, the EU and Tunisia may decide on the next step in the development of bilateral relations, including the possibility of new contractual links. This could take the form of a European Neighbourhood Agreement whose scope will be defined in the light of progress in meeting the priorities set out in the Action Plan.
