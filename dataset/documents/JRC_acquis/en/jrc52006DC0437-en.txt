COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE 
Developing a comprehensive and coherent EU strategy to measure crime and criminal justice: An EU Action Plan 2006 – 2010 
INTRODUCTION 
1. PURPOSE 
The purpose of this Communication is to outline a coherent framework within which statistical information on crime[i] (including victimisation) and criminal justice[ii] at European Union level will be developed, mainly by actions of the European Commission, with the support of Member State representatives and in coordination with relevant EU and international organisations[iii]. 
The Communication includes an action plan that sets out the framework and the main actions for the next five year period. An expert group, with representatives of all Member States, is set up by Commission Decision to support the Commission in the implementation of the action plan where it concerns the identification of policy needs for data in the area of crime and criminal justice at EU level[iv], the decision is annexed to this Communication. In addition, the possibility will be examined in the European Statistical System (ESS) of setting up in 2006 a group of representatives of all Member States to work on the development of crime and criminal justice statistics[v]. 
2. POLITICAL COMMITMENTS 
The need to develop statistics on crime and criminal justice has long been recognised by the Member States and by the European Commission. Already the Millennium Strategy on organised crime[vi] recommended the elaboration of crime statistics. The interim evaluation of the Millennium Strategy[vii] called upon the Commission to launch a study on statistics in the area of organised crime and submit a proposal for the setting up of a research, documentation and statistical network. 
The Dublin Declaration[viii], recommends that "a comprehensive system of European crime statistics should be elaborated and a co-ordinated EU Crime Statistics Strategy be developed." and states that “The objective of the strategy should be to provide information necessary for analysing trends, assessing risks, evaluating measures and benchmarking performance", to be supported by input from a Crime Experts Group and the EU Crime Prevention Network. 
The Hague Programme[ix], outlining developments for the next five years in the area of freedom, security and justice welcomed "the initiative of the Commission to establish European instruments for collecting, analysing and comparing information on crime and victimisation and their respective trends in Member States, using national statistics and other sources of information as agreed indicators." The Council and Commission Action Plan implementing the Hague Programme[x] mentions this Communication. 
3. STATE OF PLAY AND THE NEED FOR FUTURE ACTION 
Since early 2004, the European Commission has allocated human and financial resources to making preparations, developing internal coordination and setting up informal structures with relevant actors and consulting informally Member States representatives in the relevant areas. The Commission has also funded a number of research projects[xi] and more limited studies[xii] to increase the knowledge in the area, and has built a network of academics with knowledge in the field. In the area of freedom, security and justice, a number of meetings under the Forum for the prevention of organised crime[xiii] have been organised to consult Member States in a wider group. Many other EU and international organisations have increased work to develop relevant statistics[xiv]. 
As far as the statistical context is concerned, the production of Community statistics is governed by rules set out in Council Regulation on Community Statistics[xv], and actions on the establishment of Community statistics are carried out according to the Community Statistical Programme and its Annual Programmes[xvi], respecting the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice[xvii]. Important issues concerning data protection and confidentiality are included. Within this framework, crime and criminal justice statistics have been included in the annual work programme since 2005 and Eurostat has held regular consultations within the structure of the European Statistical System (ESS). 
The action plan is thus designed to incorporate and consolidate these experiences and achievements. 
4. OBJECTIVES 
One of the main deficiencies in the area of Justice, Freedom and Security is still the lack of reliable and comparable[xviii] statistical information. Quantitative information on the trends and levels as well as on the structure of crime and terrorism and of the measures taken to prevent and fight these problems in Member States and at EU level, and where possible international comparisons, is essential for the development of a knowledge based system of effective and efficient policies for the prevention of and fight against crime and terrorism. In view of increased financial resources from 2007, it has become apparent that the lack of knowledge in this area needs to be addressed in a coherent and comprehensive manner. 
Different expert groups and organisations compile available national statistics and make efforts to compare levels and trends. However, national statistics differ on so many factors that comparisons between countries, even with extensive efforts to make them comparable, are almost impossible. The actions outlined in the action plan therefore rest on the principle of subsidiarity. As in many other policy areas, there is agreement amongst key actors on the necessity to develop a framework to produce comparable statistics at EU level, based on harmonised definitions and collection procedures. 
The objective is thus to develop statistics that will, in the longer term, make comparisons possible regarding the structure, levels and trends of crime as well as on criminal justice measures between Member States and regions within Member States. The task of making national and sub-national statistics comparable across the EU may be attempted by making use of the Commission's role to define harmonised methodologies and data collection methods for Community statistics. A twin-track approach will be adopted. In the short term, available national data will be collected and quality-assessed to form the first Community statistics on crime and criminal justice. Significant efforts will however be devoted to developing truly EU-level comparable statistics through different methods outlined in the action plan. 
5. AN EXPERT GROUP ON THE POLICY NEEDS FOR DATA ON CRIME AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
The establishment of an expert group to support the Commission in identifying the policy needs for data on crime and criminal justice[xix] will aid the pooling of scarce resources on the user side, increasing synergy benefits by avoiding the duplication of work on organised and volume crime and across the EU Commission, EU bodies and agencies and other international organisations active in the field. 
6. MAINSTREAMING STATISTICAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION 
The development of comparable statistics can only be achieved if the Member States collect data in a harmonised way. Achieving harmonisation in areas where Member States already have national systems in place for the collection of data requires extensive resources and is often complicated. This is therefore identified as a medium term goal requiring a stepwise approach. It can only be achieved by involving Member States and the European Commission, on the basis of an assessment of the urgent need for such harmonised information, or on the basis of legal binding acts. 
The potential to agree on the build-up of knowledge could however be more appropriate in connection with a new framework decision, directive or regulation that includes common measures to prevent and fight crime by common definition or agreement. Quantitative information on the structure, level and trends of the problem the instrument addresses as well as on the implementation of the instrument are necessary elements for subsequent evaluation as to the effectiveness of the instrument. 
Whenever legal instruments designed to prevent or fight crime are drafted, the Commission will therefore, as a mainstreaming initiative, introduce a requirement to provide appropriate statistics in a form adapted to the practices of the European Statistical System. 
7. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ACTION PLAN AND FOLLOW-UP 
At present, competencies and tools necessary for evaluation in the field of crime and criminal justice are being developed. Statistics on criminal justice in the EU are necessary to enable the Commission to carry out ex ante and ex post evaluations of its policies and proposals. A Communication on evaluation of justice policies, scheduled for adoption in autumn 2006, will set out what evaluation methods the Commission has in mind and will give further details of the relevant statistical areas. The action plan will be updated as this work develops, and activities identified will be included in the relevant Commission work programmes and in the Community Statistical Programme and its annual work programmes. The action plan will also need to be extended when new instruments relating to crime and criminal justice are agreed. The new financial perspectives will reflect the need for support to Member States in implementing the action plan. 
The Commission will prepare a mid-term review in 2008 and inform the relevant Council working groups on progress. At the end of 2010, the Commission will prepare a report to the European Parliament and the Council on achievements in the implementation of the Action Plan and outline proposals for future work in the area (including the status of the expert group) in the context of examining the need of a legal instrument on European Union statistics on crime and criminal justice.

[xii] For example the following projects, funded under the AGIS programme (Framework programme on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, managed by DG JLS of the European Commission): 
- The project JAI 2003/AGIS/051 "Developing an EU statistical apparatus for measuring organised crime, assessing its risk and evaluating organised crime policies", managed by Transcrime, Centro interdipartimentale di ricerca sulla criminalità transnazionale – Università di Trento; 
- The project JAI 2003/AGIS/111 " Séminaire sur l'évaluation des performances de la justice pénale", arranged by the Ministry of Justice, Italy. The conference proceedings of the seminar held in October 2004, "Measuring Performance of Criminal Justice – Measuring Justice? Comparison of National Experiences" was published in a trilingual volume during spring 2006. 
Many other projects that are relevant both generally, and for specific crime types, have been funded by the AGIS programme and the predecessors. Under the AGIS programme 2006, at least two studies that are important for developing statistics on crime and criminal justice, are foreseen to be funded. 
[xiii] The Forum for the prevention of organised crime – hereafter called "the Forum" - was foreseen in the Commission Communication on crime prevention (COM (2000) 786 of 29.11.2000) which presented some orientations and proposals for further action. The Forum aims to bring together a wide range of interested stakeholders, such as national law-enforcement authorities, business and professional groups, academic researchers, non-governmental organisations and civil society as a whole to discuss new approaches in preventing organised crime, in an illustration of partnership at European level. 
[xiv] One example is the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) who has undertaken research and reporting that addresses some of the key concerns for improvement in criminal justice data collection. The EUMC publishes information on the statust of data collection on racist violence and crime in the EU Member States. These reports classify existing data collection mechanisms in the EU 25, and also provide information on trends in racist crime for those Member States for which dta is available. Given the absence of comprehensive official criminal justice data on racist violence and crime in many Member States, the EUMC has launched a pilot survey to look at ethnic minorities and immigrants' experience of criminal victimisation.

[xviii] The word "comparable" in this Communication relates not only to one of the requirements concerning the quality of Community statistics, but also to the possibility to use the statistics to compare for example the extent of a certain type of crime in one Member State to that of another, or to compare the number of police officers between Member States. The problem with using the national statistics as a base is that they are based on different definitions and the reporting and recording procedures differ. Police discretion differ between Member States, as do the point in time when a police reported crime is recorded in the statistical database (at the time when the crime is first reported to the police, after preliminary investigation only or after a more thorough investigation). Furthermore, the methods for counting crime

[xxxiii] One example of important contextual information is information relating to the number (and the characteristics) of cases which contain cross-border elements, other examples are if crimes include a racistic or xenophobic component, information about the method used to commit a crime, value of stolen goods etc. 
[xxxiv] Important and obvious background information is age and gender. Other information that is generally important for EU policy purposes in the area of criminal justice is nationality and residence. Information like this would help to identify the needs for EU level measures. 
[xxxv] Where relevant, disaggregated data at sub-national/regional level should be included. 
[xxxvi] At present it is clear that it is desirable for policy needs to have information on the following: 
- Criminal justice budget (excluding prison budget) including number of judges, prosecutors and defence lawyers, legal aid (and number of cases in which legal aid was provided by the state) and budget for training (on judicial cooperation and for interpreters and translators)
