COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2315/95 of 29 September 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of export refunds to certain sugars covered by the common organization of the market in sugar used in certain products processed from fruit and vegetables 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 of 24 February 1986 on the common organization of the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2314/95 (2), and in particular Articles 13 (8), 14 (5) and 14a (7) thereof, 
Whereas in accordance with Article 13 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, an export licence is required before any refund can be granted; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (4), lays down detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1628/95 (6), establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1384/95 (8), lays down common rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products; whereas those rules must be supplemented by specific rules on certain sugars covered by the common organization of the market in sugar used in certain products processed from fruit and vegetables; 
Whereas, pursuant to Article 13 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, refunds must be fixed within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty; 
Whereas, with this in mind, and to prevent distortion of competition, the system of export refunds for certain sugars covered by the common organization of the market in sugar used in certain products processed from fruit and vegetables should be brought into line with the system provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1464/95 of 27 June 1995 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences in the sugar sector (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2136/95 (10), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (11); 
Whereas provision should be made for licences to have a longer duration of validity than that laid down for sugar in its unaltered state; 
Whereas, pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, the Member States must check the accuracy of the declarations indicating the quantities of sugar used in production; whereas, in order to guarantee the smooth operation of the system, checks should be carried out on at least 5 % of declarations; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,
