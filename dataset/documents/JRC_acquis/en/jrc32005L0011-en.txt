Commission Directive 2005/11/EC 
of 16 February 2005 
amending, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical progress, Council Directive 92/23/EEC relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers [1], and in particular Article 13(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/23/EEC of 31 March 1992 relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting [2], and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 92/23/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC. 
(2) Directive 92/23/EEC as amended by Directive 2001/43/EC provides the possibility for type-approval authorities to accept tyre manufacturersâ&#x20AC;&#x2122; laboratories as approved test laboratories until 31 December 2005. The experience with this provision has been very positive and therefore the possibility should be continued and that deadline should be removed. 
(3) Technical progress in the tyre-producing sector is very fast. Due to strong demand from consumers and the car industry, the production cycles of tyres become faster and the variety of tyre types is constantly increasing. This situation is expected to become even more critical in the future since very expensive or unique test installations and expertise will be required. In order to be able to bring the newly developed products on to the market without delay, a sufficient number of test facilities, which can be used in a flexible manner, is indispensable. 
(4) In line with the development of superior tyres due to technical progress, the related test procedures need to be more and more sophisticated. There is currently no test capacity outside that of tyre manufacturers that would be able to cope with the high number of tests needed. 
(5) Directive 92/23/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
