Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on a Community position within the EU-South Africa Cooperation Council on the amendment of the relevant Annexes to the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other part, to phase out and eliminate the duties on some automotive products into the TDCA 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal Article 106 (1) of the EU-SA Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) empowers the Cooperation Council to amend the TDCA in order to accelerate the reduction of customs duties more rapidly than is provided for in Article 11, or otherwise improve the conditions of access under the Article. In this context, the objective of the proposed Council Decision is to phase out and eliminate the duties on some automotive products | 
120 | General context This draft Decision follows an agreement on automotive which was reached by both parties, at political level on 6 April 2006. This balanced agreement follows a long period of intensive negotiations which started at the conclusion of the TDCA in 1999. The settlement of this difficult issue is not only a very positive signal for the economic operators involved, which eagerly expected a transparent and predictable solution since a long time, but also for the future of EU-SA trade relations which are currently being re-shaped into a more ambitious partnership. | 
130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005. | 
141 | Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union This draft Decision is part of the broader Review exercise which both sides have agreed to undertake according to Article 103 of the TDCA. | 
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | 
Consultation of interested parties | 
219 | The parties were consulted, orally, on the outcome on the agreement reached on 6 April 2006. Representatives from EU automotive industry have regularly been informed on the outcome of the talks during the whole negotiating period. | 
Collection and use of expertise | 
229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 
230 | Impact assessment not applicable | 
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 
305 | Summary of the proposed action This Decision takes into account the consolidation of the tariff preferences on automotive granted to SA by the Community scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) as well as the elimination of the duty on some automotive products. It is proposed that this amendment to the TDCA should enter into force as from 1st October 2006. | 
310 | Legal basis Article 133 of the Treaty establishing the EC. | 
329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | 
Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | 
331 | This proposal will consolidate into the TDCA the current GSP duty, already enjoyed by SA (before graduation) and thus will not represent a major change in the tariff treatment and in the administrative requirement (proofs of origin). The proposed form of action (Council Decision within the EU-SA Cooperation Council) is as simple as possible in the context EU-SA legal framework (TDCA). | 
Choice of instruments | 
341 | Proposed instruments: Council Decision. | 
342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). It is the only way to amend TDCA trade provisions. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 
409 | Due to its financial impact on EC own resources (customs revenue) the proposal has an implication for the Community budget. This impact is summarised in the annexed financial statement. |

COUNCIL DECISION 
on a Community position within the EU-South Africa Cooperation Council on the amendment of the relevant Annexes to the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement (TDCA) between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other part, to phase out and eliminate the duties on some automotive products into the TDCA 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) In order to ensure clarity, long term economic predictability and legal certainty for economic operators, it is considered appropriate to consolidate into the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other part (TDCA)[1], the remaining tariff preferences granted to South Africa by the Community scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) on automotive products, as well as the elimination of the duty on some automotive products, and not yet provided for by the Community tariff concessions listed in the relevant Annexes to the TDCA. 
(2) South Africa, as a current beneficiary country under the Community scheme of generalised tariff preferences, will benefit by means of the enclosed Decision of the Joint Cooperation Council, from a commercial agreement giving preferential treatment including all the preferences related to automotive products provided for by the tariff scheme contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005 of 27 June 2005 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences[2], 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Sole Article 
The position to be adopted by the Community within the Joint Cooperation Council on the amendment of the relevant Annexes to the Trade, Development and Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, on the one part, and the Republic of South Africa, on the other part, to take into account the consolidation of the tariff preferences on automotive products granted to South Africa by the Community scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP), shall be based on the draft Decision of the Cooperation Council annexed to this Decision.
