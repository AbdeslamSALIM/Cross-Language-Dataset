COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/24/EEC of 31 March 1992 relating to speed limitation devices or similar speed limitation on-board systems of certain categories of motor vehicles 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas it is important to adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured; 
Whereas the technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to speed limitation of certain categories of vehicle; 
Whereas these requirements differ from one Member State to another; whereas it is therefore necessary for all Member States to adopt the same requirements either in addition to, or in place of, their existing rules in order to allow, in particular, the EEC type-approval procedure which was the subject of Directive 70/156/EEC (4) to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle; 
Whereas, with a view to improving road safety and reducing the severity of injuries in cases of accidents with heavy goods vehicles and buses, it is considered urgently necessary to fit speed limitation devices to these categories of motor vehicle; 
Whereas in respect of environment and economy a reduction of air pollution and fuel consumption can be achieved; 
Whereas, in all cases where the Council confers powers upon the Commission to implement rules laid down in the motor vehicle sector, it is appropriate to provide for a procedure of prior consultation between the Commission and the Member States within an Advisory Committee; 
Whereas it is reasonable and useful to undertake research activities relating to the development of variable speed limitation devices activated in conformity with the speed limits warranted by the prevailing road and traffic conditions within the framework of the Drive-programme, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

7. REQUIREMENTS 
7.1. General 
7.1.1. The speed limitation must be such that the vehicle in normal use, despite the vibrations to which it may be subjected, complies with the provisions of this Directive. The speed limitation device shall be so designed, constructed and assembled as to enable the vehicle in normal use, fitted with the speed limitation device, to comply with the provisions of this Directive. 
7.1.2. In particular, the speed limitation device of the vehicle must be so designed, constructed and assembled as to resist corrosion and ageing phenomena to which it may be exposed and to resist tampering. 
7.1.2.1. The limitation threshold must not, in any case, be capable of being increased or removed temporarily or permanently on vehicles in use. The inviolability shall be demonstrated to the technical service with documentation analysing the failure mode in which the system will be globally examined. 
The analysis shall show, taking into account the different states taken by the system, the consequences of a modification of the input or output states on the functioning, the possibilities of obtaining these modifications by failures or by tampering and the possibility of their occurence. The analysis level will be always to the first failure. 
7.1.2.2. The speed limitation function, the speed limitation device and the connections necessary for its operation, except those essential for the running of the vehicle, shall be capable of being protected from any unauthorized adjustments or the interruption of its energy supply by the attachment of sealing devices and/or the need to use special tools. 
7.1.3. The speed limitation function and the speed limitation device shall not actuate the vehicle's service braking system. A permanent brake (e.g. retarder) may be incorporated only if it operates after the speed limitation device has restricted the fuel feed to the minimum fuel position. 
7.1.4. The speed limitation function or the speed limitation device must be such that its does not affect the vehicle's road speed if a positive action on the accelerator is applied when the vehicle is running at its set speed. 
7.1.5. The speed limitation function or the speed limitation device may allow normal accelerator control for the purposes of gear changing. 
7.1.6. No malfunction or tampering shall result in an increase in engine power above that demanded by the position of the driver's accelerator. 
7.1.7. The speed limitation function shall be obtained regardless of the accelerator control used if there is more than one such control which may be reached from the driver's seating position. 
7.1.8. The speed limitation function or the speed limitation device shall operate satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without unacceptable electromagnetic disturbance for anything in this environment. 
7.1.9. All components necessary for the full function of the speed limitation or the speed limitation device shall be energized whenever the vehicle is being driven. 
7.2. Special requirements 
7.2.1. For the different categories of motor vehicles the limitation speed V shall be set in accordance with Directive 92/6/EEC. 
7.2.2. This speed limitation may be achieved either by the equipment of the motor vehicles with EEC type-approved speed limitation devices or similar systems on board of the vehicles fulfilling the same speed limitation function. 
7.2.3. The set speed shall be indicated on a plate in a conspicuous position in the driver compartment of each vehicle. 
8. TEST 
The speed limitation tests to which the vehicle or the speed limitation device presented for EEC type-approval is submitted as well as the limitation performances required, are described in Annex III to this Directive.
