THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 7(2) and Articles 15 and 23 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1203/2003(4), fixed the deadline for the period referred to in Article 2(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 during which a producer may obtain replanting rights after the area concerned has been planted. Since the date for applying the procedure provided for in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 has been postponed, the abovementioned deadline should also be extended accordingly. 
(2) So that the allocations provided for in Article 14(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 can be determined effectively, the date by which the Member States must make their annual notifications to the Commission should be amended and the date to be used for the purposes of determining the expenditure actually incurred and expenditure validated should be fixed. 
(3) The fixed format of the data and information which the Member States must send to the Commission must also be adapted as regards the classification of vine varieties. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
