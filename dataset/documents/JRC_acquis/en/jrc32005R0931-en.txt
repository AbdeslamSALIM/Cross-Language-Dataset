Commission Regulation (EC) No 931/2005 
of 6 June 2005 
amending Annexes I, II, III B and VI to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules [1], and in particular Article 28 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) As a result of the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1810/2004 of 7 September 2004 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff [2], it is necessary to amend Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 as well. 
(2) Following the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Serbia on Trade in Textile Products, the Republic of Serbia is covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries [3]. Accordingly, references to that Republic need to be removed from Annexes II, III B and VI to Regulation (EC) No 517/94. Conversely, both the Republic of Montenegro and Kosovo the latter being understood as the entity defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999 constitute separate customs territories and consequently need to be referred to, in their own right, in Annexes II, III B and VI to that Regulation. For that purpose, new quota levels have been established for the Republic of Montenegro and Kosovo, using the most appropriate criterion for doing so, namely their population ratios. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should therefore be amended accordingly; for reasons of clarity, this should entail the wholesale replacement of Annexes I, II, III B and VI. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Textile Committee established by Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annexes I, II, III B and VI to Regulation (EC) No 517/94 are replaced as shown in the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
It shall apply from 1 July 2005. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 6 June 2005.
