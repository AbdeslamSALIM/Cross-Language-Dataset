Date of adoption of the decision : 22.2.2006 
Member State : Sweden 
Aid No : N 68/2006 
Title : Aid for replanting of trees in storm-felled forest 
Objective : Aid to compensate for the losses due to a natural disaster. On 8 and 9 of January 2005 the storm "Gudrun" hit Southern Sweden. The average gale force was 33 m/s, exceeding hurricane level and reaching at times 43 m/s. Electricity and telephone lines were cut, streets blocked and millions of trees fell. It has been estimated that the lives of about 20 persons were lost due to the storm. In addition to the financial losses caused by the storm to living trees the forest owners have to finance the cost of replanting the areas. The Swedish authorities have in fact limited the aid to those forest owners who have to replant their storm-felled forests as provided by § 5.1 of the Swedish Forest Care Act (Skogsvårdslagen). The Swedish authorities have presented four aid scenarios based on different replanting options. The aid amount depends on the option chosen by the forest owner for each area he reforests. Option 1 consists of planting needle trees or needle-tree dominated mixed forest. The estimated costs are SEK 12900 per ha and the aid SEK 3000 per ha. Options 2-4 consist of planting leaf trees or natural regeneration with protective fences. The costs and the corresponding aid amounts (in brackets) aid rate are for option 2: SEK 30000 (SEK 20000), option 3: SEK 33200 (SEK 23000) and option 4: SEK 18300 (SEK 8000)
