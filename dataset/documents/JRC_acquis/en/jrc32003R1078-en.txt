Council Regulation (EC) No 1078/2003 
of 16 June 2003 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Whereas: 
(1) By virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 of 20 December 1996, opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products(2), Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products were opened. Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes and increased, extended or terminated in the case of certain existing tariff quotas, while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(3) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to invoke the grounds of urgency provided for in point I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,
