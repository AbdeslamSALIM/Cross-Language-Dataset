THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC(1), and in particular Article 8(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 establishes conditions for non-commercial movements of dogs, cats and ferrets from third countries. These conditions differ depending on the status of the third country of origin and of the Member State of destination. 
(2) Article 8(4) provides for a model certificate for these movements to be established. 
(3) It is appropriate to establish a unique model for the cases provided for in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. Those concern entries from all third countries into a Member State other than Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom and entries into Ireland, Sweden and the United Kingdom from third countries listed in section 2 of part B and part C of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. 
(4) Since Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 will apply from 3 July 2004, this Decision should apply from the same date. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

Parts I to V of the certificate should be issued and signed by an official veterinarian designated by the competent authority of the country of dispatch or by a veterinary surgeon authorised by the competent authority. In the latter case the competent authority must endorse the certificate. Parts VI and VII, where applicable, shall be completed and signed by veterinarians authorised to practice veterinary medicine in the country of dispatch. 
The certificate must be accompanied by supporting documentation, or a certified copy of it, including vaccination details and the result of the serological test. This documentation must bear identification details of the animal concerned.
