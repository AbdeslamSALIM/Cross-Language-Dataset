THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to Council Joint Action 2005/557/CFSP of 18 July 2005 on the European Union civilian-military supporting action to the African Union mission in the Darfur region of Sudan [1], and in particular second subparagraph of Article 8(1) thereof, in conjunction with Article 23(2) of the Treaty on European Union, 
Whereas: 
(1) On 11 July 2006 the Council adopted Decision 2006/486/CFSP concerning the implementation of Joint Action 2005/557/CFSP on the European Union civilian-military supporting action to the African Union mission in the Darfur region of Sudan [2], which extended the financing for its civilian component until 31 October 2006. 
(2) Pending transition of the African Union mission to a United Nations (UN) operation in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1706 (2006), the Council has, in accordance with Article 2 of Decision 2006/486/CFSP, decided, in the light of the Decision by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union of 20 September 2006, to continue the European Union civilian-military supporting action to the African Union mission in the Darfur region of Sudan until 31 December 2006.
