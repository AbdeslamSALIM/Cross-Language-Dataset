4. Specification (summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) 
4.1 Name : %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% 
4.2 Description : 
In Schleswig-Holstein, customers wanting table carp ask for %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot%, which are mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio). The traditional dish Karpfen blau can only be made with mirror carp. The minimum weight of individual live fish is about 1,5 kg; the average sale weight is around 2,5 kg. In order to achieve these weights, a three- or usually four-year growing period is required. 
%quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% is elongated in form and has few scales (mirror carp). Its meat is light in colour, full/firm, tender and low in fat, with a unique taste and pure smell. 
%quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% has been slaughtered and is ready to cook when sold to the final consumer. Ready to cook means that it meets customer requirements for whole carp, carp which has been split (halved) or divided into cuts, or for fresh fillets. 
This does not give rise to a change in quality. 
Similarly, smoked %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% is hot-smoked whole or in individual cuts (as above). 
4.3 Geographical area : The geographical area comprises all carp ponds in Schleswig-Holstein. Historically, carp pond farming started in 1196 in Reinfeld (Holstein), at the Cistercian monastery of Reyenfelde, also becoming most widespread in the south of Schleswig-Holstein. There is only a small amount of carp pond farming in northern Schleswig-Holstein because of the climate. However, consumers throughout the Federal Land of Schleswig-Holstein are familiar with %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot%. The designation %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% makes clear that the (table) carp comes from the Federal Land of Schleswig-Holstein and has not been imported from other countries, (with the long distances this involves). 
4.4 Proof of origin : 
Pond farmers and traders undertake not to bring any goods of different origin to market under the designation %quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot%. 
Traders and caterers use their purchase invoices to prove the purchase and sale of Holsteiner Karpfen which they have obtained. 
For monitoring purposes, records are kept on holding size, purchase and sale of fish, feed, etc., and the purchase of carp. The Schleswig-Holstein Chamber of Agriculture monitors proper compliance with good pond-farming practice, the hygiene of installations and the quality of table carp. 
4.5 Method of production : 
%quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% is reared in Schleswig-Holstein up to table-carp size (more than 1,5 kg). In Schleswig-Holstein, the tradition of large carp weighing more than 2 kg each still prevails. The weight is usually attained at the end of the third to fourth growth period (summer). Feeding is predominantly pond-based (bed nutrients, zooplankton, etc. in the pond). Cereals and soya are the only additional feed used to balance and supplement the protein-rich natural diet. This is part of good farming practice. 
For processed products such as smoked carp, the geographical indication (Holsteiner Karpfen) relates to the raw material, fresh Holsteiner Karpfen. 
4.6 Link : 
Schleswig-Holstein is Germany's most northerly area where the carp is found. The maritime climate prevalent in this region, with its lower temperatures, together with the low level of supplementary feeding, results in the carp's slower rate of growth. It thus acquires lean, full/firm meat which is light in colour and has a unique, pure taste and smell. 
Holsteiner Karpfen is a speciality with a long tradition. It is well-known within the region as well as nationally, and is particularly well regarded by consumers. 
%quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% is produced as a table fish on traditional pond farms which have a history spanning several centuries. Carp pond farming was first a branch of economic activity on estate holdings, and is now undertaken both as a full-time and as a subsidiary business activity on around 200 family farms covering c. 2000 ha of ponds. The latter thus form an important ecological part of Schleswig-Holstein's landscape. 
%quot%Holsteiner Karpfen%quot% is reared up to table-fish size, slaughtered and processed in Schleswig-Holstein. If fry from elsewhere are used, at least the final year of growth must take place in Schleswig-Holstein. However, this generally applies to the third and fourth years, which are key to the weight gain and maturing of flavour of the table-fish sizes typical of Schleswig-Holstein. This denotes a weight increase of a good 2 kg per fish. 
Unfortunately, pond farming in Schleswig-Holstein cannot always guarantee the supply of fry, due, in particular, to the cormorant problem. Additional fry weighing up to about 500 g each repeatedly need to be bought. The significance of the amount of growth in the last one to two years becomes clear when one considers the three- to fivefold increase in unit weight. 
Goods which are conspicuous in particular by their lower prices and which have been transported long distances (live fish transport) are often offered with names designed to suggest Holsteiner origin. 
The protected geographical indication sought provides clarity and certainty here for producers and, above all, for consumers.
