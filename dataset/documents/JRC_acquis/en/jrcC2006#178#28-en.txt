Questions referred 
1. Must Articles 25 EC and 90 EC be construed as precluding a statutory rule under which domestic purchasers of electricity are required during a transitional period ( 31 August 2000 to 31 December 2000 inclusive) to pay to their net operator a price surcharge on the amounts of electricity delivered for their use, in the case where that surcharge is to be paid by the net operator to an undertaking designated by the legislature for the purpose of defraying non-market-compatible costs which have arisen as a result of obligations incurred, or investments made, by that undertaking prior to liberalisation of the electricity market, and that undertaking: 
- is the joint subsidiary of the four domestic generating undertakings; 
- was solely responsible, in the period in question (2000), for the non-market-compatible costs which arose during that year; 
- requires, by general agreement, an amount of NLG 400 million (EUR 181 512 086.40) in order to cover those costs incurred in that year; and 
- so far as the income generated by the price surcharge exceeds the aforementioned amount, is required to forward such surplus to the Minister? 
2. Does the rule mentioned in the first question satisfy the requirements of Article 87(1) EC?
