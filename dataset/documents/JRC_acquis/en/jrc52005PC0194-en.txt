Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
Article 11(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 sets out that competent authorities of the Member States can grant authorisations to market products imported from a third country not included in the list referred to in paragraph 1 point (a) of that Article, until 31 December 2005. 
In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 10 June 2004 concerning the European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming, the Commission announced that it will propose an amendment to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 replacing the current derogations for imports by a new permanent system making use of technical equivalency evaluations by bodies assigned by the Community for that purpose. 
Sufficient time is needed to develop and establish this new permanent system. In the meantime, trade in organic products should not be unnecessarily disrupted and therefore the existing transitional measures should be extended for another year. 
The measure does not entail any financial consequences for the Community budget.
