EXCHANGE AND USE OF INFORMATION

2. Information acquired or exchanged pursuant to this Protocol shall only be used in evidence for the purpose of procedures under Articles 53 and 54 of the Agreement and in respect of the subject matter for which it was collected. 
3. Where the information referred to in Article 2 (1) and (2) concerns a case which has been initiated as a result of an application for leniency, that information cannot be used by the receiving surveillance authority as the basis for starting an inspection on its own behalf. This is without prejudice to any power of the surveillance authority to open an inspection on the basis of information received from other sources. 
4. Save as provided under paragraph 5, information voluntarily submitted by a leniency applicant will only be transmitted to the other surveillance authority with the consent of the applicant. Similarly other information that has been obtained during or following an inspection or by means of or following any other fact-finding measures which, in each case, could not have been carried out except as a result of the leniency application will only be transmitted to the other surveillance authority if the applicant has consented to the transmission to that authority of information it has voluntarily submitted in its application for leniency. Once the leniency applicant has given consent to the transmission of information to the other surveillance authority, that consent may not be withdrawn. This paragraph is without prejudice, however, to the responsibility of each applicant to file leniency applications to whichever authorities it may consider appropriate. 
5. Notwithstanding paragraph 4, the consent of the applicant for the transmission of information to the other surveillance authority is not required in any of the following circumstances: 
(a) no consent is required where the receiving surveillance authority has also received a leniency application relating to the same infringement from the same applicant as the transmitting surveillance authority, provided that at the time the information is transmitted it is not open to the applicant to withdraw the information which it has submitted to that receiving surveillance authority; 
(b) no consent is required where the receiving surveillance authority has provided a written commitment that neither the information transmitted to it nor any other information it may obtain following the date and time of transmission as noted by the transmitting surveillance authority, will be used by it or by any other authority to which the information is subsequently transmitted to impose sanctions on the leniency applicant or on any other legal or natural person covered by the favourable treatment offered by the transmitting authority as a result of the application made by the applicant under its leniency programme or on any employee or former employee of the leniency applicant or of any of the aforementioned persons. A copy of the receiving authority's written commitment will be provided to the applicant; 
(c) in the case of information collected by a surveillance authority under Article 8(2) at the request of the surveillance authority to whom the leniency application was made, no consent is required for the transmission of such information to, and its use by, the surveillance authority to whom the application was made.

- the statement of objections has been sent to the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned, 
- a letter has been sent to the complainant informing him that there are insufficient grounds for pursuing the complaint, 
- the publication of the intention to adopt a decision declaring Article 53 or 54 not applicable, or the publication of the intention to adopt a decision making commitments offered by the undertakings binding on the undertakings. 
LANGUAGES 
Article 12 
Any natural or legal person shall be entitled to address and be addressed by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EC Commission in an official language of an EFTA State or the European Community which they choose as regards complaints.
