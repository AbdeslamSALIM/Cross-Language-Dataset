THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(1), as last amended by Directive 1999/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 28 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC contains a guide to the classification and labelling of dangerous substances and preparations. Annex VI was last amended by Annex 4 to Directive 98/98/EC(3). Sections 3.2.3, 3.2.8, 6.2 and 8 of Annex 4 to Directive 98/98/EC are incomplete. In consequence it is necessary to correct Annex 4 to Directive 98/98/EC. 
(2) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to technical progress of the Directives for the elimination of technical barriers to trade in dangerous substances and preparations, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
Annex 4 to Directive 98/98/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.

ANNEX 
%quot%ANNEX 4 
1.6. For substances, the data required for classification and labelling may be obtained: 
(a) as regards substances for which the information specified in Annex VII is required, most of the necessary data for classification and labelling appear in the base set. This classification and labelling must be reviewed, if necessary, when further information is available (Annex VIII); 
(b) as regards other substances (e.g. those referred to in section 1.5), the data required for classification and labelling may, if necessary, be obtained from a number of different sources, for example the results of previous tests, information required by international rules on the transport of dangerous substances, information taken from reference works and the literature or information derived from practical experience. The results of validated structure-activity relationships and expert judgement may also be taken into account where appropriate. 
For preparations, the data required for classification and labelling may be obtained: 
(a) if it concerns physicochemical data, by the application of the methods specified in Annex V. For gaseous preparations, a calculation method may be used for flammable and oxidising properties (see Chapter 9); 
(b) if it concerns data on health effects: 
- by the application of the methods specified in Annex V and/or by the application of the conventional method referred to in Article 3(5)(a) to (i) of Directive 88/379/EEC, or, in the case of R 65, by the application of the rules under 3.2.3, 
- however, if it concerns the evaluation of the carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive properties, by the application of the conventional method referred to in Article 3(5)(j) to (q) of Directive 88/379/EEC. 
Note concerning the performance of animal tests 
The performance of animal tests to establish experimental data is subject to the provisions of Directive 86/609/EEC regarding the protection of animals used for experimental purposes. 
1.7.2. Application of the guide criteria for substances 
The guidance criteria set out in this Annex are directly applicable when the data in question have been obtained from test methods comparable with those described in Annex V. In other cases, the available data must be evaluated by comparing the test methods employed with those indicated in Annex V and the rules specified in this Annex for determining the appropriate classification and labelling. 
In some cases there may be doubt over the application of the relevant criteria, especially where these require the use of expert judgement. In such cases the manufacturer, distributor or importer should provisionally classify and label the substance on the basis of an assessment of the evidence by a competent person. 
Without prejudice to Article 6, where the above procedure has been followed and there is concern over possible inconsistencies then a proposal may be submitted for the entry of the provisional classification into Annex I. The proposal should be made to one of the Member States and should be accompanied by appropriate scientific data (see also section 4.1). 
A similar procedure may be followed when information is identified which gives cause for concern over the accuracy of an existing entry in Annex I. 
2.2.2.1. Remarks concerning peroxides 
For the explosive properties, an organic peroxide or preparation thereof in the form in which it is placed on the market is classified according to the criteria in section 2.2.1 on the basis of tests carried out in accordance with the methods given in Annex V. 
For the oxidising properties the existing methods in Annex V cannot be applied to organic peroxides. 
For substances, organic peroxides not already classified as explosive are classified as dangerous on the basis of their structure (e.g. R-O-O-H; R1-O-O-R2). 
Preparations not already classified as explosive shall be classified using the calculation method based on the percentage of active oxygen shown in section 9.5. 
Any organic peroxide or preparation thereof not already classified as explosive is classified as oxidising, if the peroxide or its formulation contains: 
- more than 5 % of organic peroxides or, 
- more than 0,5 % available oxygen from the organic peroxides, and more than 5 % hydrogen peroxide. 
3.2.3. Harmful 
Substances and preparations shall be classified as harmful and assigned the symbol %quot%Xn%quot% and the indication of danger %quot%harmful%quot% in accordance with the criteria specified below. Risk phrases shall be assigned in accordance with the following criteria: 
R 22 Harmful if swallowed 
Acute toxicity results: 
- LD50 per oral, rat: 200 %amp%lt; LD50 %amp%lt;= 2000 mg/kg, 
- discriminating dose, oral, rat 50, mg/kg: 100 % survival but evident toxicity, 
- less than 100 % survival at 500 mg/kg, rat oral by the fixed dose procedure. Refer to the evaluation table in the test method Bl(a) of Annex V. 
R 21 Harmful in contact with skin 
Acute toxicity results: 
- LD50 dermal, rat or rabbit: 400 %amp%lt; LD50 %amp%lt;= 2000 mg/kg. 
R 20 Harmful by inhalation 
Acute toxicity results: 
- LC50 inhalation, rat, for aerosols or particulates: 1 %amp%lt; LC50 %amp%lt;= 5 mg/litre/4 hr, 
- LC50 inhalation, rat, for gases or vapours: 2 %amp%lt; LC50 %amp%lt;= 20 mg/litre/4 hr. 
R 65 Harmful: may cause lung damage if swallowed 
Liquid substances and preparations presenting an aspiration hazard in humans because of their low viscosity 
(a) For substances and preparations containing aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons in a total concentration equal to or greater than 10 % and having either: 
- a flow time of less than 30 seconds in a 3 mm ISO cup according to ISO 2431, or 
- a kinematic viscosity measured by a calibrated glass capillary viscometer in accordance with ISO 3104/3105 of less than 7 × 10-6 m2/sec at 40 °C, or 
- a kinematic viscosity derived from measurements of rotational viscometry in accordance with ISO 3129 of less than 7 × 10-6 m2/sec at 40 °C. 
Note 
that substances and preparations meeting these criteria need not be classified if they have a mean surface tension greater than 33 mN/m at 25 °C as measured by the du Nouy tensiometer or by the test methods shown in Annex V Part A(5); 
(b) For substances and preparations, based on practical experience in humans. 
R 40 Possible risk of irreversible effects 
- strong evidence that irreversible damage other than the effects referred to in Chapter 4 is likely to be caused by a single exposure by an appropriate route, generally in the abovementioned dose range. 
In order to indicate route of administration/exposure one of the following combinations shall be used: R 40/20, R 40/21, R 40/22, R 40/20/21, R 40/20/22, R 40/21/22, R 40/20/21/22. 
R 48 Danger of serious damage to health by prolonged exposure 
- serious damage (clear functional disturbance or morphological change which has toxicological significance) is likely to be caused by repeated or prolonged exposure by an appropriate route. 
Substances and preparations are classified at least as harmful when these effects are observed at levels of the order of: 
- oral, rat %amp%lt;= 50 mg/kg (body weight)/day, 
- dermal, rat or rabbit %amp%lt;= 100 mg/kg (body weight)/day, 
- inhalation, rat %amp%lt;= 0,25 mg/l, 6 h/day. 
These guide values can apply directly when severe lesions have been observed in a subchronic (90 days) toxicity test. When interpreting the results of a subacute (28 days) toxicity test these figures should be increased approximately three fold. If a chronic (two years) toxicity test is available it should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. If results of studies of more than one duration are available, then those from the study of the longest duration should normally be used. 
In order to indicate route of administration/exposure one of the following combinations shall be used: R 48/20, R 48/21, R 48/22, R 48/20/21, R 48/20/22, R 48/21/22, R 48/20/21/22. 
3.2.3.1. Comments regarding volatile substances 
For certain substances with a high saturated vapour concentration, evidence may be available to indicate effects that give cause for concern. Such substances may not be classified under the criteria for health effects in this guide (3.2.3) or not covered by Section 3.2.8. However, where there is appropriate evidence that such substances may present a risk in normal handling and use, then classification on a case-by-case basis in Annex I may be necessary. 
3.2.6.1. Inflammation of the skin 
The following risk phrase shall be assigned in accordance with the criteria given: 
R 38 Irritating to skin 
- substances and preparations which cause significant inflammation of the skin which persists for at least 24 hours after an exposure period of up to four hours determined on the rabbit according to the cutaneous irritation test method cited in Annex V. 
Inflammation of the skin is significant if: 
(a) the mean value of the scores for either erythema and eschar formation or oedema formation, calculated over all the animals tested, is two or more; 
(b) or, in the case where the Annex V test has been completed using three animals, either erythema and eschar formation or oedema formation equivalent to a mean value of two or more calculated for each animal separately has been observed in two or more animals. 
In both cases all scores at each of the reading times (24, 48 and 72 hours) for an effect should be used in calculating respective mean values. 
Inflammation of the skin is also significant if it persists in at least two animals at the end of the observation time. Particular effects, for example, hyperplasia, scaling, discoloration, fissures, scabs and alopecia should be taken into account. 
Relevant data may also be available from non-acute animal studies (see comments on R 48, section 2(d)). These are considered significant if the effects seen are comparable to those described above; 
- substances and preparations which cause significant inflammation of the skin, based on practical observations in humans on immediate, prolonged or repeated contact; 
- organic peroxides, except where evidence to the contrary is available. 
Paresthesia: Paresthesia caused in humans by skin contact with pyrethroid pesticides is not regarded as an irritant effect justifying classification as Xi; R 38. The S-phrase S 24 should however be applied for substances seen to cause this effect. 
3.2.8. Other toxicological properties 
Additional risk phrases shall be assigned in accordance with the following criteria (based on experience obtained during compilation of Annex I) to substances and preparations classified by virtue of 2.2.1 to 3.2.7 above and/or Chapters 4 and 5: 
R 29 Contact with water liberates toxic gas 
For substances and preparations which in contact with water or damp air, evolve very toxic or toxic gases in potentially dangerous amounts, for example, aluminium phosphide, phosphorus pentasulphide. 
R 31 Contact with acids liberates toxic gas 
For substances and preparations which react with acids to evolve toxic gases in dangerous amounts, for example, sodium hypochlorite, barium polysulphide. For substances used by members of the general public, the use of S 50 (do not mix with ... (to be specified by the manufacturer)) would be more suitable. 
R 32 Contact with acids liberates very toxic gas 
For substances and preparations which react with acids to evolve very toxic gases in dangerous amounts; e.g. salts of hydrogen cyanide, sodium azide. For substances used by members of the general public, the use of S 50 (do not mix with ... (to be specified by the manufacturer)) would be more suitable. 
R 33 Danger of cumulative effects 
For substances and preparations when accumulation in the human body is likely and may cause some concern which, however, is not sufficient to justify the use of R 48. 
R 64 May cause harm to breastfed babies 
For substances and preparations which are absorbed by women and may interfere with lactation or which may be present (including metabolites) in breast milk in amounts sufficient to cause concern for the health of a breastfed child. 
For comments on the use and this R-phrase (and in some cases R 33) see section 4.2.3.3. 
R 66 Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking 
For substances and preparations which may cause concern as a result of skin dryness, flaking or cracking but which do not meet the criteria for R 38: 
based on either: 
- practical observation after normal handling and use, or 
- relevant evidence concerning their predicted effects on the skin. 
See also sections 1.6 and 1.7. 
R 67 Vapours may cause drowsiness and dizziness 
For volatile substances and preparations containing such substances which cause clear symptoms of central nervous system depression by inhalation and which are not already classified with respect to acute inhalation toxicity (R 20, R 23, R 26, R 40/20, R 39/23 or R 39/26). 
The following evidence may be used: 
(a) data from animal studies showing clear signs of CNS depression such as narcotic effects, lethargy, lack of coordination (including loss of righting reflex) and ataxia either: 
- at concentrations/exposure times not exceeding 20 mg/l/4 h or, 
- for which the ratio of the effect concentration at %amp%lt;= 4 h to the saturated vapour concentration (SVC) at 20 °C is %amp%lt;= 1/10; 
b) practical experience in humans (e.g. narcosis, drowsiness, reduced alertness, loss of reflexes, lack of coordination, vertigo) from well documented reports under comparable exposure conditions to the effects specified above for animals. 
See also sections 1.6 and 1.7. 
For other supplementary risk phrases see section 2.2.6. 
4.1.2. If a manufacturer, distributor or importer has information available which indicates that a substance should be classified and labelled in accordance with the criteria given in section 4.2.1, 4.2.2 or 4.2.3, he shall provisionally label the substance in accordance with these criteria, on the basis of the assessment of the evidence by a competent person. 
4.1.3. The manufacturer, distributor or importer shall submit as soon as possible a document summarising all relevant information to one Member State in which the substance is placed on the market. This summary document should include a bibliography containing all relevant references, including any relevant unpublished data.

Detailed criteria will be elaborated later. 
5.2.2.2. Substances shall be classified as dangerous for the environment and assigned the symbol %quot%N%quot% and the appropriate indication of danger, and assigned risk phrases in accordance with the following criteria: 
R 59: Dangerous for the ozone layer 
Substances which on the basis of the available evidence concerning their properties and their predicted or observed environmental fate and behaviour may present a danger to the structure and/or functioning of the stratospheric ozone layer. This includes the substances which are listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (OJ L 333, 22.12.1994, p. 1) and its subsequent amendments.
