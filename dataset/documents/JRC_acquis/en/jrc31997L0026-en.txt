(2) Whereas the said Annexes I and Ia provide that any additional information or restrictions shall be indicated in code form; 
(3) Whereas the codes and sub-codes applying to the conditions of issue governed by Directive 91/439/EEC are valid throughout the Community; 
(4) Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, Community action is needed in order to enable driving licences to be understood and reciprocally recognized, and in order to facilitate the free movement of persons by avoiding the practical problems that would face drivers, road hauliers, administrations and inspectors if Member States were to use differing codes; 
(5) Whereas provision should be made for a simplified procedure for adapting the technical aspects of the harmonized Community codes listed in Annexes I and Ia and for adapting Annexes II and III to Directive 91/439/EEC; 
(6) Whereas, in the interests of clarity and of conformity with Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles (5), the opportunity offered by this amendment should be taken in order to align the definition of the term 'motorcycle` in respect of design speed,
