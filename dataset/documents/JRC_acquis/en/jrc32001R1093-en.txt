amending Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre(1), and in particular Articles 9 and 14 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) With a view to clarifying certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 245/2001(2) laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000, a number of amendments need to be made to the text of the Regulation. 
(2) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 lays down certain provisions in order to prevent illicit hemp crops from disturbing the market in hemp for fibre. The Article thus provides for the issue of a licence for imported hemp and the establishment of a system of checks on imported raw hemp and hemp seed and restricts the import of hemp seed other than for sowing to authorised importers. A standard licence establishing the compliance of imported hemp with the conditions laid down should therefore be provided for. The establishment by the Member States concerned of a system of checks on imported hemp and arrangements for the authorisation of importers of hemp seed other than for sowing should also be provided for. Provisions should also be laid down to cover trade between the Member States in such seed. 
(3) To allow Member States and operators to adjust to the new provisions relating to imports of hemp, provision should be made for them to apply from 1 November 2001. The control measures in force before that date must therefore remain applicable until 31 October 2001. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Flax and Hemp,

Those arrangements shall include the definition of the conditions for authorisation, checks and the penalties to be applied in cases of irregularity. 
In the case of imports of hemp seed as referred to in the first subparagraph, the licence referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only where the authorised importer undertakes that the competent authorities will be presented, within the time limits and under the conditions defined by the Member State, with documents attesting that the hemp seed covered by the licence has undergone, within a period of less than 12 months from the date on which the licence is issued, one of the following operations:

- re-export to a non-Community country. 
However, if part of the hemp seed covered by the licence has not undergone one of the operations referred to in the previous subparagraph within the time limit of 12 months, the Member State may, at the request of the authorised importer accompanied by justification, extend that time limit by one or two periods of six months. 
The attestations referred to in the second subparagraph shall be drawn up by the operators who have carried out the operations and shall comprise at least the following information: 
- the name, full address, Member State and signature of the operator, 
- a description of the operation carried out meeting the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph and the date on which it was carried out, 
- the quantity in kilograms of hemp seed to which the operation related. 
3. On the basis of a risk analysis, each Member State concerned shall carry out checks on the accuracy of the attestations relating to the operations referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 carried out on their territory. 
Where appropriate, the importer Member State shall send the Member State concerned copies of the attestations concerning the operations carried out on the latter's territory and submitted by authorised importers. Where irregularities are discovered during the checks referred to in the first subparagraph, the Member State concerned shall inform the competent authority of the importer Member State.
