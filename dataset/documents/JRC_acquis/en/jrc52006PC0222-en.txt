Proposal for a 
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
concerning misleading and comparative advertising (codified version) 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In the context of a people’s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying Community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen, thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him. 
This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules. 
For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if Community law is to be clear and transparent. 
2. On 1 April 1987 the Commission therefore decided[1] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that the Community rules are clear and readily understandable. 
3. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this[2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. 
Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal Community legislative procedure. 
Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification , the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinsitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 
4. The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising[3] . The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it[4]; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. 
5. The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation , in all official languages, of Directive 84/450/EEC and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, by means of a data-processing system . Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex II to the codified Directive.

Proposal for a 
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
concerning misleading and comparative advertising 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
ê 84/450/EEC (adapted) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article Ö 95 Õ thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[5], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty[6], 
Whereas: 
ê 
1. Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising[7] has been substantially amended several times[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 1 (adapted) 
2. The laws against misleading advertising in force in the Member States differ widely. Since advertising reaches beyond the frontiers of individual Member States, it has a direct effect on the Ö smooth Õ functioning of the Ö internal Õ market. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 2 (adapted) 
3. Misleading Ö and unlawful comparative Õ advertising can lead to distortion of competition within the Ö internal Õ market. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 3 (adapted) 
4. Advertising, whether or not it induces a contract, affects the economic welfare of consumers Ö and traders Õ. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 4 (adapted) 
5. The differences between the laws of the Member States Ö on advertising which misleads business Õ hinder the execution of advertising campaigns beyond national boundaries and thus affect the free circulation of goods and provision of services. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 2 (adapted) 
6. The completion of the internal market Ö means a wide Õ range of choice. Given that consumers Ö and traders Õ can and must make the best possible use of the internal market, and that advertising is a very important means of creating genuine outlets for all goods and services throughout the Community, the basic provisions governing the form and content of comparative advertising should be uniform and the conditions of the use of comparative advertising in the Member States should be harmonised. If these conditions are met, this will help demonstrate objectively the merits of the various comparable products. Comparative advertising can also stimulate competition between suppliers of goods and services to the consumer’s advantage. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 7 (adapted) 
7. Minimum and objective criteria for determining whether Ö business to business Õ advertising is misleading should be established. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 5 and 6 (adapted) 
8. Comparative advertising, when it compares material, relevant, verifiable and representative features and is not misleading, may be a legitimate means of informing consumers of their advantage. Ö It is desirable to provide a broad concept of comparative advertising to cover all modes of comparative advertising. Õ 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 7 
9. Conditions of permitted comparative advertising, as far as the comparison is concerned, should be established in order to determine which practices relating to comparative advertising may distort competition, be detrimental to competitors and have an adverse effect on consumer choice. Such conditions of permitted advertising should include criteria of objective comparison of the features of goods and services. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 10 
10. The international conventions on copyright as well as the national provisions on contractual and non-contractual liability should apply when the results of comparative tests carried out by third parties are referred to or reproduced in comparative advertising. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 11 
11. The conditions of comparative advertising should be cumulative and respected in their entirety. In accordance with the Treaty, the choice of forms and methods for the implementation of these conditions should be left to the Member States, insofar as those forms and methods are not already determined by this Directive. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 12 
12. These conditions should include, in particular, consideration of the provisions resulting from Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs[9], and in particular Article 13 thereof, and of the other Community provisions adopted in the agricultural sphere. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 13 
13. Article 5 of First Council Directive 89/104/EEC of 21 December 1988 to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to trade marks[10] confers exclusive rights on the proprietor of a registered trade mark, including the right to prevent all third parties from using, in the course of trade, any sign which is identical to, or similar to, the trade mark in relation to identical goods or services or even, where appropriate, other goods. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 14 
14. It may, however, be indispensable, in order to make comparative advertising effective, to identify the goods or services of a competitor, making reference to a trade mark or trade name of which the latter is the proprietor. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 15 
15. Such use of another’s trade mark, trade name or other distinguishing marks does not breach this exclusive right in cases where it complies with the conditions laid down by this Directive, the intended target being solely to distinguish between them and thus to highlight differences objectively. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 9 (adapted) 
16. Persons or organisations regarded under national law as having a legitimate interest in the matter should have facilities for initiating proceedings against misleading Ö and unlawful comparative Õ advertising, either before a court or before an administrative authority which is competent to decide upon complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. 
ê 84/450/EEC Recitals 11 and 12 (adapted) 
17. The courts or administrative authorities should have powers enabling them to order or obtain the cessation of misleading Ö and unlawful comparative Õ advertising. Ö In certain cases it may be desirable to prohibit misleading and unlawful comparative advertising even before it is published. However, this in no way implies that Member States are under an obligation to introduce rules requiring the systematic prior vetting of advertising. Õ 
ê 84/450/EEC Recital 16 (adapted) 
18. The voluntary control exercised by self-regulatory bodies to eliminate misleading Ö or unlawful comparative Õ advertising may avoid recourse to administrative or judicial action and ought therefore to be encouraged. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 17 
19. National self-regulatory bodies may coordinate their work through associations or organisations established at Community level and inter alia deal with cross-border complaints. 
ê 2005/29/EC Recital 21 (adapted) 
20. While it is for national law to determine the burden of proof, it is appropriate to enable courts and administrative authorities to require traders to produce evidence as to the accuracy of factual claims they have made. 
ê 97/55/EC Recital 23 
21. Regulating comparative advertising is, under the conditions set out in this Directive, necessary for the smooth running of the internal market. Action at Community level is therefore required. The adoption of a Directive is the appropriate instrument because it lays down uniform general principles while allowing the Member States to choose the form and appropriate method by which to attain these objectives. It is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. 
ê 
22. This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part B, 
ê 84/450/EEC 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

ê 84/450/EEC 
Article 5 
ê 2005/29/EC Art. 14 pt. 4 (adapted)

(a) take legal action against such advertising; 
or 
(b) bring such advertising before an administrative authority competent either to decide on complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings. 
2. It shall be for each Member State to decide which of the facilities referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be available and whether to enable the courts or administrative authorities to require prior recourse to other established means of dealing with complaints, including those referred to in Article 6. 
It shall be for each Member State to decide: 
(a) whether these legal facilities may be directed separately or jointly against a number of traders from the same economic sector; 
and 
(b) whether these legal facilities may be directed against a code owner where the relevant code promotes non-compliance with legal requirements.

(a) to order the cessation of, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the cessation of, misleading advertising or Ö unlawful Õ comparative advertising; or 
(b) if the misleading advertising or Ö unlawful Õ comparative advertising has not yet been published but publication is imminent, to order the prohibition of, or to institute appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the prohibition of, such publication. 
ê 84/450/EEC (adapted) 
Ö The first subparagraph shall apply even where there is no Õ proof of actual loss or damage or of intention or negligence on the part of the advertiser.

4. Member States may confer upon the courts or administrative authorities powers enabling them, with a view to eliminating the continuing effects of misleading advertising or Ö unlawful Õ comparative advertising, the cessation of which has been ordered by a final decision:

ê Corrigendum 97/55/EC (OJ L 194, 10.7.1998, p. 54) 
Article 6 
This Directive does not exclude the voluntary control, which Member States may encourage, of misleading or comparative advertising by self-regulatory bodies and recourse to such bodies by the persons or organisations referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 5(1) on condition that proceedings before such bodies are additional to the court or administrative proceedings referred to in that Article. 
ê 84/450/EEC (adapted)

ê 97/55/EC Art. 1 pt. 8 
(a) to require the advertiser to furnish evidence as to the accuracy of factual claims in advertising if, taking into account the legitimate interest of the advertiser and any other party to the proceedings, such a requirement appears appropriate on the basis of the circumstances of the particular case and in the case of comparative advertising to require the advertiser to furnish such evidence in a short period of time; and 
ê 84/450/EEC 
(b) to consider factual claims as inaccurate if the evidence demanded in accordance with point (a) is not furnished or is deemed insufficient by the court or administrative authority.

Where these bans are limited to particular media, the Directive shall apply to the media not covered by these bans. 
4. Nothing in this Directive shall prevent Member States, in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty, from maintaining or introducing bans or limitations on the use of comparisons in the advertising of professional services, whether imposed directly or by a body or organisation responsible, under the law of the Member States, for regulating the exercise of a professional activity.
