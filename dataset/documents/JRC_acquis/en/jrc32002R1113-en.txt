Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1788/2001(3) establishes a new certificate of inspection for imported products replacing the certificate established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3457/92(4) and foresees that the new certificate shall be applied from 1 July 2002 to products imported under the procedures established in Article 11(1) and 11(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.
