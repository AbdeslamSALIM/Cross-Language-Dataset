Announcement [1] of the period for the monitoring and evaluation of the labour-rights situation in Belarus in view of the temporary withdrawal of benefits under the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) 
(2005/C 240/09) 
Under Article 26(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 [2] applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences, the preferential arrangements may be withdrawn from a GSP beneficiary country for "serious and systematic violation of the freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining or the principle of non-discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, or use of child labour, as defined in the relevant ILO conventions". 
On the basis of information received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the Commission carried out an investigation on the alleged systematic and serious violations of the freedom of association in Belarus, as defined in ILO Conventions Nos 87 and 98. 
The Commission considers that the findings justify the temporary withdrawal for the reason given in Article 26(1)(b) and has decided, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 39 of Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001, to monitor and evaluate the situation in Belarus for a period of six months. The Commission intends to submit to the Council a proposal for the temporary withdrawal of the trade preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 unless, before the end of the period, Belarus makes a commitment to take the measures necessary to conform within eight months with the principles referred to in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as expressed in the twelve recommendations of the ILO Commission of Enquiry report of July 2004. 
[1] Commission Decision of 17 August 2005 on the monitoring and evaluation of the labour-rights situation in Belarus for temporary withdrawal of trade preferences.
