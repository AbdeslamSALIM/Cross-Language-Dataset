That corrective amount must be calculated taking account of the factors referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.

(4) The corrective amount must be fixed at the same time as the refund and according to the same procedure; it may be altered in the period between fixings. 
(5) It follows from applying the provisions set out above that the corrective amount must be as set out in the Annex hereto. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
