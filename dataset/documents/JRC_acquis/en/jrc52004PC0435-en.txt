Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION amending Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In response to requests from various Member States, the Commission's departments, together with the government experts concerned, considered whether to open, increase and extend tariff quotas for certain industrial products. 
2. Following the discussion, at a meeting of the Economic Tariff Questions Group, the Member States were able to approve new quotas, increases or extensions to quotas for the products covered by the proposal for a Regulation, without disturbing the markets for such products. 
Hence the attached proposal for a Regulation. 
Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION amending Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Whereas: 
(1) On 20 December 1996 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products [2]. Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. New Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products. 
[2] OJ J 345, 31.12.1996, p. 1. Regulation last amended by Regulation (EC) No 226/2004 (OJ L 39, 11.2.2004, p. 1). 
(2) The quota amount for certain autonomous Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period. Consequently, these quota amounts should be increased. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly,
