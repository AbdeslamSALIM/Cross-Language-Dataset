THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever [1], and in particular Article 16(1) and Article 20(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Commission adopted Decision 2005/59/EC of 26 January 2005 approving the plans for the eradication of classical swine fever in feral pigs and the emergency vaccination of such pigs in Slovakia [2], as one of a number of measures to combat classical swine fever. 
(2) The Slovak authorities have informed the Commission about the recent evolution of the disease in feral pigs. This information indicates that classical swine fever in feral pigs has been successfully eradicated in the territories of the District Veterinary and Food Administrations of Levice, Nitra, Topoľčany, Nové Mesto nad Váhom and the district Púchov and that the approved eradication plan no longer needs be applied in these areas. In the light of the epidemiological information, the vaccination plan should be extended with the introduction of the vaccination of feral pigs against classical swine fever in the districts of Ilava, Žiar nad Hronom, Žarnovica and Banská Štiavnica. 
(3) Decision 2005/59/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
The Annex to Decision 2005/59/EC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.
