THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposals from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinions of the European Parliament (2), 
Whereas Directive 64/432/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 83/646/EEC (4), lays down the conditions to be met, as regards health, by live cattle and pigs intended for intra-Community trade; 
Whereas Directive 72/461/EEC (5), as last amended by Directive 83/646/EEC, lays down the conditions to be met, as regards health, by animals whose meat is intended for intra-Community trade;
