of 8 June 2000 
amending for the fifth time Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) Geographical and seasonal particularities render it appropriate that detailed rules for separator trawls or nets with a sorting grid to be used in shrimp fisheries should be established by Member States for fishing vessels flying their flag and registered in the Community. Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 850/98(4) should therefore be amended. 
(2) Recent scientific advice indicates that quantities of sand eels within an area off the northeast coast of England and the east coast of Scotland are currently insufficient to support both fisheries upon them and the requirements of various species for which sand eels are a major component of their diet and that a closure of fisheries for sandeels in this area is therefore required. 
(3) Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 should be redrafted to provide greater clarity with regard to its applicability. 
(4) Minimum sizes for a number of crustaceans and bivalve molluscs should be revised or introduced. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 850/98 should therefore be amended,
