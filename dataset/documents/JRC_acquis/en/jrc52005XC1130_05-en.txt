Note 1: Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal ("dow"), set by the European Standardisation Organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise. 
Note 2.1: The new (or amended) standard has the same scope as the superseded standard. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive. 
Note 3: In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 4) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive. 
Example: For EN 50014:1997, the following applies: 
CENELEC | EN 50014:1997 Electrical apparatus for potentially explosive atmospheres — General requirements [The referenced standard is EN 50014:1997] | | NONE [There is no superseded standard] | — | 
Amendment A1:1999 to EN 50014:1997 [The referenced standard is EN 50014:1997 +A1:1999 to EN 50014:1997] | | Note 3 [The superseded standard is EN 50014:1997] | — | 
Amendment A2:1999 to EN 50014:1997 [The referenced standard is EN 50014:1997 +A1:1999 to EN 50014:1997 +A2:1999 to EN 50014:1997] | | Note 3 [The superseded standard is EN 50014:1997 +A1:1999 to EN 50014:1997] | — |
