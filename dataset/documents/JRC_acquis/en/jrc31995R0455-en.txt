Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 6 (6), the first subparagraph of Article 7a (1), Article 7a (3), Article 12 (3) and Article 28 thereof, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 985/68 of 15 July 1968, laying down general rules for intervention on the market in butter and cream (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2045/91 (3), has been repealed with effect from 1 March 1995 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2807/94 (4); whereas some of the rules in Regulation (EEC) No 985/68 have been incorporated into Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2807/94; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 685/69 of 14 April 1969, detailing rules of application for intervention on the market in butter and cream (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 393/94 (6), was recast when being amended as a result of the repeal of Regulation (EEC) No 985/68; whereas it has also been repealed with effect from 1 March 1995, as a result; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1547/87 of 3 June 1987, laying down detailed rules for applying Regulation No 777/87 as regards the buying-in of intervention butter (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1634/94 (8), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1589/87 of 5 June 1987, on the sale by tender of butter to intervention agencies (9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3337/94 (10), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2191/81 of 31 July 1981, on the granting of aid for the purchase of butter by non-profit making institutions and organizations (11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3337/94, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 570/88 of 16 February 1988, on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice-cream and other food products, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3337/94, make reference to the provisions of Regulations (EEC) No 985/68 and (EEC) No 685/69; whereas the above Regulations should be amended by substituting therein references to Commission Regulations (EEC) No 804/68 and (EC) No 454/95 (12) applicable from 1 March 1995; whereas, furthermore, Regulation (EEC) No 1589/87 should be amended so that butter manufactured in a Member State other than that of the purchasing intervention agency can be bought into intervention and the reference to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 777/87 (13) should be corrected in Regulation (EEC) No 1547/87;
