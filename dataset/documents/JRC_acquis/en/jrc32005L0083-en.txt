Commission Directive 2005/83/EC 
of 23 November 2005 
amending, for the purposes of their adaptation to technical progress, Annexes I, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X to Council Directive 72/245/EEC relating to the radio interference (electromagnetic compatibility) of vehicles 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers [1], and in particular the second indent of Article 13(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 72/245/EEC of 20 June 1972 relating to the radio interference (electromagnetic compatibility) of vehicles [2], and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 72/245/EEC is one of the separate directives under the type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC. 
(2) The Electromagnetic Compatibility requirements and test provisions for electrical and electronic equipment have been constantly updated through the standardisation work of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) and the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). Therefore Commission Directive 2004/104/EC [3], which amended Directive 72/245/EEC, introduced references to the test procedures outlined in the recent editions of the relevant standards. 
(3) Since the entry into force of Directive 2004/104/EC, several standards have been replaced by more recent versions adapting them to technical progress. It is therefore necessary to update the references to those standards in Directive 72/245/EEC. 
(4) In addition, some editorial corrections need to be introduced. 
(5) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Annexes I, VI, VII, VIII, IX and X to Directive 72/245/EEC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive. 
Article 2 
1. Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 September 2006 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. 
They shall apply those provisions from 1 October 2006. 
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made. 
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 
Article 3 
This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
Article 4 
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.
