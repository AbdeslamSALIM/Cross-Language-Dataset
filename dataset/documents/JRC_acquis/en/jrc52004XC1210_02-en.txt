Imposition of public service obligations on airline services within Italy 
Imposition of public service obligations on airline services within Italy 
(2004/C 306/03) 
Pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992, regarding access for air carriers to intra-Community air routes, and in accordance with the proposal put forward by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, the Italian Government has decided to impose public service obligations on airline services with respect to certain routes between the Sardinian airports and the main national airports. 
The insularity of Sardinia significantly limits its opportunities for connections, thereby attributing to air transport a fundamental and irreplaceable role for which there are no valid and comparable alternatives. 
Consequently, airline services are considered to be services having a public interest, which are vital for the economic and social development of the Island of Sardinia, both to guarantee the right to reside and travel freely within Italy and the freedom of movement of persons within the European Union. 
1. AFFECTED ROUTES 
1.1 The routes affected by the imposition of public service obligations are the following: 
Alghero/Rome and Rome/Alghero 
Alghero/Milan [1] and Milan [1]/Alghero 
Alghero/Bologna and Bologna/Alghero 
Alghero/Turin and Turin/Alghero 
Alghero/Pisa and Pisa/Alghero 
Cagliari/Rome and Rome/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Milan [1] and Milan [1]/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Bologna and Bologna/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Turin and Turin/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Pisa and Pisa/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Verona and Verona/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Naples and Naples/Cagliari 
Cagliari/Palermo and Palermo/Cagliari

Olbia/Milan [1] and Milan [1]/Olbia 
Olbia/Bologna and Bologna/Olbia 
Olbia/Turin and Turin/Olbia 
Olbia/Verona and Verona/Olbia 
1.2 In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 of 18 January 1993, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 793/2004, relating to common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports, the competent authorities may reserve certain slots for domestic scheduled services on routes where public service obligations have been imposed under Community legislation. 
1.3 All eighteen routes indicated above and the public service obligations imposed upon them constitute a single package which must be accepted completely and entirely by the interested carriers without any compensation regardless of nature or origin. 
1.4 The carriers accepting the present public service obligations which do not autonomously dispose of the technical and organisational capacity necessary to service the routes affected by the present public service obligations shall provide at the moment of acceptance any other agreements entered into with other carriers for the purpose of servicing the affected routes. Such agreements shall specify the operative details so that the competent authorities can evaluate whether the means and the organisation are sufficient to meet the public service obligations. In any event, each single carrier or each leading carrier, which accepts the public service obligations, remains fully liable for their punctual performance. 
1.5 Each single carrier (or leading carrier) which accepts the public service obligations shall provide a performance security for the purpose of guaranteeing the correct execution and continuation of the service. Said security shall amount to at least EUR 15 million and shall be guaranteed by a bank surety to be activated upon the first request for at least EUR 5 million and by an insurance surety for the remaining amount in favour of Ente Nazionale dell'Aviazione Civile (ENAC), which will use the security to guarantee the performance of the public service obligations. 
1.6 The Infrastructure and Transportation Minister and ENAC, acting in concert with the Autonomous Region of Sardinia, will verify whether the carriers which accept the public service obligations possess the minimum requirements and the means necessary for access to the affected routes in order to determine whether the objectives pursued by the imposition of the public service obligations will be satisfied. At the conclusion of the verification, the carriers which are considered to be qualified to service the affected routes will be admitted to service the affected routes. 
1.7 Each carrier which accepts the above mentioned public service obligations imposed on the affected routes must meet the following minimum requirements: 
must be a Community air carrier in possession of the AOC and the required license in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92, 
dispose of a sufficient number of aircraft capable of satisfying the prescribed public service obligations, 
employ on the affected routes personnel who correctly and fluently speak the Italian language, 
distribute and sell tickets with at least one of the principal CRS (Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre, World Span) by internet, by telephone, at airport ticket counters, and through the travel agency system, 
self-certify of having obtained during the period from 1 January 2003 to 30 September 2004 a total regularity coefficient equal to at least 98 % and an on-time coefficient of at least 80 % within 20 minutes, 
provide the performance security as described in Point 1.5. 
1.8 In order to guarantee the objectives of continuity, reliability, punctuality and security of service, the carriers which intend to accept the public service obligations imposed on the affected routes shall provide ENAC with the appropriate documents (in the Italian language or in the English language) attesting to be in possession of the abovementioned minimum requirements as well as the organisational, technical, and financial resources to be allocated to the service. 
1.9 The carriers which accept the present public service obligations undertake to observe and respect the law of the Member States, international law and Community law with regard to the protection of passengers, in cases of physical damage, overbooking, late flights, cancelled flights, lost baggage, late arrived baggage, and damaged baggage. Such carriers also undertake beginning on 1 January 2005 to comply with the new Community rules set forth in Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 concerning overbooking, cancelled flights and late flights, and in particularly regarding the rights of disabled passengers and passengers having a reduced mobility. Contemporaneously with the acceptance of the present public service obligations, the carriers commit themselves to conform their behaviour toward air passengers and consumers to the principles contained in the Charter of European and Italian Passengers' Rights.

4.3 The favoured fare is not subject to limitations. No restriction shall apply to the favoured fare, such as a penalty for changing the date, time, or ticket, nor any penalty for a refund, provided that the changes or the refund request are made prior to 48 hours of departure.

4.6 In the event of notice that the average fuel cost beginning in the second semester of 2004 sustains percentage variations greater than 5 %, the fares shall be revised with respect to such percentage variations and in proportion to the fuel cost's effect on the carrier's performance costs. Any possible adjustment shall be decided on a semester basis by the Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation in agreement with the President of the Autonomous Region of Sardinia on the basis of an investigation conducted by a joint technical committee comprised of a representative nominated by the Minister of Infrastructure and Transportation, a representative nominated by ENAC and by a representative nominated by the Autonomous Region of Sardinia. In the event of an increase in excess of the indicated percentage, the said joint technical committee shall initiate proceedings to decide an adjustment upon receiving notice from the carriers operating on the affected routes. In the event of a decrease, the said joint technical committee may autonomously initiate proceedings to decide an adjustment without receiving any notice from the carriers. During the course of the investigation, the joint technical committee must hear the carriers operating on the affected routes. Any possible fare adjustment shall become effective beginning with the semester following the semester in the joint technical committee received notice or acted autonomously on the basis of its own notice.
