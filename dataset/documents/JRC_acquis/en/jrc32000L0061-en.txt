(3) A provision should be included to allow certain Member States, because of their climatic conditions, to apply stricter standards relating to certain equipment used in transport. 
(4) The standardisation work of the CEN on receptacles and tanks has not yet been completed; it is therefore necessary to amend the deadlines laid down in Article 6(4) of Directive 94/55/EC. 
(5) It is necessary to ensure consistency between the provisions of Directive 94/55/EC and the amendments required to adapt the annexes thereto to scientific and technical progress. 
(6) The deadlines laid down in Article 6(4) of Directive 94/55/EC regarding certain equipment should be put back; identifying the equipment concerned and the latest date for the application of Directive 94/55/EC should be made subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9 thereof. 
(7) The derogation provided for in Article 6(9) of Directive 94/55/EC should be made subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9 thereof. 
(8) Member States should be allowed to adopt derogations with regard to local transport operations and authorisation for that purpose should be made subject to the procedure laid down in Article 9 of Directive 94/55/EC. 
(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5). 
(10) The conditions to be fulfilled before a transport operation may be regarded as an ad hoc transport operation should be specified.
