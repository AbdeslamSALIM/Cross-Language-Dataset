Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97 [1] (the %quot%exemption Regulation%quot%) authorises the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty on imports of certain bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China. This duty resulted from the extension by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 [2] of the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 [3], maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000 [4] and last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005 [5]. 
In this framework, and by successive Commission Decisions, a certain number of bicycle producers have been exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty: inter alia, Bike Systems (Taric additional code 8034) [6], Biria GmbH (Taric additional code 8062) [7], Cicli Lombardo di Gaspare Lombardo %amp% C. Snc (Taric additional code A271) [8], Cicli Regina di Romagna Snc (Taric additional code 8005) [9], Ciclo Meccanica Srl (Taric additional code A170) [10], and Open Space Srl (Taric additional code A486) [11]. 
Bike Systems has informed the Commission that the legal name and address of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty has changed from Bike Systems, 97493 Bergrheinfeld, Germany, to Bike Systems GmbH, Freiherr vom Stein Straße 31, 99734 Nordhausen, Germany. 
Biria GmbH has informed the Commission that the legal name and address of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty has changed from Biria GmbH, 68535 Edingen, Germany, to Biria Bike GmbH, Hauptstraße 37, 01904 Neukirch/Lausitz, Germany. 
Cicli Lombardo di Gaspare Lombardo %amp% C. Snc has informed the Commission that the legal name of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty has changed from Cicli Lombardo di Gaspare Lombardo %amp% C. Snc to Cicli Lombardo S.p.A. 
Cicli Regina di Romagna Snc has informed the Commission that the legal name of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty has changed from Cicli Regina di Romagna Snc to Gruppo Bici Srl. 
Ciclo Meccanica Srl has informed the Commission that the legal name of the company that carries out the assembly operation and consequently requires the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty has changed from Ciclo Meccanica Srl to GI Bike Srl. 
Open Space Srl has informed the Commission that the legal address of the company has changed from Via Guido Rossa 18/A, 35020 Roncaglia de Ponte San Nicolo, Padova, Italy, to Viale Europa 6/B, Int. D, 35020 Roncaglia de Ponte San Nicolo, Padova, Italy. 
The Commission, after having examined the information supplied, has established that the changes in the companies' names and legal addresses do not affect the assembly operations with regard to the stipulations of the exemption Regulation and therefore the Commission does not consider that these changes should affect the exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.
