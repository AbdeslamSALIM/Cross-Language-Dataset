ANNEX 
TURKEY: 2003 ACCESSION PARTNERSHIP 
1. INTRODUCTION 
At its meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, the European Council decided that the Accession Partnership would be the key feature of the enhanced preaccession strategy, mobilising all forms of assistance to the candidate countries within a single framework. In this manner, the Community targets its assistance towards the specific needs of each candidate so as to provide support for overcoming particular problems with a view to accession. 
The first Accession Partnership for Turkey was decided in March 2001. In the Commission's strategy paper on enlargement of 9 October 2002, it was stated that the Commission would propose a revised Accession Partnership for Turkey. 
2. OBJECTIVES 
The purpose of the Accession Partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's 2002 regular report on the progress made by Turkey towards accession, the financial means available to help Turkey implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. The Accession Partnership provides the basis for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate States in their preparations for membership. It is expected that Turkey on the basis of this revised Accession Partnership adopts a revised national programme for the adoption of the acquis. 
3. PRINCIPLES 
The main priority areas identified for each candidate State relate to their ability to take on the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires: 
- that the candidate State has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities, 
- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union, 
- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. 
At its meeting in Madrid in 1995, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate States to adjust their administrative structures to ensure harmonious operation of Community policies after accession and at Luxembourg, in 1997, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied. The Feira and Gothenburg European Councils in 2000 and 2001 respectively confirmed the vital importance of the applicant countries' capacity to implement and enforce the acquis, and added that this required important efforts by the applicants in strengthening and reforming their administrative and judicial structures. 
4. PRIORITIES 
The Commission's regular reports have highlighted, besides the progress already made, the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by the candidate States to prepare for accession. This situation requires the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the States concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with some countries and the opening of new negotiations with the others. 
The priorities in the Accession Partnership are divided into two groups - short and medium term. Those under the short term have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Turkey can fulfil them in 2003/2004. The priorities listed under the medium term are expected to take more than one year to complete although work should be taken forward substantially in 2003/2004. 
The Accession Partnership indicates the priority areas for Turkey's membership preparations. Turkey will nevertheless have to address all issues identified in the regular report. It is also important that Turkey fulfils the commitments of legislative approximation and implementation of the acquis in accordance with the commitments made under the Association Agreement, customs union and related decisions of the EC-Turkey Association Council, for example on the trade regime for agricultural products. It should be recalled that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis. 
Drawing on the analysis of the Commission's regular report, the following priorities have been identified for Turkey. 
ENHANCED POLITICAL DIALOGUE AND POLITICAL CRITERIA 
Priorities (2003/2004) 
In accordance with the Helsinki Conclusions, in the context of the political dialogue, strongly support efforts to find a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, through the continuation of the United Nations Secretary-General's mission of good offices and of negotiations on the basis of his proposals. 
In accordance with the Helsinki Conclusions, in the context of the political dialogue, under the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the UN Charter, make every effort to resolve any outstanding border disputes and other related issues, as referred to in point 4 of the Helsinki Conclusions.

Ratify Protocol 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Comply with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, including respect of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (section II of the Convention). 
Implement measures to fight against torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement officials, in line with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. Adopt further measures to ensure that prosecutors conduct timely and effective investigations of alleged cases and that courts impose adequate punishments on those convicted of abuses. 
Guarantee in practice the right for detained and imprisoned persons to access in private to a lawyer and to have relatives notified, from the outset of their custody, in line with the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Guarantee in law and in practice the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all individuals without discrimination and irrespective of language, race, colour, sex, political opinion, religion or belief in line with relevant international and European instruments to which Turkey is a party. 
Pursue and implement reforms concerning freedom of expression including freedom of the press. Lift legal restrictions in line with the European Convention on Human Rights (Articles 10, 17 and 18). Remedy the situation of those persons prosecuted or sentenced for non-violent expression of opinion. Implement legal provisions on the right to re-trial following the relevant judgment of the European Court of Human Rights. 
Pursue and implement reforms concerning freedom of association and peaceful assembly. Lift legal restrictions in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, in particular on both foreign and national associations, including trade unions (Articles 11, 17 and 18). Encourage the development of civil society. 
Adapt and implement provisions concerning the exercise of freedom of thought, conscience and religion by all individuals and religious communities in line with Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Establish conditions for the functioning of these communities, in line with the practice of EU Member States. This includes legal and judicial protection of the communities, their members and their assets, teaching, appointing and training of clergy, and the enjoyment of property rights in line with Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Ensure cultural diversity and guarantee cultural rights for all citizens irrespective of their origin. Ensure effective access to radio/TV broadcasting and education in languages other than Turkish through implementation of existing measures and the removal of remaining restrictions that impede this access. 
Adapt the functioning of the National Security Council in order to align civilian control of the military with practice in EU Member States. 
Strengthen the independence and efficiency of the judiciary and promote consistent interpretation of legal provisions related to human rights and fundamental freedoms in line with the European Convention on Human Rights. Take measures with a view to ensuring that the obligation for all judicial authorities to take into account the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights is respected. Align the functioning of State security courts with European standards. Prepare the establishment of intermediate courts of appeal. 
Continue to bring conditions in prisons into line with standards in EU Member States. 
Extend the training of law enforcement officials on human rights issues and modern investigation techniques, in particular as regards the fight against torture and ill-treatment, in order to prevent human rights violations. Extend the training of judges and prosecutors on the application of the European Convention on Human Rights and the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. 
Intensify efforts to develop a comprehensive approach to reduce regional disparities, and in particular to improve the situation in the south-east, with a view to enhancing economic, social and cultural opportunities for all citizens. In this context, the return of internally displaced persons to their original settlements should be supported and speeded up.

5. PROGRAMMING 
Financial assistance for the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership will be made available through annual financing decisions taken by the Commission, following the procedure set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001 on preaccession financial assistance for Turkey (OJ L 342, 27.12.2001, S. 1). The financing decisions will be followed by a Financing Memorandum signed with Turkey. 
During the period 2003 to 2006, preaccession financial assistance will focus on two main priorities, institution-building and investment. Institution-building is the process of helping candidate countries to develop the structures, strategies, human resources and management skills needed to strengthen their economic, social, regulatory and administrative capacity. Preaccession assistance will contribute to the financing of institution building in all sectors. Around 30 % of the available resources will be allocated for this purpose and are mainly deployed and implemented with member states through the instrument of %quot%twinning%quot%. 
The second priority, %quot%investment%quot% will take two forms: 
- investment to establish or to strengthen the regulatory infrastructure needed (implementation bodies; enforcement and inspection capabilities) to ensure compliance with the acquis and direct, acquis-related investments, 
- investment in economic and social cohesion, taking into account the importance of regional disparities between Turkish regions as well as the gap between Turkey's national income and the EU average. This will promote the functioning of the market economy and the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the EU. 
Around 70 % of resources will be allocated for investment. Cross-border cooperation, especially at the present external frontiers of the EU and also between adjacent candidate countries, is important in contributing to economic development in the border regions of these countries. As part of investment in economic and social cohesion, efforts will be made to promote participation by Turkey in cross border activities and to ensure consistency with the Interreg approach on Turkey's borders with the EU. 
Since 2000, the Commission has provided annual average assistance to Turkey of EUR 177 million. The Conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council recommended that this amount be substantially increased from 2004. The Commission's strategy paper %quot%Towards an enlarged Union%quot% envisaged at least doubling this level of assistance by 2006. 
5.1. ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 
Turkey is a major beneficiary of assistance from the European Investment Bank (EIB). The country may benefit from up to five different mandates and facilities: the EuroMed II lending mandate for Mediterranean countries, the Mediterranean Partnership facility, the special action mandate for Turkey, the Turkey earthquake reconstruction and rehabilitation assistance facility and the preaccession facility. In total, Turkey received loan financing worth EUR 445 million from 1992 to 1999. This has increased dramatically and over the period 2000 to 2002 EIB lending for projects in Turkey totalled EUR 1500 million. 
The Commission and the Turkish authorities have also sought a high degree of complementarity between the preaccession financial assistance programme and the ongoing reform programmes supported by the international financial institutions, particularly the World Bank, in such areas as education, regulatory reform and public procurement. 
6. CONDITIONALITY 
Community assistance for financing projects through the preaccession instruments is conditional on the respect by Turkey of its commitments under the EC-Turkey Agreements, including Customs union Decision 1/95 and other decisions, further concrete steps towards satisfying effectively the Copenhagen criteria and in particular progress in meeting the specific priorities of this revised Accession Partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001. Specific conditions are also included in individual annual programmes. 
7. MONITORING 
The implementation of the Accession Partnership is monitored in the framework of the Association Agreement. The Association Agreement subcommittees provide the possibility of reviewing implementation of the Accession Partnership priorities as well as progress as regards legal approximation, implementation and enforcement. The Association Committee discusses overall developments, progress and problems in meeting the Accession Partnership's priorities as well as more specific issues referred to it from the subcommittees. 
The monitoring of the preaccession financial assistance programme shall be carried out jointly by Turkey and the European Commission through a Joint Monitoring Committee. In order to ensure the effectiveness of monitoring, projects being funded under each Financing Memorandum must incorporate verifiable and measurable indicators of achievements. Monitoring based on these indicators will assist the Commission, the Phare Management Committee and Turkey in subsequently reorienting programmes where necessary and in the design of new programmes. 
The Phare Management Committee ensures that actions financed under the preaccession programme are compatible with each other as well as with the Accession Partnership as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001. 
The Accession Partnership will continue to be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 622/98 (OJ L 85, 20.3.1998, p. 1).
