THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 737/90 of 22 March 1990 on the conditions governing imports of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 616/2000(2), and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) According to Article 1(3)(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1661/1999 of 27 July 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 737/90 on the conditions governing imports of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1627/2000(4), the products listed in Annex I to that Regulation may only be declared for free circulation in the Member State of destination in a restricted number of customs offices. Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1661/1999 contains the list of those customs offices. 
(2) In view of the request of the competent authorities of Germany, it is appropriate to add a number of customs offices in the territory of Germany to the list. 
(3) In June 2000, an inspection team of the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carried out a mission in Bulgaria, in order to assess the facilities and measures in place to control radioactive contamination in foodstuffs and in particular in non-cultivated mushrooms. 
(4) The report of that mission recommends an amendment to the export certificate set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1661/1999, in order to ensure that an independent and authorised person takes representative samples from mushroom consignments intended for export into the Community. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1661/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 737/90,
