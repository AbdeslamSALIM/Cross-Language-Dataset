COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/24/EC of 29 April 1996 amending Directive 79/373/EEC on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Council Directive 77/101/EEC of 23 November 1976 on the marketing of straight feedingstuffs (4) has been repealed by Council Directive 96/25/EC of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials, amending Directives 70/524/EEC, 74/63/EEC, 82/471/EEC and 93/74/EEC and repealing Directive 77/101/EEC (5); 
Whereas Directive 96/25/EC aims, in particular, to remove differences between the national legislations concerning straight feedingstuffs and raw materials; whereas, to that end, it introduces a common term 'feed materials` and a definition of that term which covers straight feedingstuffs and raw materials; whereas, consequently, those terms and their definitions in Directive 79/373/EEC (6) should be replaced by the new common term and by its definition as given in Directive 96/25/EC; whereas these amendments have an impact on the definition of compound feedingstuffs; 
Whereas the list contained in Part B of the Annex to Directive 96/25/EC should be used for the circulation of feed materials whatever their intended use, as well as for the labelling of feed materials used in compound feedingstuffs; 
Whereas Commission Directive 92/87/EEC of 26 October 1992 establishing a non-exclusive list of the main ingredients normally used and marketed for the preparation of compound feedingstuffs intended for animals other than pets (7) lays down a list of ingredients for the labelling requirements of compound feedingstuffs; whereas measures should be taken to ensure that Directive 92/87/EEC is repealed with the entry into force of Parts A and B of the Annex to Directive 96/25/EC,
