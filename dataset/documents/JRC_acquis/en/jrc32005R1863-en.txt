Commission Regulation (EC) No 1863/2005 
of 15 November 2005 
opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of common wheat held by the Latvian intervention agency for processing into flour in the Community 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies [2] provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at a selling price which is not below the price recorded on the market at the place of storage or, failing that, on the nearest market, account being taken of transport costs, for an equivalent quality and for a representative quantity preventing market disturbance. 
(2) Due to adverse weather conditions at the time of the 2005 harvest, the forecast quantity of common wheat in Latvia is insufficient to meet internal demand. Moreover, Latvia has intervention stocks of common wheat, outlets for which are hard to find and which should therefore be disposed of. Sales on the Community market may therefore be organised by tendering procedure with a view to processing the common wheat into flour. 
(3) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. 
(4) To enable checks on the particular destination of the stocks covered by tendering procedures, provision should be made for specific monitoring of the delivery of the common wheat and its processing into flour. To permit this monitoring, application of the procedures laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention [3] should be made compulsory. 
(5) To guarantee proper performance, tenderers should be asked to lodge a security which, in view of the nature of the operations concerned, should be fixed by derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, in particular as regards its level, which must be sufficient to guarantee the proper use of the products, and the conditions for its release, which must include proof of processing of the products into flour. 
(6) It is also important that the Latvian intervention agency’s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers. 
(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The Latvian intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 24276 tonnes of common wheat held by it with a view to its processing into flour. 
Article 2 
The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
However, notwithstanding: 
(a) Article 13(1) of that Regulation, tenders shall be drawn up by reference to the actual quality of the lot to which they apply; 
(b) the second paragraph of Article 10 of that Regulation, the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market. 
Article 3

(b) the tenderer’s written undertaking to use the common wheat for processing within the Community into flour within 60 days of its release from intervention storage and in any event before 31 August 2006 and to lodge a security of EUR 40 per tonne within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received;
