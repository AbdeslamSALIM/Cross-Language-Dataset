Case T-344/05: Action brought on 13 September 2005 — Hellenic Republic v Commission 
Action brought on 13 September 2005 — Hellenic Republic v Commission 
Parties: 
Applicant(s): Hellenic Republic (represented by: Ioannis Khalkias, Eleni Svolopoulou) 
Defendant(s): Commission of the European Communities 
Form of order sought 
The applicant(s) claim(s) that the Court should: 
- annul or amend the contested decision of the Commission of 15 July 2005 refusing the request for Community financing of certain expenditure incurred by the Member States under the European Agricultural and Guidance Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section; [1] 
- order the Commission to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
By the contested decision the Commission, in clearing the accounts under Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, [2] excluded from Community financing various expenditure incurred by the Hellenic Republic in the animal premia — extensification, fruit and vegetables and arable crops sectors. 
The applicant seeks annulment of that decision, maintaining in principle that the entire clearance of accounts procedure is invalid because Article 7 of Regulation No 1258/1999, [3] in conjunction with Article 8 of Regulation No 1663/1995, [4] was infringed by reason of the fact that the consultation and bilateral contacts between the applicant and the Commission did not include the specific evaluation of the expenditure to be refused, while in addition the expenditure excluded was effected prior to the 24 months preceding the Commission's written communication. According to the applicant, the period of 24 months commences much later than the Commission considers. 
As regards the correction of 100 % in respect of the premium for extensification, the applicant disputes the Commission's assessment of the factual circumstances and claims that it erred as to the facts and gave an inadequate statement of reasons for the contested decision. The applicant considers, moreover, that the imposition of a correction at the rate of 100 % contravenes the guidelines in Commission document VI/5330/97/23.12.97, is unjustified and clearly disproportionate, and goes beyond the bounds of proper use of the Commission's discretion. 
As regards the correction in the arable crops sector, the applicant disputes the Commission's finding that there was an infringement of Regulation No 3508/1992, [5] in connection with the identification of agricultural parcels. It also considers that it complied fully with the conditions in Article 15 of Regulation No 2419/2001 [6] as regards administrative and on-the-spot checks. In addition, it cites lack of reasoning and infringement of the principle of proportionality. 
Lastly, in connection with the correction in the fruit and vegetables sector, the applicant considers that the Commission has misinterpreted Article 20(5) and (7) of Regulation No 1169/1997. [7] In any event, the applicant disputes the reasons given in the contested decision with regard to that chapter and alleges infringement of the principle of proportionality.
