Re: 
Failure by a Member State to fulfil obligations — Articles 43 and 56 EC — Rights attached to the Netherlands State's special share in the company Koninklijke KPN NV 
Operative part of the judgment 
1. By maintaining in the statutes of KPN NV and TPG NV certain provisions, providing that the capital of those companies is to include a special share held by the Netherlands State, which confers on the latter special rights to approve certain management decisions of the organs of those companies, which are not limited to cases where the intervention of that State is necessary for overriding reasons in the general interest recognised by the Court and, in the case of TPG NV in particular for ensuring the maintenance of universal postal service, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 56(1) EC. 
2. The Kingdom of the Netherlands is ordered to pay the costs.
