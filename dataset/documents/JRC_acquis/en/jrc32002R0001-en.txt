Commission Regulation (EC) No 1/2002 
of 28 December 2001 
laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 as regards the simplified scheme for payments to farmers under certain support schemes 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 of 17 May 1999 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1244/2001(2), and in particular Article 11(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2a of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 provides for a simplified scheme for the payments to be made under certain support schemes. In order to achieve the aim of simplification pursued by that scheme, it is necessary to simplify the way in which the aids concerned are granted by derogating from certain provisions of the Regulations referred to in that Article, as well as from the Regulations adopted for their implementation, in particular as regards eligibility conditions, dates of application and payments and control provisions. 
(2) In the interest of simplification the farmers should receive, upon request, an application form filled in by the national administration. This single application should replace the existing separate applications for the aids concerned, combining area and livestock aids. Acceptance of the application should guarantee payment to the farmer of a fixed amount, without any further application during the entire period of participation. For reasons of clarity, it is appropriate to specify the payments that will be included in the calculation of the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme and the exchange rate applicable to those Member States which have not adopted the euro. 
(3) Specific rules should be established in order to make the control procedures as simple as possible without increasing the risk of double claims. For this purpose, it is appropriate to provide for a temporary blocking of the areas or number of premium rights corresponding to the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme, in the sense that the area and/or livestock premium rights in respect of which a simplified aid application has been submitted should be subject to certain conditions, and to provide for specific rules for calculating the number of hectares and livestock premium rights in respect of the reference period and the maximum amount to be taken into consideration. The parcels and premium rights corresponding to the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme should be the subject of a declaration that remains valid throughout the period of participation in the simplified scheme. In the case of aid for processing the straw of flax grown for fibre provided for in Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre(3), this declaration should replace the yearly %quot%area%quot% aid application provided for in Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 245/2001 of 5 February 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1093/2001(5). 
(4) Although farmers should be required to retain a minimum area or number of premium rights, they should be able to dispose of the area or premium rights not covered by the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme. In duly justified cases, such as expiry of lease, restructuring programmes or public intervention, Member States should be able to permit farmers to replace the declared parcels with equivalent ones. In order to ensure budget neutrality, the eligibility conditions applicable to the areas which have received aids covered by the simplified scheme should continue to apply to the corresponding areas to be blocked in order to receive the simplified scheme aid. 
(5) As far as extensification payments are concerned, areas corresponding to the extensification payment part of the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme should be blocked as in the case of areas corresponding to area aid. If a farmer keeps animals, in order to ensure compliance with the provisions on extensive types of production, certain stocking density rules should continue to apply to such areas. However, it is appropriate to ensure a certain flexibility allowing the farmer to undertake to abide by certain conditions on the number of animals to be held, as a maximum, throughout the period of participation in the simplified scheme. 
(6) If the farmer does not have parcels or premium rights to be blocked corresponding to the number of hectares or livestock notified by the competent authority, taking into account the investment that is necessary to buy or rent a parcel or a right to premium, Member States should be able to accept a declaration of an area or of a number of premium rights which does not correspond to the number of hectares or livestock premium rights notified. In this case, the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme should be reduced pro rata. 
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999 provides that the implementing rules for the simplified scheme are also to include detailed rules in order to avoid double claims in respect of the area and production covered by the simplified scheme. Therefore, farmers who receive aid under the simplified scheme should be prevented from receiving other direct aids in respect of the same calendar year. There should be a derogation for cases in which the relevant regulations allow cumulation of aids. 
(8) Budget neutrality requires that the areas and number of premium rights used to establish the entitlement to participation in the simplified scheme and which have been blocked are taken into account in the calculation of the overshoot of the base areas or ceilings concerned by reducing the relevant corresponding base areas or livestock premium ceilings. However, since farmers participating in the simplified scheme have no obligation to produce a specific crop or to keep animals in order to be entitled to the aid, the proportional reduction to be applied in the case of overshoot of the area or ceilings should not be applied to their area or rights. 
(9) In order to protect the financial interests of the Community, it is appropriate to provide for a system of sanctions in the event of non-compliance with this Regulation. For this purpose, it is appropriate to refer to the rules provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 of 11 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2550/2001(7). 
(10) In order to simplify the burden of controls, participants in the simplified scheme should form a separate population for the purposes of control sampling as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 and a reduced rate of control to should be established. 
(11) In order for the Commission to be informed in detail of the measures taken by Member States to implement Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999, pursuant to Article 9 thereof, rules concerning the content and timing of communications with regard to the simplified scheme should be adopted, taking into account the timetable for the establishment of the Community budget and on the basis of existing formats as far as the contents are concerned. 
(12) The relevant management committees have not delivered opinions within the time limits set laid down by their chairmen,

Reductions and exclusions 
1. Except in cases of force majeure or exceptional circumstances as defined in Article 48 of Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001, where, as a result of an administrative or on-the-spot check, it is found that one or more of the area aid related conditions established by Member States in accordance with Article 2a(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1259/1999, as well as those set out in Article 5 and Article 11(1) of this Regulation are not respected and if the established difference between the area declared and the area determined, within the meaning of Article 2(r) of Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001, is more than 3 % but no more than 30 % of the area determined, the area aid part of the amount to be granted under the simplified scheme shall be reduced, for the calendar year in question, by twice the difference found. 
If the difference is more than 30 % of the area determined, no area aid part shall be granted under the simplified scheme for the calendar year in question.
