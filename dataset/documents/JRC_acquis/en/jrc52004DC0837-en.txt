COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSIONTO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL 
Technical adjustment of the financial perspective for 2006 in line with movements in GNI and prices (Point 15 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure) 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[1], as adjusted for enlargement and revised in 2003[2], contains the financial perspective table for EU-25 (Table 1a). 
Point 15 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that each year the Commission will, ahead of the budgetary procedure for year n+1, make a technical adjustment to the financial perspective in line with movements in the EU's gross national income (GNI) and prices. 
The purpose of this communication is to present to the budgetary authority the result of this technical adjustment (EU-25) for 2006. 
2. TERMS OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE TABLE (TABLES 1-3) 
Table 1 shows the financial perspective for EU-25 adjusted for 2006 at current prices. 
Table 2 shows the financial perspective for EU-25 adjusted for 2006 at current prices, including the budgetary implications of a political settlement in Cyprus. 
Table 3 presents the economic parameters used for this adjustment exercise. They are based on data drawn up by Eurostat and on the most recent forecasts made by the Commission in conjunction with national experts (economic forecasts, autumn 2004). The figures and forecasts are based on the European System of Accounts revised in 1995 (ESA 95). 
2.1. Adjustment of expenditure ceilings by heading 
The adjustment is calculated by applying the following deflators to the commitment appropriations in the financial perspective (at 1999 prices): 
- a cumulative deflator of 14,87% for the period 2000-2006 to the ceiling for heading 1 and to the figure for the Structural Funds in heading 2, in accordance with point 15 of the Interinstitutional Agreement (fixed annual rate of 2% ). 
- the GNI deflator in euros for 2000-2006 (14,29%) to the ceilings of the other expenditure headings (actual deflator). 
In accordance with point 23 (a) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999, the monetary reserve has been eliminated as from 2003. 
To ensure consistency with the Cohesion Fund, allocations for the ten new Member States enshrined in the Accession treaties, the overall figure for the Cohesion Fund in 2006 prices has been rounded up to the superior unit. 
As regards payments , the adjustment is based on the appropriations for payments estimated for each expenditure heading when the financial perspective was drawn up (1999 prices). The method of calculation is set out in the following table:

Appropriations for payments concerning the ten new Member States that joined the European Union on May 1st, 2004 have been added to appropriations for payments concerning the fifteen Members, in 1999 prices and for each sub-category of the table above. Sub-totals for 2006 in 1999 prices are then adjusted in 2006 prices according to the relevant deflator: heading 1 and the Structural Funds share of heading 2 have been adjusted by means of a 14,87 % cumulative deflator; other headings or expenditure have been adjusted by means of a 14,29 % cumulative deflator. 
2.2. Main results of the technical adjustment of the Financial Perspective for 2006 (EU-25) 
The overall ceiling on appropriations for commitments for 2006 comes to € 123.515 million, equivalent to 1,12% of GNI. 
The corresponding overall ceiling on the appropriations for payments comes to € 119.112 million, i.e. 1,08% of GNI. On the basis of current economic forecasts, this leaves a margin beneath the own resources ceiling of € 18.059 million (0,16% of GNI for EU-25). 
For 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, the size of the margin has been updated from the previous technical adjustment using the most recent GNI estimates so that comparisons can be made over a number of years. However, the ceilings in commitments and payments resulting from the adjustments do not change. 
2.3. The financial perspective adjusted in 2006 prices including budgetary implications of a political settlement in Cyprus 
Table 2 presents the financial framework EU-25 for 2006 at current prices including the budgetary implications of a political settlement in Cyprus. 
This table has been adjusted in the same way as Table 1 and will apply in the event that Cyprus is unified before December 31, 2006. 
3. OTHER ELEMENTS LINKED TO THE EXERCISE OF TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT 
3.1. The agricultural guideline 
The agricultural guideline has been calculated in accordance with Article 3 of the Council Regulation on budgetary discipline[3] (see Table 4 ). 
The figures for sugar and isoglucose levies, food aid refunds and ACP sugar refunds are based at this stage on the forecasts for the 2006 budget. In accordance with the regulation on budgetary discipline, the final level of these specific items in the guideline will be fixed when the preliminary draft budget for 2006 is presented. 
In 2006 the agricultural guideline is provisionally estimated at € 58.634 million[4]. 
3.2. Heading 5 (Administration) 
In the case of heading 5, a footnote to the financial perspective states that the figures for pensions included under the ceiling for this heading are to be calculated net of staff contributions to the pension scheme, up to a maximum of € 1.100 million (1999 prices) for the period 2000-2006. As stated in the Commission communication on the technical adjustment for 2000[5], "this provision should be interpreted as imposing a dual limit on the amounts deducted from expenditure on pensions when applying the ceiling of the heading": 
- This amount may not exceed the contributions actually entered as budget revenue in any one year; 
- The accumulated total of deductions for the period 2000-2006 may not exceed € 1.100 million at 1999 prices, equivalent to an average of € 157 million (€ 180 million at 2006 prices). 
For the previous years of the financial perspective 2000-2006, the recurrent nature of administrative expenditure imposed that the lowest limit was adopted annually to avoid using a margin at the start of the period which would no longer be fully available afterwards. For 2006 –the last year of the period– the remaining available amount which can be deducted is also the lowest amount, i. e. a maximum of € 180 million at current prices for 2006. 
3.3. Operations outside the budget 
The fifth subparagraph of point 10 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that information relating to operations not included in the general budget and the foreseeable development of the various categories of own resources is to be set out in tables, as an indication, and updated annually when the technical adjustment is made to the financial perspective. 
This information, updated in line with the latest estimates available, is set out in Tables 5.1 to 5.2. It covers the European Development Fund (EDF) and the structure of own resources.
