Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security (Text with EEA relevance) - Interinstitutional declaration 
Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 16 December 2002 
establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the conclusions of the Transport Council of 16 October 2001, and in particular paragraph 9 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2), 
After consulting the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 15 November 2002, 
Whereas: 
(1) The criminal acts committed in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001 show that terrorism is one of the greatest threats to the ideals of democracy and freedom and the values of peace, which are the very essence of the European Union. 
(2) The protection of the citizen within the European Community should at all times be ensured in civil aviation by preventing acts of unlawful interference. 
(3) Without prejudice to rules of the Member States in the field of national security and of measures to be taken on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, such objective should be achieved by the adoption of appropriate provisions in the field of air transport policy establishing common basic standards, based on the current recommendations of the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC) Document 30. Executive powers should be delegated to the Commission to adopt the related detailed implementation measures. In order to prevent unlawful acts, certain of these implementation measures should be secret and not be published. 
(4) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. 
(5) The various types of civil aviation activities are not necessarily subject to the same type of threat. It is therefore necessary for the detailed implementation measures to be duly adjusted to the special circumstances of each activity and to the sensitivity of certain measures. 
(6) At small airports, the application of common basic standards might be disproportionate or their implementation might be impossible for objective practical reasons. In such case the appropriate authorities of the Member States should have the possibility to apply alternative measures providing an adequate level of protection. The Commission should examine whether these measures are justified for objective practical reasons and whether they provide an adequate level of protection. 
(7) The Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944, (Chicago Convention) provides for minimum standards to ensure the security of civil aviation. 
(8) In order to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, each Member State should adopt a national civil aviation security programme, as well as a corresponding quality control programme and a training programme. 
(9) In view of the diversity of the parties involved in the implementation of security measures at national level, it is necessary for each Member State to designate a single appropriate authority responsible for the coordination and the monitoring of the implementation of aviation security programmes. 
(10) Member States should be given the possibility to apply more stringent measures. 
(11) The monitoring of security measures requires the setting up at national level of appropriate quality control systems and the organisation of inspections under the supervision of the Commission, so as to verify the effectiveness of each national system. 
(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4). 
(13) Arrangements for greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London on 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a joint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, and such arrangements have yet to come into operation. 
(14) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the establishment and application of appropriate provisions in the field of air transport policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the Europe-wide scope of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation confines itself to the common basic standards required in order to achieve the objectives of aviation security and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

4. PASSENGERS AND CABIN BAGGAGE 
4.1. Screening of Passengers 
1. Other than as referred to in point 3 below, all departing passengers (i.e. originating and transfer passengers, unless previously screened to the standard detailed in this Annex), shall be screened to prevent prohibited articles from being introduced into the security restricted areas and on board an aircraft. Passengers shall be screened by the following methods: 
(a) searched by hand; or 
(b) screened by Walk-Through-Metal-Detection equipment. Where Walk-Through-Metal-Detection equipment is used there shall also be a continuous random hand search of screened passengers. Such hand searches shall be carried out on all passengers who cause the equipment to alarm, as well as a continuous random search which shall be carried out on those passengers who do not cause the equipment to alarm, and if: 
(i) the alarm is activated, the person shall be required to be screened again with Walk-Through-Metal-Detection equipment; or 
(ii) searched by hand where the support of a hand held metal detector may be employed. 
2. Where Walk-Through-Metal-Detection equipment is used, it shall be calibrated to such a level as to reasonably ensure that small metallic items are detected. 
3. Appropriate authorities may create categories of persons that shall be subject to special screening procedures or exempted from screening. 
4. Security provisions shall be developed for potentially disruptive passengers. 
4.2. Separation of Passengers 
Screened departing passengers shall not mix with arriving passengers who may not have been screened to the standard detailed in this Annex. Where these passengers cannot be physically separated then the security objective shall be achieved by the application of compensatory measures in accordance with the assessment of the risk by the competent authority. 
4.3. Screening of Cabin Baggage 
1. The cabin baggage of all departing passengers (i.e. originating and transfer passengers, unless previously screened to the standard detailed in this Annex), shall be screened prior to being allowed into security restricted areas and on board an aircraft. Any prohibited articles shall be removed from the passenger's possession or the passenger denied access into the security restricted area or the aircraft as appropriate. Cabin baggage shall be screened by one of the following methods: 
(a) a full hand search of the content of each bag, with each bag being examined for suspicious signs such as inconsistent weight etc; or 
(b) screened by conventional x-ray equipment with hand searching of screened bags also being conducted on a continuous random basis, where the percentage of persons so searched is not less than 10 %, including those about which the operator has concerns; or 
(c) screened by High Definition x-ray equipment fitted with TIP installed and employed. Only those bags about which the operator has concerns need be searched by hand but the hand search may be supported by use of Trace Detection Equipment. 
2. Cabin baggage of those parties listed under point 4.1 paragraph 3 may be subject to special screening procedures or exempted from screening. 
4.4. Screening of Diplomats 
Subject to the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, diplomats and other privileged persons and their personal baggage, except %quot%diplomatic bags%quot%, shall be liable to screening for security purposes. Air carrier staff responsible for receiving diplomatic bags shall make sure that they have, in fact, been sent by duly-appointed officials of the missions concerned. Diplomatic couriers and their personal baggage are not exempted from screening. 
5. HOLD BAGGAGE 
5.1. Reconciliation of Hold Baggage 
1. Hold baggage shall not be placed on board an aircraft unless the following measures are taken: 
(a) hold baggage shall be properly marked externally to permit identification with relevant passengers; and 
(b) the passenger to whom such baggage belongs shall be checked in for the flight on which it is to be carried; and 
(c) prior to loading, hold baggage shall be held in an area of the airport to which only authorised persons have access; and 
(d) all items of baggage taken into the custody of an air carrier for carriage in the hold of an aircraft shall be identified as either accompanied or unaccompanied. The process of identification shall be achieved either by manual or automated means. 
2. Measures shall be established to ensure that if a passenger checked in for a flight, who has placed baggage in the custody of the air carrier, is not onboard the aircraft, such hold baggage shall be removed from the aircraft and shall not be carried on that flight. 
3. A hold baggage manifest or an alternative means of providing evidence which confirms the identification and screening of unaccompanied hold baggage shall be drawn up. 
5.2. Screening of Hold Baggage 
1. Accompanied Hold Baggage. All items of accompanied hold baggage (both originating and transfer hold baggage, unless previously screened to the standard detailed in this Annex), shall be screened by one of the following methods before being loaded onto an aircraft: 
(a) hand search; or

Interinstitutional declaration 
In conjunction with the adoption of new Community legislation laying down common rules in the field of civil aviation security the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission re-affirm their determination to continue to strengthen the quality of aviation security systems in the Community. 
The three institutions recognise that this policy development raises important questions in relation to its funding aspects. In this context, while recognising the diversity of situations that currently exist in Member States and taking into account the policy position taken in February 2002 by the Member States of the EU at the Montreal Ministerial Conference on Aviation Security(1) and taking note of the statement by the Commission that it would %quot%consider positively public financing for the compensation of additional security measures%quot%(2), the necessity to avoid significant internal and external distortions of competition is a specific concern from a Community perspective. 
The three institutions agree that this issue has to be analysed as a matter of urgency in order to identify both differences existing in the Community over the funding of aviation security and possible solutions. 
They take note of the intention of the Commission to undertake immediately a study (which will address in particular the way the financing is shared between the public authorities and the operators, without prejudice to the distribution of competencies between the Member States and the European Community) and to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council the results and proposals if appropriate.
