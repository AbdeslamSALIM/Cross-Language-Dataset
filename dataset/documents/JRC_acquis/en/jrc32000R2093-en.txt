Council Regulation (EC) No 2093/2000 
of 28 September 2000 
prohibiting imports of Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius) originating in Belize and Honduras 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Fishery resources, which are an exhaustible natural resource, must be protected in the interests of biological balances and global food security. 
(2) The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT), to which the European Community is a Contracting Party, adopted in 1995, an Action Plan to ensure the effectiveness of the conservation Programme for Atlantic Tuna, to ensure the effective conservation of this species. 
(3) The stock concerned cannot be managed effectively by the ICCAT contracting parties, whose fishermen are obliged to reduce their catches of Atlantic swordfish, unless all non-contracting parties cooperate with ICCAT and comply with its conservation and management measures. 
(4) In 1998 ICCAT identified Belize and Honduras as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic swordfish in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of the organisation's swordfish conservation measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the observation of vessels. 
(5) ICCAT's attempts to encourage the two countries to comply with measures for the conservation and management of Atlantic swordfish have been to no avail. 
(6) ICCAT has recommended the contracting parties to take appropriate measures to prohibit imports from Belize and Honduras of Atlantic swordfish products in any form; these measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the countries in question have brought their fishing practices into line with ICCAT's measures; these measures must therefore be implemented by the Community, having the sole competence in this matter. 
(7) These measures are compatible with the Community's obligations under other international agreements,
