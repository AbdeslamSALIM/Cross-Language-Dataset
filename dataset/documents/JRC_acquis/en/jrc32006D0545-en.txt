Council Decision 
of 18 July 2006 
on the equivalence of the official examination of varieties carried out in Croatia 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/545/EC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/53/EC of 13 June 2002 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species [1], and in particular Article 22(1)(a) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 2002/53/EC allows for the Council to determine whether the official examinations of varieties carried out in a third country afford the same assurances as those carried out in the Member States. 
(2) The rules on the official examination of varieties carried out in Croatia in respect of wheat, barley and maize provide that the acceptance of varieties as regards their distinctness, stability and uniformity is based on the results of official examinations, particularly growing trials, covering a sufficient number of characteristics for the variety to be described. 
(3) An examination of those rules and the manner in which they are applied in Croatia in respect of the three aforementioned species has shown that they afford the same assurances as those carried out by the Member States, provided that further conditions are satisfied. 
(4) This Decision does not prevent Community findings on equivalence from being revoked if the conditions on which they are based are not, or cease to be, satisfied. 
(5) Given that the Annexes may require frequent modification of their technical provisions, they should be amended in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 4 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [2],
