List of gold coins meeting the criteria established in Article 26b(A) (ii) of Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 as amended by Council Directive 98/80/EC of 12 October 1998 (special scheme for investment gold) 
(2004/C 285/05)

EXPLANATORY NOTE 
(a) This list reflects the contributions sent by Member States to the Commission within the deadline set by Article 26b (A) of the Sixth Directive (as amended by Directive 98/80/EC, of 12 October 1998). 
(b) The coins included in this list are considered to fulfil the criteria of Article 26b and therefore will be treated as investment gold. As a result their supply is exempt from VAT for the whole of the year 2005. 
(c) The exemption will apply to all issues of the given coin in this list, except to issues of coins with a purity smaller than 900 thousandths. 
(d) However, if a coin does not appear in this list, its supply will still be exempt where the coin meets the criteria for the exemption laid down in the Sixth Directive. 
(e) The list is set in alphabetical order, by names of countries and denominations of coins. Within the same category of coins, the listing follows the increasing value of the currency. 
(f) In the list the denomination of the coins reflects the currency shown on the coins. However where the currency on the coins is not shown in roman script, where possible, its denomination in the list is shown in parenthesis.
