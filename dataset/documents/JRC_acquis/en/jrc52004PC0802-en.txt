Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement for scientific and technological co-operation between the European Community and the United Mexican States 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. The Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement[1] between the European Community and its Member States of the one part and the United Mexican States (hereinafter: Mexico) of the other part, entered into force on 1 October 2000. Article 29, paragraph5 of this Agreement identified cooperation on science and technology as an area of particular interest and potential. 
2. In its communication of 19 July 1996 entitled "Promoting RTD cooperation with the world's emerging economies" (COM(96) 344 final) the Commission stressed the benefits of negotiating agreements for scientific and technological cooperation with countries with emerging economies. In its resolution of 14 March 1997 on the above mentioned communication, the European Parliament “calls on the Commission to negotiate, with due regard for the circumstances in each country, bilateral agreements establishing a legal framework for the promotion of RTD cooperation”. 
The strengthening of scientific and technological cooperation with these countries has been reaffirmed in the Commission’s communication entitled “The international dimension of the European Research Area” (COM/2001/346 final). 
3. On 22 January 2002, the Ambassador of Mexico to the EU presented Mexico’s official request to enter into negotiations with the European Community with a view to concluding a specific agreement for scientific and technological cooperation. 
4. On 12 July 2002, the Council authorized the Commission to negotiate an Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Mexico. The negotiations resulted in the attached Agreement, initialed on 2 April 2003 in Mexico and signed on 3 February 2004. 
5. The Agreement was negotiated against the background of an upgraded and intensifying co-operation between Mexico and the European Union, considering the importance of science and technology for economic and social development and the mutual wish to extend and strengthen the conduct of co-operative activities in areas of common interest, as diverse as: 
- research on the environment and climate, including Earth observation, 
- biomedical and health research, 
- agriculture, forestry and fisheries, 
- industrial and manufacturing technologies, 
- research on electronics, materials and metrology, 
- non-nuclear energy, 
- transport, 
- information society technologies, 
- research on economic and social development, 
- biotechnologies , 
- aeronautics and space research and applied research; and 
- science and technology policy. 
On 18 July 2003, the Commission submitted to the Council a proposal for a Council Decision authorising the signing of the abovementioned agreement. The Council adopted this decision on 20 October 2003 and the attached agreement and the annexes thereto were signed on 3 February 2004. 
6. The Agreement is based on the principles of mutual benefit, reciprocal opportunities for access to each other’s programmes and activities relevant to the purpose of the Agreement, non-discrimination, the effective protection of intellectual property and equitable sharing of intellectual property rights. It shall be concluded for an initial period of five years and may be tacitly renewed after full evaluation, based on the results, during the penultimate year of each successive five-year period. 
7. The Agreement provides for : 
- establishment of networks and long-term institutional alliances between research centres and research and technology institutes and joint implementation of projects of common interest; 
- implementation of RTD projects between research and business centres in Mexico and Europe, including technology-based companies; 
- participation of Mexican research institutes in RTD projects under the existing framework programme and reciprocal participation of research institutes established in the Community in Mexican projects in similar sectors of RTD. Such a participation shall be subject to the rules and procedures applicable in RTD programmes of each Party; 
- visits and exchanges of scientists, RTD policy-makers and technical experts, including scientific training through research ; 
- joint organisation of scientific seminars, conferences, symposia and workshops, as well as participation of experts in such activities; 
- exchanges and sharing of equipment and materials including shared use and/or loans of laboratory infrastructure and equipment; 
- exchanges of information on procedures, laws, regulations and programmes relevant to cooperation under this Agreement, exchanges of experience and studies on best practice on science and technology policy; 
- any other form recommended by the Steering Committee and deemed in conformity with the policies and procedures applicable in both Parties; 
- cooperation activities to be subject to the availability of funds and to the applicable laws and regulations, policies and programmes of Mexico and the Community; in principle, no transfer of funds will take place. 
8. As regards dissemination and utilisation of information and management, allocation and exercise of intellectual property rights, resulting from joint research under the Agreement, they shall be subject to the provisions of the annex to this Agreement entitled “Intellectual Property Rights” which forms an integral part thereof. 
9. The principle of non-discrimination agreed under article 3 of the Agreement should protect Community participants in Mexican programmes and activities against any discriminatory treatment, also in respect of the dissemination and utilisation of results, including intellectual property rights. The Steering Committee shall, inter alia, review the efficient and effective functioning of the Agreement, including the non-discriminatory treatment of participants. 
10. Closer collaboration with Mexico on science and technology will also contribute directly to strengthening ties between the two parties and will, in particular, bring substantial benefits for Europeans, by improving the Community's position in Mexico and, consequently, within Latin America as a whole. This is in line with the conclusions adopted by the Council of the European Union on the communication from the Commission on a new European Union-Latin American partnership on the eve of the 21st century (COM (1999) 105 of 9 March 1999), the Rio Declaration by the Heads of State or Government of June 1999 and the contents of the existing CE-Mexico Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement. 
In conclusion, this negotiated agreement for scientific and technological cooperation would be the appropriate instrument for expanding and supplementing current cooperation under the FP6 specific activities for international cooperation with developing countries. 
11. In the light of the above-mentioned considerations, the Commission proposes that the Council 
- approve on behalf of the European Community, and after the consultation of the European Parliament, the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the United Mexican States; 
- notify the Mexican authorities that the procedures necessary for the entry into force of the Agreement have been completed by the European Community.

This Annex is an integral part of the "Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the United Mexican States", hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement". 
Rights to intellectual property created or furnished under the Agreement shall be allocated as provided in this Annex. 
I. Application 
This Annex is applicable to joint research undertaken pursuant to the Agreement, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties. 
II. Ownership, allocation and exercise of rights 
1. This Annex addresses the allocation of rights and interests of the Parties and their participants. Each Party and its participants shall ensure that the other Party and its participants may obtain the rights to intellectual property allocated to it in accordance with this Annex. This Annex does not otherwise alter or prejudice the allocation of rights, interests and royalties between a Party and its nationals or participants, which shall be determined by the laws and practices applicable to each Party. 
2. The Parties shall also be guided by, and contractual arrangements shall provide for, the following principles: 
a) effective protection of intellectual property. The Parties shall ensure that they and/or their participants notify one another within a reasonable time of the creation of any intellectual property arising under the Agreement or implementation arrangements and seek protection for such intellectual property in a timely fashion; 
b) effective exploitation of results, taking into account the contributions of the Parties and their participants and the provisions of Article 9 of the Agreement; 
c) non-discriminatory treatment of participants from the other Party as compared with the treatment given to its own participants without prejudice to Article 9 of the Agreement; 
d) protection of business-confidential information. 
3. The Parties or participants shall jointly develop a Technology Management Plan (TMP) in respect of the ownership and use, including publication, of information and intellectual property to be created in the course of joint research. The TMP shall be approved by the responsible funding agency or other relevant agencies involved in financing the technology, taking account of the opinion of the Steering Committee, before the conclusion of the corresponding specific research and development cooperation contracts of research institutes. The TMP shall be developed within the rules and regulations in force in each Party taking into account the aims of the joint research, the financial or other contributions of the Parties and participants, the advantages and disadvantages of licensing by territory or for fields of use, the transfer of export-controlled data, goods or services, requirements imposed by applicable laws and other factors deemed appropriate by the participants. The rights and obligations concerning the research generated by visiting researchers in respect of intellectual property shall also be addressed in the joint technology management plans. 
With respect to intellectual property, the TMP shall normally address, among other things, ownership, protection, user rights for research and development purposes, exploitation and dissemination, including arrangements for joint publication, the rights and obligations of visiting researchers and dispute settlement procedures. The TMP may also address general and specific information, licensing and deliverables. 
4. Information or intellectual property created in the course of joint research and not addressed in the TMP shall be allocated, with the approval of the Parties, according to the principles set out in the TMP. In case of disagreement, such information or intellectual property shall be owned jointly by all the participants involved in the joint research from which the information or intellectual property results. Each participant to whom this provision applies shall have the right to use such information or intellectual property for his own commercial exploitation with no geographical limitation. 
5. Each Party shall ensure that the other Party and its participants have the rights to intellectual property allocated to them in accordance with these principles. 
6. While maintaining the conditions of competition in areas affected by the Agreement, each Party shall endeavour to ensure that rights acquired pursuant to the Agreement and arrangements made under it are exercised in such a way as to encourage, in particular: 
i) the dissemination and use of information created, disclosed or otherwise made available, under the Agreement, and 
ii) the adoption and implementation of international standards. 
7. Termination or expiry of the Agreement shall not affect rights or obligations in accordance with this Annex. 
III. Copyright works and scientific literary works 
Copyright belonging to the Parties or to their participants shall be accorded treatment consistent with the Berne Convention (Paris Act 1971). The copyright shall protect the expressions but not the ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as such. Limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights may be introduced only in certain special cases which do not obstruct normal exploitation of results nor unduly endanger the legitimate interests of the right-holder. 
Without prejudice to Section II, and unless otherwise agreed in the TMP, results of joint research shall be published jointly by the Parties or participants. Subject to the foregoing general rule, the following procedures shall apply: 
1. In the case of publication by a Party or public bodies of that Party of scientific and technical journals, articles, reports, books, including videos and software arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled to a worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free licence to translate, reproduce, adapt, transmit and publicly distribute such works. 
2. The Parties shall ensure that literary works of a scientific character arising from joint research pursuant to the Agreement and published by independent publishers shall be disseminated as widely as possible. 
3. All copies of a copyright work to be publicly distributed and prepared under this provision shall indicate the names of the author(s) of the work unless an author explicitly declines to be named. Copies shall also bear a clearly visible acknowledgement of the cooperative support of the Parties. 
IV. Inventions, discoveries and other scientific and technological achievements 
Inventions, discoveries and other scientific and technological achievements arising from cooperative activities between the Parties themselves shall be owned by the Parties unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. 
V. UNDISCLOSED INFORMATION 
A. Documentary undisclosed information 
1. Each Party, its agencies or its participants, as appropriate, shall identify at the earliest possible moment, and preferably in the TMP, the information which they wish to remain undisclosed in relation to the Agreement, taking into account, inter alia, the following criteria: 
a) secrecy of the information in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration or assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible by lawful means to experts in the fields; 
b) the actual or potential commercial value of the information by virtue of its secrecy; 
c) previous protection of the information in the sense that it has been subject to steps that were reasonable under the circumstances by the person lawfully in control, to maintain its secrecy. 
The Parties and their participants may in certain cases agree that, unless otherwise indicated, parts or all of the information provided, exchanged or created in the course of joint research pursuant to the Agreement may not be disclosed. 
2. Each Party shall ensure that it and its participants clearly identify undisclosed information, for example by means of an appropriate marking or restrictive legend. This also applies to any reproduction of the said information, in whole or in part. 
Any Party receiving undisclosed information pursuant to the Agreement shall respect the privileged nature thereof. These limitations shall automatically terminate when this information is disclosed by the owner into the public domain. 
3. Undisclosed information communicated under this Agreement may be disseminated by the receiving Party to persons linked to or employed by the receiving Party and other concerned departments or agencies in the receiving Party authorised for the specific purposes of the joint research under way, provided that any undisclosed information so disseminated shall be pursuant to an agreement of confidentiality and shall be readily recognisable as such, as set out above. 
4. With the prior written consent of the Party providing undisclosed information, the receiving Party may disseminate such undisclosed information more widely than otherwise permitted in paragraph 3 above. The Parties shall cooperate in developing procedures for requesting and obtaining prior written consent for such wider dissemination, and each Party shall grant such approval to the extent permitted by its domestic policies, regulations and laws. 
B. Non-documentary undisclosed information 
Non-documentary undisclosed or other confidential information provided in seminars and other meetings arranged under the Agreement, or information arising from the attachment of staff, use of facilities, or participation in joint projects, shall be treated by the Parties or their participants according to the principles specified for documentary information in the Agreement, provided, however, that the recipient of such undisclosed or other confidential or privileged information has been made aware of the confidential character of the information at the time it was communicated. 
C. Control 
Each Party shall endeavour to ensure that undisclosed information received by it under the Agreement shall be controlled as provided herein. If one of the Parties becomes aware that it will be, or may be reasonably expected to become, unable to meet the non-dissemination provisions of sections A and B, it shall immediately inform the other Party. The Parties shall thereafter consult to define the most appropriate course of action.
