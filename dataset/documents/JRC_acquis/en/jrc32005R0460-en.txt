Commission Regulation (EC) No 460/2005 
of 21 March 2005 
opening a standing invitation to tender for the export of common wheat held by the Hungarian intervention agency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 [2], lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies. 
(2) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 320000 tonnes of common wheat held by the Hungarian intervention agency. 
(3) Special rules must be laid down to ensure that the operations are properly carried out and monitored. To that end, securities should be lodged to ensure that the goals of the operation are achieved without excessive cost to the operators. Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
(4) Where removal of the common wheat is delayed by more than five days or the release of one of the securities required is delayed for reasons imputable to the intervention agency, the Member State concerned should pay compensation. 
(5) To forestall reimportation refunds should be awarded only for exportation to certain third countries. 
(6) Whereas Article 7(2a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 provides for the possibility of reimbursing the successful tenderer for the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the actual place of exit. In view of Hungary’s geographical position, that provision should be applied.

Article 6 
1. The intervention agency, the storer and a successful tenderer shall, at the request of the latter and by common agreement, either before or at the time of removal from storage as the tenderer chooses, take reference samples for counter-analysis at the rate of at least one sample for every 500 tonnes and shall analyse the samples. The intervention agency may be represented by a proxy, provided this is not the storer. 
In the event of a dispute, the analysis results shall be forwarded to the Commission. 
Reference samples for counter-analysis shall be taken and analysed within seven working days of the date of the successful tenderer's request or within three working days if the samples are taken on removal from storage. Where the final result of sample analyses indicates a quality: 
(a) higher than that specified in the notice of invitation to tender, the successful tenderer must accept the lot as established; 
(b) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, providing that the differences do not exceed the following limits: 
- one kilogram per hectolitre as regards specific weight, which must not, however, be less than 75 kg/hl, 
- one percentage point as regards moisture content, 
- half a percentage point as regards the impurities specified in points B.2 and B.4 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 824/2000 [5], and

the successful tenderer must accept the lot as established; 
(c) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, and a difference exceeding the limits set out in point (b), the successful tenderer may: 
- accept the lot as established, or 
- refuse to take over the lot concerned. The successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations relating to the lot in question and the securities shall be released provided the Commission and the intervention agency are immediately notified in accordance with Annex II; however, if the successful tenderer requests the intervention agency to supply another lot of intervention common wheat of the quality laid down at no additional charge, the security shall not be released. The lot must be replaced within three days of the date of the successful tenderer's request. The successful tenderer shall notify the Commission immediately thereof in accordance with Annex II; 
(d) below the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention, the successful tenderer may not remove the lot in question. The successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations relating to the lot in question and the securities shall be released provided the Commission and the intervention agency are immediately notified in accordance with Annex II; however, the successful tenderer may request the intervention agency to supply another lot of intervention common wheat of the quality laid down at no additional charge. In that case, the security shall not be released. The lot must be replaced within three days of the date of the successful tenderer's request. The successful tenderer shall immediately inform the Commission thereof in accordance with Annex II. 
2. However, if the common wheat is removed before the results of the analyses are known, all risks shall be borne by the successful tenderer from the time the lot is removed, without prejudice to any means of redress against the storer. 
3. If, as a result of successive replacements, the successful tenderer has not received a replacement lot of the quality laid down within one month of the date of the request for a replacement, the successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations and the securities shall be released, provided the Commission and the intervention agency have been immediately informed in accordance with Annex II. 
4. Except where the final results of analyses indicate a quality below the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention, the costs of taking the samples and conducting the analyses provided for in paragraph 1 but not of inter-bin transfers shall be borne by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) for up to one analysis per 500 tonnes.
