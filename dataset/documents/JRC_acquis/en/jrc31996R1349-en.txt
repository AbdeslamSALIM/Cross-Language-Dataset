COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1349/96 of 11 July 1996 amending Regulation (EC) No 773/96 laying down special measures derogating from Regulations (EEC) No 3665/87, (EEC) No 3719/88 and (EEC) No 1964/82 in the beef and veal sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 894/96 (2), and in particular Article 13 (12) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 773/96 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/96 (4) lays down special measures for the regularization of certain export transactions in the wake of the measures taken by several third countries to safeguard against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE); 
Whereas exporters should not lose their securities where meat has been destroyed by a third country or a Member State as a result of measures in relation to BSE; 
Whereas where, as a result of problems related to BSE, an exporter is obliged to change destination; whereas Regulation (EC) No 773/96 provides for an adequate solution if the rate of refund corresponding to the actual destination is lower than the indicated destination but not if it is higher; whereas it is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 773/96; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
