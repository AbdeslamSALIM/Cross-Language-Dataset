(Case C-15/05) [1] 
Referring court 
Gerechtshof te Amsterdam 
Parties to the main proceedings 
Applicant: Kawasaki Motors Europe NV 
Defendant: Inspecteur van de Belastingdienst/Douane district Rotterdam 
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Gerechtshof te Amsterdam — Validity of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2518/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature (OJ 1998 L 315, p. 3) — New (all terrain) vehicles designed for hauling or pushing another vehicle, appliance or load, considered suitable for transporting persons — Tariff classification — Heading 87 03 21 and heading 87 01 90. 
Operative part of the judgment 
The Court: 
1. By adopting a capacity different from that contained in the Harmonised System Committee's classification opinion of 1999 for vehicles described in subheading 87032110 of the Combined Nomenclature, namely the capacity to tow loads three times their own weight or more, and thereby extending the scope of the heading covering vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons, point 5 of the table annexed to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2518/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature is invalid. 
2. New all terrain four-wheeled vehicles with one seat only, fitted with Ackerman steering controlled by a handlebar, equipped with a towing hitch and the technical characteristics of which enable them to push twice their own weight or more, must be classified in subheading 8701 90 of that Nomenclature. It is for the Gerechtshof te Amsterdam to classify such vehicles in the subheadings which correspond to their engine power.
