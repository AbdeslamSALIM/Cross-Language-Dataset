COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 3061/95 of 22 December 1995 amending Regulation (EC) No 992/95 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Norway 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas pursuant to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 992/95 (1) Community tariff quotas have been opened for certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Norway; whereas the quotas were granted under an Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway concluded on 14 May 1973 (2); whereas, following the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community, an Agreement in the form of exchanges of letters was concluded between the Community and Norway and approved by Decision 86/557/EEC (3); 
Whereas the above Agreement has been amended or supplemented by the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and by the bilateral Agreement in the form of exchanges of letters with Norway and approved by Decision 93/737/EC (4); 
Whereas, following the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the abovementioned quotas have to be adjusted to take into account, inter alia, the existing trade arrangements for fishery products between Austria, Finland and Sweden, on the one hand, and Norway, on the other; 
Whereas an Additional Protocol to the above Agreement has therefore been concluded between the European Community and the Kingdom of Norway and approved by Decision 95/312/EC (5), whereas by virtue of this Protocol the Community has undertaken to open, each year and subject to certain conditions, Community tariff quotas at zero duty for a number of fishery products originating in Norway; 
Whereas the tariff quotas in question should accordingly be opened from 1 January to 31 December each year; whereas it has not been possible to implement these concessions before 1 July this year and therefore, exceptionally for 1995, provision must be made for the quotas to be opened for the period from 1 July to 31 December, but for the full annual volume; 
Whereas an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters for certain agricultural products was concluded between the European Community, on the one hand, and the Kingdom of Norway, on the other hand, and approved by Decision 95/582/EC (6); whereas in the abovementioned Agreement the Community has undertaken to open from 1 January 1995 annual Community tariff quotas at zero duty for certain agricultural products from Norway,
