derogating, for 2004, from Regulation (EC) No 1431/94 laying down detailed rules for the application in the poultrymeat sector of the import arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat(1), and in particular Articles 3(2), 8(12) and 15 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 774/94 of 29 March 1994 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues(2), and in particular Article 7 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union on 1 May 2004 should enable those countries to qualify for the tariff quotas for poultrymeat provided for by Regulation (EC) No 774/94 under fair conditions compared with those applicable to the existing Member States. Economic operators in those countries must be given the possibility therefore of participating fully in those quotas upon accession. 
(2) In order not to create disturbance on the market before and after 1 May 2004, the timetable for the tranches provided for in 2004 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1431/94(3) must be altered and the allocation of quantities adjusted without, however, altering the overall quantities provided for by Regulation (EC) No 774/94. The implementing procedures should also be amended as regards the deadline for submitting applications. 
(3) It is therefore necessary, for 2004, to provide for amendments and adjustments to the measures laid down in Articles 2 and 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1431/94. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,
