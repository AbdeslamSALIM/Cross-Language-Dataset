Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 74/150/EEC of 4 March 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (1), as last amended by Directive 79/694/EEC (2), and by the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Article 11 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 78/764/EEC of 25 July 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the driver's seat on wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (3),

Whereas this first set of amendments may be followed by others concerning, initially, a procedure for the inspection of the driver's seat on tractors whose mass exceeds 5 tonnes, in particular by means of test-stand examinations and, subsequently, as soon as technical conditions so permit, the replacement of track tests by test-stand inspections and, if possible, of test personnel by mechanical devices (for example, dummies); 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Adaptation to Technical Progress of the Directives on the Elimination of Technical Barriers to Trade in Agricultural or Forestry Tractors, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
