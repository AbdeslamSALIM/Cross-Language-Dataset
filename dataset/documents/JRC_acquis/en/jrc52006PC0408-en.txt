1. BACKGROUND 
Transmission of the proposal to the Council and to the European Parliament - COM(2004) 599 final – 2004/0217 (COD) | 22 October 2004 | 
Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee | 11 May 2005 | 
Opinion of the European Parliament - first reading | 7 September 2005 | 
Transmission of the amended proposal to the Council - COM(2005) 577 | 10 November 2005 |

Opinion of the European Parliament - second reading | 1 June 2006 | 
2. PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSAL 
The initial proposal aimed to address the current situation in Europe whereby more than fifty percent of the medicines used to treat children have not been tested and are not authorised for use in children. The health and therefore quality of life of the children of Europe may suffer from a lack of testing and authorisation of medicines for their use. The overall policy objective was to improve the health of the children of Europe by increasing the research, development and authorisation of medicines for use in children. General objectives were to: 
- increase the development of medicines for use in children; 
- ensure that medicines used to treat children are subject to high quality research; 
- ensure that medicines used to treat children are appropriately authorised for use in children; 
- improve the information available on the use of medicines in children, and; 
- achieve these objectives without subjecting children to unnecessary clinical trials and in full compliance with Community legislation on clinical trials (Directive 2001/20/EC[1]). 
3. OPINION OF THE COMMISSION ON THE AMENDMENTS BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
3.1. Summary of the Commission’s position 
The Commission can accept in full all amendments adopted by the European Parliament. They are the result of a compromise package agreed between the European Parliament and the Council with a view to the adoption of the Regulation in second reading. The amendments are in line with the objectives of the Commission’s proposal and maintain the balance of interests achieved in the common position. 
The amendments to the Common Position mainly refer to: 
- provision for the Commission to adopt guidelines relating to the operation of the reward contained in the Regulation in the form of a six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate; 
- introduction of a transitional period of five years since entry into force reducing the deadline for submission of an application to extend the supplementary protection certificate: 
- several clarifications on: the rules on independence and impartiality of members of the Paediatric Committee; the transparency of opinions of this Committee; pharmacovigilance and risk management; early dialogue between companies developing medicinal products and the Paediatric Committee on whether a product should be developed for children; and the avoidance of delays in the authorisation of medicinal products for populations. 
The conclusion of the compromise package has been facilitated by a declaration which the Commission made during the June 2006 Plenary session (see annex). 
4. CONCLUSION 
Pursuant to Article 250(2) of the EC Treaty, the Commission amends its proposal as set out 
above.
