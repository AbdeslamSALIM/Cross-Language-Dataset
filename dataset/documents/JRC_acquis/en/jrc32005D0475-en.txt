THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products [1], and in particular Articles 5 and 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 2002/308/EC [2] establishes the lists of approved zones and approved fish farms situated in non-approved zones with regard to certain fish diseases. 
(2) France, Germany, Italy and Spain have submitted the justifications for obtaining the status of approved zones, with regard to VHS and IHN, for certain zones in their territories. The documentation provided shows that those zones meet the requirements of Article 5 of Directive 91/67/EEC. They therefore qualify for the status of approved zones and should be added to the list of approved zones.

The documentation provided shows that those farms meet the requirements of Article 6 of Directive 91/67/EEC. They therefore qualify for the status of approved farm in a non-approved zone and should be added to the list of approved farms. 
(4) Germany and Italy have requested technical amendments to the list of approved farms situated in non-approved zones, mainly due to change of ownership. 
(5) Decision 2002/308/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
