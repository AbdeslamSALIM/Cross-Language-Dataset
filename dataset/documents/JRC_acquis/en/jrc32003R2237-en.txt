Commission Regulation (EC) No 2237/2003 of 23 December 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of certain support schemes provided for in Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2237/2003 
of 23 December 2003 
laying down detailed rules for the application of certain support schemes provided for in Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001(1), and in particular Article 145(c), (e), (f), (q) and Article 155 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishes certain support schemes for farmers. For the sake of simplification it is appropriate to provide for one single regulation laying down the implementing rules of those schemes which enter into force in 2004. 
(2) Starting from 2005 the integrated administration and control system provided for in Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (hereinafter referred as %quot%the IACS%quot%) shall apply to those support schemes. Some of those support schemes as well as some of the products receiving direct payments under some of those support schemes are already covered by the IACS. In order to facilitate the transition from the arrangements provided for by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(2) to the arrangements provided for by the IACS, it is appropriate to make applicable the existing rules under Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 and its implementing rules provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001(3) to those support schemes. 
(3) For the efficiency and good administration of the schemes, the area payments must be restricted to certain areas and conditions to be specified. 
(4) The sowing of land for the sole purpose of qualifying for area payments should be prevented. Certain conditions relating to the sowing and cultivation of crops must be specified, in particular as regards durum wheat, protein plants and rice. Local standards must be respected in order to reflect the diversity of agricultural practice within the Community. 
(5) Only one application for an area payment should be permitted in respect of any parcel cultivated in a given year except in the cases where the area payment is given as a supplement to the same crop or the aid concerns the production of seeds. Area payments can be granted on crops subsidised under a scheme falling within the Community's structural or environmental policies. 
(6) Support schemes based on area aid provide that where the area for which aid is claimed exceeds the maximum guaranteed area or base areas or subbase areas, the area per farmer for which aid is claimed shall be reduced proportionately in that year. It is therefore appropriate to establish the modalities and deadlines for the exchange of information between the Commission and the Member States in order to establish the coefficient of reduction and to inform the Commission of the areas for which the aid has been paid. The same provisions shall apply for the reduction of the total amount of individual reference quantities in case of application of Article 95(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
(7) According to Article 73 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, granting of the specific quality premium for durum wheat is subject to the use of certain quantities of certified seeds of varieties recognised, in the production zone, as being of high quality for the production of semolina or pasta. In order to ensure that those requirements are respected, the criteria for the variety screening method in each Member States should be fixed and the procedure for the establishment of the eligible varieties list as well as the minimum quantity of certified seeds to be used should be fixed. 
(8) The short time between the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and the entry into force of the specific quality premium for durum wheat makes it impossible to establish a list of eligible varieties for the granting of the aid in the years 2004 and 2005 according to the envisaged screening method. It is therefore necessary for Member States to establish a transitional list based on a selection of current varieties. 
(9) In view of the obligation, for the purpose of the eligibility to the specific quality premium for durum wheat, to use a certain quantity of certified seeds, an appropriate control procedure should be set up in order to verify that the eligible seeds and the required quantities are effectively used. 
(10) In some regions, the protein crops are traditionally sown in a mixture with cereals for agronomical reasons. The resulting crop principally consists of protein crops. For the purpose of granting the protein crop premium, the areas thus sown should therefore be considered as areas of protein crops. 
(11) In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme for nuts, the area aid granted should not be used to finance marginal plantations or isolated trees. A minimum plot size and a minimum tree density of a specialised orchard should therefore be defined. In order to facilitate the transition between the existing improvement plans which expire later than the introduction of the new aid scheme, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures. 
(12) The terms of payment as well as the crop-specific payment for rice calculation depend not only on the base area or areas fixed for each producing Member State fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, but also on the possible subdivision of those base areas into subbase areas and on the objective criteria chosen by each Member State to perform this subdivision, on conditions in which the cultivated parcels are put into cultivation and on the minimum size of the latter. As a consequence, detailed rules should be set for the establishment, the management and the cultivation modalities applicable to base areas and subbase areas. 
(13) The observation of a possible overrun of the base area referred to in Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 implies a reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice. In order to set the calculation modalities for this reduction, criteria to be taken into consideration as well as applicable coefficients should be defined. 
(14) The follow-up of the payments of the crop-specific payment for rice presumes that the Commission has been forwarded certain information related to the cultivation of base areas and subbase areas. For this purpose, the detailed information that the Member States should communicate to the Commission as well as the deadlines for those communications should be determined. 
(15) The crop-specific payment for rice replaces the compensatory payments whose detailed rules where provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 613/97 of 8 April 1997 laying down rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as regards the conditions for granting compensatory payments under the aid scheme for rice producers(4). That Regulation becomes without object and should therefore be repealed. 
(16) Articles 93 and 94 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for an aid to farmers producing potatoes intended for the manufacture of potato starch subject to a cultivation contract and within the quota limit established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 of 27 July 1994 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch(5). The conditions for the granting of the aid should therefore be established and, where the case may be, cross references should be made to the existing provisions concerning the quota system provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. Taking into account that the potatoes are delivered progressively to starch undertaking and, until now, the aid has been paid on the quantities delivered, it is appropriate to maintain for the year 2004 the current payment system. In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme, provisions on checks should be provided for. 
(17) Articles 95 and 96 Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide that the dairy premium and additional payment are paid to producers. Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing a levy in the milk and milk products sector(6) provides for specific provisions in case of inactivity. It is therefore appropriate to provide, when a natural or legal person holding an individual reference quantity no longer meets the conditions referred to in Article 5(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1788/2003 during the 12-month period preceding 31 March of the year concerned, for an exclusion from the benefiting of the premium and payment. In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme, provisions on checks should be provided for. 
(18) Articles 88 to 92 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provide for a new aid scheme for energy crops to be granted to farmers. As this is a new aid scheme requiring complex management and control measures, the implementing rules should be limited to 2004 to permit a review, in the light of experience, in subsequent years. 
(19) In line with Commission Regulation (EC) No 2461/1999 of 19 November 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 as regards the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials for the manufacture within the Community of products not primarily intended for human or animal consumption(7), which excludes sugar beet from the aid, the cultivation of sugar beet should be excluded from the aid scheme for energy crops. 
(20) The terms of eligibility for this aid must be laid down. To this end it should be laid down that a contract must be concluded between the producer and the first processor with respect to the agricultural raw materials concerned. The conditions where processing is carried out by the farmer on the holding should also be defined. 
(21) To ensure that the raw material is processed into the specified energy product, first processors must lodge a security, despite the fact that the aid is granted not to first processors but to farmers. The security must be high enough to prevent any risk that the raw materials are ultimately diverted from their destination. In addition, in order to make the control system for the scheme effective, sales of raw materials and of semi-processed products should be limited to a maximum of two before final processing. 
(22) An explicit distinction must be made between the applicant's obligations, which end once the total quantity of raw material harvested is delivered, and the obligations incumbent on first processors, which commence on delivery and end with the final processing of the raw materials into energy products. 
(23) Certain transport operations within Community territory involving raw materials and products derived therefrom should be subject to controls entailing the use of T5 control copies to be issued in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(8). Provision should be made for alternative evidence should the T5 control copy be lost as a result of circumstances for which the first processor is not responsible. In the interest of efficiency and good management of the aid scheme, provisions on checks should be provided for. 
(24) The Management Committee for Direct Payments has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER 2 SPECIFIC QUALITY PREMIUM FOR DURUM WHEAT 
Article 7 
Variety screening 
1. Member States listed in Article 74(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall establish the list of durum wheat varieties eligible for the special quality premium referred to in Article 72 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 in accordance with the variety screening method laid down in paragraphs 2 to 5 of this Article. 
2. Member States shall, at least every two years, identify at least two representative varieties. The representative varieties shall be the most certified durum wheat varieties. 
3. Member States shall analyse durum wheat varieties according to the following quality parameters and assign to each parameter the relevant weighting: 
(a) protein content (40 %), 
(b) gluten quality (30 %), 
(c) yellow index (20 %), 
(d) specific weight or weight of one thousand kernels (10 %). 
The sum of the averages of the quality parameters referred to in (a) to (d), multiplied by the indicated value in percentage, shall constitute the quality index of the varieties. 
Each Member State shall compare, over a period of at least two years, the quality indexes of the durum wheat varieties with those of the representative varieties at regional level. The varieties to be examined shall be those which are registered in the national catalogue of each Member State, with the exclusion of those varieties for which no analytical data are available for the last three years because they are not used or certified any more. 
To that end, based on the average quality index of 100 attributed to the representative varieties, each Member State shall calculate, for each of quality parameters referred to in (a) to (d), the percentage to be assigned to the other durum wheat varieties in comparison with the index of 100. Only durum wheat varieties with an index equal to or higher than 98 shall be eligible for the quality premium for durum wheat. 
4. A Member State may exclude from the list of eligible varieties the varieties which have an average rate of loss of vitreous aspect of durum wheat (mitadinage) exceeding 27 %. 
5. Varieties, which are registered in the national catalogue of another Member State, may also be examined for their eligibility. 
Article 8 
Analysis methods 
1. The analysis methods of the protein content, specific weight and the rate of loss of vitreous aspect of durum wheat (mitadinage) shall be those laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) 824/2000(13). 
2. The yellow index shall be measured according to the ICC 152 method or an equivalent recognised method. 
3. The gluten quality shall be measured according to the ICC 158 method or according to the ICC 151 method. 
Article 9 
Quantity of certified seeds 
Member States shall fix, before 1 October of the year preceding the year in respect of which the premium is granted, the minimum quantity of seed, certified in accordance with Council Directive 66/402/EEC(14), to be used in accordance with the current agricultural practices in the production zone concerned. 
Article 10 
Publications and communications 
1. Member States shall publish the list of selected varieties which are eligible at national or regional level to the special quality premium for durum wheat, not later than 1 October, for winter varieties, and not later than 31 December, for spring varieties, of the year preceding the year in respect of which the premium is granted. 
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission, not later than one month after the dates provided for in paragraph 1, the list referred to in paragraph 1 as well as, if modified, the minimum quantity of certified seed to be used. 
Article 11 
Validity 
1. The varieties admitted in the list referred to in Article 10(1) shall be eligible for the special quality premium for durum wheat for periods of five years starting from the date of their first admission in that list. 
2. The eligibility of each variety may be extended for a period of five years, based on the results of the qualitative analyses carried out during the second and third year of the five-year eligibility period. 
Article 12 
Transitional measures 
1. Member States shall publish before 15 May 2004 the list of the varieties, which are eligible for the premium only in 2004 and 2005 and shall communicate the list to the Commission before 30 June 2004. 
2. Member States shall establish the list referred to in paragraph 1 by eliminating from the list of varieties which are registered in the national catalogue the varieties which have not been certified in 2002 and 2003 and those which do not satisfy at least two of the following parameters: 
(a) a minimum protein content of 11,5 %; 
(b) a minimum specific weight of 78 kg/hl; 
(c) a minimum weight of 1000 kernels of 42 g; 
(d) a maximum rate of loss of vitreous aspect of durum wheat (mitadinage) of 27 %; 
(e) a minimum gluten content of 10 %. 
3. The lists of varieties which are eligible for the premium in 2004, 2005 and 2006 may include varieties which are in the list of selected varieties of another Member State on the basis of the results of the qualitative analyses carried out by this other Member State. 
Article 13 
Control measures 
1. The aid application for the specific quality premium for durum wheat shall be accompanied by proof, given according to the rules fixed by the Member State, that the minimum quantity of certified seed has been used. 
2. In case a difference is established between the minimum quantity of certified seeds fixed by the Member State and the quantity effectively used, the determined area within the meaning of Article 2(r) of Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 shall be calculated by dividing the total quantity of certified seeds, for which proof of use was given by the farmer, by the minimum quantity of certified seeds per hectare fixed by the Member State in the production zone concerned. 
CHAPTER 3 PROTEIN CROP PREMIUM 
Article 14 
Mixture of cereals and protein crops 
In regions where protein crops are traditionally sown in a mixture with cereals, the protein crop premium shall be paid at the request of the applicant provided that he proves, to the satisfaction of the competent authorities, that the protein crops are predominant in the mixture. The areas concerned shall not be eligible for the specific regional aid for arable crops referred to in Article 98 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
CHAPTER 4 CROP-SPECIFIC PAYMENT FOR RICE 
Article 15 
Application 
In the aid application, the farmers shall specify the variety of rice sown for each cultivated parcel for which he claims the crop-specific payment for rice referred to in Article 79 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
Article 16 
Dates for sowings 
To be eligible for the crop-specific payment for rice, the declared area shall be sown at the latest: 
(a) on 30 June preceding the harvest in question, for Spain and Portugal, 
(b) on 31 May for the other producing Member States referred to in Article 80(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
However, in French Guiana, the areas shall be sown respectively for each of the two sowing cycles, at the latest on 31 December and 30 June preceding each of them and the crop-specific payment for rice shall be granted on the basis of the average of the areas sown for each of the two sowing cycles. 
Article 17 
Coefficient of reduction 
The coefficient of reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice referred to in Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 shall be calculated according to Annex I.

3. For French Guiana, the information concerning the sown areas is communicated on the basis of the average of the areas sown during the two sowing cycles. 
4. Member States may revise annually the base sub-areas and the objective criteria referred to in paragraph 1. They shall communicate this information to the Commission at the latest on 15 May preceding the harvest in question. 
CHAPTER 5 AREA PAYMENT FOR NUTS 
Article 19 
Eligibility conditions for the Community aid 
1. For the purposes of this Chapter, an orchard shall mean a homogeneous and cohesive area planted with nut trees which is not intersected by other crops or plantations and which is geographically continuous. Isolated trees or a single row of nut trees planted alongside roads or other crops shall not be considered an orchard. 
By way of derogation from the first subparagraph, Member States may allow the presence of trees other than nut trees within a limit corresponding to 10 % of the number of trees laid down in paragraph 3. Moreover, Member States may allow the presence of chestnut trees if the number of trees laid down in paragraph 3 is respected by the eligible nut trees. 
2. Only orchards producing nuts and meeting the conditions referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 at the date to be fixed in conformity with Article 3 of this Regulation are eligible for the area payment provided for in Article 83 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
In the case of an orchard where different types of nuts are grown and when the aid is differentiated in function of the products, the eligibility conditions and/or the level of the aid specific to the nut type which is predominant shall apply. 
3. The minimum plot size of orchards may not be less than a surface area of 0,10 hectare. 
The number of nut trees per hectare of orchards may not be less than: 
- 125 for hazelnuts, 
- 50 for almonds, 
- 50 for walnuts, 
- 50 for pistachios, 
- 30 for locust beans. 
4. Member States may fix the minimum plot size and tree density at a higher level than those laid down in paragraph 3 according to objective criteria and in order to take into account the specific characteristic of the areas and productions concerned. 
Article 20 
Eligibility conditions for national aid 
Article 19 of this Regulation shall apply to the national aid referred to in Article 87 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
Without prejudice to Article 87 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, a Member State may establish further eligibility criteria, provided that such criteria are consistent with the environmental, rural, social and economic objectives of the aid scheme and do not introduce discrimination between producers. Member States shall establish the necessary arrangements in order to control those criteria. 
Article 21 
Application 
In the aid application, farmers shall specify the number of nut trees per type and per agricultural parcel. 
Article 22 
Communications

Article 33 
Use of raw material 
1. Any agricultural raw material with the exception of sugar beet may be grown on the areas covered by the aid provided for in Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provided that they are intended primarily for use in the production of the energy products referred to in the said Article. 
The economic value of the energy products referred to in the first subparagraph obtained by processing raw materials shall be higher than that of all other products intended for other uses and obtained by such processing, as determined by the valuation method set out in Article 49(3). 
2. The raw materials referred to in paragraph 1 must be covered by a contract in accordance with Article 90 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 under the conditions laid down below. 
3. Applicants shall deliver all raw materials harvested to a first processor who shall take delivery of them and ensure that an equivalent quantity of such raw materials is used within the Community for the manufacture of one or more energy products as referred to in Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
Where the first processor uses the raw material actually harvested to manufacture an intermediate product or a by-product, he may use an equivalent quantity of such intermediate products or by-products to manufacture one or more end products as referred to in the first subparagraph. 
In the case referred to in the second subparagraph, the first processor shall so inform the competent authority with whom the security is lodged. Where such equivalent quantity is used in a Member State other than that in which the raw material is harvested, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform each other of the details of such transaction.

Article 34 
Derogations 
1. Notwithstanding Article 33(2) and (3), Member States may permit applicants to: 
(a) use all the cereals or oilseeds covered by CN codes 1201 00 90, ex 1205 00 90 and 1206 00 91 harvested: 
(i) as fuel for heating their agricultural holding; 
(ii) for the production on the holding of power or biofuels; 
(b) process into biogas (CN code 2711 29 00 ) on their holdings all raw materials harvested. 
2. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 applicants shall undertake, by way of a declaration in place of the contract referred to in Article 35, to use or process directly the raw material covered by the declaration. Articles 35 to 50 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 
In addition, applicants must have all the raw material harvested weighed by a body or an undertaking designated by the Member State and must keep separate accounts for the raw material used and the products and by-products resulting from its processing. 
However, in the case of cereals and oilseeds, and of straw, and where the entire plant is used, weighing may be replaced by volumetric measurement of the raw material. 
3. Member States applying paragraph 1 shall introduce adequate control measures to ensure that the raw material is directly used on the holding or is processed into biogas falling within CN code 2711 29 00. 
4. Cereals and oilseeds used in accordance with paragraph 1(a) must be denatured in accordance with the method laid down by the Member State. The Member States may authorise the oil produced by processing oilseeds in accordance with paragraph 1(a)(ii) to be denatured instead of the oilseeds themselves, provided that such denaturing takes place immediately after the seeds are processed into oil and that the use to which the seeds are put is checked. 
Article 35

SECTION 3 Amendment and termination of contract 
Article 36 
Amendment and termination of contract 
Where the parties to the contract amend or terminate the latter after applicants have lodged an aid application, applicants may maintain such aid applications only on condition that, with a view to allowing the requisite inspections to be carried out, they inform their competent authority of such amendment or termination, no later than the closing date set in the Member State concerned for amendment of the application. 
Article 37 
Exceptional circumstances 
Without prejudice to Article 36, where applicants inform their competent authorities that, owing to exceptional circumstances, they will be unable to supply all or part of the raw materials specified in the contract, the competent authorities may, after obtaining sufficient evidence of such exceptional circumstances, authorise such amendments to contracts as appear justified, or may authorise their termination. 
Where the land covered by contracts is reduced as a result of amendments thereto or where contracts are terminated, applicants shall forfeit their right to the aid referred to in this Chapter for the areas withdrawn from the contract. 
Article 38 
Changes in end uses 
Without prejudice to Article 36, first processors may alter the intended primary end uses of raw materials, as referred to in Article 35(2)(f), once the raw materials under contract have been delivered to them and once the conditions laid down in Article 40(1) and in the first subparagraph of Article 44(3) have been fulfilled.

ANNEX I 
CROP-SPECIFIC PAYMENT FOR RICE 
Calculation of the coefficient of reduction referred to in Article 17 
1. For the observation of a possible overrun of the base area referred to in Article 82 of the Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the competent authority of the Member State shall take into account, on the one hand, the base areas or subbase areas, fixed in Article 81 of the aforementioned Regulation, and on the other hand, the total of the areas for which aid applications have been submitted for these base areas and subbase areas. 
2. In establishing the total area for which aid applications have been submitted, account shall not be taken of applications or parts of applications that a check has shown to be clearly unjustified. 
3. If an overrun is observed for certain base areas or subbase areas, the Member State shall establish for these, the percentage of overrun, calculated with two decimal places according to the deadline fixed in Article 18(2) of this Regulation. When an overrun can be foreseen, the Member State shall inform the producers forthwith. 
4. The coefficient of reduction of the crop-specific payment for rice shall be calculated, in accordance with Article 82 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, according to the following formula: 
Reduction coefficient = reference area of the subbase area divided by the total area for which aid applications have been submitted for this subbase area. 
The reduced crop-specific payment for rice, shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
reduced crop-specific aid for rice = crop-specific aid for rice multiplied by the reduction coefficient. 
This reduction coefficient and this reduced crop-specific payment for rice shall be calculated for each subbase area, after application of the redistribution provided for in Article 82(2) of the aforementioned Regulation. Redistribution shall be done to the profit of the subbase areas for which limits have been exceeded. It shall be done proportionally to the overruns noted in the subbase areas for which limits have been exceeded.
