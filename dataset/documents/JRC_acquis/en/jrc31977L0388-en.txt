Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment 
SIXTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax : uniform basis of assessment (77/388/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 99 and 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Whereas all Member States have adopted a system of value added tax in accordance with the first and second Council Directives of 11 April 1967 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States realting to turnover taxes (3); 
Whereas the Decision of 21 April 1970 on the replacement of financial contributions from Member States by the Communities' own resources (4) provides that the budget of the Communities shall, irrespective of other revenue, be financed entirely from the Communities' own resources ; whereas these resources are to include those accruing from value added tax and obtained by applying a common rate of tax on a basis of assessment determined in a uniform manner according to Community rules; 
Whereas further progress should be made in the effective removal of restrictions on the movement of persons, goods, services and capital and the integration of national economies; 
Whereas account should be taken of the objective of abolishing the imposition of tax on the importation and the remission of tax on exportation in trade between Member States ; whereas it should be ensured that the common system of turnover taxes is non-discriminatory as regards the origin of goods and services, so that a common market permitting fair competition and resembling a real internal market may ultimately be achieved; 
Whereas, to enhance the non-discriminatory nature of the tax, the term %quot%taxable person%quot% must be clarified to enable the Member States to extend it to cover persons who occasionally carry out certain transactions; 
Whereas the term %quot%taxable transaction%quot% has led to difficulties, in particular as regards transactions treated as taxable transactions ; whereas these concepts must be clarified; 
Whereas the determination of the place where taxable transactions are effected has been the subject of conflicts (1)OJ No C 40, 8.4.1974, p. 25. (2)OJ No C 139, 12.11.1974, p. 15. (3)OJ No 71, 14.4.1967, p. 1301/67. (4)OJ No L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 19. 
concerning jurisdiction as between Member States, in particular as regards supplies of goods for assembly and the supply of services ; whereas although the place where a supply of services is effected should in principle be defined as the place where the person supplying the services has his principal place of business, that place should be defined as being in the country of the person to whom the services are supplied, in particular in the case of certain services supplied between taxable persons where the cost of the services is included in the price of the goods; 
Whereas the concepts of chargeable event and of the charge to tax must be harmonized if the introduction and any subsequent alterations of the Community rate are to become operative at the same time in all Member States; 
Whereas the taxable base must be harmonized so that the application of the Community rate to taxable transactions leads to comparable results in all the Member States; 
Whereas the rates applied by Member States must be such as to allow the normal deduction of the tax applied at the preceding stage; 
Whereas a common list of exemptions should be drawn up so that the Communities' own resources may be collected in a uniform manner in all the Member States; 
Whereas the rules governing deductions should be harmonized to the extent that they affect the actual amounts collected ; whereas the deductible proportion should be calculated in a similar manner in all the Member States; 
Whereas it should be specified which persons are liable to pay tax, in particular as regards services supplied by a person established in another country; 
Whereas the obligations of taxpayers must be harmonized as far as possible so as to ensure the necessary safeguards for the collection of taxes in a uniform manner in all the Member States ; whereas taxpayers should, in particular, make a periodic aggregate return of their transactions, relating to both inputs and outputs where this appears necessary for establishing and monitoring the basis of assessment of own resources; 
Whereas Member States should nevertheless be able to retain their special schemes for small undertakings, in accordance with common provisions, and with a view to closer harmonization ; whereas Member States should remain free to apply a special scheme involving flat rate rebates of input value added tax to farmers not covered by normal schemes ; whereas the basic principles of this scheme should be established and a common method adopted for calculating the value added of these farmers for the purposes of collecting own resources; 
Whereas the uniform application of the provisions of this Directive should be ensured ; whereas to this end a Community procedure for consultation should be laid down ; whereas the setting up of a Value Added Tax Committee would enable the Member States and the Commission to cooperate closely; 
Whereas Member States should be able, within certain limits and subject to certain conditions, to take or retain special measures derogating from this Directive in order to simplify the levying of tax or to avoid fraud or tax avoidance; 
Whereas it might appear appropriate to authorize Member States to conclude with non-member countries or international organizations agreements containing derogations from this Directive; 
Whereas it is vital to provide for a transitional period to allow national laws in specified fields to be gradually adapted, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
TITLE I INTRODUCTORY PROVISIONS

3. Member States may also treat as a taxable person anyone who carries out, on an occasional basis, a transaction relating to the activities referred to in paragraph 2 and in particular one of the following: (a) the supply before first occupation of buildings or parts of buildings and the land on which they stand ; Member States may determine the conditions of application of this criterion to transformations of buildings and the land on which they stand. 
Member States may apply criteria other than that of first occupation, such as the period elapsing between the date of completion of the building and the date of first supply or the period elapsing between the date of first occupation and the date of subsequent supply, provided that these periods do not exceed five years and two years respectively.

5. States, regional and local government authorities and other bodies governed by public law shall not be considered taxable persons in respect of the activities or transactions in which they engage as public authorities, even where they collect dues, fees, contributions or payments in connection with these activities or transactions. 
However, when they engage in such activities or transactions, they shall be considered taxable persons in respect of these activities or transactions where treatment as non-taxable persons would lead to significant distortions of competition. 
In any case, these bodies shall be considered taxable persons in relation to the activities listed in Annex D, provided they are not carried out on such a small scale as to be negligible. 
Member States may consider activities of these bodies which are exempt under Article 13 or 28 as activities which they engage in as public authorities.

Where appropriate, Member States may take the necessary measures to prevent distortion of competition in cases where the recipient is not wholly liable to tax. 
Article 6 
Supply of services

TITLE VII CHARGEABLE EVENT AND CHARGEABILITY OF TAX 
Article 10 
1. (a) %quot%Chargeable event%quot% shall mean the occurrence by virtue of which the legal conditions necessary for tax to become chargeable are fulfilled. 
(b) The tax becomes %quot%chargeable%quot% when the tax authority becomes entitled under the law at a given moment to claim the tax from the person liable to pay, notwithstanding that the time of payment may be deferred. 
2. The chargeable event shall occur and the tax shall become chargeable when the goods are delivered or the services are performed. Deliveries of goods other than those referred to in Article 5 (4) (b) and supplies of services which give rise to successive statements of account or payments shall be regarded as being completed at the time when the periods to which such statements of account or payments pertain expire. 
However, where a payment is to be made on account before the goods are delivered or the services are performed, the tax shall become chargeable on receipt of the payment and on the amount received. 
By way of derogation from the above provisions, Member States may provide that the tax shall become chargeable, for certain transactions or for certain categories of taxable person, either: - no later than the issue of the invoice or of the document serving as invoice, or

Where imported goods are subject to customs duties, to agricultural levies or to charges having equivalent effect established under a common policy, Member States may link the chargeable event and the date when the tax becomes chargeable with those laid down for these Community duties. 
In cases where imported goods are not subject to any of these Community duties, Member States may apply the provisions in force governing customs duties as regards the chargeable event and the date when the tax becomes chargeable. 
Where goods are placed on importation under one of the arrangements provided for in Article 16 (1) A or under arrangements for transit or temporary admission, the chargeable event and the date when the tax becomes chargeable shall occur only when the goods cease to be covered by these arrangements and are declared for home use. 
TITLE VIII TAXABLE AMOUNT 
Article 11 
A. Within the territory of the country 1. The taxable amount shall be: (a) in respect of supplies of goods and services other than those referred to in (b), (c) and (d) below, everything which constitutes the consideration which has been or is to be obtained by the supplier from the purchaser, the customer or a third party for such supplies including subsidies directly linked to the price of such supplies;

%quot%First place of destination%quot% shall mean the place mentioned on the consignment note or any other transport document by means of which the goods are imported into the country of importation. In the absence of such an indication, the first place of destination shall be taken to be the place of the first transfer of cargo in that country.

3.As regards returnable packing costs, Member States may: - either exclude them from the taxable amount and take the necessary measures to see that this amount is adjusted if the packing is not returned, 
- or include them in the taxable amount and take the necessary measures to see that this amount is adjusted where the packing is in fact returned. 
TITLE IX RATES

Each reduced rate shall be so fixed that the amount of value added tax resulting from the application thereof shall be such as in the normal way to permit the deduction therefrom of the whole of the value added tax deductible under the provisions of Article 17. 
5. The rate applicable on the importation of goods shall be that applied to the supply of like goods within the territory of the country.

Article 14 
Exemptions on importation 
1. Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States shall exempt the following under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemption and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse: (a) final importation of goods of which the supply by a taxable person would in all circumstances be exempted within the country; 
(b) importation of goods under a declaration for transit arrangements; 
(c) importation of goods declared to be under temporary importation arrangements, which thereby qualify for exemption from customs duties, or which would so qualify if they were imported from a third country; 
(d) final importation of goods qualifying for exemption from customs duties other than as provided for in the Common Customs Tariff or which would qualify therefor if they were imported from a third country. However, Member States shall have the option of not granting exemption where this would be liable to have a serious effect on conditions of competition on the home market; 
(e) reimportation by the person who exported them of goods in the state in which they were exported, where they qualify for exemption from customs duties or would qualify therefor if they were imported from a third country; 
(f) the re-importation of movable tangible property by the person who exported it, or by another person on his account, where that property has while in another Member State undergone work which has been taxed without the right to deduction or refund;

(j) importation of gold by Central Banks. 
2. The Commission shall submit to the Council at the earliest opportunity proposals designed to lay down Community tax rules clarifying the scope of the exemptions referred to in paragraph 1 and detailed rules for their implementation. 
Until the entry into force of these rules, Member States may: - maintain their national provisions in force on matters related to the above provisions, 
- adapt their national provisions to minimize distortion of competition and in particular the non-imposition or double imposition of value added tax within the Community, 
- use whatever administrative procedures they consider most appropriate to achieve exemption. 
Member States shall inform the Commission, which shall inform the other Member States, of the measures they have adopted and are adopting pursuant to the preceding provisions. 
Article 15 
Exemption of exports and like transactions and international transport 
Without prejudice to other Community provisions Member States shall exempt the following under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and of preventing any evasion, avoidance or abuse: 1. the supply of goods dispatched or transported to a destination outside the territory of the country as defined in Article 3 by or on behalf of the vendor; 
2. the supply of goods dispatched or transported to a destination outside the territory of the country as defined in Article 3 by or on behalf of a purchaser not established within the territory of the country, with the exception of goods transported by the purchaser himself for the equipping, fuelling and provisioning of pleasure boats and private aircraft or any other means of transport for private use; 
3. the supply of services consisting of work on movable property acquired or imported for the purpose of undergoing such work in the territory of the country as defined in Article 3, and dispatched or transported out of the territory of that country by the person providing the services or by his customer who is not established within the territory of the country or on behalf of either of them;

The Member States may, however, restrict the scope of this exemption until the implementation of Community tax rules in this field; 
5. the supply, modification, repair, maintenance, chartering and hiring of the sea-going vessels referred to in paragraph 4 (a) and (b) and the supply, hiring, repair and maintenance of equipment - including fishing equipment - incorporated or used therein;

This exemption shall be subject to conditions and limitations laid down by Member States until Community tax rules are adopted. 
The exemption may be implemented by means of a refund of the tax; 
11. supplies of gold to Central Banks;

Article 16 
Special exemptions linked to international goods traffic 
1. Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States may, subject to the consultations provided for in Article 29, take special measures designed to relieve from value added tax all or some of the following transactions, provided that they are not aimed at final use and/or consumption and that the amount of value added tax charged at entry for home use corresponds to the amount of the tax which should have been charged had each of these transactions been taxed on import or within the territory of the country: A. importation of goods which are intended to be: (a) produced to customs and, where applicable, placed in temporary storage within the meaning of Directive 68/312/EEC (1);

2. Subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29, Member States may opt to exempt imports for and supplies of goods to a taxable person intending to export them as they are or after processing, as well as supplies of services linked with his export business, up to a maximum equal to the value of his exports during the preceding 12 months. 
3. The Commission shall submit to the Council at the earliest opportunity proposals concerning common arrangements for applying value added tax to the transactions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. 
TITLE XI DEDUCTIONS 
Article 17 
Origin and scope of the right to deduct 
1. The right to deduct shall arise at the time when the deductible tax becomes chargeable. 
2. In so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of his taxable transactions, the taxable person shall be entitled to deduct from the tax which he is liable to pay: (a) value added tax due or paid in respect of goods or services supplied or to be supplied to him by another taxable person; 
(b) value added tax due or paid in respect of imported goods; (1)OJ No L 194, 6.8.1968, p. 13. (2)OJ No L 58, 8.3.1969, p. 11. (3)OJ No L 58, 8.3.1969, p. 7. (4)OJ No L 238, 28.9.1968, p. 1. 
(c) value added tax due under Articles 5 (7) (a) and 6 (3). 
3. Member States shall also grant to every taxable person the right to a deduction or refund of the value added tax referred to in paragraph 2 in so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of: (a) transactions relating to the economic activities as referred to in Article 4 (2) carried out in another country, which would be eligible for deduction of tax if they had occurred in the territory of the country; 
(b) transactions which are exempt under Article 14 (1) (i) and under Articles 15 and 16 (1) (B), (C) and (D), and paragraph 2; 
(c) any of the transactions exempted under Article 13 B (a) and (d), paragraphs 1 to 5, when the customer is established outside the Community or when these transactions are directly linked with goods intended to be exported to a country outside the Community. 
4. The Council shall endeavour to adopt before 31 December 1977, on a proposal from the Commission and acting unanimously, Community rules laying down the arrangements under which refunds are to be made in accordance with paragraph 3 to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country. Until such Community arrangements enter into force, Member States shall themselves determine the method by which the refund concerned shall be made. Where the taxable person is not resident in the territory of the Community, Member States may refuse the refund or impose supplementary conditions. 
5. As regards goods and services to be used by a taxable person both for transactions covered by paragraphs 2 and 3, in respect of which value added tax is deductible, and for transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible, only such proportion of the value added tax shall be deductible as is attributable to the former transactions. 
This proportion shall be determined, in accordance with Article 19, for all the transactions carried out by the taxable person. 
However, Member States may: (a) authorize the taxable person to determine a proportion for each sector of his business, provided that separate accounts are kept for each sector; 
(b) compel the taxable person to determine a proportion for each sector of his business and to keep separate accounts for each sector; 
(c) authorize or compel the taxable person to make the deduction on the basis of the use of all or part of the goods and services; 
(d) authorize of compel the taxable person to make the deduction in accordance with the rule laid down in the first subparagraph, in respect of all goods and services used for all transactions referred to therein; 
(e) provide that where the value added tax which is not deductible by the taxable person is insignificant it shall be treated as nil. 
6. Before a period of four years at the latest has elapsed from the date of entry into force of this Directive, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide what expenditure shall not be eligible for a deduction of value added tax. Value added tax shall in no circumstances be deductible on expenditure which is not strictly business expenditure, such as that on luxuries, amusements or entertainment. 
Until the above rules come into force, Member States may retain all the exclusions provided for under their national laws when this Directive comes into force. 
7. Subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29, each Member State may, for cyclical economic reasons, totally or partly exclude all or some capital goods or other goods from the system of deductions. To maintain identical conditions of competition, Member States may, instead of refusing deduction, tax the goods manufactured by the taxable person himself or which he has purchased in the country or imported, in such a way that the tax does not exceed the value added tax which would have been charged on the acquisition of similar goods. 
Article 18 
Rules governing the exercise of the right to deduct 
1. To exercise his right to deduct, the taxable person must: (a) in respect of deductions under Article 17 (2) (a), hold an invoice, drawn up in accordance with Article 22 (3); 
(b) in respect of deductions under Article 17 (2) (b), hold an import document, specifying him as consignee or importer, and stating or permitting calculation of the amount of tax due; 
(c) in respect of deductions under Article 17 (2) (c), comply with the formalities established by each Member State; 
(d) when he is required to pay the tax as a customer or purchaser where Article 21 (1) applies, comply with the formalities laid down by each Member State. 
2. The taxable person shall effect the deduction by subtracting from the total amount of value added tax due for a given tax period the total amount of the tax in respect of which, during the same period, the right to deduct has arisen and can be exercised under the provisions of paragraph 1. 
However, Member States may require that as regards taxable persons who carry out occasional transactions as defined in Article 4 (3), the right to deduct shall be exercised only at the time of the supply. 
3. Member States shall determine the conditions and procedures whereby a taxable person may be authorized to make a deduction which he has not made in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2. 
4. Where for a given tax period the amount of authorized deductions exceeds the amount of tax due, the Member States may either make a refund or carry the excess forward to the following period according to conditions which they shall determine. 
However, Member States may refuse to refund or carry forward if the amount of the excess is insignificant. 
Article 19 
Calculation of the deductible proportion 
1. The proportion deductible under the first subparagraph of Article 17 (5) shall be made up of a fraction having: - as numerator, the total amount, exclusive of value added tax, of turnover per year attributable to transactions in respect of which value added tax is deductible under Article 17 (2) and (3), 
- as denominator, the total amount, exclusive of value added tax, of turnover per year attributable to transactions included in the numerator and to transactions in respect of which value added tax is not deductible. The Member States may also include in the denominator the amount of subsidies, other than those specified in Article 11 A (1) (a). 
The proportion shall be determined on an annual basis, fixed as a percentage and rounded up to a figure not exceeding the next unit. 
2. By way of derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1, there shall be excluded from the calculation of the deductible proportion, amounts of turnover attributable to the supplies of capital goods used by the taxable person for the purposes of his business. Amounts of turnover attributable to transactions specified in Article 13 B (d), in so far as these are incidental transactions, and to incidental real estate and financial transactions shall also be excluded. Where Member States exercise the option provided under Article 20 (5) not to require adjustment in respect of capital goods, they may include disposals of capital goods in the calculation of the deductible proportion. 
3. The provisional proportion for a year shall be that calculated on the basis of the preceding year's transactions. In the absence of any such transactions to refer to, or where they were insignificant in amount, the deductible proportion shall be estimated provisionally, under supervision of the tax authorities, by the taxable person from his own forecasts. However, Member States may retain their current rules. 
Deductions made on the basis of such provisional proportion shall be adjusted when the final proportion is fixed during the next year. 
Article 20 
Adjustments of deductions 
1. The initial deduction shall be adjusted according to the procedures laid down by the Member States, in particular: (a) where that deduction was higher or lower than that to which the taxable person was entitled; 
(b) where after the return is made some change occurs in the factors used to determine the amount to be deducted, in particular where purchases are cancelled or price reductions are obtained ; however, adjustment shall not be made in cases of transactions remaining totally or partially unpaid and of destruction, loss or theft of property duly proved or confirmed, nor in the case of applications for the purpose of making gifts of small value and giving samples specified in Article 5 (6). However, Member States may require adjustment in cases of transactions remaining totally or partially unpaid and of theft. 
2. In the case of capital goods, adjustment shall be spread over five years including that in which the goods were acquired or manufactured. The annual adjustment shall be made only in respect of one-fifth of the tax imposed on the goods. The adjustment shall be made on the basis of the variations in the deduction entitlement in subsequent years in relation to that for the year in which the goods were acquired or manufactured. 
By way of derogation from the preceding subparagraph, Member States may base the adjustment on a period of five full years starting from the time at which the goods are first used. 
In the case of immovable property acquired as capital goods the adjustment period may be extended up to 10 years. 
3. In the case of supply during the period of adjustment capital goods shall be regarded as if they had still been applied for business use by the taxable person until expiry of the period of adjustment. Such business activities are presumed to be fully taxed in cases where the delivery of the said goods is taxed ; they are presumed to be fully exempt where the delivery is exempt. The adjustment shall be made only once for the whole period of adjustment still to be covered. 
However, in the latter case, Member States may waive the requirement for adjustment in so far as the purchaser is a taxable person using the capital goods in question solely for transactions in respect of which value added tax is deductible. 
4. For the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3, Member States may: - define the concept of capital goods, 
- indicate the amount of the tax which is to be taken into consideration for adjustment, 
- adopt any suitable measures with a view to ensuring that adjustment does not involve any unjustified advantage, 
- permit administrative simplifications. 
5. If in any Member State the practical effect of applying paragraphs 2 and 3 would be insignificant, that Member State may subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29 forego application of these paragraphs having regard to the need to avoid distortion of competition, the overall tax effect in the Member State concerned and the need for due economy of administration. 
6. Where the taxable person transfers from being taxed in the normal way to a special scheme or vice versa, Member States may take all necessary measures to ensure that the taxable person neither benefits nor is prejudiced unjustifiably. 
TITLE XII PERSONS LIABLE FOR PAYMENT FOR TAX 
Article 21 
Persons liable to pay tax to the authorities 
The following shall be liable to pay value added tax: 1. under the internal system: (a) taxable persons who carry out taxable transactions other than those referred to in Article 9 (2) (e) and carried out by a taxable person resident abroad. When the taxable transaction is effected by a taxable person resident abroad Member States may adopt arrangements whereby tax is payable by someone other than the taxable person residing abroad. Inter alia a tax representative or other person for whom the taxable transaction is carried out may be designated as such other person. The Member States may also provide that someone other than the taxable person shall be held jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax; 
(b) persons to whom services covered by Article 9 (2) (e) are supplied and carried out by a taxable person resident abroad. However, Member States may require that the supplier of services shall be held jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax; 
(c) any person who mentions the value added tax on an invoice or other document serving as invoice; 
2. on importation : the person or persons designated or accepted as being liable by the Member States into which the goods are imported. 
TITLE XIII OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS LIABLE FOR PAYMENT 
Article 22 
Obligations under the internal system 
1. Every taxable person shall state when his activity as a taxable person commences, changes or ceases. 
2. Every taxable person shall keep accounts in sufficient detail to permit application of the value added tax and inspection by the tax authority. 
3. (a) Every taxable person shall issue an invoice, or other document serving as invoice in respect of all goods and services supplied by him to another taxable person, and shall keep a copy thereof. 
Every taxable person shall likewise issue an invoice in respect of payments on account made to him by another taxable person before the supply of goods or services is effected or completed. 
(b) The invoice shall state clearly the price exclusive of tax and the corresponding tax at each rate as well as any exemptions. 
(c) The Member States shall determine the criteria for considering whether a document serves as an invoice. 
4. Every taxable person shall submit a return within an interval to be determined by each Member State. This interval may not exceed two months following the end of each tax period. The tax period may be fixed by Member States as a month, two months, or a quarter. However, Member States may fix different periods provided that these do not exceed a year. 
The return must set out all the information needed to calculate the tax that has become chargeable and the deductions to be made, including, where appropriate, and in so far as it seems necessary for the establishment of the tax basis, the total amount of the transactions relative to such tax and deductions, and the total amount of the exempted supplies. 
5. Every taxable person shall pay the net amount of the value added tax when submitting the return. The Member States may, however, fix a different date for the payment of the amount or may demand an interim payment. 
6. Member States may require a taxable person to submit a statement, including the information specified in paragraph 4, and concerning all transactions carried out the preceding year. This statement must provide all the information necessary for any adjustments. 
7. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that those persons who, in accordance with Article 21 (1) (a) and (b), are considered to be liable to pay the tax instead of a taxable person established in another country or who are jointly, and severally liable for the payment, shall comply with the above obligations relating to declaration and payment. 
8. Without prejudice to the provisions to be adopted pursuant to Article 17 (4), Member States may impose other obligations which they deem necessary for the correct levying and collection of the tax and for the prevention of fraud. 
9. Member States may release taxable persons: - from certain obligations, 
- from all obligations where those taxable persons carry out only exempt transactions, 
- from the payment of the tax due where the amount is insignificant. 
Article 23 
Obligations in respect of imports 
As regards imported goods, Member States shall lay down the detailed rules for the making of the declarations and payments. 
In particular, Member States may provide that the value added tax payable on importation of goods by taxable persons or persons liable to tax or certain categories of these two need not be paid at the time of importation, on condition that the tax is mentioned as such in a return to be submitted under Article 22 (4). 
TITLE XIV SPECIAL SCHEMES 
Article 24 
Special scheme for small undertakings 
1. Member States which might encounter difficulties in applying the normal tax scheme to small undertakings by reason of their activities or structure shall have the option, under such conditions and within such limits as they may set but subject to the consultation provided for in Article 29, of applying simplified procedures such as flat-rate schemes for charging and collecting the tax provided they do not lead to a reduction thereof. 
2. Until a date to be fixed by the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, but which shall not be later than that on which the charging of tax on imports and the remission of tax on exports in trade between the Member States are abolished: (a) Member States which have made use of the option under Article 14 of the second Council Directive of 11 April 1967 to introduce exemptions or graduated tax relief may retain them and the arrangements for applying them if they conform with the value added tax system. 
Those Member States which apply an exemption from tax to taxable persons whose annual turnover is less than the equivalent in national currency of 5 000 European units of account at the conversion rate of the day on which this Directive is adopted, may increase this exemption up to 5 000 European units of account. 
Member States which apply graduated tax relief may neither increase the ceiling of the graduated tax reliefs nor render the conditions for the granting of it more favourable; 
(b) Member States which have not made use of this option may grant an exemption from tax to taxable persons whose annual turnover is at the maximum equal to the equivalent in national currency of 5 000 European units of account at the conversion rate of the day on which this Directive is adopted ; where appropriate, they may grant graduated tax relief to taxable persons whose annual turnover exceeds the ceiling fixed by the Member States for the application of exemption; 
(c) Member States which apply an exemption from tax to taxable persons whose annual turnover is equal to or higher than the equivalent in national currency of 5 000 European units of account at the conversion rate of the day on which this Directive is adopted, may increase it in order to maintain its value in real terms. 
3. The concepts of exemption and graduated tax relief shall apply to the supply of goods and services by small undertakings. 
Member States may exclude certain transactions from the arrangements provided for in paragraph 2. The provisions of paragraph 2 shall not, in any case, apply to the transactions referred to in Article 4 (3). 
4. The turnover which shall serve as a reference for the purposes of applying the provisions of paragraph 2 shall consist of the amount, exclusive of value added tax, of goods and services supplied as defined in Articles 5 and 6, to the extent that they are taxed, including transactions exempted with refund of tax previously paid in accordance with Article 28 (2), and the amount of the transactions exempted pursuant to Article 15, the amount of real property transactions, the financial transactions referred to in Article 13 B (d), and insurance services, unless these transactions are ancillary transactions. 
However, disposals of tangible or intangible capital assets of an undertaking shall not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating turnover. 
5. Taxable persons exempt from tax shall not be entitled to deduct tax in accordance with the provisions of Article 17, nor to show the tax on their invoices or on any other documents serving as invoices. 
6. Taxable persons eligible for exemption from tax may opt either for the normal value added tax scheme or for the simplified procedures referred to in paragraph 1. In this case they shall be entitled to any graduated tax relief which may be laid down by national legislation. 
7. Subject to the application of paragraph 1, taxable persons enjoying graduated relief shall be treated as taxable persons subject to the normal value added tax scheme. 
8. At four-yearly intervals, and for the first time on 1 January 1982, and after consultation of the Member States, the Commission shall report to the Council on the application of the provisions of this Article. It shall as far as may be necessary, and taking into account the need to ensure the long-term convergence of national regulations, attach to this report proposals for: (a) improvements to be made to the special scheme for small undertakings; 
(b) the adaptation of national systems as regards exemptions and graduated value added tax relief; 
(c) the adaptation of the limit of 5 000 European units of account mentioned in paragraph 2. 
9. The Council will decide at the appropriate time whether the realization of the objective referred to in Article 4 of the first Council Directive of 11 April 1967 requires the introduction of a special scheme for small undertakings and will, if appropriate, decide on the limits and common implementing conditions of this scheme. Until the introduction of such a scheme, Member States may retain their own special schemes which they will apply in accordance with the provisions of this Article and of subsequent acts of the Council. 
Article 25 
Common flat-rate scheme for farmers 
1. Where the application to farmers of the normal value added tax scheme, or the simplified scheme provided for in Article 24, would give rise to difficulties, Member States may apply to farmers a flat-rate scheme tending to offset the value added tax charged on purchases of goods and services made by the flat-rate farmers pursuant to this Article. 
2. For the purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply: - %quot%farmer%quot% : a taxable person who carries on his activity in one of the undertakings defined below, 
- %quot%agricultural, forestry or fisheries undertakings%quot% : an undertaking considered to be such by each Member State within the framework of the production activities listed in Annex A, 
- %quot%flat-rate farmer%quot% : a farmer subject to the flat-rate scheme provided for in paragraphs 3 et seq., 
- %quot%agricultural products%quot% : goods produced by an agricultural, forestry or fisheries undertaking in each Member State as a result of the activities listed in Annex A, 
- %quot%agricultural service%quot% : any service as set out in Annex B supplied by a farmer using his labour force and/or by means of the equipment normally available on the agricultural, forestry or fisheries undertaking operated by him, 
- %quot%value added tax charge on inputs%quot% : the amount of the total value added tax attaching to the goods and services purchased by all agricultural, forestry and fisheries undertakings of each Member State subject to the flat-rate scheme where such tax would be deductible under Article 17 by a farmer subject to the normal value added tax scheme, 
- %quot%flat-rate compensation percentages%quot% : the percentages fixed by Member States in accordance with paragraph 3 and applied by them in the cases specified in paragraph 5 to enable flat-rate farmers to offset at a fixed rate the value added tax charge on inputs, 
- %quot%flat-rate compensation%quot% : the amount arrived at by applying the flat-rate compensation percentage provided for in paragraph 3 to the turnover of the flat-rate farmer in the cases referred to in paragraph 5. 
3. Member States shall fix the flat-rate compensation percentages, where necessary, and shall notify the Commission before applying them. Such percentages shall be based on macro-economic statistics for flat-rate farmers alone for the preceding three years. They may not be used to obtain for flat-rate farmers refunds greater than the value added tax charges on inputs. Member States shall have the option of reducing such percentages to a nil rate. The percentage may be rounded up or down to the nearest half point. 
Member States may fix varying flat-rate compensation percentages for forestry, for the different sub-divisions of agriculture and for fisheries. 
4. Member States may release flat-rate farmers from the obligations imposed upon taxable persons by Article 22. 
5. The flat-rate percentages provided for in paragraph 3 shall be applied to the price, exclusive of tax, of the agricultural products and agricultural services supplied by the flat-rate farmers to taxable persons other than a flat-rate farmer. This compensation shall exclude all other forms of deduction. 
6. Member States may provide for the flat-rate compensation to be paid: (a) either by the taxable person to whom the goods or services are supplied. In this case, the taxable person to whom the goods or services are supplied shall be authorized, following the procedure laid down by the Member States, to deduct from the value added tax for which he is liable, the amount of the flat-rate compensation has paid to the flat-rate farmers; 
(b) or by the public authorities. 
7. Member States shall make all necessary provisions to check properly the payment of the flat-rate compensation to the flat-rate farmers. 
8. As regards all supplies of agricultural products and agricultural services other than those covered by paragraph 5, the flat-rate compensation is deemed to be paid by the purchaser or customer. 
9. Each Member State may exclude from the flat-rate scheme certain categories of farmers and farmers for whom the application of the normal value added tax scheme, or the simplified scheme provided for in Article 24 (1), would not give rise to administrative difficulties. 
10. Every flat-rate farmer may opt, subject to the rules and conditions to be laid down by each Member State, for application of the normal value added tax scheme or, as the case may be, the simplified scheme provided for in Article 24 (1).

Article 26 
Special scheme for travel agents 
1. Member States shall apply value added tax to the operations of travel agents in accordance with the provisions of this Article, where the travel agents deal with customers in their own name and use the supplies and services of other taxable persons in the provision of travel facilities. This Article shall not apply to travel agents who are acting only as intermediaries and accounting for tax in accordance with Article 11 A (3) (c). In this Article travel agents include tour operators. 
2. All transactions performed by the travel agent in respect of a journey shall be treated as a single service supplied by the travel agent to the traveller. It shall be taxable in the Member State in which the travel agent has established his business or has a fixed establishment from which the travel agent has provided the services. The taxable amount and the price exclusive of tax, within the meaning of Article 22 (3) (b), in respect of this service shall be the travel agent's margin, that is to say, the difference between the total amount to be paid by the traveller, exclusive of value added tax, and the actual cost to the travel agent of supplies and services provided by other taxable persons where these transactions are for the direct benefit of the traveller. 
3. If transactions entrusted by the travel agent to other taxable persons are performed by such persons outside the Community, the travel agent's service shall be treated as an exempted intermediary activity under Article 15 (14). Where these transactions are performed both inside and outside the Community, only that part of the travel agent's service relating to transactions outside the Community may be exempted. 
4. Tax charged to the travel agent by other taxable persons on the transactions described in paragraph 2 which are for the direct benefit of the traveller, shall not be eligible for deduction or refund in any Member State. 
TITLE XV SIMPLIFICATION PROCEDURES 
Article 27 
1. The Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from the provisions of this Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance. Measures intended to simplify the procedure for charging the tax, except to a negligible extent, may not affect the amount of tax due at the final consumption stage. 
2. A Member State wishing to introduce the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of them and shall provide the Commission with all relevant information. 
3. The Commission shall inform the other Member States of the proposed measures within one month. 
4. The Council's decision shall be deemed to have been adopted if, within two months of the other Member States being informed as laid down in the previous paragraph, neither the Commission nor any Member State has requested that the matter be raised by the Council. 
5. Those Member States which apply on 1 January 1977 special measures of the type referred to in paragraph 1 above may retain them providing they notify the Commission of them before 1 January 1978 and providing that where such derogations are designed to simplify the procedure for charging tax they conform with the requirement laid down in paragraph 1 above. 
TITLE XVI TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS 
Article 28

Member States shall adopt the measures necessary to ensure that taxable persons declare the data required to determine own resources relating to these operations. 
On the basis of a report from the Commission, the Council shall review the abovementioned reduced rates and exemptions every five years and, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall where appropriate, adopt the measures required to ensure the progressive abolition thereof.

(f) provide that for supplies of buildings and building land purchased for the purpose of resale by a taxable person for whom tax on the purchase was not deductible, the taxable amount shall be the difference between the selling price and the purchase price; 
(g) by way of derogation from Articles 17 (3) and 26 (3), continue to exempt without repayment of input tax the services of travel agents referred to in Article 26 (3). This derogation shall also apply to travel agents acting in the name and on account of the traveller. 
4. The transitional period shall last initially for five years as from 1 January 1978. At the latest six months before the end of this period, and subsequently as necessary, the Council shall review the situation with regard to the derogations set out in paragraph 3 on the basis of a report from the Commission and shall unanimously determine on a proposal from the Commission, whether any or all of these derogations shall be abolished.
