Council Directive 92/52/EEC of 18 June 1992 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae intended for export to third countries 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/52/EEC of 18 June 1992 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae intended for export to third countries 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Community rules concerning infant formulae and follow-on formulae are laid down by Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses (4) in Commission Directive 91/321/EEC (5); 
Whereas given the nature of the products in question it is desirable that Community rules or international standards relating to their composition are made applicable to such products intended for export to third countries; 
Whereas in order to prevent inappropriate use of these products which could prejudice the health of infants it is also desirable to extend the application of the Community rules on labelling of infant formulae and follow-on formuale to those products intended for export to third countries; 
Whereas the products complying with Directive 91/321/EEC may be marketed in the Community as from 1 December 1992; whereas no legislation prohibits the export of such products to third countries, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
This Directive concerns infant formuale and follow-on formulae, as defined by Article 1 (2) (c) and (d) of Directive 91/321/EEC, intended for export to third countries. 
Article 2 
Member States shall ensure that the products referred to in Article 1 may be exported from the Community only if they comply with this Directive.

1. No product other than infant formulae may be represented as suitable for satisfying by itself the nutritional requirements of normal healthy infants during the first four to six months of life. 
2. In addition the products referred to in Article 1 must comply: 
(a) with Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Directive 91/321/EEC or with relevant applicable world standards established by Codex Alimentarius;
