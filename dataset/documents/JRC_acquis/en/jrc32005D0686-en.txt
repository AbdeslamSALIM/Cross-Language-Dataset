Whereas, 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 753/2004 contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions and classifications for compiling Community statistics on science and technology in order to obtain high quality statistical results from Member states in accordance with these standards, definitions and classifications. 
(2) Section 1, point 3 of the Annex to the Regulation (EC) No 753/2004 provides that, in so far as national statistical systems require major adaptations, the Commission may grant derogations to Member States with respect to the statistics on research and development compiled for the first reference year 2003. In very exceptional cases, this derogation period may be extended for the regional breakdowns of certain variables. 
(3) Section 2, point 3 of the Annex to the Regulation (EC) No 753/2004 provides that, in so far as national statistical systems require major adaptations, the Commission may grant derogations to Member States with respect to the statistics on government budget appropriations or outlays on research and development (GBAORD) compiled for the first reference year 2004. 
(4) Such derogations have been requested by the respective authorities of Belgium, Estonia, Greece, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
(5) According to the information received by the Commission (Eurostat), the requests from the Member States concerned are due to the fact that they need to make important changes to their statistical system.
