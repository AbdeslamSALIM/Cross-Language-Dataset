COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 17 May 1982 amending for the second time Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (82/368/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas the implementation of Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (4), as amended by Directive 79/661/EEC (5), showed that certain amendments should be made to Annexes II, III, IV and V; 
Whereas, in order to protect public health, measures should be taken with regard to mandatory warnings on the labels of cosmetic products containing thioglycollic acid, its salts and esters; 
Whereas the use of hydrogen peroxide is not restricted to oxydizing colouring agents for hair dyeing ; whereas the use of this substance should therefore also be authorized for hair care products, with the requirement that certain warnings be printed on the label to safeguard health; 
Whereas in certain circumstances it is not necessary to mention the formaldehyde content on the label when this substance is not used as an ingredient of a cosmetic product but is inevitably present as a residue from the processing of raw materials; 
Whereas the field of application and/or use of hydroquinone should be specified; 
Whereas the maximum authorized concentration of potassium or sodium hydroxide in depilatories should be specified; 
Whereas a decision may be taken with regard to the substances listed in Part I of Annex IV to Directive 76/768/EEC, in accordance with Article 5 thereof; 
Whereas Parts 2 and 3 of Annex IV to the same Directive do not correspond with the list of colouring (1) OJ No C 165, 2.7.1979, p. 52. (2) OJ No C 175, 14.7.1980, p. 88. (3) OJ No C 83, 2.4.1980, p. 7. (4) OJ No L 262, 27.9.1976, p. 169. (5) OJ No L 192, 31.7.1979, p. 35. agents actually used in the preparation of cosmetic products ; whereas this list should therefore be updated; 
Whereas a list of substances authorized for use as preservatives can be drawn up on the basis of the latest scientific and technical research; 
Whereas a procedure for updating the Annexes rapidly should be introduced; 
Whereas the presence of traces of substances which cosmetic products must not contain according to Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC is technologically inevitable with correct manufacturing processes ; whereas therefore certain provisions should be made in this connection; 
Whereas the English, German and Dutch versions of Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 contain typographical errors which should be corrected, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
