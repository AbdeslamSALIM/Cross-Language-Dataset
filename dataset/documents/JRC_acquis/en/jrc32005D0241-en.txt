MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT 
A. Monitoring Committee 
1. Establishment 
Independent of the financing of this action, a monitoring committee for the programme shall be set up, composed of representatives of France and the Commission. It shall review implementation of the programme regularly and, in appropriate cases, propose any adjustments required. 
The Committee shall establish its own internal procedures within one month of the notification of the present decision to France. 
3. Competence of Monitoring Committee 
The Committee:

Its competence shall embrace the programme measures within the limits of the Community aid granted. It shall keep watch with respect to the regulatory provisions, including those on eligibility of operations and projects, 
- shall, on the basis of information on the selection of projects already approved and implemented, reach an opinion on application of the selection criteria set out in the programme,

- shall give its opinion on the adjustments proposed to the Commission, 
- shall issue an opinion on technical assistance projects scheduled in the programme,

- shall report during the relevant period to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on the progress of the programme and expenditure incurred. 
B. Monitoring and assessment of the programme during the implementation period (continuous monitoring and assessment) 
The national agency responsible for implementation shall also be responsible for continuous monitoring and assessment of the programme. 
By continuous monitoring is meant an information system on the state of progress of the programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the programme. It involves reference to the financial and physical indicators structured so as to permit assessment of the correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the degree of realization. 
Continuous assessment of a programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and programme objectives. 
Implementation report and scrutiny of programme 
France shall notify to the Commission, within one month of adoption of the programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the final implementation report.

It shall contain: 
- a concise technical evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact, 
- a financial cost statement, including expenditure and income, and a declaration from France stating that no other Community contribution was or will be asked for for these measures included in the programme. 
The Commission may jointly with France call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment referred to in point 3. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the subprogrammes and/or measures, and amending the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall give an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken.
