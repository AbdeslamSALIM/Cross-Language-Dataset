THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, of 30 June 1992, on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1253/1999(2), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2072/98(4), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, 
(1) Whereas Article 7(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/98(6), provides for a scrutiny period before licences are actually issued for the export of all cereals, including rice, and most processed products, given the risks involved in issuing licences for very high volumes; whereas the maintenance of this mechanism is not justified for non-commercial exports made with a view to providing Community or national food aid, or for certain supplies by humanitarian agencies; whereas Article 7 should therefore be amended and provision should be made for the amendment to take immediate effect; 
(2) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
