Commission Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 
of 9 December 2005 
on licences under the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community in respect of bananas released into free circulation at the common customs tariff rate of duty 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 of 2 December 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas [1], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 sets the rate of duty applicable from 1 January 2006 to imports into the Community of bananas falling within CN code 08030019. 
(2) Import arrangements based on the application of a customs duty at an appropriate rate, parallel to the application of a tariff preference in connection with a tariff quota for imports originating in ACP countries, must be accompanied by a mechanism for monitoring imports on a regular basis to ascertain the quantities released into free circulation in the Community. The appropriate instrument for achieving that objective is a mechanism based on issuing import licences subject to the provision of a security to ensure that the operations for which a licence has been applied for are actually performed. Detailed rules for applying such a mechanism as regards imports at the common customs tariff rate of duty should be laid down. 
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products [2] is applicable. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,
