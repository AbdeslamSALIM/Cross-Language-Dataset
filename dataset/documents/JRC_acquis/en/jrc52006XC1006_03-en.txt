Commission Opinion of 5 October 2006 concerning the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste arising from the dismantling of the Buildings 101A, 102X, 103X, 104X and 153X of the former Eurochemic Reprocessing Plant located in Belgium, in accordance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty 
Commission Opinion of 5 October 2006 concerning the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste arising from the dismantling of the Buildings 101A, 102X, 103X, 104X and 153X of the former Eurochemic Reprocessing Plant located in Belgium, in accordance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty 
(2006/C 241/13) 
(only the French and the Dutch texts are authentic) 
On 19 October 2005, the European Commission received from the Belgian Government, in accordance with Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty, General Data relating to the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste arising from the dismantling of the Buildings 101A, 102X, 103X, 104X and 153X of the former Eurochemic Reprocessing Plant. 
On the basis of these data and the additional information requested by the Commission on 7 February 2006 and 10 March 2006 and provided by the Belgian authorities on 29 March 2006 and 24 April 2006, and following consultation with the Group of Experts, the Commission has drawn up the following opinion: 
1. The distance between the plant and the nearest point of another Member State, in this case the Netherlands, is approximately 11 km while Germany is at 70 km. 
2. During normal dismantling operation, discharges of liquid and gaseous effluents will not cause an exposure of the population in other Member States that is significant from the point of view of health. 
3. Most of the solid waste emanating from the dismantling activities is likely to be released for disposal as conventional waste or for unconditional reuse or recycling, in all cases complying with the criteria laid down in the Basic Safety Standards (Directive 96/29/Euratom). All other radioactive waste will be treated and stored on-site. 
4. In the event of unplanned releases of radioactive effluents, which may follow an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the General Data, the doses likely to be received by the population in other Member States would not be significant from the point of view of health. 
In conclusion, the Commission is of the opinion that the implementation of the plan for the disposal of radioactive waste in whatever form arising from the dismantling of the Buildings 101A, 102X, 103X, 104X and 153X of the former Eurochemic Reprocessing Plant in Belgium, both in normal operation and in the event of an accident of the type and magnitude considered in the General Data, is not liable to result in radioactive contamination, significant from the point of view of health, of the water, soil or airspace of another Member State.
