Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Whereas: 
(1) The list of third countries from which certain agricultural products obtained by the organic production method must originate in order to be marketed within the Community, provided for in Article 11(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (hereinafter referred to as "the list"), is set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 94/92 of 14 January 1992 laying down detailed rules for implementing the arrangements for imports from third countries provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs [2]. 
(2) Certain agricultural products imported from India are currently marketed in the Community pursuant to the derogation provided for in Article 11(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(3) India submitted a request to the Commission to be included in the list. It submitted the information required pursuant to Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 94/92. 
(4) The examination of this information and consequent discussion with the Indian authorities have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and inspection of agricultural products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(5) The Commission has carried out an on-the-spot-check of the rules of production and the inspection measures actually applied in India, as provided for in Article 11(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91. 
(6) The duration of inclusion of Costa Rica and New Zealand in the list expires on 30 June 2006. In order to avoid trade disruption, there is a need to prolong the inclusion of these countries in the list for a further period. 
(7) Australia has informed the Commission that one inspection body has changed its name and has corrected the name of another inspection body. 
(8) Switzerland has requested the Commission to amend the terms of its inclusion in the list in accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products [3], approved by Decision 2002/309/EC of the Council and of the Commission [4], and in particular with Annex 9 of that Agreement on organically produced agricultural products and foodstuffs.

(10) New Zealand has informed the Commission that one inspection body has changed its name. 
(11) Regulation (EEC) No 94/92 should therefore be amended accordingly.
