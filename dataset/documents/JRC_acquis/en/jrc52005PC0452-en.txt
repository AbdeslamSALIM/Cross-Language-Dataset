It is responsible for examining all questions relating to the said Annex and its implementation and is to carry out the tasks provided for therein. The Joint Veterinary Committee is empowered to adopt decisions in the cases provided for in Annex 11. 
Article 19(3) of Annex 11 to the Agriculture Agreement authorises the Joint Veterinary Committee to amend the appendices thereto, in particular with a view to adapting and updating them.
