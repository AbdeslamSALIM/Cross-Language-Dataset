Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the signature and provisional application of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Moldova on certain aspects of air services 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Moldova on certain aspects of air services 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
International aviation relations between Member States and third countries have traditionally been governed by bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries, the Annexes to such agreements and other related bilateral or multilateral arrangements. 
Following the judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in cases C-466/98, C-467/98, C-468/98, C-471/98, C-472/98, C-475/98 and C-476/98, the Community has exclusive competence with respect to various aspects of external aviation. The Court of Justice also clarified the right of Community air carriers to benefit from the right of establishment within the Community, including the right to non-discriminatory market access. 
Traditional designation clauses in Member States’ bilateral air services agreements infringe Community law. They allow a third country to reject, withdraw or suspend the permissions or authorisations of an air carrier that has been designated by a Member State but that is not substantially owned and effectively controlled by that Member State or its nationals. This has been found to constitute discrimination against Community carriers established in the territory of a Member State but owned and controlled by nationals of other Member States. This is contrary to Article 43 of the Treaty which guarantees nationals of Member States who have exercised their freedom of establishment the same treatment in the host Member State as that accorded to nationals of that Member State. 
Following the Court of Justice judgements, the Council authorised the Commission in June 2003 to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement.[1] 
In accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the Council decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with the Republic of Moldova that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of Moldova. Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with a Community designation clause, permitting all Community carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. Articles 4 and 5 of the Agreement address two types of clauses concerning matters of Community competence. Article 4 deals with the taxation of aviation fuel, a matter which has been harmonised by Council Directive 2003/96/EC restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity, and in particular Article 14 (2) thereof. Article 5 (Pricing) resolves conflicts between the existing bilateral air services agreements and Council Regulation No 2409/92 on fares and rates for air services which prohibits third country carriers from being price leaders on air services for carriage wholly within the Community. 
The Council is asked to approve the decisions on the signature and provisional application and on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Moldova on certain aspects of air services and to designate the persons authorised to sign the Agreement on behalf of the Community.

ANNEX 4 
Definitions 
The expression “Member State” means any Member State of the European Community. 
The expression “Establishment of a Community air carrier (airline) on the territory of a Member State” implies the effective and real exercise of air transport activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such an establishment should not be the determining factor in this respect, whether it is a branch or a subsidiary with legal personality. When an undertaking is established on the territory of several Member States, as defined by the Treaty, it should ensure, in order to avoid any circumvention of national law, that each of the establishments fulfils the obligations which may, in accordance with Community law, be imposed by the national law applicable to its activities.[6] 
The expression “Operating licence ” means an authorisation granted by the Member State responsible to an undertaking, permitting it to carry out carriage by air of passengers, mail and/or cargo, as stated in the operating licence, for remuneration and/or hire. 
The expression “Air operator’s certificate” means a document issued to an undertaking or a group of undertakings by the competent authorities which affirms that the operator in question has the professional ability and organisation to secure the safe operation of aircraft for the aviation activities specified in the certificate. 
Evidence of “effective regulatory control” is predicated upon but is not limited to: the air carrier holds a valid Operating Licence issued by the competent authorities, and meets the criteria for the operation of international air services established by the competent authorities, such as proof of financial fitness, ability to meet, where relevant, public interest requirement, obligations for assurance of service etc., and the licensing Member State has and maintains aviation safety and security oversight programmes in compliance with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation at least.
