ANNEX 
GUIDE TO THE COMPILATION OF SAFETY DATA SHEETS The following explanatory notes are intended as a guide. Their purpose is to ensure that the content of each of the mandatory headings listed in Article 3 will enable professional users to take the necessary measures relating to protection of health and safety at the workplace, and to protect the environment. 
The information must be written in a clear and concise manner. 
Additional information may prove necessary in some cases in view of the wide range of properties of the substances and preparations. If in other cases it emerges that information from certain properties is of no significance or that it is technically impossible to provide the reasons for this must be clearly stated. 
Although the order of headings is not obligatory, the sequence given in Article 3 is recommended. 
When a safety data sheet has been revised, the changes should be brought to the attention of the recipient. 
1. Identification of the substance/preparation and of the company/undertaking 
1.1. Identification of the substance or preparation: 
The term used for identification must be identical to that provided on the label as set out in Annex VI to Directive 67/548/EEC. 
Other means of identification available may also be indicated. 
1.2. Company/undertaking identification: 
- identification of the person established within the Community responsible for placing the substance or preparation on the market whether it be the manufacturer, importer or distributor, 
- full address and telephone number of this person. 
1.3. In addition to the abovementioned information, supply the emergency telephone number of the company and/or official advisory body in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 88/379/EEC. 
2. Composition/information on ingredients 
The information given should enable the recipient to identify readily the risks attached to the substance or preparation. 
In the case of a preparation: 
(a) it is not necessary to give the full composition (nature of the ingredients and their concentration); 
(b) however, the following substances shall be indicated, together with their concentration or concentration range, if they are present in concentrations equal to or greater than those laid down in Article 3 (6) (a) of Directive 88/379/EEC (unless a lower limit is considered more appropriate): 
- substances presenting a health hazard within the meaning of Directive 67/548/EEC, 
and 
- at least substances subject to recognized exposure limit values pursuant to Community provisions but which are not covered by the above Directive; 
(c) the classification (either from Article 6 of or Annex I to Directive 67/548/EEC) of the above substances shall be given in the form of the symbols and R phrases which are assigned in accordance with their health hazards; 
(d) if, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (1) of Directive 88/379/EEC, the identity of certain substances is to be kept confidential, their chemical nature shall be described in order to ensure safe handling. The name must be the same as that which derives from the above procedure. 
3. Hazards identification 
Indicate clearly and briefly the most important hazards the substance or preparation presents, in particular the critical hazards to man and the environment. 
Describe the most important adverse human health effects and symptoms relating to the uses and possible misuses of the substance or preparation that can be reasonably foreseen. 
The information should be compatible with that shown on the product label but need not repeat it. 
4. First-aid measures 
Describe the first-aid measures; however, it is important to specify whether immediate medical attention is required. 
The information on first aid must be brief and easy to understand by the victim, bystanders and first aiders. The symptoms and effects should be briefly summarized. The instructions should indicate what is to be done on the spot in the case of an accident and whether delayed effects can be expected after exposure. 
Subdivide the information according to the different routes of exposure, i. e. inhalation, skin and eye contact and ingestion, under different subheadings. 
Indicate whether professional assistance by a doctor is needed or advisable. 
For some substances or preparations it may be important to emphasize that special means to provide specific and immediate treatment must be available at the workplace. 
5. Fire-fighting measures 
Refer to requirements for fighting a fire caused by the substance or preparation, or arising in its vicinity by indicating: 
- suitable extinguishing media, 
- extinguishing media which must not be used for safety reasons, 
- special exposure hazards arising from the substance or preparation itself, combustion products, resulting gases, 
- special protective equipment for fire-fighters. 
6. Accidental release measures 
Depending on the substance or preparation involved, information may be needed on: 
- personal precautions such as: 
removal of ignition sources, provision for sufficient ventilation/respiratory protection, control of dust, prevention of skin and eye contact, 
- environmental precautions such as: 
keeping away from drains, surface- and ground-water and soil, possible need to alert the neighbourhood, 
- methods for cleaning up such as: 
use of absorbant material (e. g. sand, diatonic soil, acid binder, universal binder, sawdust . . .) reduction of gases/fumes with water, dilution.
