EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. Context of the proposal 
Grounds for and objectives of the proposal 
The Commission announced in the White Paper on Food Safety a proposal amending the framework Directive 89/107/EEC on food additives to lay down specific provisions in respect of food enzymes. In-depth assessment of the situation has led to the development of a specific proposal for food enzymes. 
Currently the scope of Directive 89/107/EEC only covers enzymes used as food additives and only two enzymes are authorised under this Directive. The remaining enzymes are not regulated at all or are regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States, which is diverse. Thus, there is a need for harmonised rules at Community level, in order to promote fair trading and effective functioning of the internal market in food enzymes and ensure protection of human health and consumers' interest. A proposal for a new Regulation on food enzymes, as part of the package on food improvement agents, is included in the Commission Legislative Working Programme of 2005. 
General context 
The legislation controlling the use of enzymes in food processing is not fully harmonised in the EU. The national regulatory context for enzymes used as processing aids in food production differs significantly among Member States. Only a few Member States have a mandatory or voluntary authorisation procedure, the majority have none at all. Moreover, there are divided opinions among Member States in relation to the categorisation of enzymes into food additives or processing aids according to their function in the food process or in the final food. This lack of harmonised rules in the Community created barriers to the trade of food enzymes and has hindered growth in this field. 
With respect to safety, there is neither safety evaluation nor authorisation of food enzymes at European level, except for those that are considered as food additives. Historically, food enzymes were considered to be non-toxic. However, the food enzyme industry is continually striving to develop improved technology resulting in the development of food enzymes which became through the years more complex and sophisticated. There could be some potential hazards arising from their chemical nature and source such as allergenicity, activity-related toxicity, residual microbiological activity, and chemical toxicity. Therefore safety evaluation of all food enzymes, including those produced by genetically modified micro-organisms (GMOs), is essential in order to ensure consumer safety. 
Existing provisions in the area of the proposal 
Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners allows for the use of two enzymes as food additives: E 1103 Invertase and E1105 Lysozyme. 
In addition, Council Directive 2001/112/EC relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption, Council Directive 83/417/EEC relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption and Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, regulate the use of certain food enzymes in these specific foods. 
Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union 
The policy objectives to be met are: 
– the promotion of fair trading in food enzymes in order to ensure an efficient and internationally competitive food industry; 
– the protection of human health and consumers' interest. 
These objectives will contribute to the strategic objectives of the Commission as set out in the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission five year plan and the Commission's White paper of Food Safety published in 2000. 
2. Consultation of interested parties and impact assessment 
Consultation of interested parties 
Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents 
The opinion of Member States and stakeholders has been sought through consultations at several working groups and during bilateral contacts with stakeholders since 2000. Some of the stakeholders consulted were: 
BEUC (The European Consumers' Organisation) 
CIAA (Confederation of the food and drink industries of the EU) 
CEFIC (European Chemical Industry Council) 
AMFEP (Association of Manufacturers and Formulators of Enzyme products) 
ELC (Federation of European Food Additives and Food Enzymes Industries) 
ISA (International Sweeteners Association) 
FEDIMA (Federation of the Intermediate products Industries for the Bakery and Confectionery trades in the EEA) 
CAOBISCO (Association of the Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries of the EU) 
Moreover, a questionnaire on the impacts of the proposal was circulated to the different stakeholders on 22.2.2005 to which 70 replies were received by the end of the consultation. 
Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account 
After each consultation, comments have been considered and texts have been adapted. General consensus exists on the proposal. The following points were specifically raised and comments considered as follows: 
1. Harmonisation and scope of legislation: 
The introduction of specific harmonising legislation on food enzymes was generally welcomed. 
2. Harmonisation of safety evaluation and authorisation: 
All stakeholders were generally positive to the introduction of a European wide safety evaluation and authorisation of food enzymes. 
3. Labelling of enzymes on food: 
Initially proposed labelling of enzymes which have no function in food raised concerns among the food industry. On the other hand some Member States and consumer's association supported more specific labelling for enzymes present in food. Revised labelling rules require specific and informative labelling for enzymes which have a technological function in the final food, but exclude from labelling enzymes which are used as processing aids. 
4. Time limited authorisation: 
There was a strong indication from industry that a time limited authorisation could be a barrier to innovation. On the other hand Member States and consumer organisations considered that enzyme approvals should be kept under review to ensure that they remain current. An intermediate solution is proposed where producers or users of enzymes should provide to the Commission on its request information on actual uses. 
5. Transitional periods: 
The proposal sets out a procedure for a smooth transition to a Community positive list. The consultation pointed out that during this transition period, industry should continue to be able to develop and market new enzymes. In order to avoid hindering innovation in this sector, the proposal now provides for additional transitional measures. 
Collection and use of expertise 
Scientific/expertise domains concerned 
A "study of the enzymes used in foodstuffs and collation of data on their safety", was generated under the scientific co-operation procedure within the legal frame of Council Directive 93/5/EEC 'on the assistance to the Commission and co-operation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food (SCOOP)'. 
Methodology used 
Data was collected from 9 Member States on the approval systems, safety evaluation procedures and uses of enzymes in the EU. 
Main organisations/experts consulted 
Experts from 9 Member States and AMFEP. 
Summary of advice received and used 
The existence of potentially serious risks with irreversible consequences has not been mentioned. 
The SCOOP Task Force concluded that "A consensus was obtained to assert that, in all cases, whatever the status or the categorisation of the enzyme, a rationale for safety evaluation is necessary". 
Means used to make the expert advice publicly available 
The report was published on: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/scoop/7.4.1_en.pdf 
Impact assessment 
The impacts expected on the different options concern economic and social aspects. Environmental impacts are not expected from the different options considered, since the industry concerned - the food industry - is involved in secondary or tertiary processing of food products. Enzymes are already widely used. 
1. No action 
1.1 Economic impact 
The current legal uncertainty due to the differing regulatory approaches among Member States would remain, along with the current market distortions in the trade of food enzymes. Enzyme producers would continue to seek authorisation for the same enzyme in more than one Member States which is an administrative and financial burden for industry. 
1.2 Social impact 
Differences in risk perception, safety assessment and regulation of food enzymes among Member States would lead to different levels of consumer protection. GMO produced enzymes not covered by Regulation 1829/2003, such as microbial enzymes, would not be assessed for their safety. 
2. Non-Regulatory instrument 
2.1 Economic impact 
Self-regulation would provide flexibility; on the other hand, food enzymes are already regulated when used as food additives by Community law and as processing aids by national legislation. This could lead to contradictory and confusing situation for the industry and negative economic impact. 
2.2 Social impact 
A safety assessment, which is not carried out by an independent body, would not get the same level of acceptance from the public. The transparency of the procedures built in a self-regulatory system would be limited. An unclear legal situation would result in loss of consumer confidence, especially with regard to enzymes obtained from GMOs. 
3. Regulatory approach 
3.1 Economic impacts 
The harmonisation of the safety evaluation and authorisation of food enzymes, may result in higher upfront investments before market introduction of food enzymes due to the authorisation cost, estimated to be in the range of 150-250k € per enzyme. However, some Member States already have authorisation procedures in place entailing similar costs for companies that market their products in those Member States. With this proposal industry will benefit from a harmonised Community procedure with defined deadlines, instead of multiple national ones. 
The proposal exempts from labelling those food enzymes used as processing aids. Food enzymes used in the same way as food additives, to exert a technological function in the final food should be labelled with their function (e.g. stabiliser etc) and specific name. This provision is unlikely to have an economic impact on businesses as only a limited number of enzymes (currently only 2 and in the future not more than a dozen) would need to be labelled. This implies no major change to the current situation. 
This proposal will have a very limited impact on households. Although the costs of evaluation seem high it is unlikely that these costs will result in any significant increases in the cost which consumers pay for food. 
3.2 Social impact 
It can be expected that the proposed comprehensive system of safety evaluation of food enzymes will have positive impacts on public health and consumer confidence. 
The Commission carried out an impact assessment listed in the Work Programme, whose report is accessible on http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/additives/index_en.htm. 
3. Legal elements of the proposal 
Summary of the proposed action 
The proposed Regulation sets the conditions of use of food enzymes, provides for the establishment of a Community list of approved food enzymes and lays down labelling rules for those enzymes. The proposal will complete the framework of GM food and feed legislation. 
Legal basis 
Article 95 of the EC Treaty 
Subsidiarity principle 
The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. 
The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reason(s). 
In the absence of harmonisation and to the extent that there is still uncertainty in the current state of scientific research, which is particularly the case in new technology sectors such as food enzymes, it is for the Member States to decide on the level of protection of human health they wish to ensure and whether to require prior authorisation for the marketing of foodstuffs, taking into account the requirements of the free movement of goods within the Community. In terms of risk assessment, Member States often start with different scientific assumptions and may require different scientific data. Therefore, if Member States were to introduce their own legislation, that would risk creating barriers to trade and possible burdens to industry from different requirements which might arise, as well as different levels of consumer protection among Member States. 
Community action will better achieve the objectives of the proposal for the following reason(s). 
As food enzymes and food containing those enzymes are traded across borders, Member States cannot by themselves achieve the objectives of the proposal sufficiently. 300 food enzymes need to be managed. This requires a harmonised and centralised approach. 
Efficiency of the authorisation procedure and effective functioning of the internal market with a level playing field for all economic operators will indicate that the objectives are best met by the Community action. 
The proposal achieves its objectives by limiting its scope to general conditions for the safe use of food enzymes, provisions for the establishment of a Community list of food enzymes and common labelling provisions. 
The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle. 
Proportionality principle 
The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). 
The proposal is a framework Regulation that sets the general rules for the safe use and authorisation of food enzymes via a Community list. In terms of consumer information, the proposal provides for a proportionate labelling of food enzymes with a limited cost for industry while at the same time offers, where necessary, sufficient information to the consumer. 
The Community procedure for the safety assessment of food enzymes will have a financial and administrative impact upon the European Food Safety Authority. However, it will move the burden of safety assessment from those Member States that have currently legislation on food enzymes, and will allow them to direct their resources more towards the implementation of legislation and control activities. The financial and in particular administrative impact on economic operators will be decreased as they will have to apply for a single Community authorisation instead of multiple national ones. 
Choice of instruments 
Proposed instruments: regulation. 
Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). 
The provisions of this proposal are of technical nature. The use of regulation as the legal instrument for the proposal will ensure uniform and direct application of the rules for the benefit both of the consumers and of the competitiveness of the industry. 
4. Budgetary implication 
The Community may finance the establishment of a harmonised policy and system in the field of food enzymes including: 
development of an appropriate database for gathering and storing all information relating to Community legislation on enzymes, undertaking of studies necessary for the preparation of legislation, for the harmonisation of procedures, for decision-making criteria and data requirements to facilitate work sharing between Member States and to develop guidance in these areas. 
5. Additional information 
Simulation, pilot phase and transitory period 
There was or there will be a transitory period for the proposal. 
Simplification 
The proposal provides for simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or national), simplification of administrative procedures for private parties. 
The evaluation and authorisation of food enzymes by national authorities will be replaced by a Community procedure. 
Administrative burden will be decreased for private parties as they will have to apply for a single Community authorisation instead of multiple national ones. 
The proposal is included in the Commission's rolling programme for up-date and simplification of the acquis communautaire and its Work and Legislative Programme under the reference 2005/SANCO/034. 
European Economic Area 
The proposed act concerns an EEA matter and should therefore extend to the European Economic Area. 
Detailed explanation of the proposal 
Chapter I - Subject matter, scope and definitions. 
The proposed Regulation will apply to enzymes used for a technological purpose in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of food, including those used as processing aids ('food enzymes'). Food enzymes shall be subject to safety evaluation and approval via a community list. 
Chapter II - Community list of approved food enzymes 
All food enzymes and their use in food will be evaluated for safety, technological need, benefit to the consumer and that the consumer is not being misled by the use. In line with the decision to separate risk management and risk assessment, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will carry out the safety evaluations. The inclusion of a food enzyme in the Community list will be considered by the Commission on the basis of the opinion from EFSA, taking into account the other general criteria (technological need, consumer aspects). For every food enzyme included in the positive list specifications, including the criteria on purity and the origin of the food enzyme shall be laid down. 
Chapter III - Labelling 
The proposed Regulation will introduce labelling requirements for food enzymes sold to the manufacturer or directly to the consumer. For the purpose of labelling, enzymes used in food should be considered as ingredients similarly to additives according to Directive 2000/13/EC relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs. In most cases food enzymes will be used as processing aids i.e. will be present in food in the form of a residue, if at all and will have no technological effect on the finished product. Taking into account that all food enzymes will be assessed for their safety, it is proposed that food enzymes which are used as processing aids are exempted from labelling. Food enzymes used to exert a technological function in the final food, will be labelled with their function (e.g. stabiliser etc) and specific name. 
Chapter IV - Procedural provisions and implementation 
Wherever necessary, producers or users of food enzymes will be obliged to inform the Commission of any new information which may affect the safety assessment of the food enzyme. 
Implementation of the measures proposed in the Regulation will be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the regulatory procedure laid down in Council Decision 1999/468/EC. 
Chapter V -Transitional and final provisions 
Since many food enzymes are already on the market in the Community, the transition to a Community positive list should be smooth and should not lead to unfair conditions for enzyme producers. Therefore, the proposal provides for an initial period of 24 months, after the date of application of the implementing measures foreseen in the common procedure Regulation, during which applications can be submitted. The establishment of the Community list will take place in a single step procedure after the Authority has expressed opinions on all products for which sufficient information has been submitted during the 24-month period. Until the establishment of the Community list, food enzymes and food produced with food enzymes may be placed on the market and used, according to the existing national rules. A transitional period is also foreseen for the proposed labelling requirements.

Proposal for a 
REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
on food enzymes and amending Council Directive 83/417/EEC, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, Directive 2000/13/EC, and Council Directive 2001/112/EC 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, 
Whereas: 
(1) The free movement of safe and wholesome food is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests. 
(2) A high level of protection of human life and health should be assured in the pursuit of Community policies. 
(3) Enzymes other than those used as food additives are not currently regulated or are regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States. Differences between national laws, regulations and administrative provisions concerning the assessment and authorisation of food enzymes may hinder their free movement, creating conditions for unequal and unfair competition. It is therefore necessary to adopt Community rules harmonising national provisions relating to the use of enzymes in foods. 
(4) This Regulation should only cover enzymes that are added to food to perform a technological function in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of such food, including enzymes used as processing aids (‘food enzymes’). The scope of this Regulation should therefore not extend to enzymes that are not added to food to perform a technological function but are intended for human consumption, such as enzymes for nutritional purposes. Microbial cultures traditionally used in the production of food, such as cheese and, wine and which may contain enzymes but are not specifically used to produce them should not be considered food enzymes. 
(5) Food enzymes used exclusively in the production of food additives falling within the scope of the Regulation […] on food additives, flavourings falling within the scope of the Regulation […] on flavourings […] and novel foods falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients [3] should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation, since the safety of these foods is already assessed and regulated. However, when these food enzymes are used as such in food, they are covered by this Regulation. 
(6) Food enzymes should be approved and used only if they fulfil the criteria laid down in this Regulation. Food enzymes should be safe when used, there should be a technological need for their use and their use should not mislead the consumer. 
(7) Some food enzymes are permitted for specific uses, such as in fruit juices and certain similar products and certain lactoproteins intended for human consumption and for certain authorised oenological practices and processes. Those food enzymes should be used in accordance with this Regulation and with the specific provisions laid down in the relevant Community legislation. Council Directive 2001/112/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption [4], Council Directive 83/417/EEC of 25 July 1983 on the approximation of the laws of the Member states relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption [5] and Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [6] should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(8) Food enzymes the use of which is permitted within the Community should appear in a Community list that should clearly describe the enzymes, specify any conditions governing their use and be supplemented by specifications, in particular on their origin and purity criteria. Where the food enzyme contains or consists of a genetically modified organism (“GMO”) within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC [7], the unique identifier assigned to the GMO under that Regulation should also be included in the specifications. 
(9) With a view to harmonisation, the risk assessment of food enzymes and their inclusion in the Community list should be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No […] of the European Parliament and of the Council of […] establishing a common authorisation procedure for the food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings [8]. 
(10) Under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [9], the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) is to be consulted on matters likely to affect public health. 
(11) A food enzyme which falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed [10] should be authorised in accordance with that Regulation, prior to its approval under this Regulation. 
(12) A food enzyme already included in the Community list under this Regulation and prepared by production methods or from starting materials significantly different from those covered by the Authority’s risk assessment, or different from those covered by the authorisation and the specifications under this Regulation should be submitted to the Authority for an evaluation with emphasis on the specifications. Significantly different production methods or starting materials could mean a change in the production method from extraction from plants to production by fermentation using a micro-organism or genetic modification of the original micro-organism. 
(13) Since many food enzymes are already on the Community market, provision should be made to ensure that the switchover to a Community list of food enzymes takes place smoothly and does not disturb the existing food enzyme market. Sufficient time should be allowed for applicants to make available the information necessary for the risk assessment of these products. An initial two-year period should therefore be allowed following the date of application of the implementing measures to be laid down in accordance with Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No […] [establishing a common authorisation procedure for the food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings], in order to give applicants sufficient time to submit the information on existing enzymes which may be included in the Community list to be drawn up under this Regulation. It should also be possible to submit applications for the authorisation of new enzymes during the initial two-year period. The Authority should evaluate without delay all applications for food enzymes for which sufficient information has been submitted during that period. 
(14) In order to ensure fair and equal conditions for all applicants, the Community list should be drawn up in a single step. That list should be established after the risk assessment of all food enzymes for which sufficient information has been submitted during the initial two-year period has been completed. 
(15) A significant number of applications is expected to be submitted during the initial two-year period. A lengthy period may therefore be needed before the risk assessment of these has been completed and the Community list is drawn up. In order to ensure equal access to the market for new food enzymes after the initial two-year period, a transitional period should be provided for during which food enzymes and food using food enzymes may be placed on the market and used, in accordance with the existing national rules in the Member States, until the Community list has been drawn up. 
(16) The food enzymes E 1103 Invertase and E 1105 Lysozyme, that have been authorised as food additives under Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners [11], and the conditions governing their use should be carried over from Directive 95/2/EC to the Community list when it is drawn up by this Regulation. In addition, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 authorises the use of urease, beta-glucanase and lysozyme in wine subject to the conditions laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 of 24 July 2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes [12]. Those substances are food enzymes and they should fall within the scope of this Regulation. They should therefore be also added to the Community list when it is drawn up for their use in wine in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000. 
(17) Food enzymes remain subject to the general labelling obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 as applicable. In addition, specific labelling provisions for food enzymes sold as such to the manufacturer or to the consumer should be laid down in this Regulation. 
(18) Food enzymes are covered by the definition of food in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and are therefore, when used in food, required to be indicated as ingredients in the labelling of the food in compliance with Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs [13]. Food enzymes should be designated by their technological function in food, followed by the specific name of the food enzyme. However, provision should be made for a derogation from the provisions on labelling in cases where the enzyme performs no technological function in the final product but is present in the foodstuff only as a result of carry-over from one or more of the ingredients of the foodstuff or where it is used as a processing aid. Directive 2000/13/EC should be amended accordingly. 
(19) Food enzymes should be kept under continuous observation and should be re-evaluated whenever necessary in the light of changing conditions governing their use and new scientific information. 
(20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [14]. 
(21) In order to develop and update Community legislation on food enzymes in a proportionate and effective way, it is necessary to collect data, share information and coordinate work between Member States. For that purpose, it may be useful to undertake studies to address specific issues with a view to facilitating the decision-making process. It is appropriate that the Community may finance such studies as part of its budgetary procedure. The financing of such measures is covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules [15] and consequently the legal basis for the financing of the above measures will be Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. 
(22) Member States are to carry out official controls in order to enforce compliance with this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. 
(23) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to lay down Community rules on food enzymes cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of market unity and high level of consumer protection be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term 
The proposed Regulation on Food enzymes aims at harmonising the use of food enzymes within the EU. The Regulation provides, among other, for the establishment of a Community list of authorised food enzymes after the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated them for their safety. About 200 food enzymes are already on the market in the Community subject to national laws of the Member States. Their safety assessment and transfer to the Community list should be smooth and fair for all producers. Therefore transition periods are provided for, until the initial establishment of the Community list. During this period the Commission should maintain and make available to the public a database of food enzymes for which a valid application has been submitted with information about the status of their assessment. 
Moreover in the future, data on usage of food enzymes may be needed in some cases for risk management decisions. 
In order to assure proportionality of the implementing measures that will be taken in the framework of the proposed regulation and to meet the objectives of Regulation (EC) 882/2004 on official feed and food control, the following instruments are therefore needed: 
• An appropriate database for gathering and storing all information relating to Community legislation on food enzymes, 
• undertaking of studies necessary for the preparation and development of legislation on food enzymes, 
• undertaking of studies necessary to harmonise procedures, decision-making criteria and data requirements, to facilitate work sharing between Member States and to develop guidance in these areas. 
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
The data and information obtained will help in assuring the best protection of the health of the consumer while allowing industry to continue to develop and use food enzymes. 
In the harmonised market this can only be achieved via a coordinated approach allowing exchange of comparable information between Member States. 
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework 
Objective 1: Create and maintain a database and undertake related studies in 
collaboration with external organisations to be selected via the 
appropriate procedures. 
Objective 2: Assure that the use of food enzymes does not lead to 
unacceptable risks for the consumer and at the same time does 
not impose unnecessary burden to the industry. 
Objective 3: Effective and transparent handling of the food enzymes 
applications before the establishment of the Community 
positive list, via a centralised database containing updated 
information about the status of the applications and safety 
assessments. 
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative) 
X Centralised Management 
X directly by the Commission 
indirectly by delegation to: 
executive Agencies 
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation 
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission 
Shared or decentralised management 
with Member states 
with Third countries 
Joint management with international organisations (please specify) 
Relevant comments: 
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
6.1. Monitoring system 
The content of the database and the conclusions of the results of the studies can be monitored via their usability for proposing good implementing measures. A basic tool will be the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health. 
6.2. Evaluation 
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation 
The anticipated expenditure is not significant and therefore data for an ex ante evaluation are not currently available. 
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) 
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation 
Ongoing in relation to the need to propose implementing measures. 
7. Anti-fraud measures
