COMMISSION DECISION 
of 12 November 1986 
amending Decision 81/675/EEC establishing that particular sealing systems are 'non-reusable systems' within the meaning of, inter-alia, Council Directives 66/401/EEC and 69/208/EEC 
(86/563/EEC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed (1), as last amended by Directive 86/155/EEC (2), and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 69/208/EEC of 30 June 1969 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants (3), as last amended by Directive 86/155/EEC, and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Decision 81/675/EEC (4), established that partiular sealing systems were 'non-reusable systems' within the meaning of certain Council Directives on the market of seed and propagating material, including Directive 66/401/EEC and Directive 69/208/EEC; 
Whereas it was understood at the time that the use of one of the systems concerned, which was then specified exclusively for cereal seed, should show a tendency to decrease in favour of new systems and should be reconsidered after five years; 
Whereas experience has shown that the said system provides a sufficient guarantee of effectiveness and should furthermore also be considered to be a 'non-reusable system' within the meaning of Directive 66/401/EEC and Directive 69/208/EEC for the seed of certain species of fodder plants and oil and fibre plants; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
