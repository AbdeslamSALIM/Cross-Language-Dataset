ANNEX 
TECHNICAL FORMAT 
1. The form of the data 
The data is sent as a set of records of which a large part describes the characteristics of the data (country, year, economic activity, etc.). The data itself is a number which can be linked to flags and explanatory footnotes used for example to describe aggregations of NACE codes. Confidential data should be sent with the true value being recorded in the value field and a flag indicating the nature of the confidential data being added to the record. 
In order to be precise about the nature of the data, it is necessary to distinguish the following special cases: 
- data equal to zero (coded "0"): real values of zero only, 
- confidential data (coded "x"): indicates data which the Member State does not transmit to Eurostat because the data is confidential, 
- missing data (coded "m"): this is data which is currently missing but the Member State intends to supply when available, 
- data not available: this is data which is not collected in a Member State. In this case the corresponding record is not sent. 
By default, if an entire dimension (a variable, a NUTS code, a NACE code, etc.) is not collected then the corresponding records will not exist except for those which are missing because they form part of a regrouping of NACE codes. This is why it is important to distinguish data which is really missing by supplying a record (one per missing item) in which the data value is coded as "m", and data which is really equal to zero by supplying the corresponding records in which the data value is set to 0. 
2. Record structure 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
This format may be converted into a fixed format by using the maximum length of each field and right justifying the contents of each field preceded by blanks. 
3. Description of the fields 
3.1. Series 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.2. Year 
3.3. Territorial unit 
This code corresponds to the country for national series 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.4. Economic activity 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.5. Measurement 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.6. Unit 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.7. Variable 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.8. Type of insurance enterprise or insurance business 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.9. Size classes / Residence of parent enterprise 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.10. Breakdown of products 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.11. Legal status / Geographical breakdown 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.12. Data value 
Monetary data is expressed in millions of national currency units except for: 
- Italy: data is given in milliards of national currency units. 
In order to be precise about the nature of the data, it is necessary to distinguish the following cases: 
- data equal to zero (coded "0"): real values of zero only, 
- confidential data (coded "x"): indicates data which the Member State does not transmit to Eurostat because the data is confidential. A flag should also be used to indicate that the data is missing due to confidentiality (see 3.14 below), 
- missing data (coded "m"): this is data which is currently missing but the Member State intends to supply when available, 
- data not available: this is data which is not collected in a Member State. In this case the corresponding record is not sent. 
By default, if an entire dimension (a variable, a NUTS code, a NACE code, etc.) is not collected then the corresponding records will not exist except for those which are missing because they form part of a regrouping of NACE codes. This is why it is important to distinguish data which is really missing by supplying a record (one per missing item) in which the data value is coded as "m". 
3.13. Quality flag 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
"Revised data" refers to data which are sent for a second (or more) time and are corrections of data which has been previously sent. 
"Updated data" concerns data which was not previously available and was coded as missing in the data value field (see 3.12 above) but has since become available. 
The flag indicating "Provisional data" should be used in order to indicate that it is likely that the data being transmitted may be corrected. 
3.14. Confidentiality 
Member States are asked to clearly indicate confidential data using the flags listed below: 
Countries which cannot send confidential data are asked to set the value to "x" (see 3.12 above) and to indicate using a flag that the data is missing due to confidentiality. 
&gt;TABLE&gt; 
3.15. Dominance 
A numeric value less than or equal to 100. This indicates the percentage dominance of one or two enterprises which dominate the data and make it confidential. The value is rounded to the nearest whole number: e.g. 90,3 becomes 90, 94, 50 becomes 95. This field is blank for non-confidential data. This field is only used when the confidentiality flags B or C are used in the previous field. 
3.16. List 
The variables - characteristics - are presented in Regulation (EC) No 410/98 in two different lists: A and B. The first year of reference for which they shall be compiled differs. Three variables are optional.
