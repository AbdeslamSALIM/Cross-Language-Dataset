ANNEX I 
-------------------------------------------------- 
PROTOCOL 1 
concerning the arrangements applicable to imports into the Community of agricultural products originating in Morocco 
Article 1 
1. The products listed in Annex 1A, originating in Morocco, shall be admitted for import into the Community in accordance with the conditions set out below and in the Annex. 
2. Import duties shall be either eliminated or reduced by the percentage indicated in respect of each product in column (a) of Annex 1A. 
Where the Common Customs Tariff provides for the application of ad valorem customs duties and a specific customs duty in respect of certain products marked by an asterisk in column (a) or (c), the rates of reduction shown in column (a) and in column (c), as referred to in paragraph 3, shall apply only to the ad valorem customs duty. 
3. The customs duties shall be eliminated in respect of certain products within the limits of the tariff quotas shown against them in column (b) of Annex 1A. 
The Common Customs Tariff duties in respect of the quantities imported in excess of the quotas shall be reduced at the rates indicated in column (c) of that Annex. 
4. For CN codes 07051900, 07052900, 07061000 and 070690 a reference quantity indicated in column (d) shall be set. Should the volume of imports of these products exceed the reference quantity, the Community, having regard to an annual review of trade flows which it shall carry out, may make these products subject to a Community tariff quota, the volume of which shall be equal to the reference quantity. In such a case, for quantities imported in excess of the quota, the Common Customs Tariff duty shall be applied in full. 
5. For the first year of application of the Agreement, except for tomatoes falling within CN code 07020000, the volumes of the tariff quotas for which the quota period began before the entry into application of this agreement shall be calculated as a pro rata of the basic volumes, taking into account the part of the period which elapsed before this date. 
6. For some of the products listed in Annex 1A and indicated in column (d), the quotas shall be increased from 1 January 2004 to 1 January 2007 on the basis of four equal instalments, each corresponding to 3 % of the quota amounts. 
7. If the Community reduces the most-favoured-nation duties it applies, the phasing-out of tariffs as indicated in columns (a) and (c) shall apply to the said reduced duties. 
Article 2 
1. For fresh or chilled tomatoes falling within CN code 07020000, for each period from 1 October to 31 May, hereinafter called "marketing years", under the following tariff quotas and subject to paragraph 2:

Line B | 15000 | 8000 | 18000 | 28000 | 
(a) ad valorem customs duties shall be eliminated, 
(b) the entry price level from which specific duties will be reduced to zero, hereinafter called the "agreed entry price", shall be EUR 461 per tonne. 
2. When the total quantity of tomatoes originating in Morocco released for free circulation in the Community during a given marketing year does not exceed the sum of the basic monthly quotas and the additional quota applicable for that marketing year, the additional quota for the following marketing year shall be that indicated at line A in paragraph 1 above. Where that condition is not met during a given marketing year, the additional quota for the following year shall be that indicated at line B in paragraph 1 above. However, a maximum tolerance of 1 % shall be accepted for the purpose of assessing whether this condition has been met. 
3. Morocco undertakes to ensure that no more than 30 % of this additional quota is used during any one month. 
4. Drawings on the basic monthly tariff quotas shall be stopped on 15 January for the months from October to December each marketing year and on the second working day after 1 April for the months from January to March. The following working day, the Commission shall determine the unused quantities under the basic monthly quotas concerned, and these shall be transferred to the additional quota for that marketing year. From the above dates, all retroactive applications under one of the basic monthly tariff quotas which has been closed and any unused quantities to be returned to those quotas shall be taken from or placed in the additional tariff quota for the marketing year concerned. 
5. Morocco shall notify the Commission of weekly exports to the Community within a space of time which allows precise and accurate reporting. That space of time must not exceed 15 days. 
Article 3 
For the products listed below, the agreed entry price level from which specific duties will be reduced to zero during the periods indicated shall be those set out below, and the ad valorem customs duties shall be eliminated for the quantities and periods fixed in this Article.

Article 4 
For the products referred to in Articles 2 and 3: 
- if the entry price of a particular consignment is 2 %, 4 %, 6 % or 8 % below the agreed entry price, the specific customs duty under the quota shall be 2 %, 4 %, 6 % or 8 % of the agreed entry price; 
- if the entry price of a particular consignment is below 92 % of the agreed entry price, the specific customs duty bound in the WTO shall apply; 
- these agreed entry prices shall be reduced in the same proportions and at the same pace as the entry prices bound in the WTO. 
Article 5 
1. The aim of the specific arrangements provided for in Articles 2 and 3 of this Protocol shall be to preserve the level of Morocco's traditional exports to the Community and to avoid disturbing Community markets. 
2. In order to ensure that the aim described in the first paragraph and Articles 2 and 3 is fully achieved and to improve market stability and continuity of supply, the two Parties shall hold consultations during the second quarter of each year, or at any time if one of the Parties so requests, no more than three working days after such a request. 
Consultations shall cover trade during the previous marketing year and the outlook for the coming marketing year, in particular the market situation, production forecasts, estimated production and export prices and possible market developments. 
Where necessary, the Parties shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the aim described in the first paragraph of this Article and in Articles 2 and 3 is fully achieved. 
Article 6 
Without prejudice to other provisions of this Agreement, if, given the particular sensitivity of the agricultural markets, imports of products originating in Morocco which are the subject of concessions granted under this Protocol cause serious disturbance to Community markets within the meaning of Article 25 of the Agreement, both Parties shall hold consultations immediately to find an appropriate solution. Pending such solution, the Community may take the measures it deems necessary. 
Article 7 
Wine originating in Morocco bearing a registered designation of origin shall be accompanied by a certificate indicating the origin in accordance with the model in Annex IB to this Protocol or by a V I 1 or V I 2 document annotated in accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2001 on the certificates and analyses required for imports of wine, grape juice and grape must.
