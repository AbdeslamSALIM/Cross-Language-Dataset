ANNEX DECLARATION REFERRED TO IN THE SECOND SUBPARAGRAPH OF ARTICLE 2 
Competence of the European Economic Community as regards the matters covered by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Declaration pursuant to Article 27 (2) of the Convention) 
Article 27 (2) of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances stipulates that, in their instruments of formal confirmation, regional economic integration organizations shall declare the extent of their competence with respect to the matters covered by this Convention. 
The European Economic Community was established by the Treaty of Rome which was signed on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958. This Treaty was amended and supplemented by the Single European Act, which entered into force on 1 July 1987. 
In accordance with the provisions referred to above, the European Economic Community is at present competent for questions of commercial policy relating to the substances frequently used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, questions which are dealt with in Article 12 of the Convention. 
The exercise of the powers which the Member States have transferred to the Communities under the Treaties is, by its nature, subject to continuous development. The Communities therefore reserve the right to make further declarations in accordance with Article 27 (2) of the Convention.
