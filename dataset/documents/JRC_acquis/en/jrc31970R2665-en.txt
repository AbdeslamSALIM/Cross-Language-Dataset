Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 391/68 (3) of 1 April 1968 laid down detailed rules for intervention buying-in in pigmeat; 
Whereas, in order to ensure that the intervention measures are carried out as effectively as possible, the quality of products bought in by the intervention agencies should, as far as possible, remain unchanged, even during a fairly long storage period; 
Whereas Community provisions should therefore be laid down concerning refrigeration and storage temperatures and packing;

Whereas the technical requirements shown in the Annex to that Regulation should be adapted to trade usages so that breasts and unrendered back-fat free of rind may also be bought in; 
Whereas, moreover, the technical requirements shown in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 391/68 should be adapted to the present state of the law;
