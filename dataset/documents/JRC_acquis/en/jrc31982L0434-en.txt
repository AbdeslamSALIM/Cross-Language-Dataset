ANNEX I. IDENTIFICATION OF OXIDIZING AGENTS AND DETERMINATION OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE IN HAIR-CARE PRODUCTS 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The iodometric determination of hydrogen peroxide in cosmetics is only possible in the absence of other oxidizing agents that form iodine from iodides. Consequently, before the iodometric determination of hydrogen peroxide it is necessary to detect and identify any other oxidizing agents present This identification breaks down into two stages ; the first covers the persulphates the bromates and hydrogen peroxide and the second covers barium peroxide.

5.2. Pipette 10 ml of the sample solution (5.1) into a 250-ml conical flask (4.6) and add successively 100 ml of 2N sulphuric acid (3.1), 20 ml of potassium iodide solution (3.5) and three drops of ammonium molybdate solution (3.6). 
5.3. Titrate the iodine formed immediately against 0 71N sodium thiosulphate solution (3.4) and just before the end point is reached add a few millilitres of starch solution as indicator (3.7). Record the consumption of 0 71N sodium thiosulphate (3.4) in millilitres (V). 
5.4. In the manner described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3, carry out a blank determination, replacing the 10 ml of the sample solution by 10 ml of water. Record the consumption of 0 71N sodium thiosulphate in the blank determination (Vo ml). 
6. CALCULATION 
Calculate the hydrogen peroxide content of the product as a percentage by mass (% m/m) with the aid of the following formula: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0050749%quot%%gt% 
7. REPEATABILITY (1)

In addition, apply at points 10 and 11 respectively 2 ¶l of the test solution samples obtained according to Section 5.1. 
Keep the plate under nitrogen (3.8) until the moment when it is chromatographed. 
5.2.2. Development 
Place the plate in a tank previously flushed out with nitrogen (3.8), saturated with one of the four solvents (3.22) and allow to develop at room temperature (20 to 25 °C) in the dark until the solvent front has moved about 15 cm from the baseline.

6.4. Chromatography 6.4.1. Draw two lines, at shown in Figure 1, on the absorbent surface of a thin-layer plate (4.1.3). 
6.4.2. Under a nitrogen atmosphere (4.1.1), apply 1 to 4 ¶l extract (5.1) at base point 1 (Figure 1) which is at 2 cm from the two sides. The quantity of extract depends on the intensity of the spots on the chromatograms 5.2. 
6.4.3. Divide between points 2 and 3 (Figure 1) the oxidation colorants identified or assumed to be identified by 5.2 (distance between points 1 75 cm). Apply 2 ¶l of each of the reference solutions - except DAP of which 6 ¶l must be applied. Conduct the operation under nitrogen (6.4.2). 
6.4.4. Repeat the operation in 6.4.3 at base points 4 and 5 (Figure 1) and keep the plate under nitrogen until the moment it is chromatographed (distance between points 1 75 cm). 
6.4.5. Flush out a chromatographic tank with nitrogen (3.8) and place in it a suitable quantity of developing solvent 3.22.2. Place the plate (6.4.4) in the tank and develop it in the first elution direction (Figure 1) in the dark.

Remove the plate from the tank and evaporate the elution solvent in air. 
6.4.8. Place the plate for 10 minutes in the chromatography tank with iodine vapour (6.3) and interpret the two-way chromatogram using the Rf and colour values of the reference substances chromatographed at the same time (Table II gives a guide to the Rf values and colours). 
Note 
To obtain maximum colouring of the spots leave the chromatogram exposed to the atmosphere for half an hour after developing. 
6.4.9. The presence of the oxidation colorants found in 6.4.8 can be definitively confirmed by repeating the operations described in 6.4.1 to 6.4.8 and adding at base point 1 on top of the amount of extract specified in 6.4.2 1 ¶l of the reference substances identified in 6.4.8. if no other spot is found in comparison with the chromatogram obtained in 6.4.8, the interpretation of chromatogram 6.4.8 is correct.

IV. IDENTIFICATION AND DETERMINATION OF FREE FORMALDEHYDE 
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This method describes the identification and the determination of free formaldehyde. It is applicable to all cosmetic products and comprises three parts: 1.1. Identification 
1.2. Determination by pentane-2,4-dione colorimetry 
This method is inadequate when the formaldehyde is combined or polymerized, as in the case of formaldehyde donors. If the result exceeds the maximum permitted concentration, the following method must be used. 
1.3. Determination with bisulphite 
With this method, formaldehyde in most combined or polymeric compounds is not taken into account. However, certain unstable combinations (hexamethylene tetramine, for example) are determined. Moreover, the alkalinity measurement is difficult in the presence of a buffer solution. 
2. DEFINITION 
The free formaldehyde content of the sample determined according to this method is expressed as percentage by mass. 
3. PRINCIPLE 3.1. Part I - Identification 
Formaldehyde in a sulphuric acid medium turns Schiff's reagent pink or mauve. 
3.2. Part II - Determination by pentane-2,4-dione 
Formaldehyde reacts with pentane-2,4-dione in the presence of ammonium acetate to form 3,5-diacetyl-1,4-dihydrolutidine. This is extracted with butan-1-ol and the absorbance of the extract is measured at 410 nm. (1) See Norm ISO 5725. 
3.3. Part III - Determination with bisulphite 
Formaldehyde reacts with the sulphite in an acid medium at 0 °C to form an addition compound. The excess protons are titrated with sodium hydroxide. The protons consumed form the basis of the calculation for determining the quantity of formaldehyde. A blank test without sulphite enables the alkalinity or acidity of the medium to be measured. 
4. REAGENTS 
All the reagents should be of analytical purity. 4.1. Glacial acetic acid 
4.2. Anhydrous ammonium acetate 
4.3. Butan-1-ol
