COMMISSION DIRECTIVE of 14 April 1972 on determining the characteristics and minimum conditions for inspecting vine varieties (72/169/EEC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; 
Having regard to the Council Directive of 9 April 1968 1 on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine, as amended by the Directive of 22 March 1971, 2 and in particular Article 5d (2) thereof; 
Whereas in accordance with the provisions of the abovementioned Directive, Member States are obliged to compile a catalogue of the varieties accepted for certification and inspection of standard propagation material in their territory; 
Whereas the acceptance of varieties is subject to Community conditions which must be enforced by means of official inspections and in particular by crop inspections; 
Whereas the inspections must cover a sufficient number of characteristics to enable the varieties to be described; 
Whereas the minimum characteristics which have to undergo inspection should be determined at Community level; 
Whereas, moreover, the minimum conditions for carrying out the inspections must be laid down: 
Whereas these characteristics and minimum conditions for inspection should be laid down in the light of the present state of scientific and technical knowledge; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the Opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry; 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Member States shall provide that official inspections carried out for the acceptance of vine varieties shall cover at least the characteristics listed in Annex I. 
They shall ensure that the minimum conditions listed in Annex II are fulfilled at the time of the inspections. 
Article 2 
Member States shall bring into force not later than 1 July 1972 the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 
Article 3
