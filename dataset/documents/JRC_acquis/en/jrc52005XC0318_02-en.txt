Infringement 2003/4497 Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201D; multiple complaint 
(2005/C 66/03) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
Following the decision on infringement No 2003/4497 (multiple complaint) taken at the A1/2004 meeting on infringements, the Commission sent Italy a reasoned opinion regarding its incorrect application of Directives 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management and 99/30/EC relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air. In particular, the Commission considered that, by not correctly measuring ambient concentrations of PM10 particles in Civitavecchia, Rome, and consequently failing to inform the public of these concentrations regularly, Italy had failed to fulfil its obligations under Directives 96/62/EC and 99/30/EC.
