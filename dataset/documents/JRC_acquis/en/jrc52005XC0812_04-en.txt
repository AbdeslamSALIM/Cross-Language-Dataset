Notice to importers 
Imports of garlic into the Community 
(2005/C 197/05) 
The European Commission informs Community operators that there is reasonable doubt as to the origin of garlic of tariff heading CN 07032000, which is released for free circulation into the Community in order to benefit: 
- either from the GATT tariff quota open by Council Decision 2001/404/EC [1], 
- or from preferential tariff measures, contained in agreements which the Community has concluded with or arrangements it has adopted unilaterally in respect of certain countries or group of countries. 
From various investigations, it results that important quantities of garlic of Chinese origin are declared with another origin and then benefit from the tariff measures mentioned above, beyond the annual quota of 13200 tonnes allocated to China. 
Community operators declaring and/or presenting documentary evidence of origin for garlic of tariff heading CN 07032000 are therefore advised to take all the necessary precautions, since the release of the goods in question for free circulation may give rise to a customs debt and lead to fraud against the Community's financial interests. 
[1] Decision 2001/404/EC of 28 May 2001 on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and Argentina pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 for the modification of concessions with respect to garlic provided for in Schedule CXL annexed to GATT (OJ L 142, 29.5.2001, p. 7) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 565/2002 of 2 April 2002 establishing the method for managing tariff quotas and introducing a system of certificates of origin for garlic imported from third countries (OJ L 86, 3.4.2002, p. 11).
