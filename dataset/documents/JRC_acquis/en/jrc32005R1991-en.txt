THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1166/2005 [2] was amended in order to extend the closing date for tenders until 28 June 2006. 
(2) In the context of this extension, however, the weeks from 26 October 2005 when no invitation to tender will be made were not specified. Tenders could thus be lodged in good faith by traders during those weeks, although no Management Committee meetings are scheduled. 
(3) It is necessary, therefore, to exclude the weeks up to 28 June 2006 during which no invitation to tender will be made. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1166/2005 should be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
