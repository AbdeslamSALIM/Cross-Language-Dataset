Parties to the main proceedings

Defendant: Ministero dell'Economia e delle Finanze 
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Corte Suprema di Cassazione — Interpretation of Article 4 of Council Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital (OJ 1969 L 249, p. 25), as amended by Council Directive 85/303/EEC of 10 June 1985 (OJ 1985 L 156, p. 23) — Indirect taxes on contributions of capital to capital companies — Merger of two companies where one holds all the shares in the other 
Operative part of the judgment 
In circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, Council Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital, as amended by Council Directives 73/80/EEC of 9 April 1973 fixing common rates of capital duty and 85/303/EEC of 10 June 1985, precludes the charging of a proportional registration duty of 1 % of the value of the transaction in the case of a 'reverse' merger, namely a merger by means of acquisition where all of the shares in the acquiring company are held by the company acquired.
