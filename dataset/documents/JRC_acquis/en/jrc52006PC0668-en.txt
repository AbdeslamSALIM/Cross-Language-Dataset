EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
Grounds for and objectives of the proposal As is the case each year, under Article 3 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, the Council, acting on a Commission proposal based on the Eurostat report, must take a decision before the end of the year adjusting remuneration and pensions, with effect from 1 July. Following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union on 1 January 2007, it is necessary to fix the correction coefficients, applying to the remuneration of officials and other servants of the European Communities in these new Member States. | 
General context In accordance with Article 3 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, the adjustment to remuneration and pensions derives directly from changes in the purchasing power of salaries in national civil services (specific indicator), changes in the cost of living in Brussels (International Index) and economic parities determined by Eurostat. The specific indicator measures changes in the net remuneration, exclusive of inflation, of national civil servants in Member States' central governments. Eurostat has calculated this indicator on the basis of the information supplied by the eight Member States referred to in Article 1(4) of Annex XI. The Brussels International Index measures changes in the cost of living in Brussels for European Community officials. Eurostat has drawn up this index on the basis of the information provided by the Belgian authorities. The economic parities for remuneration establish the purchasing power equivalence of the remuneration paid in Brussels, as the reference city, with that paid in the other places of employment. Eurostat has calculated those parities in agreement with the national statistical bodies. The economic parities for pensions establish the purchasing power equivalence of the pension paid in Belgium, as the reference country, with that paid in the other countries of residence. Eurostat has calculated those parities in agreement with the national statistical bodies. Following enlargement on 1 January 2007, the correction coefficient applicable to remuneration in the new Member States will be calculated in accordance with Annex XI to the Staff Regulations. Article 27(4) of the Act of Accession, however, allows the period of application of Annex X to the Staff Regulations to be extended by up to 19 months after accession in the case of officials who remain in service in the new Member States. Consequently, the correction coefficients will apply to officials and other servants who are assigned to the new Member States from 1 January 2007. |

Legal elements of the proposal | 
Summary of the proposed action In accordance with Article 1 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has drawn up a report on changes in the cost of living in Brussels, changes in the purchasing power of remuneration in national civil services, and the economic parities from which the weightings derive. 3.1. ADJUSTMENT TO REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS IN BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG The average change in the purchasing power of national civil servants' remuneration in the reference period measured by the specific indicator is equal to 0,2%. The change in the cost of living in Brussels in the reference period measured by the Brussels International Index calculated by Eurostat is equal to 2,1%. According to Article 3(2) of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, the amount of the adjustment is obtained by multiplying together the specific indicator and Brussels International Index calculated by Eurostat. The proposed adjustment to remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg is therefore 2,3%. Under Article 3(5) of Annex XI, no weighting is applicable in Belgium and Luxembourg. 3.2. ADJUSTMENT TO REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS OUTSIDE BELGIUM AND LUXEMBOURG Outside Belgium and Luxembourg the adjustment to remuneration and pensions is obtained by multiplying the adjustment in Belgium and Luxembourg by the change in weightings and in the exchange rate. The weightings applicable to remuneration, pensions and transfers of part of the remuneration that are set out in the Regulation have been calculated as follows: - Weightings for OFFICIALS outside Belgium and Luxembourg: Eurostat has calculated, in agreement with the national statistical bodies, the economic parities which establish the purchasing power equivalence of the remuneration paid in Brussels with that paid in the other places of employment at 1 July. The weightings applicable to the remuneration of officials and other servants employed in the Member States other than Belgium and Luxembourg are determined by the ratios between these economic parities and the exchange rates applicable at 1 July. - Weightings for PENSIONS outside Belgium and Luxembourg and weightings for TRANSFERS: Eurostat has calculated, in agreement with national statistical bodies, the economic parities which establish the purchasing power equivalence of the pension paid in Brussels with that paid in the other countries of residence at 1 July. The weightings calculated for the pensions of individuals living outside Belgium and Luxembourg in the various countries are determined by the ratios between these economic parities and the exchange rates applicable at 1 July. Under Article 17 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, these weightings are directly applicable to transfers made by officials and other servants. Under Article 20 of Annex XIII to the Staff Regulations, those weightings apply only to the part of the pension corresponding to pension rights acquired before 1 May 2004. Under Article 20(2) of Annex XIII, the weightings applicable to pensions are obtained by taking a weighted average of the coefficients applicable to officials and the coefficients calculated for pensions. - Date on which the weightings enter into effect: These weightings take effect on 1 July for all places except those with a high cost-of-living increase, for which the weighting enters into effect on 16 May if the increase in the cost of living is greater than 6.3%, or 1 May if it is greater than 12.6%. Changes in the cost of living outside Belgium and Luxembourg are measured by the change in the implicit indices. These indices are calculated by multiplying the Brussels International Index by the change in the economic parity. The date of entry into force of this adjustment is earlier for the places referred to in the Regulation. | 
Legal basis The Staff Regulations and, in particular, Annex XI thereto constitute the legal basis. | 
Subsidiarity principle The proposal concerns an area that falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. The principle of subsidiarity does not therefore apply. | 
Proportionality principle The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality for the following reasons: | 
- Annex XI to the Staff Regulations provides for a Council regulation. | 
- The financial burden results directly from the application of the adjustment method provided for in the Staff Regulations. | 
Choice of instruments | 
Proposed instrument: regulation. | 
Other instruments would have been inappropriate for the following reasons: - Annex XI to the Staff Regulations provides for a Council regulation. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS | 
The impact on administrative expenditure and on revenue of the adjustment to remuneration and pensions is detailed in the financial statement annexed hereto. |
