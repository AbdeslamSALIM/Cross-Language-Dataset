Form of order sought

Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicants, who are Ukrainian producers of seamless tubes and pipes, seek the annulment of Council Regulation No 954/2006 [1] imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes originating in among others Ukraine. 
In support of their application, the applicants invoke that the Council: 
- determined the normal value on the basis of a manifest error of assessment and contrary to the principle of non-discrimination by taking into account products that were not manufactured by the applicants; 
- made a material injury determination in breach of Article 3 of the Basic Regulation [2] given that the Community producers did not fully cooperate; 
- acted in breach of Article 5(4) of the Basic Regulation by not terminating the proceeding in light of the non-cooperation by the Community industry; 
- committed a manifest error of assessment under Article 2(10) of the Basic Regulation by deducting an assumed commission from the export price of the sales company Sepco; 
- breached the principle of non-discrimination in considering and ultimately rejecting an offer of undertaking by the applicants; and 
- breached the rights of defence of the applicants and Article 253 EC by not adequately stating reasons for its decision.
