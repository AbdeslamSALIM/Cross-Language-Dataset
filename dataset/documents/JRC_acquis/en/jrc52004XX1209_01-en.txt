Final report of the hearing officer in case COMP/38.284/D2 (AIR FRANCE/ALITALIA) 
(pursuant to Article 15 of Commission Decision 2001/462/EC, ECSC of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of hearing officers in certain competition proceedings Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201D; OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21) 
(2004/C 305/04) 
The draft decision in the abovementioned case gives rise to the following observations: 
On 13 November 2001, Air France and Alitalia, notified various agreements to the Commission seeking negative clearance under Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87 or alternatively exemption under Article 5 of the same Regulation. 
A summary of the application was published on 8 May 2002 in the Official Journal of the European Communities inviting third parties and the Member States to submit their comments to the Commission within 30 days in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87. 
On 1 July 2002, the Commission notified the parties pursuant to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87 that there were serious doubts as to the applicability of Articles 81(3) of the Treaty to the notified agreements. 
After discussions with the Commission services, the parties proposed commitments that were published on 9 December 2003 pursuant to Article 16(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87, inviting all interested third parties to submit their observations. 
Several airlines and the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading made comments on the proposed remedies and the parties accepted to improve their commitments, with the result that the competition concerns of the Commission services have been removed. 
I therefore conclude that the rights to be heard have been respected in the present case. 
Brussels, 18 March 2004.
