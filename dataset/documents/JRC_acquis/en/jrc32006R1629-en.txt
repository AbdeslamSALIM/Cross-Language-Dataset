Commission Regulation (EC) No 1629/2006 
of 31 October 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1010/2006 on certain exceptional market support measures in the eggs and poultry sector in certain Member States 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs [1], and in particular point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 14(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat [2], and in particular point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 14(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 93/119/EC [3] on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing defines the concepts of %quot%slaughter%quot% and %quot%killing%quot%. 
(2) Articles 4 and 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1010/2006 [4] do not stipulate that the %quot%killing%quot% of animals must be considered to be an exceptional market support measure in the same way as slaughter. 
(3) Given that the Member States did not have time to take the concept of %quot%killing%quot% into account in their national legislation and in view of the recent amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1010/2006, some Member States might have problems meeting the deadline laid down in Article 10 of that Regulation for making payments to the beneficiaries of exceptional market support measures, i.e. 31 December 2006. The payment deadline should therefore be extended by several months. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1010/2006 should therefore be amended. 
(5) Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 providing for the adoption of the measures concerned have been in force since 11 May 2006. This Regulation should therefore also apply from that date. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
