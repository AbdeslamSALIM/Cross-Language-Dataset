2006/668/EC: Commission Decision of 29 September 2006 concerning a financial contribution from the Community towards a baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs to be carried out in the Member States (notified under document number C(2006) 4306) 
Commission Decision 
of 29 September 2006 
concerning a financial contribution from the Community towards a baseline survey on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs to be carried out in the Member States 
(notified under document number C(2006) 4306) 
(2006/668/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field [1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Pursuant to Decision 90/424/EEC the Community is to undertake or assist the Member States in undertaking the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training. 
(2) Under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of Salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents [2], a Community target is to be established for reducing the prevalence of Salmonella in populations of herds of slaughter pigs by the end of 2007. 
(3) The Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted an opinion on the request from the Commission related to "Risk assessment and mitigation options of Salmonella in pig production", during its meeting of 16 March 2006. The opinion proposes technical specifications for a baseline study on the prevalence of Salmonella in fattening pigs in the EU. 
(4) In order to set the Community target, comparable data on the prevalence of Salmonella in populations of slaughter pigs in the Member States needs to be available. Such information is not at hand and a special survey should therefore be carried out to monitor the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs over a suitable period in order to take account of possible seasonal variations. 
(5) The EFSA opinion recommends slaughterhouse sampling by taking ileocaecal lymph nodes to reflect the Salmonella status of the pig sent to slaughter. Such sampling should therefore be used as a tool to monitor the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs. It is opportune to use this baseline survey also to evaluate the effect of contamination of the pigs during transport and lairage, and contamination of the carcase during the slaughter process by taking carcase swabs. In addition, serological methods have been developed to assess the Salmonella status of a pig and may be used for monitoring Salmonella in pigs within the frame of national control programmes to be implemented in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003. 
(6) A number of Member States volunteered to carry out the additional analyses by taking carcase swabs or carrying out serology on meat juice. 
(7) The survey is to provide technical information necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation. Given the importance of collecting comparable data on the prevalence of Salmonella in slaughter pigs in the Member States, they should be granted a Community financial contribution for implementing the specific requirements of the survey. It is appropriate to reimburse 100 % of the costs incurred on the laboratory testing, subject to a ceiling. All other costs such as sampling, travel, administration, etc should not be eligible for any Community financial contribution. 
(8) A financial contribution from the Community should be granted provided that the survey is carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of Community law and subject to compliance with certain other conditions. 
(9) A financial contribution from the Community should be granted in so far as the actions provided for are effectively carried out and provided that the authorities furnish all the necessary information within the time limits provided for. 
(10) There is a need to clarify the rate to be used for the conversion of payment applications submitted in national currencies as defined in Article 1(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro [3]. 
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

ANNEX I 
Technical specifications in accordance with Article 2 
1. Sampling frame 
A minimum number of pigs, kept during at least the preceding three months in the Member State, shall be ad random sampled in accordance with Table 1. 
Table 1 
Minimum sample size 
Number of pigs present in the population | Minimum sample size [1] | 
%gt% 20000000 | 2400 | 
10 to 20000000 | 1067 | 
2 to 10000000 | 600 | 
%lt% 2000000 | 384 | 
Member States shall take a 10 % extra number of samples, to be analyzed in case some samples would be excluded from the study for various reasons. 
Samplings shall be stratified by month to ensure to cover the different seasons. 
Sampling shall be stratified by slaughterhouses that participate and proportional to slaughterhouse capacity. Each Member State shall rank all slaughterhouses according to their fattening pigs throughput in the previous year. Thus, each Member State shall identify those plants that accounted for at least 80 % of all slaughtered fattening pigs. 
The total number of pigs and carcases to be sampled in each of the slaughterhouses included in the study shall be estimated by multiplying the sample size (e.g. 2400) by the proportion of fattening pigs processed in the previous year. For example, if one slaughterhouse accounted for 25 % of fattening pigs slaughtered in the selected slaughterhouses (those representing at least 80 % of all fattening pigs slaughtered in the Member State), then (2400 × 0,25) 600 pigs shall be sampled. These shall be evenly divided so that 50 pigs were sampled in every month, for 12 months. A further example is shown in Table 2. 
Naturally, if a slaughterhouse is no longer in production, if a new facility has been opened or there is predicted to be a significant change in plant throughput during the survey, then the estimated throughput shall be adjusted accordingly. 
Table 2 
Weighing of slaughterhouses for the purpose of allocating the number of fattening pigs to be sampled from each slaughterhouse; calculation of sampled animals per slaughterhouse 
Slaughterhouse ID | Number of fattening pigs processed previous year | Percent of total slaughter included in the study | Number of samples per slaughterhouse | Samples per month (/12) | 
AXD | 88000 | 17,6 | 0,176 × 2400 = 422,4 | 422,4:12 = 36 | 
SVH | 25000 | 5,0 | | | 
TPB | 75000 | 15,0 | | | 
MLG | 100000 | 20,0 | | | 
GHT | 212000 | 42,4 | | | 
Total | 500000 [2] | 100,0 | | | 
For each slaughterhouse each month, a number between 1 and 31 shall be selected at random. If the randomly selected number is a slaughtering day, for that month, then that day is selected for sampling. If not, then a new number is selected randomly. This process is performed once a month and repeated so many times as there are samples to be collected at the slaughterhouse. For example, in the slaughterhouse AXD the process shall be repeated at least 36 times to select at least 36 working days randomly. Naturally, it might be more than one carcase to be sampled on the same day. 
As the number of animals slaughtered on a specific day may vary enormously, the random selection of the individual animal shall take place at the slaughterhouse at the day randomly selected for sampling. The given day, the total number of animals is known, and the personnel of the slaughterhouse shall then randomly select a carcase or carcases using the randomisation sheet which has been provided to them and which has been generated using a maximum that exceeds the highest possible number of fattening pigs slaughtered on any given day in any slaughterhouse in the Member State. 
A randomisation table may then look as shown in Table 3. 
Table 3 
Randomisation table 
Slaughterhouse | Day of the month | Identity of carcase [3] | 
AXD | 19 | 5 | 
4 | 2 | 
12 | 124 | 
12 | 2 | 
8 | 59 | 
The following animals shall be excluded from the baseline study: 
- animals with a live weight of less than 50 kg or more than 170 kg, 
- animals that have undergone emergency slaughter, 
- any carcase that is totally condemned. 
2. Samples 
2.1. Sampling in general 
The following samples shall be collected: 
- the aggregate of ileocaecal lymph nodes or at least five individual ileocaecal lymph nodes of all selected pigs. If possible, at least 25 grams of lymph nodes without fat or connective tissues shall be collected, 
- a sponge swabbed at four sites in accordance with paragraph 2(3), per carcase, from a total of at least 384 pigs, randomly selected from the selected pigs. The sponge sampling method shall be used in accordance with the most recent edition of standard ISO 17604. This sampling shall be carried out in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Ireland, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Poland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom, 
- a muscle sample for serology on meat juice or blood (if equivalent to the method on meat juice) from all selected pigs. Sufficient neck or diaphragm muscle shall be taken to yield enough meat juice to allow a portion to be frozen and stored for later comparative studies. This sampling shall be carried out in Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Cyprus, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
Records shall be kept at the slaughterhouse on the muscle which is sampled, time and date of sampling of each sample and the time and date and name of the courier that takes delivery of the samples. 
2.2. Details on sampling of ileocaecal lymph nodes 
The mesenterium between the caecum and the part of the ileum that is closest to the caecum shall be torn and the ileocaecal lymph nodes are presented at the surface of the torn-open area. Without a knife, but with gloved fingers, the lymph nodes shall be bluntly "harvested" from such opened mesenterium if individual lymph nodes are collected. The lymph nodes or the aggregate shall be placed in a plastic bag which is marked with date, time, slaughterhouse identification and sample identification code. 
2.3. Details on carcase sampling by surface swabs-sampling 
Sampling of the carcase shall be performed after evisceration and before chilling. A surface of about 100 cm2 per site shall be swabbed using one single abrasive sponge for all the following sites as indicated and numbered below in accordance with Annex A of standard ISO 17604: 
- hind limb, medial (9), 
- abdomen, lateral (belly, 3), 
- mid-dorsal region (mid-back, 4), 
- jowl (7). 
Two sites shall be swabbed with one side of the sponge, which shall then be turned over for the remaining two sites, and a scrubbing action shall be used. Enough pressure shall be used to push the lower part of the carcase slightly (2 to 5 mm) away from the sampler. The sponge shall be wiped over each sampling site for a total of approximately 10 times in the vertical and 10 times in the horizontal direction. If templates are used, precautions shall be taken to avoid cross-contamination between carcases. 
The sample shall be kept at max. 7 °C during storage and transportation. The plastic bag is marked with the date, time, slaughterhouse identification and sample identification code. 
3. Transport 
Samples shall be sent within 36 hours by fast mail or courier and shall reach the laboratory no later than 72 hours after sampling. Samples arriving later than within 72 hours after sampling shall be discarded unless analysis is initiated within 96 hours after sampling and the cold chain was not interrupted. 
4. Analysis of samples 
Analysis and serotyping shall take place at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL). In case that the NRL does not have the capacity to perform all analyses or if it is not the laboratory that performs detection routinely, the competent authorities may decide to designate a limited number of other laboratories involved in official control of Salmonella to perform the analyses. These laboratories should have proven experience of using the required detection method and have a quality assurance system complying with ISO standard 17025 and be submitted to the supervision of the NRL. 
At the laboratory, samples shall be kept refrigerated until bacteriological examination, which shall be carried out within 24 hours after receipt and so that analysis is initiated no later than 96 hours after the sample was collected. 
The muscle sample for serology shall be kept frozen until analysis, which shall be carried out immediately after thawing. 
4.1. Sample preparation for bacteriology 
Lymph nodes shall be surface de-contaminated before analysis by dipping into absolute alcohol and drying by air. 
All lymph nodes shall be pooled and closed in a plastic bag and banged with a hammer or so on the plastic bag smashing the lymph nodes. 
The homogenised lymph nodes shall be weighed and placed in a sterile container with pre-warmed buffered peptone water (BPW) in dilution 1:10. Containers shall be incubated for a total of (18 ± 2) hours at (37 ± 1) °C. 
Regarding swabs sample, at the laboratory, 100 ml of BPW shall be added for pre-enrichment. The sample shall be incubated at 37 °C overnight and examined for Salmonella using the modified semi-solid Rappaport-Vassiladis medium (MRSV) method (draft Annex D of the ISO 6579:2002(E). 
4.2. Detection method for bacteriology 
The method recommended by the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for Salmonella in Bilthoven, the Netherlands, shall be used. This method is described in the current version of draft Annex D of ISO 6579:2002: "Detection of Salmonella spp. in animal faeces and in samples of the primary production stage." In this method, MSRV shall be used as the single selective enrichment medium. 
4.3. Serotyping 
All strains isolated and confirmed as Salmonella spp. shall be serotyped according to the Kaufmann-White scheme. 
For quality assurance, 16 typable strains and 16 non-typable isolates shall be sent to the CRL. If less strains have been isolated, all shall be sent. 
4.4. Phage typing 
In case isolates of Salmonella serovar typhimurium and Salmonella serovar enteritidis are phage typed (optional), the methods described by WHO reference centre for phage typing of Salmonella of the Health Protection Agency (HPA), Colindale, United Kingdom, shall be used. 
4.5. Testing of anti-microbial susceptibility 
In case of testing for anti-microbial susceptibility (optional), a validated and controlled method for testing shall be used, such as those recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, since 1 January 2005: "Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute" — CLSI). 
Both agar diffusion and broth dilution methods are acceptable. Results shall be reported both as quantitative data (MIC for dilution methods and inhibition zone diameter for diffusion methods) and as qualitative data (proportion resistant isolates). Qualitative data shall be based on interpretation according to epidemiological cut-off values presented by the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) at: http://www.eucast.org 
The isolates shall be tested for the susceptibility to the antimicrobial substances listed below: 
- Ampicillin or Amoxicillin, 
- Tetracycline, 
- Chloramphenicol, 
- Florfenicol, 
- Nalidixic acid, 
- Ciprofloxacin (preferably) or Enrofloxacin, 
- Sulphonamide (preferably Sulfametoxazole), 
- Sulphonamide/Trimethoprim or Trimethoprim, 
- Gentamicin, 
- Streptomycin, 
- Kanamycin (preferably) or Neomycin, 
- third generation Cephalosporin, (preferably Cefotaxime), 
- Colistin (optional). 
Before initiation of the study Member States are encouraged to organise training for the involved parties. 
5. Records and sample storage 
Records of bacteriology shall be kept on all samples processed in a format like or comparable to the example given in Table 4. 
All strains isolated shall be stored at the NRLs of the different Member States as long as it ensures integrity of the strains for a minimum of five years. 
All samples of meat juice for serology shall be stored frozen for two years.
