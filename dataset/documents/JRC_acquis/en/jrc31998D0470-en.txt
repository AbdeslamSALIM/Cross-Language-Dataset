THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (2), and in particular Article 16(3) thereof, 
Whereas, so that basic information about veterinary checks carried out in the Member States pursuant to Directive 89/662/EEC can be examined in the Standing Veterinary Committee, the Commission needs to have prompt and reliable information available; 
Whereas, in order to establish a rational approach to the results of checks, the information should be presented for each sector of activity covered by veterinary legislation; 
Whereas, for practical reasons, such information should be transmitted to the Commission in electronic form; 
Whereas, so that the results can be expressed coherently, the requisite information should be transmitted in consolidated form for each sector for a given Member State as a whole by the competent national authority; 
Whereas, to ensure that the whole system is reliable, account should be taken only of information obtained from official checks carried out by the competent authorities in the Member States; 
Whereas provision should be made in the first instance for information on fresh meat; whereas this Decision should be supplemented subsequently to include all the sectors covered by veterinary legislation; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
