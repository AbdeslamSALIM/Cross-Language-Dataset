ANNEX I 
LIVE PLANTS AND FLOWER PRODUCTS 
1. OVERVIEW OF THE SITUATION 
The supply situation in the sector is increasing competition between products from within the Community and products from third countries. 
The evaluation studies of the promotion campaigns carried out from 1997 to 2000 suggest that, in order to facilitate the sale of Community production within the European Union, the whole chain from producer to distributor needs to be better organised and rationalised, and consumers should be better informed about the intrinsic qualities of products. 
2. GOALS 
- To increase the consumption of flowers and plants of Community origin. 
- To rationalise the industry of each Member State and keep participants more informed at all stages, in particular encouraging practices which benefit the environment. 
- To strengthen the partnership between professionals from several Member States, allowing, amongst other things, the most advanced knowledge in the sector to be shared, and certain specific products to be developed. 
3. MAIN TARGETS 
- Producers 
- Nurseries 
- Distributors 
- Students

5. MAIN CHANNELS
