Commission Directive 2006/2/EC 
of 6 January 2006 
amending, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical progress, Annexe II to Directive 96/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain methods for quantitative analysis of binary textile fibre mixtures 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Directive 96/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 on certain methods for quantitative analysis of binary textile fibre mixtures [1], and in particular Article 5(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 96/74/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 1996 on textile names [2] requires labelling to indicate the fibre composition of textile products, with checks being carried out by analysis on the conformity of these products with indications given on the label. 
(2) Uniform methods for quantitative analysis of binary textile fibre mixtures are provided in Directive 96/73/EC. 
(3) On the basis of recent findings by a technical working group, Directive 96/74/EC was adapted to technical progress, by adding the fibres polylactide and elastomultiester to the list of fibres set out in the Annexes I and II to that Directive. 
(4) It is therefore necessary to define uniform test methods for polylactide and elastomultiester. 
(5) Directive 96/73/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Directives relating to Textile Names and Labelling, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Annex II to Directive 96/73/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.

2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 
Article 3 
This Directive shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

2. Point 1.2 of method No 1 is replaced by the following: 
"2. wool (1), animal hair (2 and 3), silk (4), cotton (5), flax (7) true hemp (8), jute (9), abaca (10), alfa (11), coir (12), broom (13), ramie (14), sisal (15), cupro (21), modal (22), protein (23), viscose (25), acrylic (26), polyamide or nylon (30), polyester (34) and elastomultiester (45)".

(a) Points 1, 2 of method No 6 are replaced by the following: 
"1. FIELD OF APPLICATION 
This method is applicable, after removal of non-fibrous matter, to binary mixtures of: 
1. triacetate (24) or polylactide (33a)

2. wool (1), animal hair (2 and 3), silk (4), cotton (5), cupro (21), modal (22), viscose (25), acrylic (26), polyamide or nylon (30), polyester (34), glass fibre (43) and elastomultiester (45). 
Note 
Triacetate fibres which have received a finish leading to partial hydrolysis cease to be completely soluble in the reagent. In such cases, the method is not applicable. 
2. PRINCIPLE 
The triacetate or polylactide fibres are dissolved out from a known dry mass of the mixture, with dichloromethane. The residue is collected, washed, dried and weighed; its mass, corrected if necessary, is expressed as a percentage of the dry mass of the mixture. The percentage of dry triacetate or polylactide is found by difference".
