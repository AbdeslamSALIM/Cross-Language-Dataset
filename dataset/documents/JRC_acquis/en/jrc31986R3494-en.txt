COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3494/86 
of 13 November 1986 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 2772/75 on marketing standards for eggs and Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in eggs (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1475/86 (2), and in particular Article 2 (2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1475/86, and in particular Article 2 (2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2772/75 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3791/85 (5), lays down certain marketing standards for eggs; 
Whereas experience gained since the introduction of those standards indicates the need to define the scope of the latter more clearly; whereas, in view of recent trends in practices observed in hatcheries and in order to encourage the production and marketing of egg products, provision should be made in particular for incubated eggs to be excluded from the scope of those standards; 
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3791/85, lays down provisions on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks; whereas, in order to be able to distinguish eggs withdrawn from incubators from eggs subject to Regulation (EEC) No 2772/75, the provisions relating to the identification of eggs for hatching should be amended; whereas data should be collected at regular intervals on eggs withdrawn from incubators and use thereof,
