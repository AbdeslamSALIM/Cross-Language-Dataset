- set aside the judgment of the Court of First Instance of 14 December 2005;

Pleas in law and main arguments 
The appellants submit that the judgment under appeal is defective in that it fails totally to state any grounds concerning one of the principal arguments raised, namely, that in the specific factual circumstances of the case, the appellants are entitled to rely on the decision adopted by the Appeal Board of the World Trade Organisation to establish unlawful conduct on the part of the Community for the purposes of their claim for compensation.
