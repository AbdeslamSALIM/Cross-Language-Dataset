Commission Regulation (EC) No 1415/2006 
of 26 September 2006 
opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of maize held by the Slovak intervention agency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies [2] provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance. 
(2) Slovakia has intervention stocks of maize, which should be used up. 
(3) It is therefore appropriate to make the stocks of maize held by the Slovak intervention agency available on the internal market. 
(4) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. 
(5) It is also important for the Slovak intervention agency’s notification to the Commission to maintain the anonymity of the tenderers. 
(6) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

However, notwithstanding that Regulation: 
(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply; 
(b) the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market; it may not in any event be lower than the intervention price in force for the month in question, including any monthly increases. 
Article 3 
Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security shall be set at EUR 10 per tonne.
