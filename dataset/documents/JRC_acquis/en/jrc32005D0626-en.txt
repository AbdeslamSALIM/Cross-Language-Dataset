(2005/626/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer [1], and in particular Article 3(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride,1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromo-chloromethane. 
(2) Each year the Commission is required to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them. 
(3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, hereinafter "the Montreal Protocol", sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party. 
(4) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, Decision VII/11 and Decision XI/15 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. 
(5) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the Twelfth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs), Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Norway, Portugal, The Netherlands, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom have notified the United Nations Environment Programme [2] that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of CFC-MDIs that contain active ingredients belonging to the therapeutic categories of "short-acting beta agonist bronchiodilators", "inhaled steroids" and "anticholinergic bronchiodilators". Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have reduced the demand for CFCs in the Community. In addition, Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1). 
(6) The Commission has published a Notice [3] on the 22 July 2004 to those companies in the Community of 25 Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2005 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances in 2005. 
(7) For the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may continue to benefit in due time from the licensing system, it is appropriate that the present decision shall apply from 1 January 2005. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
1. The quantity of controlled substances of Group I (chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 which may be used for essential medical uses in the Community in 2005 shall be 1029770,00 ODP [4] kilograms.

6. The quantity of controlled substances of Group VII (hydrobromofluorocarbons) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2005 shall be 3,04 ODP kilograms. 
7. The quantity of controlled substances of group IX (bromochloromethane) subject to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 that may be used for essential laboratory uses in the Community in 2005 shall be 12,048 ODP kilograms. 
Article 2 
The chlorofluorocarbon metered-dose inhalers (CFC-MDIs) listed in Annex I shall not be placed on markets that have determined CFCs for these products to be non-essential. 
Article 3 
During the period 1 January to 31 December 2005 the following rules shall apply: 
1. The allocation of essential medical use quotas for chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115 shall be to the companies indicated in Annex II. 
2. The allocation of essential laboratory use quotas for chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115 and other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons shall be to the companies indicated in Annex III. 
3. The allocation of essential laboratory use quotas for halons shall be to the companies indicated in Annex IV. 
4. The allocation of essential laboratory use quotas for carbon tetrachloride shall be to the companies indicated in Annex V. 
5. The allocation of essential laboratory use quotas for 1,1,1-trichloroethane shall be to the companies indicated in Annex VI. 
6. The allocation of essential laboratory use quotas for hydrobromofluorocarbons shall be to the companies indicated in Annex VII. 
7. The allocation of essential laboratory use quotas for bromochloromethane shall be to the companies indicated in Annex VIII.
