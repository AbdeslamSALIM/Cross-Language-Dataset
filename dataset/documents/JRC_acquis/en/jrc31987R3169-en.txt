amending Regulations (EEC) No 32/82, (EEC) No 1964/82 and (EEC) No 74/84 in the matter of customs export formalities for certain beef on which special refunds are granted 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 467/87 (2), and in particular Article 18 (6) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 32/82 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2688/85 (4), laid down conditions for granting special export refunds on beef; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 (5) laid down conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned beef; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 74/84 (6) laid down conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of unboned beef; 
Whereas in order to facilitate monitoring by the competent authorities of compliance with the conditions laid down for the granting of special refunds the abovementioned Regulations require the use of certain procedures, in particular the identification of the products by an indelible mark or by a seal; whereas the provisions which are currently laid down in the Regulations listed above with a view to preventing the products concerned from being switched can be applied in compliance with the conditions laid down for the quantity of refunds only by requiring that the export formalities and, where appropriate, cutting and boning should be carried out in the Member State in which the animals were slaughtered; whereas the abovementioned Regulations should therefore be amended to that effect; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
