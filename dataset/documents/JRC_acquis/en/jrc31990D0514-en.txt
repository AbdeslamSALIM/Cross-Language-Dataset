ANNEX 
ALTERNATIVE STAFF MEDICAL CHECK-UP SCHEME FOR PERSONS EMPLOYED TO WORK WITH OR HANDLE FRESH MEAT, POULTRYMEAT AND MEAT PRODUCTS PRESENTED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF DENMARK 
A. Medical examination before taking up employment 
- The health of each person who is to be employed to handle meat, poultrymeat or meat products must be examined. The said examination is a pre-condition of such employment. 
- The health check, on the basis of which the risk of contamination through the person concerned is assessed, must include an inquiry into the medical history carried out by means of a questionnaire (see under E), which must be assessed by a doctor, and a general medical examination carried out by a medical doctor. 
Such medical examination may, if the doctor concerned considers it necessary, include a number of tests. 
B. (Annual) routine examination 
- Whenever the medical authorities service concerned (attached to an undertaking) or the family doctor of the employee concerned considers it necessary in particular when suspicion exists in relation to the diseases listed in the questionnaires under E and F, but at least once a year, the health of the staff referred to in A must be assessed by means of a questionnaire (see under F). 
- The questionnaire, when completed by the personnel, is to be submitted to the medical authorities concerned. The doctor in charge has to sign this declaration, thus prolonging the medical certificate for one year. If the medical doctor, on basis of the questionnaire or on basis of any other information considers that there is a need for further medical assessment, a possible prolongation of the medical certificate can only be made after the results of such an assessment have been made available. 
Such an assessment may, if the doctor concerned considers it necessary, include a number of tests. 
- Where there is justification on epidemiological or clinical grounds, the medical service (attached to an undertaking) or the family doctor of the employee concerned ensures that persons who are a possible source of contamination are prohibited from working or handling fresh meat, poultrymeat or meat products. 
C. Guidance in matters of hygiene 
Anyone working with or handling fresh meat, poultrymeat or meat products must have undergone appropriate training, particularly as regards his/her responsibility in matters of food and personal hygiene. 
D. Further comments 
Although a health certificate drawn up before taking up employment offers no absolute guarantee that the person concerned will not be a source of contamination, it is important when first employed to draw the attention to essential public health aspects such as the responsibility in matters of hygiene generally and the obligation to report any contagious disease during the term of employment. 
In this context, it is essential that the person concerned is sufficiently well informed of his role as a transmitter of disease. 
The routine medical examination (normally taking place every year) of staff engaged in handling meat, poultrymeat and meat products has been carried out for many years in a number of countries, with the aim of reducing the risk of pathogenic micro-organisms being transmitted to the consumer through the meat, poultrymeat or meat products by the person concerned. 
At various international meetings the question has been raised of whether such routine examinations, particularly of faeces, must necessarily form part of the measures to protect the consumer against contagious diseases that may be transmitted via badly handled meat, poultry meat or meat products. The value of the routine examination of faeces for pathogenic intestinal bacteria, in particular, has repeatedly been called into question. 
It emerges from the study of the reports of the abovementioned meeting that routine examinations, particularly of faeces samples, do not in any significant way contribute towards preventing contagious diseases from being transmitted to the consumer via meat, poultry meat or meat products; in other words, the examination at regular intervals of faeces and urine of staff for Salmonella and Shigellae is no longe considered to be relevant. There should only be examination where it is justified on epidemiological or clinical grounds.
