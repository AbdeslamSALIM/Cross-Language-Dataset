fixing for the 2005/06 marketing year the specific agricultural conversion rate applicable to the minimum sugar beet prices and the production levy and additional levy in the sugar sector for the currencies of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [1], 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1713/93 of 30 June 1993 establishing special detailed rules for applying the agricultural conversion rate in the sugar sector [2], and in particular Article 1(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 replaced, from the 2006/07 marketing year, Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector [3]. Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 continues to apply to the 2005/06 marketing year. 
(2) Under Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1713/93, the minimum sugar beet prices referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and the production levy and additional levy referred to, respectively, in Articles 15 and 16 of that Regulation are to be converted into national currency using a specific agricultural conversion rate equal to the average, calculated pro rata temporis, of the agricultural conversion rates applicable during the marketing year in question. 
(3) Since 1 January 1999, pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro [4], the fixing of conversion rates should be restricted to the specific agricultural conversion rates between the euro and the national currencies of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency. 
(4) The specific agricultural conversion rate for the minimum sugar beet prices and the production levy and the additional levy for the 2005/06 marketing year should therefore be fixed in the various national currencies, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
