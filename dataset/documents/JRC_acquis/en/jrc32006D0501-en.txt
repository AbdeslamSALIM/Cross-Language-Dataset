THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18(7) thereof,

(1) Newcastle disease is a highly contagious viral disease in poultry and birds and there is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products. 
(2) Commission Decision 2006/264/EC of 27 March 2006 concerning protection measures in relation to Newcastle disease in Romania [3] was adopted following outbreaks of Newcastle disease in Romania.

(3) Romania has notified to the Commission another outbreak of Newcastle disease in the county of Sﾄネaj, a part of the territory of Romania from which imports into the Community have not been suspended. That county should therefore be added to the list of counties set out in the Annex to Decision 2006/264/EC. 
(4) Taking account of the current epidemiology situation in Romania in relation to Newcastle disease the measures laid down in Decision 2006/264/EC should be prolonged.
