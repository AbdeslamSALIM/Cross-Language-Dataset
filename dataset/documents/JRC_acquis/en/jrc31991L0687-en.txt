Whereas Council Directive 72/461/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (6), as last amended by Directive 91/266/EEC (7), defines the conditions which must be satisfied as regards classical swine-fever by fresh pigmeat intended for intra-Community trade;
