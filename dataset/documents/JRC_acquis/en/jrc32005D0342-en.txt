Commission Decision 
of 23 March 2005 
establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to hand dishwashing detergents 
(notified under document number C(2005) 1026) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/342/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme ( [1]), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof, 
After consulting the European Union Eco-Labelling Board, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria, drawn up on the basis of the criteria drafted by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board, are to be established according to product groups. 
(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in good time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for the product group concerned. 
(4) It is appropriate, in order to take account of scientific and market developments, to revise the ecological criteria established by Commission Decision 2001/607/EC of 19 July 2001 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to hand dishwashing detergents ( [2]). 
(5) Furthermore, in order to specify that products for both private and professional use are covered, it is necessary to modify the definition of the product group laid down in that Decision. 
(6) In the interests of clarity, Decision 2001/607/EC should therefore be replaced. 
(7) The revised ecological criteria should be valid for a period of four years. 
(8) It is appropriate to allow a transitional period of not more than 12 months for applicants whose products have been awarded the eco-label before the date of notification of this Decision or who have applied for such an award before that date, so that they have sufficient time to adapt their products to comply with the revised criteria and requirements. 
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1

-------------------------------------------------- 
ANNEX 
FRAMEWORK 
In order to qualify for the eco-label, a hand dishwashing detergent (hereinafter referred to as the product) must fall within the product group as defined in Article 1, and must comply with the criteria of this Annex. 
The aims of the criteria 
These criteria aim in particular at promoting: 
- the reduction of discharges of toxic or otherwise polluting substances into the aquatic environment, 
- the reduction or prevention of risks to health or the environment related to the use of hazardous substances, 
- the minimisation of packaging waste, 
- information that will enable the consumer to use the product in the way that is efficient and minimises environmental impact. 
The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of hand dishwashing detergents that have a low environmental impact. 
Assessment and verification requirements 
The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion. 
Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if the competent body assessing the application accepts their equivalence. 
Where no tests are mentioned, or are mentioned as being for use in verification or monitoring, competent bodies should rely as appropriate on declarations and documentation provided by the applicant and/or independent verifications. 
Where appropriate, competent bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications. 
Where the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses test reports, or other evidence to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate. 
Where ingredients are referred to, this includes substances and preparations. 
Appendix I presents the new revised detergent ingredient database (DID list), version 30 June 2004, which contains the most widely used ingredients in detergent formulations. Part A of the DID list shall be used for deriving the data for the calculations of CDVtox and for the assessment of the biodegradability of surfactants. 
Where appropriate, the applicant may use subsequent revisions of the detergent ingredient database as they become available. 
For ingredients which are not included in part A of the DID list, the applicant shall, under his own responsibility, apply the procedure as described in the part-B of Appendix I. 
For ingredients, which are not listed in the DID list, the applicant may use an approach to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic degradability described in Appendix II. 
The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO 14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria in this Annex (Note: It is not required to implement such management scheme). 
ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA 
1. Toxicity to aquatic organisms 
The critical dilution volume toxicity (CDVtox) is calculated for each ingredient (i) using the following equation: 
CDV tox (ingredient i) 
= 
weight (i) x DF (i) 
/ 
TF chronic (i) 
x 1000 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
where weight (i) is the weight of the ingredient (in grams) per recommended dose for 1 litre of dishwashing water, DF (i) is the degradation factor and TF chronic (i) is the toxicity factor of the ingredient (in milligram/litre). 
The values of DF and TF chronic shall be as given in the Detergent Ingredient Database list-part A (DID list-part A) (Appendix I). If the ingredient in question is not included in the DID list part A, the applicant shall estimate the values following the approach described in the DID list part B (Appendix I). The CDVtox is summed for each ingredient, making the CDVtox for the product. 
The CDVtox of the recommended dose expressed for 1 litre of dishwashing water shall not exceed 4200 l. 
Assessment and verification: the exact formulation of the product shall be provided to the competent body, together with the details of the CDVtox calculations showing compliance with this criterion. 
2. Biodegradability of surfactants 
(a) Ready biodegradability (aerobic) 
Each surfactant used in the product shall be readily biodegradable. 
Assessment and verification: the exact formulation of the product as well as a description of the function of each ingredient shall be provided to the Competent Body. The DID list part A (Appendix I) indicates whether a specific surfactant is aerobically biodegradable or not (the surfactants with an entry of "R" in the column on aerobic biodegradability are readily biodegradable). For surfactants which are not included in the DID list part A, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are aerobically biodegradable shall be provided. The tests for ready biodegradability shall be as referred to in Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents [1]. Surfactants shall be considered as readily biodegradable if the level of biodegradability (mineralisation) measured according to one of the five following tests is at least 60 % within 28 days: CO2 headspace test (OECD 310), carbon dioxide (CO2) Evolution Modified Sturm test (OECD 301B; Directive 67/548/EEC Annex V.C.4-C), Closed Bottle test (OECD 301D; Directive 67/548/EEC Annex VC(4E)), Manometric Respirometry (OECD 301F; Directive 67/548/EEC Annex VC(4D)), or MITI (I) test (OECD 301C; Directive 67/548/EEC Annex VC(4F)), or their equivalent ISO tests. Depending on the physical characteristics of the surfactant, one of the following tests might be used to confirm ready biodegradability, if the level of biodegradability is at least 70 % within 28 days: Dissolved Organic Carbon DOC Die-Away (OECD 301A; Directive 67/548/EEC Annex VC(4A)) or Modified OECD Screening DOC Die-Away (OECD 301E; Directive 67/548/EEC Annex VC(4B)), or their equivalent ISO tests. The applicability of test methods based on measurement of dissolved organic carbon needs to be appropriately justified as these methods could give results on the removal and not on the biodegradability. Pre-adaptation is not to be used in tests for aerobic ready biodegradability. The 10 days window principle shall not apply. 
(b) Anaerobic biodegradability 
Each surfactant used in the product shall be biodegradable under anaerobic conditions. 
Assessment and verification: the exact formulation of the product as well as a description of the function of each ingredient shall be provided to the competent body. The DID list part A (Appendix I) indicates whether a specific surfactant is anaerobically biodegradable or not (the surfactants with an entry of "Y" in the column on anaerobic biodegradability are biodegradable under anaerobic conditions). For surfactants which are not included in the DID list part A, the relevant information from literature or other sources, or appropriate test results, showing that they are anaerobically biodegradable shall be provided. The reference test for anaerobic degradability shall be OECD 311, ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent test method, with the requirement of a minimum of 60 % ultimate degradability under anaerobic conditions. Test methods simulating the conditions in a relevant anaerobic environment may also be used to document that 60 % ultimate degradability has been attained under anaerobic conditions (see Appendix II). 
3. Dangerous, hazardous or toxic substances or preparations 
(a) The following ingredients shall not be included in the product, either as part of the formulation or as part of any preparation included in the formulation: 
- alkyl phenol ethoxylates (APEOs) and derivatives thereof

musk tibetine: 1-tert-butyl-3,4,5-trimethyl-2,6-dinitrobenzene 
musk ketone: 4'-tert-butyl-2',6'-dimethyl-3',5'-dinitroacetaphenone 
HHCB (1,3,4,6,7,8-Hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta(g)-2-benzopyran) 
AHTN (6-Acetyl-1,1,2,4,4,7-hexamethyltetralin). 
Assessment and verification: the applicant shall provide a declaration supported by declarations from manufacturers, as appropriate, confirming that the listed substances have not been included in the product. 
(b) Quaternary ammonium salts that are not readily biodegradable shall not be used, either as part of the formulation or as part of any preparation included in the formulation. 
Assessment and verification: the applicant shall provide documentation showing the biodegradability of any quaternary ammonium salt used. 
(c) R40 (limited evidence of a carcinogenic effect), 
R45 (may cause cancer), 
R46 (may cause heritable genetic damage), 
R49 (may cause cancer by inhalation), 
R68 (possible risks of irreversible effects), 
R50-53 (very toxic to aquatic organism and may cause long term adverse effects in the aquatic environment),

Part B - Critical dilution volume 
The Critical dilution volume is calculated according to the following equation: 
CDV= 1000 * Σdosage(i)*DF(i)/TF(i) 
Dosage(i) = dosage of ingredient i, expressed in g/wash, or in some cases as g/100 g product. 
DF(i) = degradation factor for ingredient i. 
TF(i) = toxicity factor for ingredient i. 
PROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING PARAMETER VALUES FOR INGREDIENTS NOT ON THE DID LIST 
As a general rule the listed parameter values must be used for all ingredients on the DID list. An exception is made for perfumes and dyes, where additional test results are accepted (see footnote in part A). 
The following approach applies for ingredients that are not listed on the DID list. 
Aquatic toxicity 
In the European eco-label scheme, the CDV is calculated based on the chronic toxicity and chronic safety factors. If no chronic test results are available, the acute toxicity and safety factor must be used. 
The chronic toxicity factor (TFchronic) 
- Calculate the median value within each trophic level (fish, crustaceans or algae) using validated test results for chronic toxicity. If several test results are available for one species within a trophic level, a median for the species shall be calculated first, and these median values shall be used when calculating the median value for the trophic level. 
- The chronic toxicity factor (TFchronic) is the lowest median of the trophic levels calculated. 
- The TFchronic shall be used when calculating the critical dilution volume criterion. 
The acute toxicity factor (TFacute) 
- Calculate the median value within each trophic level (fish, crustaceans or algae) using validated test results for acute toxicity. If several test results are available for one species within a trophic level, a median for the species shall be calculated first, and these median values shall be used when calculating the median value for the trophic level. 
- The acute toxicity factor (TFacute) is the lowest median of the trophic levels. 
- The TFacute shall be used when calculating the critical dilution volume criterion. 
Safety factor 
The safety factor (SF) is depending on how many trophic levels are tested, and whether chronic test results are available or not. SF is determined as follows: 
Data | Safety factor (SF) | Toxicity factor (TF) | 
One short-term L(E)C50 | 10000 | Toxicity/10000 | 
Two short-term L(E)C50 from species representing two trophic levels (fish and/or crustaceans and/or algae) | 5000 | Toxicity/5000 | 
At least one short-term L(E)C50 from each of three trophic levels of the base-set 1 | 1000 | Toxicity/1000 | 
One long-term NOEC (fish or crustaceans) | 100 | Toxicity/100 | 
Two long-term NOEC from species representing two trophic levels (fish and/or crustaceans and/or algae) | 50 | Toxicity/50 | 
Long-term NOEC from at least three species (normally fish, crustaceans and algae) representing three trophic levels | 10 | Toxicity/10 | 
- The base set for testing the toxicity of substances towards aquatic organisms consists of acute tests with fish, daphnia and algae. 
Degradation factors 
The degradation factor is defined as follows: 
Table 1 - Degradation factor (DF) 
| DF | 
Readily biodegradable [5] | 0,05 | 
Readily biodegradable [6] | 0,15 | 
Inherently biodegradable | 0,5 | 
Persistent | 1 | 
Anaerobic biodegradability 
The ingredient must be classified into one of the following classes of compounds: 
Category | Label | 
Anaerobically not biodegradable, i.e. tested and found not biodegradable. | N | 
Anaerobically biodegradable, i.e. tested and found biodegradable or not tested but demonstrated through analogy considerations etc. | Y | 
Not tested for anaerobic biodegradability. | 0 | 
Aerobic biodegradability 
The ingredient must be classified into one of the following classes of compounds: 
Category | Label | 
Readily biodegradable | R | 
Inherently biodegradable, but not readily biodegradable | I | 
Persistent | P | 
Not tested for aerobic biodegradability | O | 
Insoluble inorganic ingredients 
If an inorganic ingredient has a very low water-solubility, or is not soluble in water this must be indicated in the submitted file. 
[1] If no acceptable chronic toxicity data was found, these columns are empty. In that case TF(chronic) is defined as equal to TF(acute). 
[2] As a general rule licence applicants must use the data on the list. Perfumes and dyes are exceptions. If toxicity data is submitted by the licence applicant the submitted data shall be used to calculate the TF and determine the degradability. If not, the values on the list shall be used. 
[3] Due to a lack of toxicity results the TF has been calculated as an average of the values of C 12/14 Alkyl sulphate (AS) and C 16/18 Alkyl sulphate (AS). 
[4] 5-Chloro-2-Methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 2-Methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one in mixture 3: 1 
[5] All surfactants or other ingredients consisting of a series of homologues and fulfilling the final degradation requirement of the test, shall be included in this class regardless of fulfilment of the 10-day window criterion. 
[6] 10-day window criterion not fulfilled.For inorganic ingredients the DF is set according to observed degradation rate. If the ingredient degrade within five days: DF = 0,05, within 15 days: DF = 0,15 or within 50 days: DF = 0,5.

Appendix II 
Documentation of anaerobic biodegradability 
The following approach may be used to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic biodegradability in the case of ingredients that are not listed in the DID list. 
Apply reasonable extrapolation. Use test results obtained with one raw material to extrapolate the ultimate anaerobic degradability of structurally related surfactants. If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant (or a group of homologues) according to the DID list (Appendix I), it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (for example, C12-15 A 1-3 EO sulphate (DID No 8) is anaerobically biodegradable, and a similar anaerobic biodegradability may also be assumed for C12-15 A 6 EO sulphate). If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant by use of an appropriate test method, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (for example, literature data confirming the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants belonging to the group alkyl ester ammonium salts may be used as documentation for a similar anaerobic biodegradability of other quaternary ammonium salts containing ester-linkages in the alkyl chain(s)). 
Perform screening test for anaerobic degradability. If new testing is necessary, perform a screening test by use of OECD 311, ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent method. 
Perform low-dosage degradability test. If new testing is necessary, and in the case of experimental problems in the screening test (for example, inhibition due to toxicity of test substance), repeat testing by using a low dosage of surfactant and monitor degradation by 14C measurements or chemical analyses. Testing at low dosages may be performed by use of OECD 308 ( 24 April 2002) or an equivalent method provided that strict anaerobic conditions are applied. The testing and interpretation of the test results should be conducted by an independent expert.

Appendix III 
Framework for a performance test 
The purpose of the performance test is to compare the ability and capacity of a test product to that of a reference product. The framework allows for a wide range of test procedures as long as the requirements below are a part of the test procedure. In the test, washing-up may be done by hand or, alternatively, a machine may be responsible for the mechanical work. The test may either involve the washing up of crockery, e.g. dishes or plates, or tests that do not involve crockery may be used. 
NUMBER OF TESTS 
Five rounds of testing must be performed in which the test and reference products are compared with one another in each round. Each round shall accordingly consist of two subtests: one for the test product and one for the reference product. Besides the 10 subtests at least one additional test must be performed in which that no hand dishwashing detergent is used (water test). This test must show that the results of the chosen test method confirm that the test product has a better cleaning performance than that of pure water. 
WATER PARAMETERS 
- The same volume of water must be used in all subtests. The volume must be determined in litres to one decimal point. 
- The water hardness, specified in OdH, and the calcium-magnesium-ratio must be known. 
- The water temperature must be the same for all subtests. It shall be measured at the start and kept constant throughout the test. However, a decrease of the water temperature during the test is acceptable, if the same temperature decrease is documented for all subtests. 
TEST AND REFERENCE PRODUCT PARAMETERS 
- The reference product may either be a market-leading product or a generic formulation. 
- If a market-leading reference product is used, it shall be one of the three to four products with the highest sales volume on the market in a region, where the eco-labelled product is to be marketed. Furthermore, the market-leading reference product must be approved by the competent body, and the trade name must be available to the public. 
- If a generic reference product is used, it must have a composition, which is representative of the products on the market. Furthermore, the generic reference product must be approved by the competent body and the exact formulation must be commonly available free of charge. 
- The dosage of test product and reference product shall be the recommended dosage in all tests, normalised to the given volume of water and weighed in grams to one decimal point. If no recommended dosage is stated for the reference product, the same dosage must be used for both the test product and the reference product. 
- If a dosage interval is given, the lowest recommended dosage must be used for the test. 
- The detergent must be mixed and completely dissolved in the water. 
SOIL PARAMETERS 
- At least one type of soil, consisting primarily of fresh animal fat and vegetable fat, must be used. 
- The same soil must be used for all subtests. 
- The origin or chemical composition of the soil, e.g. olive oil, beef tallow, etc., must be described in detail. 
- The soil must be homogenous and of even consistency. 
- Enough soil for the entire test must be prepared in one batch. 
- The quantity of soil applied to a substrate, e.g. plates or dishes, or to the washing-water must be the same in all subtests and must be weighed in grams to one decimal point. 
TEST PROCEDURE 
- The test and reference products must be made anonymous to the person(s) performing the test. 
- The elements and stages included in each subtest must be decided in advance and must be identical for each subtest. 
- The temperature and relative humidity of the room must be measured and kept constant in all subtests. 
- A fixed procedure for application of soil, allowing sufficient time for drying, must be determined in advance. 
- A fixed procedure for manual dishwashing or removal of soil by machinery must be described in advance 
- At least five subtests must be performed with both the test and reference product, and at least one test must be performed with water without addition of detergent. 
ASSESSMENT OF CAPACITY 
- The test must be capable of generating results that provide a measure of capacity. The capacity must be expressed in grams of soil removed per five litres of water before reaching a predefined point of saturation. The point of saturation can for example be when a cleaning effect is no longer observed, when soil is floating at the surface of the water, when the foam layer is not completely covering the surface, or when there is no visible foam. 
ASSESSMENT OF CLEANNESS 
- The test must be capable of generating results that provide a measure of the cleanness. Cleanness can be measured visually, optically or by means of another relevant method. The method of measurement, including a possible scoring system, must be decided in advance. 
COMPARISON 
- A positive result of a test round is obtained when the capacity and cleanness are as good as or better for the test product compared with the reference product. 
- The test product is considered to have fulfilled the performance requirements when positive results are obtained in at least 80 % of the test rounds. As an alternative, the applicant may use statistical methods and demonstrate with a one-sided 95 % confidence range that the test product is as good as or better than the reference product in at least 80 % of the test rounds. 
- It shall also be shown that the test product has a better cleaning ability than that of pure water. 
DOCUMENTATION 
All tests must be reported in accordance with the following specification. The report must contain the following points: 
- description of how the test and reference products were made anonymous to the person(s) performing the test, 
- specification of the temperature and humidity in the test room and details describing how the test person(s) ensured that these conditions were kept constant in all subtests, 
- description of the composition of the soil and of the procedure used to ensure that the soil was of a homogenous and even consistency, 
- specification of the hardness of the water, and how it was achieved, and specification of the calcium-magnesium ratio, 
- specification of the quantity of water used in the subtests and specification of how the water temperature requirement was fulfilled, 
- specification of the results of the weighing of the hand dishwashing detergent in each subtest and description of the procedure for dissolving the product in the water, 
- description of the procedure for adding the soil to either a substrate (e.g. plates or dishes) or to the washing water,
