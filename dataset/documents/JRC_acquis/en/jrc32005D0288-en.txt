(2005/288/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 96/16/EC, of 19 March 1996 on statistical surveys of milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 5(2), and Article 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 5(2) of Directive 96/16/EC provides that Member States forward annually to the Commission methodological information compiled in the form of a standard questionnaire drawn up by the Commission. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS) [2] lays down the legal framework for Community statistics broken down by territorial units; the new classification (NUTS) should therefore be used for transmitting data on the cows’ milk production by agricultural holdings on a regional basis. 
(3) In view of the growing economic importance of the protein content of milk, it is becoming increasingly necessary to have statistical information on the protein content of the main milk products. 
(4) Commission Decision 97/80/EC of 18 December 1996 [3] laying down provisions for implementation of Council Directive 96/16/EC on statistical surveys of milk and milk products must be amended and supplemented; 
(5) The measures provided for in this decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics,
