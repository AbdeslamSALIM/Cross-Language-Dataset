ANNEX 
In Annex III to Decision 97/808/EC the table and the text relating to product family "FLOORINGS (2/2)", are replaced by the following: 
"PRODUCT FAMILY FLOORINGS (2/2) 
Systems of attestation of conformity 
For the products and intended uses listed below, CEN/CENELEC are requested to specify the following systems of attestation of conformity in the relevant harmonised standards: 
Products | Intended uses | Levels or classes Reaction to fire | Attestation of conformity systems | 
Rigid flooring products(A)ComponentsPaving units, tiles mosaics, parquet, decking of mesh or sheet, floor gratings, rigid laminated floorings, wood based products(B)Load bearing systems put on the market as kitsRaised access floors, cavity floors | For internal uses including enclosed public transport premises | A1FL [1] — A2FL [1] — BFL [1] — CFL [1] | 1 [2] | 
A1FL [3] — A2FL [3] — BFL [3] — CFL [3] — DFL — EFL | 3 [4] | 
(A1FL to EFL) [5], FFL | 4 [6] | 
Resilient and textile floorings Homogenous and heterogeneous resilient floor coverings supplied either in tile, sheet or roll form (textile floor covering including tiles; plastic and rubber sheets (aminoplastic thermosetting floorings); linoleum and cork; anti-static sheet; floor loose laid tiles; resilient laminated floorings) | For internal uses | A1FL [1] — A2FL [1] — BFL [1] — CFL [1] | 1 [2] | 
A1FL [3] — A2FL [3] — BFL [3] — CFL [3] — DFL — EFL | 3 [4] | 
(A1FL to EFL) [5], FFL | 4 [6] | 
Resilient and textile floorings Homogenous and heterogeneous resilient floor coverings supplied either in tile, sheet or roll form (textile floor covering including tiles; plastic and rubber sheets (aminoplastic thermosetting floorings); linoleum and cork; anti-static sheet; floor loose laid tiles; resilient laminated floorings) | For external uses | — | 4 [6] | 
Floor screed materials | For internal uses | A1FL [1] — A2FL [1] — BFL [1] — CFL [1] | 1 [2] | 
A1FL [3] — A2FL [3] — BFL [3] — CFL [3] — DFL — EFL | 3 [4] | 
(A1FL to EFL) [5], FFL | 4 [6] | 
For external uses | — | 4 [6] | 
The specification for the system should be such that it can be implemented even where performance does not need to be determined for a certain characteristic, because at least one Member State has no legal requirement at all for such characteristic (see Article 2(1) of Directive 89/106/EEC and, where applicable, clause 1.2.3 of the Interpretative Documents). In those cases the verification of such characteristic must not be imposed on the manufacturer if he does nor wish to declare the performance of the product in that respect." 
[1] Products/materials for which a clearly identifiable stage in the production process results in an improvement of the reaction to fire classification (e.g. an addition of fire retardants or a limiting of organic material). 
[2] System 1: See Annex III, Section 2, point (i), of Directive 89/106/EEC without audit-testing of samples. 
[3] Products/materials not covered by footnote 1. 
[4] System 3: See Annex III, Section 2, point (ii), of Directive 89/106/EEC, second possibility. 
[5] Products/materials that do not require to be tested for reaction to fire (e.g. Products/materials of Classes A1 according to Commission Decision 96/603/EC (OJ L 267, 19.10.1996, p. 23)). 
[6] System 4: See Annex III, Section 2, point (ii), of Directive 89/106/EEC, third possibility.
