Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2007 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 
- Objectives of the proposal 
The objective of this proposal is to fix, for the commercial most important fish stocks in the Baltic Sea, the fishing opportunities for Member States for 2007.120 
- General context 
In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy shall ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. An important tool to achieve these objectives is the annual fixing of the fisheries opportunities in the form of total allowable catches (TACs), quotas and fishing effort limits. 
With a view to simplification and clarification, the fixing of fishing opportunities in the Baltic Sea was for the first time implemented by a separate Regulation for 2006, Council Regulation (EC) No 52/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea for 2006. 
The scientific advice on fishing opportunities in 2007 in the Baltic Sea was delivered by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in June 2006. On the basis of the scientific advice the Community has discussed the TACs and quotas and associated condition with the Russian Federation within the framework of the new bilateral fisheries agreement, which was initialled in July 2006. This agreement will not formally enter into force until the agreement has been concluded by both Parties, for the Community in the form of a decision of the Council on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. However, the Parties have agreed to establish management measures for shared stocks already from 1 January 2007 based on a provisional application of the agreement [exchange of letters]. The management measures agreed by the Community and the Russian Federation are in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy. 
The proposal contains three sections of importance for the management of the Baltic fisheries in 2007; a section fixing the TACs and quotas, a section limiting the fishing effort and a section laying down associated technical and control measures. 
Recent scientific advice from the ICES has indicated that the two cod stocks in the Baltic Sea are suffering from unsustainable exploitation levels. With respect to the Eastern stock, ICES has recommended that no catch should be taken in 2007 and that a recovery plan should be developed and implemented. The objective is therefore to establish a multi-annual plan for the long-term management of the fisheries on the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea to ensure that the exploitation of Baltic cod stocks is in conformity with the overall objective of the Common Fisheries Policy of providing sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. The Commission has recently presented a proposal for a Council Regulation for such a plan[1]. Measures in the present proposal concerning monitoring, inspection and surveillance in connection with the recovery of the cod stocks in question are in accordance with the measures proposed in the proposal. 
- 130 Existing provisions in the area of the proposal 
The fishing opportunities and the allocation to Member States are subject to the provisions of annual regulations. The latest is the Council Regulation (EC) No 52/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006. 
Of relevance to management of the fisheries in the Baltic Sea is also Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, amending Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 88/98. 
- Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union 
The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and is consistent with the Community's policy on sustainable development. 
2. CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
- Consultation of interested parties 
The sections on limiting the fishing effort and on laying down associated technical measures are in accordance with the decisions taken in the Council in December 2005 on Council Regulation (EC) No 52/2006 of 22 December 2005 fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 and have been subject to consultations with the fishing sector, NGO's dealing with fisheries issues in the Baltic Sea, and Member States concerned already in 2005. 
The Baltic RAC, which was founded in March 2006, has been preliminarily consulted at its Executive Committee meeting in June 2006. The scientific basis for the proposal was provided by ICES, and DG FISH indicated the rules it would follow for setting the TACs and quotas for 2007. Based on the new calendar for the timing of legislative proposals and decisions outlined in the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament COM(2006) 246 of 24 May 2006 on improving consultation on Community fisheries management a formal response of the Baltic RAC could not be given before the presentation of the proposal. However, the preliminary views expressed during the meeting were taken into account. 
The state of the two cod stocks were discussed during the meeting. Both cod stocks are overexploited, with the stock in the Eastern Baltic suffering also from reduced reproductive capacity. ICES has recommended a substantial reduction in the fishing on the Western stock to keep the spawning stock biomass (SSB) above precautionary levels and to close the fishery on the Eastern stock following precautionary limits to ensure a recovery to a level within safe biological limits. However, implementing the reduction required to rebuild the Eastern stock within one year would remove the economic basis for the fishing sector and would undermine the management system. DG-Fish had therefore suggested a long-term approach where the level of fishing is gradually reduced to sustainable levels already in 2005. The approach as well as the TACs following from applying the approach was supported by the sector to that time. 
With a view to promoting greater transparency in the consultation process the Commission services have informed the Baltic Sea RAC since the June meeting of the likely approach to be followed in the setting of the TAC for the cod stocks. 
Regarding the measures concerning fishing effort and control, the sector, NGOs and Member States have been consulted on several occasions and the elements included in the proposal reflects comments made especially by the fishing sector. 
- Collection and use of expertise 
The Community requests, each year, ICES and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) for scientific advice on the state of important fish stocks. The advice received covers all Baltic stocks for which TACs are proposed. The proposed TACs are based on the advice but do not necessary follow the advice to the letter. According to the intention of the Commission to ensure the sustainable use of fishery resources while maintaining stability in fishing opportunities, changes in TACs are limited to no more than 15% from one year to the next. 
For the cod stocks the proposed TACs reflect a long-term approach whereby the TACs and fishing effort are gradually reduced to sustainable levels over a number of years. In parallel to this proposal the Commission has tabled a proposal for a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. The central element of the plan is a gradual reduction of fishing effort to long-term sustainable levels that will provide high and stable yields. The proposed TACs do therefore not follow the ICES catch advice to close the Eastern Baltic cod fisheries in order to save these stocks from collapse. They reflect the gradual approach to be applied in the multi-annual plan. 
The TAC proposal for the Eastern cod stock is however not set in line with a gradual reduction in fishing effort according to the proposed multi-annual plan due to exceptional circumstances. The poor state of the stock requires stronger measures to be taken in order to prevent further erosion of the stock. Given the current state of the stock the gradual 10% reduction in fishing mortality proposed in the plan would lead to a 26% increase in the TAC. Considering the intention to rebuild the stock and to ensure sustainable exploitation thereafter, the Commission has therefore decided to apply a bigger reduction in fishing mortality which corresponds to a 15% reduction of the TAC and an equivalent reduction of fishing effort for the vessels concerned. 
Given the scientific advice for this stock, the Commission will play particular attention to the impact of the proposed reduction on the state of the Eastern cod stock and, in the absence of Council adoption of a long-term management plan for this stock, will be obliged to propose even more stringent measures in future years. 
Main organisations/experts consulted 
The scientific organisations consulted were the International Council for the Exploitation of the Seas (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). 
- Impact assessment 
The proposed measures will, if implemented, result in an overall increase in fishing opportunities for Community vessels in the Baltic Sea. The fishing possibilities on sprat and some of the herring stocks will increase and fishermen will face lower quotas only for the cod stocks. The reduction in the TAC for salmon has been based on real catches and is therefore not expected to have an influence on the first hand value of landings. The first hand value of landings from the Baltic is however, assuming unchanged prices, expected to decrease by about 12% in 2007 due to the reduction of the TACs for the cod stocks. 
The proposal does not only reflect short term decisions but is also part of a longer term approach whereby the level of fishing is gradually reduced to long-term sustainable levels. 
The approach taken in the proposal will therefore in the medium to long term result in reduced fishing effort but stable or increasing quotas. The long-term consequences of the approach are therefore predicted to be reduced impact on the environment as a consequence of the decline in fishing effort, reductions in the catching sector in terms of number of vessels and/or in the average fishing effort per vessel, and unchanged or increased landings. 
3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL 
- Legal basis 
The legal basis for this proposal is Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, and in particular Article 20 thereof. 
4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION 
The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. 
5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
- Detailed Explanation 
The proposal fixes for 2007 the fishing opportunities for Member States fishing in the Baltic Sea. 
The TACs and quotas allocated to Member States are given in Annex I. The proposed figures reflect the scientific advice and the framework for setting the TACs and quotas outlined in the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament about a Policy Statement from the European Commission on Fishing Opportunities for 2007. 
The TACs and quotas for the two cod stocks are closely linked to the fishing effort limits laid down in Annex II as well at the measures concerning monitoring, inspection and surveillance laid down point 2 of Annex III. 
The transitional technical measures in Annex III represent important measures concerning the two cod stocks in the Baltic Sea which are suffering from unsustainable exploitation levels. The Commission has presented a proposal for a new Regulation establishing a multi-annual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks, which includes all these measures [COM(2006) 411]. It is expected that the proposal will be adopted by the Council early in 2007. 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2007 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy[2], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/1996 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas[3], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. 
(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunity limits by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of these opportunities to Member States. 
(3) In order to ensure effective management of the fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established. 
(4) The principles and certain procedures for fishery management need to be laid down at Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the vessels flying their flag. 
(5) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities. 
(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified. 
(7) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with the Community legislation on the subject, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels[4], Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish[5], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy[6], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems[7], and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels[8], Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic[9], and Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound[10]. 
(8) In order to contribute to the conservation of fish stocks, certain supplementary measures on control and technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2007. 
(9) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2007. Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community,

Appendix 1 to Annex III 
Specific inspection benchmarks 
Objective 
1. Each Member State shall set specific inspection benchmarks in accordance with this Annex. 
Strategy 
2. Inspection and surveillance of fishing activities shall concentrate on vessels likely to catch cod. Random inspections of transport and marketing of cod shall be used as a complementary cross-checking mechanism to test the effectiveness of inspection and surveillance. 
Priorities 
3. Different gear types shall be subject to different levels of prioritisation, depending on the extent to which the fleets are affected by fishing opportunity limits. For that reason, each Member State shall set specific priorities. 
Sampling 
4. Each Member States shall specify and describe which sampling strategy will be applied. 
The Commission can have access on request to the sampling plan used by the Member State. 
Target benchmarks 
5. Not later than one month from the date of entry into force of this Regulation, each Member State shall implement its inspection schedules taking account of the targets set out below. 
a. Level of inspection in ports 
As a general rule, the accuracy to be achieved should be at least equivalent to what would be obtained by a simple random sampling method, where inspections shall cover 20% by weight of cod landings covering all places of landing. 
b. Level of inspection of marketing 
Inspection of 5% of the quantities of cod offered for sale at auction. 
c. Level of inspection at sea 
Flexible benchmark: to be set after a detailed analysis of the fishing activity in each area. Benchmarks at sea shall refer the number of patrol days at sea in the cod management areas, possibly with a separate benchmark for days patrolling specific areas. 
d. Level of aerial surveillance 
Flexible benchmark: to be set after a detailed analysis of the fishing activity conducted in each area and taking the available resources at the Member State’s disposal into consideration.
