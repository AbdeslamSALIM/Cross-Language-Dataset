Council Regulation (EC) No%nbsp%1236/2005 of 27 June 2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 
of 27 June 2005 
concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes one of the principles common to the Member States. In view of this, the Community resolved in 1995 to make respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms an essential element of its relations with third countries. It was decided to insert a clause to that end in any new trade, cooperation and association agreement of a general nature that it concludes with third countries. 
(2) Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms all lay down an unconditional, comprehensive prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Other provisions, in particular the United Nations Declaration Against Torture [1] and the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, place an obligation on States to prevent torture. 
(3) Article 2(2) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union [2] states that no one shall be condemned to the death penalty or executed. On 29 June 1998, the Council approved "Guidelines on EU policy towards third countries on the death penalty" and resolved that the European Union would work towards the universal abolition of the death penalty. 
(4) Article 4 of the said Charter states that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. On 9 April 2001, the Council approved "Guidelines to the EU policy toward third countries, on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment". These guidelines refer to both the adoption of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports in 1998 and the ongoing work to introduce EU-wide controls on the exports of paramilitary equipment as examples of measures to work effectively towards the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment within the Common Foreign and Security Policy. These guidelines also provide for third countries to be urged to prevent the use and production of, and trade in, equipment which is designed to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and prevent the abuse of any other equipment to these ends. They also make the point that the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment imposes clear limits on the use of the death penalty. Therefore and in line with these texts, capital punishment is not to be considered a lawful penalty under any circumstances. 
(5) In its Resolution on Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted on 25 April 2001 and supported by the EU Member States, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights called upon United Nations Members to take appropriate steps, including legislative measures, to prevent and prohibit, inter alia, the export of equipment which is specifically designed to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. This point was confirmed by Resolutions adopted on 16 April 2002, 23 April 2003, 19 April 2004 and 19 April 2005. 
(6) On 3 October 2001, the European Parliament adopted a Resolution [3] on the Council's second Annual Report according to Operative Provision 8 of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, urging the Commission to act swiftly to bring forward an appropriate Community instrument banning the promotion, trade and export of police and security equipment the use of which is inherently cruel, inhuman or degrading, and to ensure that that Community instrument would suspend the transfer of police and security equipment the medical effects of which are not fully known, and of such equipment where its use in practice has revealed a substantial risk of abuse or unwarranted injury. 
(7) It is therefore appropriate to lay down Community rules on trade with third countries in goods which could be used for the purpose of capital punishment and in goods which could be used for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. These rules are instrumental in promoting respect for human life and for fundamental human rights and thus serve the purpose of protecting public morals. Such rules should ensure that Community economic operators do not derive any benefits from trade which either promotes or otherwise facilitates the implementation of policies on capital punishment or on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are not compatible with the relevant EU Guidelines, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and international conventions and treaties. 
(8) For the purpose of this Regulation, it is considered appropriate to apply the definitions of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment laid down in the 1984 United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and in Resolution 3452 (XXX) of the General Assembly of the United Nations. These definitions should be interpreted taking into account the case law on the interpretation of the corresponding terms in the European Convention on Human Rights and in relevant texts adopted by the EU or its Member States. 
(9) It is considered necessary to prohibit exports and imports of equipment which has no practical use other than for the purpose of capital punishment or for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
(10) It is also necessary to impose controls on exports of certain goods which could be used not only for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, but also for legitimate purposes. These controls should apply to goods that are primarily used for law enforcement purposes and, unless such controls prove disproportionate, to any other equipment or product that could be abused for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, taking into account its design and technical features. 
(11) As regards law enforcement equipment, it should be noted that Article 3 of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials [4] provides that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty. The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders in 1990, provide that, in carrying out their duty, law enforcement officials should, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms. 
(12) In view of this, the Basic Principles advocate the development of non-lethal incapacitating weapons for use in appropriate situations, while admitting that the use of such weapons should be carefully controlled. In this context, certain equipment traditionally used by the police for self-defence and riot-control purposes has been modified in such a way that it can be used to apply electric shocks and chemical substances to incapacitate persons. There are indications that, in several countries, such weapons are abused for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
(13) The Basic Principles stress that law enforcement officials should be equipped with equipment for self-defence. Therefore, this Regulation should not apply to trade in traditional equipment for self-defence, such as shields. 
(14) This Regulation should also apply to trade in some specific chemical substances used to incapacitate persons. 
(15) As regards leg-irons, gang-chains and shackles and cuffs, it should be noted that Article 33 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners [5] provides that instruments of restraint shall never be applied as a punishment. Furthermore, chains and irons are not to be used as restraints. It should also be noted that the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners provide that other instruments of restraint shall not be used except as a precaution against escape during a transfer, on medical grounds as directed by a medical officer, or, if other methods of control fail, in order to prevent a prisoner from injuring himself or others, or from damaging property. 
(16) Taking into account the fact that some Member States have already prohibited exports and imports of such goods, it is appropriate to grant Member States the right to prohibit exports and imports of leg-irons, gang-chains and portable electric shock devices other than electric shock belts. Member States should also be empowered to apply export controls on handcuffs having an overall dimension, including chain, exceeding 240 mm when locked, if they so wish. 
(17) This Regulation shall be construed as not affecting the existing rules on export of tear gases and riot control agents [6], of firearms, of chemical weapons and of toxic chemicals. 
(18) It is appropriate to provide for specific exemptions from the export controls in order not to impede the functioning of the police forces of the Member States and the execution of peace keeping or crisis management operations and, subject to review at a later stage, in order to allow transit of foreign goods. 
(19) The Guidelines to the EU Policy toward third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment provide, inter alia, that the Heads of Mission in third countries will include in their periodic reports an analysis of the occurrence of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the State of their accreditation, and the measures taken to combat it. It is appropriate for the competent authorities to take these and similar reports made by relevant international and civil society organisations into account when deciding on requests for authorisations. Such reports should also describe any equipment used in third countries for the purpose of capital punishment or for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
(20) In order to contribute to the abolition of the death penalty in third countries and to the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, it is considered necessary to prohibit the supply to third countries of technical assistance related to goods which have no practical use other than for the purpose of capital punishment or for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
(21) The measures of this Regulation are intended to prevent both capital punishment and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in third countries. They comprise restrictions on trade with third countries in goods that could be used for the purpose of capital punishment or for the purpose of torture and other cruel, degrading or inhuman treatment or punishment. It is not considered necessary to establish similar controls on transactions within the Community as, in the Member States, capital punishment does not exist and Member States will have adopted appropriate measures to outlaw and prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
(22) The aforementioned Guidelines state that, in order to meet the objective of taking effective measures against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, measures should be taken to prevent the use, production and trade of equipment which is designed to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is up to the Member States to impose and enforce the necessary restrictions on the use and production of such equipment. 
(23) In order to take into account new data and technological developments, the lists of goods covered by this Regulation should be kept under review and provision should be made for a specific procedure to amend these lists. 
(24) The Commission and the Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation. 
(25) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [7]. 
(26) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. 
(27) Nothing in this Regulation constrains any powers under and pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code [8] and its implementing provisions, as laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 [9]. 
(28) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Goods that could be used for the purpose of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
Article 5 
Export authorisation requirement 
1. For any export of goods that could be used for the purpose of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, listed in Annex III, an authorisation shall be required, irrespective of the origin of such goods. However no authorisation shall be required for goods which only pass through the customs territory of the Community, namely those which are not assigned a customs-approved treatment or use other than the external transit procedure within Article 91 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, including storage of non-Community goods in a free zone of control type I or a free warehouse. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to exports to those territories of Member States which are both listed in Annex IV and are not part of the customs territory of the Community, provided that the goods are used by an authority in charge of law enforcement in both the country or territory of destination and the metropolitan part of the Member State to which that territory belongs. Customs or other relevant authorities shall have the right to verify whether this condition is met and may decide that, pending such verification, the export shall not take place. 
3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to exports to third countries, provided that the goods are used by military or civil personnel of a Member State, if such personnel is taking part in an EU or UN peace keeping or crisis management operation in the third country concerned or in an operation based on agreements between Member States and third countries in the field of defence. Customs and other relevant authorities shall have the right to verify whether this condition is met. Pending such verification, the export shall not take place. 
Article 6 
Criteria for granting export authorisations 
1. Decisions on applications for authorisation for the export of goods listed in Annex III shall be taken by the competent authority on a case by case basis, taking into account all relevant considerations, including in particular, whether an application for authorisation of an essentially identical export has been dismissed by another Member State in the preceding three years. 
2. The competent authority shall not grant any authorisation when there are reasonable grounds to believe that goods listed in Annex III might be used for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including judicial corporal punishment, by a law enforcement authority or any natural or legal person in a third country. 
The competent authority shall take into account: 
- available international court judgements, 
- findings of the competent bodies of the UN, the Council of Europe and the EU, and reports of the Council of Europe's European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment and Punishment and of the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 
Other relevant information, including available national court judgements, reports or other information prepared by civil society organisations and information on restrictions on exports of goods listed in Annexes II and III applied by the country of destination, may be taken into account. 
Article 7 
National measures 
1. Notwithstanding the provisions in Articles 5 and 6, a Member State may adopt or maintain a prohibition on the export and import of leg irons, gang chains and portable electric shock devices. 
2. A Member State may impose an authorisation requirement on the export of handcuffs which have an overall dimension including chains, measured from the outer edge of one cuff to the outer edge of the other cuff, exceeding 240 mm when locked. The Member State concerned shall apply Chapter III and IV to such handcuffs. 
3. Member States shall notify the Commission of any measures adopted pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2. Existing measures shall be notified by 30 July 2006. Subsequent measures shall be notified before they enter into force. 
CHAPTER IV

1. An authorisation for export and import and for the supply of technical assistance shall be granted only by the competent authority of the Member State listed in Annex I where the applicant is established. 
2. Applicants shall supply the competent authority with all relevant information on the activities for which an authorisation is required. 
Article 9 
Authorisations 
1. Authorisations for export and import shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex V and shall be valid throughout the Community. The period of validity of an authorisation shall be from three to twelve months with a possible extension of up to 12 months. 
2. The authorisation may be issued by electronic means. The specific procedures shall be established on a national basis. Member States availing themselves of this option shall inform the Commission. 
3. Authorisations for export and import shall be subject to any requirements and conditions the competent authority deems appropriate. 
4. The competent authorities, acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an export authorisation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authorisation which they have already granted. 
Article 10 
Customs formalities 
1. When completing customs formalities, the exporter or importer shall submit the duly completed form set out in Annex V as proof that the necessary authorisation for the export or import concerned has been obtained. If the document is not filled out in an official language of the Member State where the customs formalities are being completed, the exporter or importer may be required to provide a translation into such official language. 
2. If a customs declaration is made concerning goods listed in Annexes II or III, and it is confirmed that no authorisation has been granted pursuant to this Regulation for the intended export or import, the customs authorities shall detain the goods declared and draw attention to the possibility to apply for an authorisation pursuant to this Regulation. If no application for an authorisation is made within six months of time after the detention, or if the competent authority dismisses such an application, the customs authorities shall dispose of the detained goods in accordance with applicable national legislation. 
Article 11 
Notification and consultation requirement 
1. The authorities of the Member States, as listed in Annex I, shall notify all other authorities of the Member States and the Commission, as listed in that Annex, if they take a decision dismissing an application for an authorisation under this Regulation and if they annul an authorisation they have granted. The notification shall be made not later than 30 days of the date of the decision. 
2. The competent authority shall consult the authority or authorities which, in the preceding three years, dismissed an application for authorisation of an import or export or the supply of technical assistance under this Regulation, if it receives an application concerning an import or export or the supply of technical assistance involving an essentially identical transaction referred to in such earlier application and considers that an authorisation should, nevertheless, be granted. 
3. If, after such consultations, the competent authority decides to grant an authorisation, it shall immediately inform all the authorities listed in Annex I of its decision and explain the reasons for its decision, submitting supporting information as appropriate. 
4. The refusal to grant an authorisation, if it is based on a national prohibition in accordance with Article 7(1), shall not constitute a decision dismissing an application within the meaning of paragraph 1. 
CHAPTER V

4. Except for the supply of information mentioned in paragraph 2 to the authorities of the other Member State and to the Commission, this Article shall be without prejudice to applicable national rules concerning confidentiality and professional secrecy. 
5. The refusal to grant an authorisation, if it is based on a national prohibition adopted in accordance with Article 7(1), shall not constitute an authorisation refused within the meaning of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article. 
Article 14
