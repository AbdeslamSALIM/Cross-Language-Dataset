Risk reduction measures for the environment (1, 2) 
1. The competent authorities in the Member States concerned should lay down, in the permits issued under Council Directive 96/61/EC [7], conditions, emission limit values or equivalent parameters or technical measures regarding dibutylphthalate, in order for the installations concerned to operate according to the best available techniques (hereinafter BAT) by the end of October 2007, taking into account the technical characteristic of the installations concerned, their geographical location and the local environmental conditions. 
2. Member States should carefully monitor the implementation of BAT regarding dibutylphthalate and report any important developments to the Commission in the framework of the exchange of information on BAT. 
SECTION 2 
3,4-DICHLOROANILINE 
(CAS No 95-76-1; EINECS No 202-448-4) 
Risk reduction measures for workers (3) and the environment (4, 5) 
3. The employers using 3,4-dichloroaniline in production and further processing for the uses indicated as a concern in the risk assessment should take note of any sector specific guidance for cleaning, maintenance and repair work developed at national level based on the practical non-binding guidance, available from the Commission as provided for in Article 12(2) of Council Directive 98/24/EC [8]. 
The legislation currently in force at Community level for plant protection products (Council Directive 91/414/EEC [9]) and for biocides (Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [10]) is considered to give an adequate framework to limit the risks of the substance to the extent needed and shall apply. 
Within this framework: 
4. The information from the risk assessment of 3,4-dichloroaniline released from diuron used as a herbicide on sealed surfaces should be considered. 
5. Misuse of diuron in small packages should be prevented.
