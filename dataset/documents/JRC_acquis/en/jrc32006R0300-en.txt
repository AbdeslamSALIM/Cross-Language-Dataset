Council Regulation (EC) No 300/2006 of 30 January 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain industrial, agricultural and fishery products 
Council Regulation (EC) No 300/2006 
of 30 January 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on certain industrial, agricultural and fishery products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) It is in the interest of the Community to suspend partially or totally the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties for a number of new products not listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 [1]. 
(2) A number of products which are referred to in the said Regulation should be withdrawn from the list in the Annex because it is no longer in the Community's interest to maintain suspension of autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties or because the description needs to be altered in order to take account of technical product developments and economic trends on the market. 
(3) Accordingly, products whose description needs to be altered should be regarded as new products. 
(4) For ease of comprehension, in view of the large number of amendments coming into force on 1 January 2006, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should be replaced by a completely new version with effect from that date. 
(5) The validity period of the measure should be 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008, in order to be able to carry out economic examinations of the individual suspensions in that period. Eight years of experience have shown the necessity to provide for an expiry date to the suspensions listed in the Annex to this Regulation to ensure account is taken of technological and economic changes. This should not exclude the premature termination of certain measures or their continuation beyond that period, if economic reasons are submitted, in accordance with the principles laid down in the Commission Communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas [2]. 
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(7) In view of the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely upon the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. 
(8) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 January 2006, it should enter into force immediately, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 shall be replaced by the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
The temporary suspensions of the autonomous duties of the Common Customs Tariff for the products set out in the Annex shall apply from 1 January 2006. They shall expire on 31 December 2008, unless the Council of the European Union decides otherwise. 
Article 3 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
It shall apply from 1 January 2006. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 30 January 2006. 
For the Council 
The President
