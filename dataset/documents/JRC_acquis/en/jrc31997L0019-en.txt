5. SPECIFICATIONS 
5.1. All vehicles must be so constructed and/or equipped as to offer effective protection over their whole width against underrunning from the rear by a vehicle of categories M1 and N1 (2). 
5.2. Any vehicle in one of the categories M1, M2, M3, N1, O1 or O2 (3) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in 5.1: 
- if it satisfies the conditions set out in 5.3, or 
- if the ground clearance of the rear part of the unladen vehicle does not exceed 55 cm over a width which is not shorter than that of the rear axle by more than 10 cm on either side (excluding any tyre bulging close to the ground). 
Where there is more than one rear axle, the width to be considered is that of the widest. 
This requirement must be satisfied at least on a line at a distance of not more than 45 cm from the rear extremity of the vehicle. 
5.3. Any vehicle in one of the categories N2, N3, O3 or O4 (4) will be deemed to satisfy the condition set out in 5.1 provided that: 
- the vehicle is equipped with a special rear underrun protective device in accordance with the requirements of 5.4, or 
- the vehicle is so designed and/or equipped at the rear that, by virtue of their shape and characteristics, its component parts can be regarded as replacing the rear underrun protective device. Components whose combined function satisfies the requirements set out in 5.4 are considered to form a rear underrun protective device. 
5.4. A device for protection against underrunning from the rear, hereinafter referred to as 'device`, generally consists of a cross-member and linking components connected to the chassis side-members or to whatever replaces them. 
It must have the following characteristics: 
5.4.1. the device must be fitted as close to the rear of the vehicle as possible. When the vehicle is unladen (5) the lower edge of the device must at no point be more than 55 cm above the ground; 
5.4.2. the width of the device must at no point exceed the width of the rear axle measured at the outermost points of the wheels, excluding the bulging of the tyres close to the ground, nor must it be more than 10 cm shorter on either side. Where there is more than one rear axle, the width to be considered is that of the widest; 
5.4.3. the section height of the cross-member must be not less than 10 cm. The lateral extremities of the cross-member must not bend to the rear or have a sharp outer edge; this condition is fulfilled when the lateral extremities of the cross-member are rounded on the outside and have a radius of curvature of not less than 2,5 mm; 
5.4.4. the device may be so designed that its position at the rear of the vehicle can be varied. In this event, there must be a guaranteed method of securing it in the service position so that any unintentional change of position is precluded. It must be possible for the operator to vary the position of the device by applying a force not exceeding 40 daN; 
5.4.5. the device must offer adequate resistance to forces applied parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, and be connected, when in the service position, with the chassis side-members or whatever replaces them. 
This requirement will be satisfied if it is shown that both during and after the application the horizontal distance between the rear of the device and the rear extremity of the vehicle does not exceed 40 cm at any of the points P1, P2 and P3. In measuring this distance, any part of the vehicle which is more than 3 m above the ground when the vehicle is unladen must be excluded; 
5.4.5.1. points P1 are located 30 cm from the longitudinal planes tangential to the outer edges of the wheels on the rear axle; points P2, which are located on the line joining points P1, are symmetrical to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle at a distance from each other of 70 to 100 cm inclusive, the exact position being specified by the manufacturer. The height above the ground of points P1 and P2 must be defined by the vehicle manufacturer within the lines that bound the device horizontally. The height must not, however, exceed 60 cm when the vehicle is unladen. P3 is the centre-point of the straight line joining points P2; 
5.4.5.2. a horizontal force corresponding to 12,5 % of the maximum technically permissible mass of the vehicle but not exceeding 2,5 × 104N must be applied successively to both points P1 and to point P3; 
5.4.5.3. a horizontal force corresponding to 50 % of the maximum technically permissible mass of the vehicle but not exceeding 10 × 104 N must be applied successively to both points P2; 
5.4.5.4. the forces specified in 5.4.5.2 and 5.4.5.3 above must be applied separately. The order in which the forces are applied may be specified by the manufacturer; 
5.4.5.5. whenever a practical test is performed to verify compliance with the abovementioned requirements, the following conditions must be fulfilled: 
5.4.5.5.1. the device must be connected to the chassis side-members of the vehicle or to whatever replaces them; 
5.4.5.5.2. the specified forces must be applied by rams which are suitably articulated (e.g. by means of universal joints) and must be parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle via a surface not more than 25 cm in height (the exact height must be indicated by the manufacturer) and 20 cm wide, with a radius of curvature of 5 ± 1 mm at the vertical edges; the centre of the surface is placed successively at points P1, P2 and P3. 
5.5. By way of derogation from the abovementioned requirements, vehicles of the following categories need not comply with the requirements of this Annex as regards rear underrun protection: 
- tractors for semi-trailers, 
- 'slung` trailers and other similar trailers for the transport of logs or other very long items, 
- vehicles for which rear underrun protection is incompatible with their use. 
6. EC TYPE-APPROVAL MARKING 
6.1. Every rear underrun protective device conforming to the type approved pursuant to this Directive as a separate technical unit shall bear an EC type-approval mark. 
6.2. This mark shall consist of a rectangle surrounding the letter 'e` followed by the distinguishing number or letters of the Member State which has granted type-approval:
