Council Regulation (EC) No 941/2005 
of 30 May 2005 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 establishing a quota system in relation to the production of potato starch 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament [1], 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 [2] fixes the potato starch quotas for producer Member States for the 2002/2003, 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 marketing years. 
(2) Under Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 the three-yearly quotas are to be allocated to producer Member States on the basis of a report from the Commission to the Council. The recent changes in the common agricultural policy and production in the Member States which joined the Community on 1 May 2004 should be taken into account to this end. Pending indication of the initial effects on the sector, the existing quotas for the 2004/2005 marketing year should therefore be rolled over for a further two years. 
(3) Producer Member States should allocate their quotas for a period of two years among all potato starch manufacturers on the basis of the quotas for the 2004/2005 marketing year. 
(4) Quantities used by potato starch manufacturers in excess of the sub-quotas available in the 2004/2005 marketing year are to be deducted in the 2005/2006 marketing year in accordance with Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The European Economic and Social Committee has given its opinion [3], 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 are hereby replaced by the following: 
"Article 2

2. Each producer Member State referred to in the Annex shall allocate its quota among potato starch manufacturers for use in the 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 marketing years on the basis of the sub-quotas available to each manufacturer in 2004/2005, subject to application of the second subparagraph. 
The sub-quotas available to each manufacturer for the 2005/2006 marketing year shall be adjusted to take account of any amount used in excess of quota during the 2004/2005 marketing year in accordance with Article 6(2). 
Article 3 
1. No later than 30 September 2006, the Commission shall present to the Council a report on the allocation of quota within the Community, accompanied by appropriate proposals.
