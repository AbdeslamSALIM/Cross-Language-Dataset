Commission Decision 
of 17 August 2006 
on the financing of expenditure on computer support and communication measures in the field of animal health and welfare for 2006 
(2006/575/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field [1], and in particular Articles 17, 37 and 37a thereof; 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30 March 2004 on the introduction of the Traces system and amending Decision 92/486/EEC [2] makes it compulsory for the Member States to participate in the system from 31 December 2004. Provision must be made for the expenditure needed to update the system in line with the development of the relevant veterinary legislation and the development of Traces, especially in the field of risk assessment. Given the technical demands connected with the availability and stability of the Traces production environment as well as security requirements, computer equipment must be acquired and a dedicated monitoring and maintenance team must be put in place specifically for the system. The everyday use of the system also calls for reinforced logistical support to be made available, taking account of experience acquired. The Community’s financial participation is based on Articles 37 and 37a of Decision 90/424/EEC. 
(2) The notification system introduced under Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982 on the notification of animal diseases within the Community [3] by Commission Decision 2005/176/EC of 1 March 2005 laying down the codified form and the codes for the notification of animal diseases pursuant to Directive 82/894/EEC [4] must be kept up to date technically. The Community’s financial participation is based on Article 37 of Decision 90/424/EEC. 
(3) Only the study to draw up specifications for a navigation system provided for by Commission Decision 2005/607/EC of 5 August 2005 on the financing of expenditure on computer support and communication measures in the field of animal health and welfare for 2005 [5] has been started. It is therefore necessary to reprogramme the study on the use of satellitenavigation technology to improve animal protection in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005 of 22 December 2004 on the protection of animals during transport and related operations and amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1255/97 [6]. The Community’s financial participation is based on Article 17 of Decision 90/424/EEC. 
(4) The animalprotection information policy also calls for the communication of technical and scientific developments in this area and requires the European Union’s trading partners to be made more aware of the issue of livestock welfare. The Community’s financial participation is based on Article 17 of Decision 90/424/EEC. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
