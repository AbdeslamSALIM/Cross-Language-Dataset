Commission Regulation (EC) No 615/2005 
of 21 April 2005

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 [2] lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 [3] lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention. 
(3) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 65000 tonnes of common wheat held by the Slovak intervention agency. 
(4) Special rules must be laid down to ensure that the operations are properly carried out and monitored. To that end, securities should be lodged to ensure that the goals of the operation are achieved without excessive cost to the operators. Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
(5) To forestall reimportation, refunds should be awarded only for exportation to certain third countries. 
(6) The second paragraph of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 allows the successful exporting tenderer to be reimbursed the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the actual place of exit, up to a certain ceiling. In view of Slovakia’s geographical location, this provision should be applied.
