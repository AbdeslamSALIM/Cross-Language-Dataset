Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 
110 
- Objectives of the proposal 
The objective of this proposal is to fix, for the commercial most important fish stocks in the Baltic Sea, the fishing opportunities for Member States for 2006. 
120 
- General context 
In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Fisheries Policy shall ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. An important tool to achieve these objectives is the annual fixing of the fisheries opportunities in the form of total allowable catches (TACs), quotas and fishing effort limits. The fishing opportunities have until this year been implemented by a single Council Regulation (so-called TAC and quota Regulation). However, in the contents of simplification and clarification, the fixing of fishing opportunities for 2006 is proposed implemented by two separate Regulations, one covering the Baltic Sea and one all other areas. 
The scientific advice on fishing opportunities in 2006 in the Baltic Sea was delivered by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in June. On the basis of the scientific advice the Community discussed in September the TACs and quotas and associated condition with the Russian Federation within the framework of the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC). The recommendations on TACs and the allocation to the two Parties adopted by the IBSFC reflect the discussion and are in accordance with the Common Fisheries Policy. 
The enlargement of the Community in 2004 left in reality the IBSFC with only two Parties, the Community and Russia. The Community has withdrawn from the IBSFC and the organisation will in practise cease to exist by the end of 2005. The recommendations adopted by IBSFC are therefore not binding to the Community after 2005. However, there are no reasons for not following the recommendations and the TACs and quotas presented in this proposal reflect the IBSFC recommendations. 
The proposal covers three sections of importance for the management of the Baltic fisheries in 2006. A section fixing the TACs and quotas, a section limiting the fishing effort and a section laying down associated technical and control measures. 
- 130 Existing provisions in the area of the proposal 
The fishing opportunities and the allocation to Member States are subject to the provisions of annual regulations. The latest is the Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 of 22 December 2004 fixing for 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community water and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required. Of relevance to management of the fisheries in the Baltic Sea is also Council Regulation (EC) No 88/98 of 18 December 1997 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound.140 
- Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union 
The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy and is consistent with the Community's policy on sustainable developments. 
2. CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
- Consultation of interested parties 
All three main elements of the proposal have been subject to consultations with the Fishing sector, NGO's dealing with fisheries issues in the Baltic Sea, and Member States concerned. 
The fishing sector and the NGO's were consulted on the TACs and quotas at a workshop organised by the DG-Fish in Brussels on 23 February. The scientific basis for the proposal was presented by ICES and DG-Fish explained its position on the level of TACs and quotas for 2006. There was general support to DG-Fish's position although the fishing sector argued for a somewhat higher TAC for sprat than advised by ICES. 
The main discussion was on the TACs for the two cod stocks. Both cod stocks are overfished and especially the stock in the eastern Baltic are exploited at unsustainable levels. ICES has recommended a substantial reduction in the fishing on the two stocks to ensure a recovery of the stocks to levels within safe biological limits. Implementing the reduction required to rebuild the stocks within one year would remove the economic basis for the fishing sector and would undermine the management system. DG-Fish had therefore suggested a long-term approach where the level of fishing is gradually reduced to sustainable levels. The approach as well as the TACs following from applying the approach was supported by the sector. 
Member States were consulted in the margin of the IBSFC meeting in September and all Member States concerned expressed their support to the TACs suggested by the Commission. 
Regarding the measures concerning fishing effort and control, the sector, NGOs and Member States have been consulted on several occasions and the elements included in the proposal reflects comments made especially be the fishing sector. 
- Collection and use of expertise 
The Community requests, each year, ICES and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) for scientific advice on the state of important fish stocks. The advice received covers all Baltic stocks for which TACs are proposed. The proposed TACs are based on the advice but do not necessary follow the advice to the letter. For the sprat stock the proposed TAC is set above the level advised by scientists. The recommendation from ICES corresponds to a substantial reduction in the TAC. In accordance with the general policy of reducing the year to year variation in the fishing possibilities the proposed TAC reflects a smaller reduction than recommended by ICES. According to the predictions made by ICES the stock is in a healthy state and can sustain the proposed TAC. 
For the cod stocks the proposed TACs reflects a long-term approach whereby the TACs and fishing effort is gradually reduced to sustainable levels over a number of years. In parallel to this proposal the Commission will table a proposal for a long-term management plan for the fisheries on the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea. The central element of the plan is a gradual reduction of fishing effort to long-term sustainable levels that will provide high and stable yields. The proposed TACs do therefore not follow the ICES catch advice but reflect the gradual approach to be applied in the long-term management plan. 
Main organisations/experts consulted 
The scientific organisations consulted were the International Council for the Exploitation of the Seas (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF). 
- Impact assessment 
The proposed measures will, if implemented, result in an overall increase in fishing opportunities for Community vessels in the Baltic Sea. The fishing possibilities on cod and some of the herring stocks will increase and only for the sprat stock the fishermen will face lower quotas. The first hand value of landings from the Baltic is therefore, assuming unchanged prices, expected to increase in 2006. 
The proposal does not only reflect a short term decisions but is also part of a longer term approach whereby the level of fishing is gradually reduced to long-term sustainable levels. 
The approach taken in the proposal will therefore in the medium to long term result in reduced fishing effort but stable or increasing quotas. The long-term consequences of the approach are therefore predicted to be reduced impact on the environment as a consequence of the decline in fishing effort, reductions in the catching sector in terms of number of vessels and/or in the average fishing effort per vessel, and unchanged or increased landings. 
3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL 
- Legal basis 
The legal basis for this proposal is Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, and in particular Article 20 thereof. 
4. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION 
The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. 
5. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
- Detailed Explanation 
The proposal fixes for 2006 the fishing opportunities for Member States fishing in the Baltic Sea. The proposal furthermore introduces transitional technical and control measures to be applied in 2006. 
The TACs and quotas allocated to Member States are given in Annex I. The proposed figures reflect the scientific advice and the recommendations adopted by IBSFC at its meeting in September 2005. 
The TACs and quotas for the two cod stocks are closely linked to the fishing effort limits laid down in Annex II and point 5 of Annex III. The TACs are only acceptable if the restrictions in periods where cod fishing is allowed proposed in Annex II and the associated control measures in point 5 of Annex III are adopted. 
The transitional technical measures in Annex III (except point 8) represent important measures currently not included in the technical measures regulation for the Baltic Sea (Council Regulation (EC) No 88/98). The Commission has presented proposal for a new technical measures regulation which include all these measures. It is expected that the proposal will be adopted by the Council in November. In that case the technical provisions in Annex III can be deleted from this proposal. 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2006 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy[1], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/1996 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas[2], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. 
(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunity limits by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of these opportunities to Member States. 
(3) In order to ensure effective management of the fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established. 
(4) The principles and certain procedures for fishery management need to be laid down at Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the vessels flying their flag. 
(5) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities. 
(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified. 
(7) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1434/98 of 29 June 1998 specifying conditions under which herring may be landed for industrial purposes other than direct human consumption[3], does not ensure that the catches of herring are limited to the catch limits fixed for the species. It is therefore necessary to introduce transitional measures ensuring an appropriate monitoring and counting of herring in unsorted landings. With such measures in place it is not necessary to maintain the provisions laid down in the said Regulation. 
(8) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with the Community legislation on the subject, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels[4], Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish[5], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy[6], Council Regulation (EC) No 88/98 of 18 December 1997 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound[7], Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems[8], and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels[9], Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic[10]. 
(9) In order to contribute to the conservation of fish stocks, certain supplementary measures on control and technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2006. 
(10) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2006. Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community,

b. Method for Repairing the "BACOMA" exit window. 
[pic] 
i. Clean the hole by melting the ends of the twine around the edge of the hole to prevent the twines from un-braiding. 
ii. Count the meshes to be replaced. Prepare a patch using knotless braided single twine that is the same material, diameter and strength of the net needing to be patched. 
iii. The patch should be two meshes larger in each direction than the cleaned-up hole to provide sufficient netting to overlap the edges of the hole. 
iv. Clean the patch by melting the ends of the twine around the edge of the patch. 
v. Lay the patch over the hole and lace it to the existing netting using braided twine, as shown in the illustration. 
vi. Make sure to lace the crosses of the netting together. 
vii. Continue lacing around the hole so that you have at least two rows of lacing around the patch. 
viii. The patched hole will resemble this illustration when finished.
