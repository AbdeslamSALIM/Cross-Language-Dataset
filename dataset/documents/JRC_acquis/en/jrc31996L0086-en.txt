PART II 
LIST OF SUBSTANCES AND SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR THE VARIOUS CLASSES 
CLASS 1 EXPLOSIVE SUBSTANCES AND ARTICLES 
Replace marginals 2100 to 2199 by the following: 
1. List of substances and articles 
2100 (1) Among the substances and articles covered by the title of Class 1, only those listed in marginal 2101 or assigned to an n.o.s. entry or to the entry '0190 samples, explosive` in marginal 2101 are to be accepted for carriage. These substances and articles are only to be accepted for carriage subject to the conditions set out in marginals 2100 (2) to 2116, Appendix A.1 and Annex B. They are then considered as substances and articles of this Directive. 
(2) Class 1 comprises: 
(a) Explosive substances: solid or liquid substances (or mixtures of substances) capable by chemical reaction of producing gases at such a temperature and pressure and at such a speed as to cause damage to the surroundings. 
Pyrotechnic substances: substances or mixtures of substances designed to produce an effect by heat, light, sound, gas or smoke or a combination of these as the result of non-detonating self-sustaining exothermic chemical reactions. 
Note: 1. Explosive substances which are unduly sensitive or are liable to spontaneous reaction are not to be accepted for carriage. 
2. Substances which are not themselves explosive but which may form an explosive mixture of gas, vapour or dust are not substances of Class 1. 
3. Also excluded from Class 1 are: water- or alcohol-wetted explosives the water or alcohol content of which exceeds the limits indicated in marginal 2101 and those containing plasticizers - these explosives are assigned to Class 4.1 (marginal 2401, 21°, 22° and 24°) - and those explosives which, on the basis of their predominant danger, are assigned to Class 5.2. 
(b) Explosive articles: articles containing one or more explosive substances and/or pyrotechnic substances. 
Note: Devices containing explosive and/or pyrotechnic substances in such small quantity or of such a character that their inadvertent or accidental ignition or initiation during carriage would not cause any manifestation external to the device by projection, fire, smoke, heat or loud noise are not subject to the requirements of Class 1. 
(c) Substances and articles not mentioned under (a) or (b) above which are manufactured with a view to producing a practical effect by explosion or a pyrotechnic effect. 
(3) Explosive substances and articles shall be assigned to a name in marginal 2101 in accordance with the test methods for the determination of explosive properties and the classification procedures set out in Appendix A.1 and they shall meet the conditions appropriate to that name or shall be assigned to an n.o.s. entry in marginal 2101 in accordance with these test methods and classification procedures. 
Samples of new or existing explosive substances or articles carried for purposes including: testing, classification, research and development, quality control, or as a commercial sample, other than initiating explosive, may be assigned to the entry '0190 Samples, explosive`, item 51° of marginal 2101. 
Assignment of substances and articles not mentioned by name to an n.o.s. entry or to the entry '0190 Samples, explosive` shall be made by the competent authority of the country of origin. 
Substances and articles which are assigned to an n.o.s. entry or to the entry '0190 Samples, explosive` as well as certain substances the carriage of which is subject to a specific authorization by the competent authority according to the notes inserted in the list of substances and articles of marginal 2101 may be carried only with the approval of the competent authority of the country of origin and under the conditions laid down by that authority. 
The approval shall be issued in writing. 
(4) Substances and articles of Class 1, other than empty packagings, uncleaned, of 91°, shall have been assigned to a division in accordance with paragraph (6) and to a compatibility group in accordance with paragraph (7). The division shall be based on the results of the tests described in Appendix A.1 applying the definitions in paragraph (6). The compatibility group shall be determined in accordance with the definitions in paragraph (7). The classification code shall consist of the division number and the compatibility group letter. 
(5) Substances and articles of Class 1 are assigned to packing group II (see Appendix A.5). 
(6) Definition of divisions 
1.1 Substances and articles which have a mass explosion hazard. (A mass explosion is an explosion which affects almost the entire load virtually instantaneously). 
1.2 Substances and articles which have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard. 
1.3 Substances and articles which have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard: 
(a) combustion of which gives rise to considerable radiant heat; or(b) which burn one after another, producing minor blast or projection effects or both. 
1.4 Substances and articles which present only a slight risk in the event of ignition or initiation during carriage. The effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire shall not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package. 
1.5 Very insensitive substances having a mass explosion hazard which are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of carriage. As a minimum requirement they shall not explode in the external fire test. 
1.6 Extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosion hazard. The articles contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation. 
Note: The risk from articles of Division 1.6 is limited to the explosion of a single article. 
(7) Definition of compatibility groups of substances and articles: 
A Primary explosive substance 
B Article containing a primary explosive substance and not having two or more effective protective features. Some articles, such as detonators for blasting, detonator assemblies for blasting and primers, cap-type, are included, even though they do not contain primary explosives. 
C Propellant explosive substance or other deflagrating explosive substance or article containing such explosive substance 
D Secondary detonating explosive substance or black powder or article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance, in each case without means of initiation and without a propelling charge, or article containing a primary explosive substance and having two or more effective protective features 
E Article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance, without means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing a flammable liquid or gel or hypergolic liquids)F Article containing a secondary detonating explosive substance with its own means of initiation, with a propelling charge (other than one containing a flammable liquid or gel or hypergolic liquids) or without a propelling charge 
G Pyrotechnic substance, or article containing a pyrotechnic substance, or article containing both an explosive substance and an illuminating, incendiary, tear- or smoke-producing substance (other than a water-activated article or one which contains white phosphorus, phosphides, a pyrophoric substance, a flammable liquid or gel or hypergolic liquids) 
H Article containing both an explosive substance and white phosphorus 
J Article containing both an explosive substance and a flammable liquid or gel 
K Article containing both an explosive substance and a toxic chemical agent 
L Explosive substance or article containing an explosive substance and presenting a special risk (e.g. due to water activation or the presence of hypergolic liquids, phosphides or a pyrophoric substance) necessitating isolation of each type 
N Articles containing only extremely insensitive detonating substances 
S Substance or article so packed or designed that any hazardous effects arising from accidental functioning are confined within the package unless the package has been degraded by fire, in which case all blast or projection effects are limited to the extent that they do not significantly hinder or prevent fire-fighting or other emergency response efforts in the immediate vicinity of the package. 
Note: 1. Each substance or article, packed in a specified packaging, may be assigned to one compatibility group only. Since the criterion of compatibility group S is empirical, assignment to this group is necessarily linked to the tests for assignment of a classification code. 
2. Articles of compatibility groups D or E may be fitted or packed together with their own means of initiation provided that such means have at least two effective protective features designed to prevent an explosion in the event of accidental functioning of the means of initiation. Such packages shall be assigned to compatibility groups D or E. 
3. Articles of compatibility groups D or E may be packed together with their own means of initiation, which do not have two effective protective features (i.e. means of initiation assigned to compatibility group B), provided that they comply with the requirements of marginal 2104 (6). Such packages shall be assigned to compatibility groups D or E. 
4. Articles may be fitted or packed together with their own means of ignition provided that the means of ignition cannot function during normal conditions of carriage. 
5. Articles of compatibility groups C, D and E may be packed together. Such packages shall be assigned to compatibility group E. 
(8) Articles of compatibility group K, in accordance with paragraph (7), shall not be accepted for carriage. 
(9) For the purposes of the requirements of this Class and by derogation from marginal 3510 (3), the term 'package` shall also include an unpackaged article in so far as that article is accepted for carriage unpackaged. 
2101 (1) The substances and articles of Class 1 to be accepted for carriage are listed in Table 1 below. Explosive substances and articles listed in marginal 3170 can be assigned to the various names in this marginal only if their properties, composition, construction and anticipated use correspond to one of the descriptions contained in Appendix A.1. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
2. Conditions of carriage 
A. Packages 
1. General conditions of packing 
2102 (1) All explosive substances and articles, as prepared for carriage, shall have been classified in accordance with the procedures detailed in marginal 2100. 
(2) All packagings for Class 1 goods should be so designed and constructed that: 
(a) they will protect the explosives, prevent them escaping and cause no increase in the risk of unintended ignition or initiation when subjected to normal conditions of carriage including foreseeable changes in temperature, humidity and pressure; 
(b) the complete package can be handled safely in normal conditions of transport; and(c) the packages will withstand any loading imposed on them by foreseeable stacking to which they will be subject during transport so that they do not add to the risk presented by the explosives, the containment function of the packagings is not harmed, and they are not distorted in a way or to an extent which will reduce their strength or cause instability of a stack. 
(3) The packages shall conform to the requirements of Appendices A.5 or A.6, in particular to the requirements for the testing of packagings in Section IV of these appendices, subject to marginals 3500 (12) and 3512 (5). 
(4) In accordance with the provisions of marginals 2100 (5), 3511 (2) and 3611(2) packagings or IBCs of packing group II marked with the letter 'Y` shall be used for substances and articles of Class 1. 
(5) The closure device of packagings containing liquid explosives shall ensure a double protection against leakage. 
(6) The closure device of metal drums shall include a suitable gasket; if a closure device includes a screw-thread, the ingress of explosive substances into the screw-thread shall be prevented. 
(7) Packagings for water soluble explosives shall be water resistant. Packagings for desensitized or phlegmatized substances shall be closed to prevent changes in concentration during carriage. 
(8) When the packaging includes a double envelope filled with water which may freeze during transport, a sufficient quantity of an anti-freeze agent shall be added to the water to prevent freezing. Anti-freeze that could create a fire hazard because of its inherent flammability shall not be used. 
(9) Nails, staples and other closure devices made of metal without protective covering shall not penetrate to the inside of the outer packaging unless the inner packaging adequately protects the explosives against contact with the metal. 
(10) Inner packagings, fittings and cushioning materials and the placing of explosive substances or articles in packages shall be accomplished in a manner which prevents the explosive substance from becoming loose in the outer packaging under normal conditions of carriage. Metallic components of articles shall be prevented from making contact with metal packagings. Articles containing explosive substances not enclosed in an outer casing shall be separated from each other in order to prevent friction and impact. Padding, trays, partitioning in the inner or outer packaging, mouldings or receptacles may be used for this purpose. 
(11) Packagings shall be made of materials compatible with, and impermeable to, the explosives contained in the package, so that neither interaction between the explosives and the packaging materials, nor leakage, causes the explosive to become unsafe to transport, or the hazard division or compatibility group to change. 
(12) The ingress of explosive substances into the recesses of seamed metal packagings shall be prevented. 
(13) Plastics packagings shall not be liable to generate or accumulate sufficient static electricity so that a discharge could cause the packaged explosive substances or articles to initiate, ignite or function. 
(14) Large and robust explosives articles, normally intended for military use, without their means of initiation or with their means of initiation containing at least two effective protective features, may be carried unpackaged. When such articles have propelling charges or are self-propelled, their ignition systems shall be protected against stimuli encountered during normal conditions of carriage. A negative result in Test Series 4 on an unpackaged article indicates that the article can be considered for transport unpackaged. Such unpackaged articles may be fixed to cradles or contained in crates or other suitable handling devices. 
(15) Explosive substances shall not be packed in inner or outer packagings where the differences in internal and external pressures, due to thermal or other effects, could cause an explosion or rupture of the package. 
(16) Whenever loose explosive substances or the explosive substance of an uncased or partly cased article may come into contact with the inner surface of metal packagings (1A2, 1B2, 4A, 4B and metal receptacles), the metal packaging shall be provided with an inner liner or coating [see marginal 3500 (2)]. 
2. Special conditions of packing2103 (1) Substances and articles shall be packed as indicated in marginal 2101, Table 1, columns 4 and 5, and as set out in detail in paragraphs (3), Table 2 and (4), Table 3. 
(2) Notwithstanding the explosive packing methods required in marginal 2101, Table 1, columns (4) and (5) and in paragraph (3) below, Table 2, EP 01 may be adopted for any explosive substance or article provided the product as packaged has been tested by the competent authority of the country of origin and proved to present no greater hazard than that presented when the product is packed by the method specified in Table 1, column 4. 
(3) Table 2: Packing Methods 
Note: 1. In Table 2, the following convention is used: 
Packing method EP 01 - reserved for methods requiring competent authority approval; 
Packing methods EP 10 to EP 29 - reserved for explosive substances; andPacking methods EP 30 onwards - reserved for explosive articles.

CLASS 2 GASES 
Replace marginals 2200 to 2299 by the following: 
1. List of substances 
2200 (1) Among the substances and articles covered by the title of Class 2, those which are listed in marginal 2201 or are covered by a collective entry of that marginal are subject to the conditions set out in marginals 2200 (2) to 2250 and to the provisions of this Annex and of Annex B. They are then considered as substances and articles of this Directive. 
Note: For the quantities of substances and for articles listed in marginal 2201, which are not subject to the provisions for this Class, either in this Annex or in Annex B, see marginal 2201a. 
(2) A gas is a substance which: 
(a) at 50 °C has a vapour pressure greater than 300 kPa (3 bar); or(b) is completely gaseous at 20 °C at the standard pressure of 101,3 kPa. 
Note: 1052 Hydrogen fluoride shall nevertheless be classified in Class 8, item 6°. 
(3) The title of Class 2 covers pure gases, mixtures of gases, mixtures of one or more gases with one or more other substances and articles containing such substances. 
Note: 1. A pure gas may contain other components deriving from its production process or added to preserve the stability of the product, provided that the level of these components does not change its classification or its conditions of carriage, such as filling ratio, filling pressure or test pressure. 
2. N.o.s. entries in marginal 2201 cover pure gases as well as mixtures. 
3. For the classification of solutions and mixtures (such as preparations and wastes) see also marginal 2002(8) and paragraphs (6) and (7) of this marginal. 
(4) Substances and articles of Class 2 are subdivided as follows: 
1° Compressed gases: gases having a critical temperature below 20 °C; 
2° Liquefied gases: gases having a critical temperature of 20 °C or above; 
3° Refrigerated liquefied gases: gases which when carried are partially liquid because of their low temperature; 
4° Gases dissolved under pressure: gases which when carried are dissolved in a solvent; 
5° Aerosol dispensers and receptacles, small, containing gas (gas cartridges); 
6° Other articles containing gas under pressure; 
7° Non-pressurized gases subject to special requirements (gas samples); 
8° Empty receptacles and empty tanks. 
(5) Substances and articles, classified under the various items of marginal 2201 are assigned to one of the following groups according to their hazardous properties, as follows (): 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
For gases and gas mixtures presenting according to the criteria, hazardous properties associated with more than one group, the groups designated by letter T take precedence over all other groups. The groups designated by letter F take precedence over the groups designated by letters A or O. 
Note: Corrosive gases are considered to be toxic, and are therefore assigned to the group TC, TFC or TOC see paragraph (7). 
(6) If a mixture of Class 2, specifically named under an item number and group comes into a different item number and/or group on the basis of criteria mentioned in paragraphs (4) and (7), this mixture shall be classified according to the criteria and assigned to an appropriate n.o.s. entry. 
(7) Substances and articles not specifically named in marginal 2201 shall be classified in accordance with paragraphs (4) and (5). 
According to their hazardous properties, the following criteria shall apply: 
Asphyxiant gases 
Gases which are non-oxidizing, non-flammable and non-toxic and which dilute or replace oxygen normally in the atmosphere. 
Flammable gases 
Gases which at 20 °C and the standard pressure of 101,3 kPa: 
(a) are ignitable when in a mixture of 13 % or less by volume with air; or(b) have a flammable range with air of at least 12 percentage points regardless of the lower flammable limit. 
Flammability shall be determined by tests or by calculation in accordance with methods adopted by ISO (see ISO 10156:1990). 
Where insufficient data are available to use these methods, tests by a comparable method recognized by the competent authority of the country of origin may be used. 
Oxidizing gases 
Gases, which may, generally by providing oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other material more than air does. Oxidizing ability is determined either by tests or by calculation methods adopted by ISO (see ISO 10156:1990). 
Toxic gases 
Note: Gases meeting the criteria for toxicity in part or completely owing to their corrosivity are to be classified as toxic. See also the criteria under the heading 'Corrosive` for a possible subsidiary corrosivity risk. 
Gases which: 
(a) are known to be so toxic or corrosive to humans as to pose a hazard to health; or(b) are presumed to be toxic or corrosive to humans because they have a LC50 value for acute toxicity equal to or less than 5 000 ml/m³ (ppm) when tested in accordance with marginal 2600(3). 
In the case of gas mixtures (including vapours of substances from other classes) the following formula may be used: 
%gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% 
1LC50 Toxic(mixture) =n fi Ói = 1T i%gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: fi = mole fraction of the ith component substance of the mixtureTi = toxicity index of the ith component substance of the mixture. The Ti equals the LC50 value as found in ISO:10298:1995. When no LC50 value is listed in ISO:10298:1995, a LC50 value available in scientific literature shall be used. When the LC50 value is unknown, the toxicity index is determined by using the lowest LC50 value of substances of similar physiological and chemical effects, or through testing if this is the only practical possibility. 
Corrosive gases 
Gases or gas mixtures meeting the criteria for toxicity completely owing to their corrosivity are to be classified as toxic with a subsidiary corrosive risk. 
A gas mixture that is considered to be toxic due to the combined effects of corrosivity and toxicity has a subsidiary risk of corrosivity when the mixture is known by human experience to be destructive to the skin, eyes or mucous membranes or when the LC50 value of the corrosive components of the mixture is equal to or less than 5 000 ml/m³ (ppm) when the LC50 is calculated by the formula: 
%gt%START OF GRAPHIC%gt% 
1LC50 Corrosive(mixture) =n fci Ói = 1Tci%gt%END OF GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: fci = mole fraction of the ith corrosive component substance of the mixtureTci = toxicity index of the ith corrosive component substance of the mixture. The Tci equals the LC50 value as found in ISO:10298:1995. When no LC50 value is listed in ISO:10298:1995, a LC50 value available in scientific literature shall be used. When the LC50 value is unknown, the toxicity index is determined by using the lowest LC50 value of substances of similar physiological and chemical effects, or through testing if this is the only practical possibility. 
(8) Chemically unstable substances of Class 2 are not to be handed over for carriage, unless the necessary steps have been taken to prevent all possibility of a dangerous reaction e.g. decomposition, dismutation or polymerisation under normal conditions during transport. To this end particular care shall be taken to ensure that receptacles and tanks do not contain any substances liable to promote these reactions.

'(¹) LD50 toxicity data for a number of common pesticides may be obtained from the most current edition of the document The WHO Recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard and Guidelines to Classification available from the International Programme on Chemical Safety, World Health Organization (WHO), CH-1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland. While that document may be used as a source of LD50 data for pesticides, its classification system should not be used for purposes of transport classification of, or assignment of packing groups to, pesticides, which should be in accordance with the provisions of this Directive.`2.5 Second sentence, replace as follows: 
'A solid substance should be tested if at least 10 % of its total mass is likely to be dust in a respirable range, e.g. the aerodynamic diameter of that particle-fraction is 10 ìm or less. A liquid substance should be tested if a mist is likely to be generated in a leakage of the transport containment. Both for solid and liquid substances more than 90 % (by mass) of a specimen prepared for inhalation toxicity should be in the respirable range as defined above.`(3) Add at the end: 
'Methods for determining oral and dermal toxicity of mixtures5. When classifying and assigning the appropriate packing group to mixtures in Division 6.1 in accordance with the oral and dermal toxicity criteria (2.3 and 2.4 above), it is necessary to determine the acute LD50 of the mixture. 
5.1. If a mixture contains only one active substance, and the LD50 of that constituent is known, in the absence of reliable acute oral and dermal toxicity data on the actual mixture to be transported, the oral or dermal LD50 may be obtained by the following method: 
LD50 value of preparation = %gt%NUM%gt%LD50 value of active substance × 100%gt%DEN%gt%percentage of active substance by mass 5.2. If a mixture contains more than one active constituent, there are three possible approaches that may be used to determine the oral or dermal LD50 of the mixture. The preferred method is to obtain reliable acute oral and dermal toxicity data on the actual mixture to be transported. If reliable, accurate data is not available, then either of the following methods may be performed: 
(a) Classify the formulation according to the most hazardous constituent of the mixture as if that constituent were present in the same concentration as the total concentration of all active constituents; or 
(b) Apply the formula: 
%gt%NUM%gt%CA%gt%DEN%gt%TA+%gt%NUM%gt%CB%gt%DEN%gt%TB+%gt%NUM%gt%CZ%gt%DEN%gt%TZ=%gt%NUM%gt%100%gt%DEN%gt%TMwhere: 
C = the percentage concentration of constituent A, B, ... Z in the mixtureT = the oral LD50 values of constituent A, B, ... ZTM = the oral LD50 value of the mixtureNote: This formula can also be used for dermal toxicities provided that this information is available on the same species for all constituents. The use of this formula does not take into account any potentiation or protective phenomena.`(6) Amend to read:

211 230 The discharge pipes of shells shall be capable of being closed by blank flanges or some other equally reliable device. For shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3°, these blank flanges or other equally reliable devices may be fitted with pressure-release openings of a maximum diameter of 1,5 mm. 
211 231 Shells intended for the carriage of liquefied gases may be provided with, in addition to the openings prescribed in marginal 211 131, openings for the fitting of gauges, including pressure gauges, and thermometers and with bleed holes, as required for their operation and safety. 
211 232 Safety devices shall meet the following requirements: 
(1) Filling and discharge openings of shells intended for the carriage of liquefied flammable and/or toxic gases shall be equipped with an instant-closing internal safety device which closes automatically in the event of an unintended movement of the shell or of fire. It shall also be possible to operate the closing device by remote control. 
(2) All openings, other than those accommodating safety valves and than closed bleed holes, of shells intended for the carriage of liquefied flammable and/or toxic gases shall, if their nominal diameter is more than 1,5 mm, be equipped with an internal shut-off device. 
(3) By derogation from the provisions of (1) and (2), shells intended for the carriage of deeply-refrigerated flammable and/or toxic liquefied gases may be equipped with external devices in place of internal devices if the external devices afford protection against external damage at least equivalent to that afforded by the wall of the shell. 
(4) If the shells are equipped with gauges, the latter shall not be made of a transparent material in direct contact with the substance carried. If there are thermometers, they shall not project directly into the gas or liquid through the shell wall. 
(5) Shells intended for the carriage of 1053 hydrogen sulphide or 1064 methyl mercaptan of 2°TF or 1017 chlorine, 1076 phosgene or 1079 sulphur dioxide of 2°TC shall not have an opening below the surface level of the liquid. In addition, the cleaning apertures (fist holes) referred to in marginal 211 132 shall not be permitted. 
(6) Filling and discharge openings situated in the upper part of shells shall be equipped with, in addition to what is prescribed in (1), a second, external, closing device. This device shall be capable of being closed by a blank flange or some other equally reliable device. 
(7) By derogation from the provisions in paragraphs (1), (2) and (6), for receptacles as defined in marginals 2211 (1), (2), (3) and (5) which form a battery-vehicle, the required closing devices may be provided for within the manifolding arrangement. 
211 233 Safety valves shall meet the following requirements: 
(1) Shells intended for the carriage of gases of 1°, 2° or 4° may be provided with not more than two safety valves whose aggregate clear cross-sectional area of passage at the seating or seatings shall be not less than 20 cm² per 30 m³ or part thereof of the receptacle's capacity. 
These valves shall be capable of opening automatically at a pressure of between 0,9 and 1,0 times the test pressure of the shell to which they are fitted. They shall be of such a type as to resist dynamic stresses, including liquid surge. The use of dead-weight or counter-weight valves is prohibited. 
Shells intended for the carriage of gases of 1° to 4° indicated by the letter T in marginal 2201, shall not have safety valves unless the safety valves are preceded by a bursting disc. In the latter case the arrangement of the bursting disc and the safety valve shall be satisfactory to the competent authority. 
Where tank-vehicles are intended for carriage by sea, the provisions of this paragraph shall not prohibit the fitting of safety valves conforming to the regulations governing that mode of transport (). 
(2) Shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be equipped with two independent safety valves, each so designed as to allow the gases formed by evaporation during normal operation to escape from the shell in such a way that the pressure does not at any time exceed by more than 10 % the working pressure indicated on the shell. One of the two safety valves may be replaced by a bursting disc which shall be such as to burst at the test pressure. In the event of loss of the vacuum in a double-walled shell, or of destruction of 20 % of the insulation of a single-walled shell, the safety valve and the bursting disc shall permit an outflow such that the pressure in the shell cannot exceed the test pressure. 
(3) The safety valves of shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be capable of opening at the working pressure indicated on the shell. They shall be so designed as to function faultlessly even at their lowest working temperature. The reliability of their operation at that temperature shall be established and checked either by testing each valve or by testing a specimen valve of each design-type. 
Thermal insulation 
211 234 (1) If shells intended for the carriage of gases of 2° are equipped with thermal insulation, such insulation shall consist of either: 
- a sun shield covering not less than the upper third but not more than the upper half of the shell surface and separated from the shell by an air space at least 4 cm across; or- a complete cladding, of adequate thickness, of insulating materials. 
(2) Shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be thermally insulated. Thermal insulation shall be ensured by means of a continuous sheathing. If the space between the shell and the sheathing is under vacuum (vacuum insulation), the protective sheathing shall be so designed as to withstand without deformation an external pressure of at least 100 kPa (1 bar) (gauge pressure). By derogation from marginal 211 102 (2) (a), external and internal reinforcing devices may be taken into account in the calculations. If the sheathing is so closed as to be gas-tight, a device shall be provided to prevent any dangerous pressure from developing in the insulating layer in the event of inadequate gas-tightness of the shell or of its items of equipment. The device shall prevent the infiltration of moisture into the heat-insulating sheath. 
(3) Shells intended for the carriage of liquefied gases having a boiling point below P 182 °C at atmospheric pressure shall not include any combustible material either in the thermal insulation or in the means of attachment to the frame. 
The means of attachment for shells of vacuum insulated tanks may, with the approval of the competent authority, contain plastics substances between the shell and the sheathing. 
211 235 (1) A battery-vehicle contains elements which are linked to each other by a manifold and permanently fixed to a transport unit. The following elements are considered to be elements of a battery-vehicle: 
- cylinders as defined in marginal 2211 (1); 
- tubes as defined in marginal 2211 (2); 
- pressure drums as defined in marginal 2211 (3); 
- bundles of cylinders (also known as frames) as defined in marginal 2211 (5);

- gases of 1° having a critical temperature of P 50 °C or above; and 
- gases of 2° having a critical temperature below 70 °C 
- gases of 4° 
shall be such that, when the shell is filled to the maximum mass of the contents per litre of capacity, the pressure reached in the shell by the substance at 55 °C for shells with thermal insulation or 65 °C for shells without thermal insulation does not exceed the test pressure. 
(3) The test pressure for shells intended for the carriage of gases of 2° having a critical temperature of 70 °C or above will be: 
(a) If the shell is equipped with thermal insulation, at least equal to the vapour pressure, reduced by 0,1 MPa (1 bar) of the liquid at 60 °C, but not less than 1 MPa (10 bar); 
(b) If the shell is not equipped with thermal insulation, at least equal to the vapour pressure, reduced by 0,1 MPa (1 bar), of the liquid at 65 °C, but not less than 1 MPa (10 bar). 
The maximum permissible mass of contents per litre of capacity in kg/litre prescribed for the degree of filling is calculated as follows: 
maximum permissible mass of contents 
per litre of capacity = 0,95 × density of the liquid phase at 50 °C;

In the event of loss of the vacuum in a double-walled shell, or of destruction of 20 % of the insulation of a single-walled shell, the safety valve and the bursting disc shall permit an outflow such that the pressure in the shell cannot exceed the test pressure. 
(3) The safety valves of shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be capable of opening at the working pressure indicated on the shell. They shall be so designed as to function faultlessly even at the lowest working temperature. The reliability of their operation at that temperature shall be established and checked either by testing each valve or by testing a specimen valve of each design type. 
Thermal insulation212 234 (1) If shells intended for the carriage of gases of 2° are equipped with thermal insulation, such insulation shall consist of either: 
- a sun shield covering not less than the upper third but not more than the upper half of the shell surface and separated from the shell by an air space at least 4 cm across; or- a complete cladding, of adequate thickness, of insulating materials. 
(2) Shells intended for the carriage of gases of 3° shall be thermally insulated. The thermal insulation shall be protected by means of a continuous sheathing. If the space between the shell and the sheathing is under vacuum (vacuum insulation), the protective sheathing shall be so designed as to withstand without deformation an external pressure of at least 100 kPa (1 bar) (gauge pressure). By derogation from marginal 212 102 (2) (a) external and internal reinforcing devices may be taken into account in the calculations. If the sheathing is so closed as to be gas-tight, a device shall be provided to prevent any dangerous pressure from developing in the insulating layer in the event of inadequate gas-tightness of the shell or of its items of equipment. The device shall prevent the infiltration of moisture into the heat-insulating sheath. 
(3) Shells intended for the carriage of liquefied gases having a boiling point below P182 °C at atmospheric pressure shall not include any combustible material either in the thermal insulation or in the fastenings. 
The fastening for shells of vacuum insulated tanks may, with the approval of the competent authority, contain plastics substances between the shell and the sheathing.
