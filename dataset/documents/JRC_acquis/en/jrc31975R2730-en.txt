Regulation (EEC) No 2730/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on glucose and lactose 
REGULATION (EEC) No 2730/75 OF THE COUNCIL of 29 October 1975 on glucose and lactose 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof; 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission; 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1); 
Whereas, in order to avoid technical difficulties as regards customs treatment, the Council Decision of 12 December 1964 (2) on the introduction of some amendments to the Common Customs Tariff, provided for glucose, glucose syrup, lactose and lactose syrup to fall within one heading and for chemically pure glucose and lactose to fall within another; 
Whereas, however, glucose and lactose falling respectively within subheadings 17.02 B II and 17.02 A II are listed in Annex II to the Treaty and are therefore subject to the system of trade with third countries provided for under the common organization of the markets to which they belong, while chemically pure glucose and lactose not listed in Annex II to the Treaty are subject to the system of customs duties, the economic incidence of which can be appreciably different; 
Whereas this situation creates difficulties which are the greater in that the products in question, whatever their degree of purity, are derived from the same basic products ; whereas the criterion for customs classification between those products which are and those which are not chemically pure is a 99 % degree of purity ; whereas products with a slightly higher or slightly lower degree of purity may have the same economic use ; whereas, therefore, the application of different systems leads to distortions of competition which are all the greater because of interchangeability; 
Whereas the only solution to these difficulties is to follow the Council Decision of 12 December 1964 by giving the products the same economic treatment whatever their degree of purity or, to the extent that this would appear adequate, by harmonizing the treatment given to the two groups of products; 
Whereas the Treaty does not specifically provide the authority needed to take such action ; whereas in these circumstances the necessary measures should be taken on the basis of Article 235 of the Treaty ; whereas the most appropriate measures are to extend to chemically pure glucose the treatment given to other glucose under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 (3) of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals, and to extend to chemically pure lactose the treatment given to other lactose under Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 (4) of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 740/75 (5),
