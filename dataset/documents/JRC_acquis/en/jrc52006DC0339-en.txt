COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION 
on the implementation of the Hercule programme and its extension during the period 2007-13 
Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 established a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule programme). It constitutes a basic act in accordance with Article 49 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. 
I. Assessment of the implementation of the Hercule programme 2004-05 [see annex][1]: 
Article 7(a) of Decision No 804/2004/EC requires the Commission to present OLAF's report on the implementation of the programme and the appropriateness of continuing it to the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2006. This communication presents the conclusions of the OLAF report, and on the basis of those conclusions presents a proposal for the amendment and extension of the decision currently in force. 
The conclusions of this assessment are as follows: 
- For “Technical assistance”, grants were awarded to 10 Member States, including four new Member States. The grants were for technical assistance to operations concerning: a) the fight against fraud, the total amount of which is estimated at approximately €800 000 000; b) the fight against the smuggling and counterfeiting of 100 million cigarettes; c) the fight against the smuggling of more than 2 billion litres of gasoline or alcohol. Furthermore, two international meetings were organised on the exchange of information in the field of technical assistance. The second meeting was attended by 109 participants representing 54 competent national authorities in the 25 Member States. 
- For “Training”, grants were awarded for 19 training activities, of which three were carried out in the new Member States. 2 236 participants from the 25 Member States, third countries and European institutions attended/benefited from the activities organised in this context. 
- For “Associations of European lawyers”, grants covering 28 activities were awarded 1 852 participants from the 25 Member States, five third countries and other European institutions attended/benefited from the activities organised in this context. 
A general reinforcement of the protection of the Community’s financial interests has been promoted across the territory of the Union and beyond its borders. Cooperation with national partners has been promoted and consolidated by means of targeted technical assistance on, among others, information exchanges and specialised technical knowledge; there has been constant improvement in the quality of training for those involved in the fight against fraud; also, thorough legal analysis has been carried out, leading to an improvement to Community legislation in this field. 
On the basis of this analysis, the report on the implementation of the Hercule programme makes the following recommendations: 
1. Extend the Hercule programme to ensure the consolidation of the work carried out so far and to enable the new Member States to benefit more from the opportunities offered by the programme. 
2. Appoint a coordinator or to establish a committee in charge of monitoring the implementation of the programme; identify indicators that would improve assessment of the activities of the programme; ensure the exchange of information so that impact assessments can be carried out in this field in the future; ensure the link between the programme objectives, the geographical distribution of the beneficiaries and the results obtained. 
3. Promote participation by beneficiaries from the new Member States and by previously unsuccessful interested parties to ensure that all the objectives of the programme are achieved. 
4. Ensure that the current appropriations for the budget lines concerned by the programme are maintained. If it becomes necessary for new activities to be included in the programme, the necessary expenditure must be added in a revised financial framework for the programme. 
5. Make the duration of the new Hercule programme longer than the three years provided for in the current programme. 
II. The proposal for a Decision amending and extending Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community’s financial interests (Hercule programme) focuses in particular on these recommendations. 
It also proposes that the programme be expanded to include contracts awarded in this field by means of invitations to tender, thereby covering all types of funding in the field of the protection of financial interests. The Hercule II programme should cover in particular activities in the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting. It will also be expanded to cover certain third countries. 
Annex: OLAF report “Report on the implementation of the “Hercule” Programme – Article 7(a) of PE/COUNCIL Decision (804/2004/EC) 21 April 2004”. 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 established a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule programme). The Hercule programme constitutes a basic act in accordance with Article 49 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom)No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities. 
The aim of the Hercule programme is to ensure similar and efficient levels of protection of the Community’s financial interests and the exchange of best practice. To this end, the programme provides grants for individual activities, such as studies, conferences or training, and provides operating grants for organisations active in this field, such as associations established to promote the protection of Community financial interests. 
In accordance with Article 7(a) of Decision No 804/2004/EC, OLAF has drawn up a report on the implementation of the programme and the appropriateness of continuing it. As the implementation report confirmed that the objective of the programme had been achieved, particularly in terms of improving the protection of the Community's financial interests, the conclusions of the report recommended the continuation of the programme. 
On the basis of the recommendations of this report, the Commission decided to submit a proposal to extend and amend Decision No 804/2004/EC to cover the period 2007-13. The main objective of the Hercule II programme remains unchanged, while the amendments introduced in the proposed decision focus on the following elements: 
- The introduction of “public procurement contracts” into the basic act, which at present covers grants only. In this way, all operational expenditure relating to general anti-fraud activities is included in a single basic act, thereby streamlining and simplifying the legal bases in force at present. These public procurement contracts will aim to attain the objectives of the programme, complementing those attained by means of calls for proposals. Article 280(3) of the EC Treaty requires the Member States, as part of the coordination of their action aimed at protecting the financial interests of the Community against fraud, to organise together with the Commission close and regular collaboration with the competent authorities. For its part, the Commission is required to put this collaboration into practice via activities such as the development and provision of specific IT tools, data exchange and processing, the purchase of specialised hardware and technical support for the monitoring of illegal activities, and the organisation of seminars and conferences, by the Commission (OLAF). The awarding of public procurement contracts in the field of the fight against fraud makes it possible to acquire goods and services (which remain the property of the Community) and to support coordination of activities with the Member States in this field. The public procurement contracts targeted by the Hercule programme cover the sectors “information support”, “technical assistance” and “training, seminars and conferences”. 
- In this context, it is judged appropriate to merge OLAF’s budget lines starting in 2007, with the exception of the “AFIS” budget line (No 24 02 03). In this way, the commitment appropriations and appropriations for expenditure relating to general anti-fraud activities will be covered by a single OLAF budget line for the period 2007-13. This will increase transparency in terms of the allocation of funds by means of grants or public procurement contracts and confirm the emphasis placed on the quality of submissions and on selection by competition. 
- Operating grants are removed from the basic act, as no such grants were awarded under the Hercule programme 2004-06. It was thus deemed appropriate for the financial resources available to be concentrated on the promotion of activities rather than the support of organisations. 
- The sectoral objectives of the programme are clearly defined. The overall objective of the fight against fraud and any other illegal activity detrimental to the Community's financial interests is achieved through specific objectives derived from the three sectors of activity, namely "Technical assistance", "Training, seminars and conferences” and “Information support”. 
- As a consequences of the increased efforts and commitment to combating cigarette smuggling, including the signature by the Commission and numerous Member States of an agreement with a major cigarette manufacturer, it is necessary to give a clearer expression of the objectives of the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting. This objective is in conformity with the conclusions of the risk assessment carried out by OLAF in collaboration with the Member States. An analysis carried out by OLAF of the risk of fraud reached the following conclusions: 1) the certainty of an increase in the smuggling of counterfeited cigarettes in the future; 2) the emergence of the production of counterfeited cigarettes on European territory; 3) the need for the competent national authorities to promote greater cooperation; 4) the identification of certain external borders as being “high-risk” in terms of their being routes for the import of counterfeited cigarettes onto the EU's internal market; 5) the heightened need for cooperation and support for the anti-fraud activities of the Member States in this field is illustrated by the signature by some Member States and the Commission of an agreement with a cigarette manufacturer on taking more rigorous action against the counterfeiting and smuggling of cigarettes. 
- Accession countries which signed the Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005 and the candidate countries can participate in the programme on the basis of a memorandum of understanding to be drawn up in accordance with the respective framework agreements. Moreover, in order to promote activities combating fraud and any other illegal activities detrimental to the Community's financial interests outside the territory of the European Union, including the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, expenditure relating to the participation of certain other third countries and the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy is also considered eligible. 
- Continuation of the programme will consolidate the progress made so far. An extension within the framework of the 2007-13 multiannual financial framework, or in any case beyond the three-year period covered by the Hercule programme, will thus ensure the continuity and stability of the anti-fraud activities of the Commission (OLAF). 
The assessment has also demonstrated the need to improve follow-up of the implementation of the programme, for example in the form of the establishment of a monitoring committee or the definition of indicators. These recommendations will be applied in the management of the programme but do not require a change in its legal basis.

Proposal for a 
DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
amending and extending Decision No 804/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote activities in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests (Hercule II programme) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and particularly Article 280 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[2], 
Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors[3], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the EC Treaty, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Community and the Member States have set themselves the objective of countering fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the Community's financial interests, including cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting. 
(2) Activities with the purpose of providing better information, carrying out studies and providing training or technical and scientific assistance help significantly to protect the Community's financial interests. 
(3) Support for such initiatives in the form of grants has made it possible in the past to enhance the activities of the Community and the Member States in terms of countering fraud and protecting the Community’s financial interests, and to achieve the objectives of the Hercule programme for the period 2004 to 2006. 
(4) Article 7(a) of Decision No 804/2004/EC requires the Commission to present OLAF's report on the implementation of the programme and the appropriateness of continuing it to the European Parliament and to the Council. The conclusions of the report state that the objectives established by the Hercule programme have been achieved. Recommendations have been made for the extension of the programme during the period 2007 to 2013. 
(5) To consolidate the activities of the Community and the Member States in the field of the protection of the Community’s financial interests, including the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting, the new programme should bring together all operational expenditure relating to the Commission’s (OLAF’s) general anti-fraud activities in a single basic act. 
(6) The awarding of grants and public procurement contracts to promote and implement the programme must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and its implementing rules. It was deemed appropriate to eliminate operating grants from the programme as they have not been used as a means of supporting initiatives in the past. 
(7) The accession countries who signed the Treaty of Accession on 25 April 2005 and the candidate countries are able to participate in the Hercule programme on the basis of a memorandum of understanding to be drawn up in accordance with the respective framework agreements,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term 
The Commission (OLAF) supplies Member States with the necessary support and multidisciplinary technical know-how to help them in their fight against fraud, including the fight against cigarette smuggling. It strives to contribute to the design of the European strategy in the fight against fraud and illegal activities and takes the necessary initiatives to strengthen the relevant legislation. 
In this context the main objectives are: 
1. to improve co-operation through a better understanding of the national, international and community mechanisms within the area of the fight against fraud, the Commission considers it essential to support anti-fraud measures of the Member States, including the fight against cigarette smuggling, in particular by co-financing training actions in the form of workshops, seminars, conferences and exchange of personnel.. 
2. to improve co-operation between the competent national authorities in the area of the fight against fraud. In this context, the Commission (OLAF) considers it is essential to support national anti-fraud services, in particular by co-financing the acquisition of advanced technical equipment to be used in the fight against fraud. 
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
Training, conferences and seminars in the area of the fight against fraud: The activity plays an important role in informing officials in the Member State’s Services about OLAF’s mission and the need to actively protect the Community’s financial interests. Complementary actions are founded by the AGIS and the FISCALIS programmes. 
Technical Assistance in the area of the fight against fraud: The activity plays an important role in supporting the national Law enforcement agencies (LEA) by offering the possibility to employ new means and methods in the fight against fraud and assist them throughout this fight. The activity reinforces also the cooperation amongst them by offering advanced technical means to combat fraud. Furthermore, it provides a forum for discussion on technical ways to fight fraud, including cigarette smuggling and corruption issues for which no other fore exist. Complementarity with the objectives and tasks of Europol will be kept under review to avoid any overlap between proposals under this programme and Europol’s role. 
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework 
Awareness raising, enhanced cooperation, number of participants trained, arising of new cooperation networks, organisation of meetings, dissemination of information, comparative law studies, enlargement of possibilities to approach technical difficulties, information on new approaches. 
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative) 
( Centralised Management 
( directly by the Commission 
( indirectly by delegation to: 
( executive Agencies 
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation 
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission 
( Shared or decentralised management 
( with Member states 
( with Third countries 
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify) 
Relevant comments: 
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
6.1. Monitoring system 
Monitoring and evaluation are on-going processes and are constantly reviewed. The monitoring system is fully operational from the outset and goes on right through the process until the final report. 
The types of evaluation required are as follows: 
• Ex-ante evaluation of each proposal by a Committee of people experienced in the field of that grant programme, and in budgetary matters. Each proposal is marked and weighted and final conclusions drawn at the Evaluation Committee meeting(s). 
• Evaluation gathered by the beneficiary based on a standard evaluation form provided by the Commission (OLAF). 
• On-the-spot evaluation to ensure the event takes place at all; that it covers the topics specified in the proposal, that it follows the project / programme given in the proposal. 
• On-the-spot evaluation to ensure the acquisition has taken place at all; ensuring that the equipment is in an operational state and complies with the provisions. In the framework of the controls also the national share is verified on a random base. 
• A final evaluation of the event, action, technical assistance by the Commission (OLAF). 
6.2. Evaluation 
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation 
In 2005, an internal ex-ante evaluation of the Hercule programme was based on the evaluation reports of projects carried out between 2003 and 2005. 
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) 
Lessons learnt form an integral part of every evaluation done. 
In order to improve the implementation of the programme regarding its activity areas, the results were used as a reference for future events. 
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation 
Ongoing (each project, each year) 
7. Anti-fraud measures 
In order to protect the European Community's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities, the Commission carries out on-the-spot checks and inspections under this programme in accordance with Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities. Where necessary, investigations must be conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and governed by Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
