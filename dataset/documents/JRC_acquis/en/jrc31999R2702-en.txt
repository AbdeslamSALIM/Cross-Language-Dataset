Council Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999 of 14 December 1999 on measures to provide information on, and to promote, agricultural products in third countries 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2702/1999 
of 14 December 1999 
on measures to provide information on, and to promote, agricultural products in third countries 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(2), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) Under current legislation the Community can conduct promotional measures in third countries for a limited number of agricultural products; the results so far have been very encouraging; 
(2) In view of the experience gained, the prospects for market growth both within and outside the Community and the new context of international trade, a consistent overall policy needs to be developed towards information and promotion on the markets of third countries; 
(3) Such a policy can usefully supplement and strengthen the measures undertaken by the Member States, especially by promoting the image of Community products on international markets as regards food quality and safety in particular; this activity, by helping to open up new markets, is also likely to have a multiplier effect on national and private initiatives; 
(4) The selection criteria for the products involved and markets must be identified; however, products qualifying for export refunds are not excluded from the system; 
(5) As a general rule, the Commission should provide only part of the requisite funding, so that the proposer organisations and Member States concerned can share the responsibility; however, in exceptional cases it may be appropriate not to require a financial contribution from the Member State concerned; 
(6) Provision should be made whereby the Commission of the European Communities, through the appropriate procedures, can delegate implementation of the measures to bodies with the necessary facilities and skills; 
(7) In view of the experience gained and the results achieved by the International Olive Oil Council in its promotional activities, provision should, however, be made to continue delegating to it measures falling within its sphere of responsibility; it should also be possible to seek the assistance of similar international organisations for other products; 
(8) To monitor the proper conduct of the programmes and the impact of the measures, provision should be made for effective monitoring by the Commission and the Member States and for evaluation of the results by an independent body; 
(9) As a result, Regulations (EC) No 136/66/EEC(4), (EEC) No 1308/70(5) and (EC) No 2275/96(6) should be amended; 
(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7), and it is appropriate therefore that those measures be adopted under the management procedure laid down in Article 4 of the said Decision. In this context the management committees concerned will act jointly,

Article 6 
Where measures are decided on in particular for the olive oil and table olive sector, the Community may carry them out through the International Olive Oil Council. 
In the case of other sectors, the Community may seek the help of international organisations offering similar guarantees. 
Article 7 
1. To carry out the measures referred to in Article 2(a), (b), (d) and (e) and subject to Article 6, the trade or inter-trade organisation or organisations representing the sector or sectors concerned shall draw up promotion and information programmes lasting no longer than three years and shall propose the name of a body which may be entrusted with implementing the programmes.

- the body or bodies responsible for evaluating the results of the measures implemented. 
2. The body or bodies responsible for implementing the measures referred to in Articles 7(1) and 8(1) shall have specialist knowledge of the products concerned and the targeted markets and have the resources to ensure that the measures are implemented as effectively as possible, taking account of the European dimension of these programmes.
