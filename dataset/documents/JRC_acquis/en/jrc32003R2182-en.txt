Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2182/2003 
of 8 December 2003 
adjusting with effect from 1 January 2004 the remuneration and pensions of officials and other servants of the European Communities and the weightings applied thereto 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities, and in particular Article 13 thereof, 
Having regard to the Staff Regulations of officials and the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities laid down by Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2265/2002(2), and in particular Articles 63, 64, 65, and 82 of the Staff Regulations, and the first paragraph of Article 20 and Article 64 of the Conditions of employment, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with the political agreement reached in the Council on 29 September 2003, the 2003 annual adjustment of remunerations on the basis of the current method should, by way of exception, take effect from 1 January 2004. The Commission has accordingly drafted a proposal for a Regulation extending Annex XI to the Staff Regulations until 30 June 2004. 
(2) A review of the remuneration of officials and other servants carried out on the basis of a report by the Commission has shown that the remuneration and pensions of officials and other servants of the Communities should be adjusted under the 2003 annual review. 
(3) The annual adjustment in respect of 2004 could entail the establishment before 31 December 2004 of new weightings with retroactive effect from 1 July 2004. 
(4) These new weightings could lead to retroactive adjustments to remuneration and pensions (positive or negative) in respect of the period of 2004 for which payments have already been made on the basis of this Regulation. 
(5) Provision should therefore be made for the payment of arrears in the event of an upward adjustment as a result of these weightings or for the recovery of sums overpaid in the event of a downward adjustment for the period between the effective date and the date of entry into force of the Council's decision on the annual adjustment in respect of 2004. 
(6) Provision should be made for the effects of any such recovery to be spread over a period of not more than 12 months following the date of entry into force of the Council's decision on the annual adjustment in respect of 2004,
