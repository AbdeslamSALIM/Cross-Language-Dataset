THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/492/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs(1), as last amended by the Directive 97/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(3), as last amended by the Directive 97/79/EC, and in particular Article 11(5) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 98/569/EC of 6 October 1998 laying down special conditions governing imports of live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods originating in Tunisia(4), states that the %quot%direction générale de la santé animale (DGSA) du ministère de l'agriculture%quot% is to be the competent authority in Tunisia for verifying and certifying compliance of live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods with the requirements of Directive 91/492/EEC. 
(2) Commission Decision 98/570/EC of 7 October 1998 laying down special conditions governing imports of fishery and aquaculture products originating in Tunisia(5), as last amended by Decision 1999/135/EC(6), states that the %quot%direction générale de la santé animale (DGSA) du ministère de l'agriculture%quot% is to be the competent authority in Tunisia for verifying and certifying compliance of fishery and aquaculture products with the requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC. 
(3) Following a restructuring of the Tunisian administration, the competent authority for verifying and certifying compliance of fishery and aquaculture products and bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods has changed to the %quot%direction générale des services vétérinaires (DGSV)%quot%. This new authority is capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force. 
(4) The wording of Decisions 98/569/EC and 98/570/EC should be aligned on the wording of more recently adopted Commission decisions, laying down special conditions governing imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods, fishery and aquaculture products originating in certain third countries. 
(5) Decisions 98/569/EC and 98/570/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
