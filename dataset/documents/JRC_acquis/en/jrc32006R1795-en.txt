THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products [1], and in particular, Article 7(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Decision 2004/859/EC of 25 October 2004 concerning the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Kingdom of Norway on Protocol 2 to the bilateral Free Trade Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway [2], and in particular Article 3 thereof, 
Whereas:

(2) Protocol 3 to the EEA Agreement, as amended by Decision 138/2004 of the EEA Joint Committee [5], provides for a zero duty applying to certain waters containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured, classified under CN code 22021000 and certain other non alcoholic beverages containing sugar, classified under CN code ex22029010. 
(3) The zero duty for the waters and other beverages in question has been temporarily suspended for Norway by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Kingdom of Norway on Protocol 2 to the bilateral free trade Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway [6], hereinafter referred to as %quot%the Agreement%quot%, approved by Council Decision 2004/859/EC. According to point IV of the Agreed Minutes of the Agreement, duty free imports of goods of the CN codes 22021000 and ex22029010 originating in Norway are to be permitted only within the limits of a duty free quota while a duty is to be paid for imports outside the quota allocation.

According to statistics provided to the Commission, the annual quota for 2006 for the products in question opened by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2028/2005 [7] has been exhausted on 31 October 2006. Pursuant to Point IV of the Agreed Minutes of the Agreement the tariff quota for 2007 should therefore be increased by 10 %.
