COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3602/92 of 14 December 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 27/85 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 laying down special measures in respect of olive oil 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 of 17 July 1984 laying down special measures in respect of olive oil (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 593/92 (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof, 
Whereas, under Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84, the Commission may take part in the discussions held by the agency's management; whereas the arrangements for such participation in the discussions of the four agencies should therefore be laid down; 
Whereas, under Article 1 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84, Member States shall act upon the agency's findings and shall regularly communicate to the Commission details of the action taken and the sanctions applied as a result of the agency's findings; whereas the intervals at which such communications are to be made and their content are to be laid down; 
Whereas experience has shown that the period provided for in Article 6 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 27/85 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2427/86 (4), within which the Commission is to take a decision with regard to the amount representing the agency's actual expenditure, is too short; whereas that period should therefore be extended; 
Whereas checks to ensure the correct application of Community rules imply an effort to guarantee the quality of olive oil; whereas, therefore, agencies should be allowed to take samples of the olive oil held by the operators covered by the control arrangements; 
Whereas the content of the agency's work schedule should be specified; 
Whereas the areas in which personnel responsible for control must have the necessary technical knowledge should be specified; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,
