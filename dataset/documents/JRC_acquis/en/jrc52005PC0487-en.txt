EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Council has to decide each year, on a proposal from the Commission, on the adjustment of the rate of contribution to the pension scheme effective from 1 July. | 
General context Under Article 83a(4) of the Staff Regulations the Commission has to present to the Council each year an updated version of the five-yearly actuarial assessment, in accordance with Annex XII to the Staff Regulations. Under Article 13 of Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has submitted the annual report on this assessment, which determines the rate of contribution required to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme. | 
Existing provisions in the area of the proposal A proposal is to be presented each year for adjusting the rate of contribution to the pension scheme. | 
Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. |

Summary of replies received and the way in which they have been taken into account The proposal takes account of the opinions of the parties consulted. | 
Collection and use of expertise | 
There was no need for external expertise. | 
Impact assessment - The purpose of the proposal is to adjust the rate of contribution to the pension scheme in accordance with the rules in force. - The rules in force permit no alternative. | 
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 
Summary of the proposed action In accordance with Annex XII to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has submitted a report on the actuarial assessment of the pension scheme. According to this assessment, the rate of contribution required to maintain actuarial balance of the pension scheme is 10.3 % of basic salary. Under Article 2(1) of Annex XII, the adjustment cannot lead to a contribution that is more than one percentage point above or below the valid rate of the previous year. However, under Article 2(2) of Annex XII, the adjustment taking effect on 1 July 2005 may not lead to a contribution higher than 10.25%. The Commission is therefore proposing to adjust the rate of contribution to 10.25% with effect from 1 July. | 
Legal basis Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities, and in particular Article 83a thereof and Annex XII thereto. | 
Subsidiarity principle The proposal concerns an area that falls within the exclusive competence of the Community. The principle of subsidiarity does not therefore apply. | 
Proportionality principle The proposal is consistent with the principle of proportionality for the following reasons: | 
- Article 83a of the Staff Regulations provides for a Council regulation. | 
- The proposal has no financial impact on expenditure. The impact on revenue results directly from the application of the adjustment method provided for in the Staff Regulations. | 
Choice of instruments | 
Proposed instrument: regulation. | 
Other instruments would have been inappropriate for the following reasons: - Article 83a of the Staff Regulations provides for a Council regulation. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS | 
The impact on revenue of the adjustment to the rate of contribution to the pension scheme is detailed in the financial statement annexed hereto. |
