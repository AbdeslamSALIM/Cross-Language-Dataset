COM(2006) 176 final 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The quota amount for certain autonomous Community tariff quotas is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period. In response to requests from several Member States, the Commission's departments, together with the government experts concerned, considered whether to open, increase or extend autonomous tariff quotas for certain industrial products. | 
General context On 20 December 1996 the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products so that Community demand for the products in question could be met under the most favourable conditions. New Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for such products. Discussions at meetings of the Economic Tariff Questions Group showed that the Member States were ready to open, increase or extend quotas for the products covered by the proposal for a Regulation, without disturbing the markets for such products. | 
Provisions in force in the field covered by the proposal Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 (OJ L 345, 31.12.1996) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 151/2006 (OJ L 25, 28.1.2006). | 
Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union The proposal is in line with agricultural, trade, entreprise, development and external relations policies. |

For that purpose new Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products. 
(2) The quota amount for an autonomous Community tariff quota is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period. Consequently, this quota amount should be increased. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point 1.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community.
