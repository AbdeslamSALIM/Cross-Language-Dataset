(Text with EEA relevance) 
1. Pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes, Portugal has decided to amend the public service obligations imposed in respect of scheduled air services operated between Lisbon/Bragança and Bragança/Vila Real/Lisbon. 
2. The public service obligations are as follows: 
- Minimum frequency: 
Two return flights a day, one with a stopover in Vila Real, from Monday to Friday. 
If there is a high demand for services, flights could also be operated at weekends. 
- Timetables: 
The operating conditions at Bragança and Vila Real aerodromes must be complied with. 
Passengers must be able to make a round trip between Bragança and Lisbon the same day with a stay of at least five hours in winter and seven hours in summer. 
- Type and capacity of aircraft used: 
Twin-engined turbofan aircraft which meet the performance requirements contained in Decree-Law No 289/03 of 14 November 2003, for Bragança and Vila Real aerodromes [1]. 
- Fares: 
A fully flexible return fare, and a range of special fares with special conditions adapted to demand (e.g. excursion, groups, events, etc.) must be offered for each of the following routes: 
- Lisbon — Bragança 
- Lisbon — Vila Real 
- Bragança — Vila Real 
- Continuity of service: 
Except in cases of force majeure, the number of flights cancelled for reasons directly attributable to the carrier must not exceed 3 % of the number of flights scheduled in any IATA scheduling season. 
The planned services must be guaranteed throughout one calendar year at least and, except in the case mentioned above, may be suspended only with six months' notice. 
- Flight marketing: 
Flights must be marketed using at least one computerised reservation system.
