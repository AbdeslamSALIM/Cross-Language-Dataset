(Case C-242/05) [1] 
Referring court 
Gerechtshof te 's-Hertogenbosch 
Parties 
Applicant: G.M. van de Coevering 
Defendant: Hoofd van het District Douane Roermond van de rijksbelastingdienst 
Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Gerechtshof te 's-Hertogenbosch — Interpretation of Articles 49 EC to 55 EC — National legislation providing for the levy of a tax on vehicles registered in the territory and on vehicles not registered but made available to persons residing in that Member State — Motor vehicle hired in another State by a person residing in the State in which the tax is levied — Full tax levied with no account taken of the duration of the hire or use of the vehicle on the territory of that State 
Operative part of the order 
Articles 49 EC to 55 EC preclude national legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires a natural person established in that Member State who hires a vehicle registered in another Member State to pay the full amount of registration tax on commencement of use of the highway in the first Member State by that vehicle, irrespective of the duration of the use of that highway, and denying the person in question any right to an exemption or a refund when it is neither intended that the vehicle essentially be used in the first Member State on a permanent basis nor is the vehicle in fact used in that manner.
