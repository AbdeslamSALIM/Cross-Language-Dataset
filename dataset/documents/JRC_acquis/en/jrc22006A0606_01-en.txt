(b) or the period elapsing between entering FSM EEZ and a transhipment; 
(c) or the period elapsing between entering FSM EEZ and a landing in the FSM port. 
2. All Community vessels authorised to fish in the waters of FSM under the Agreement shall be obliged to communicate their catches to the Executive Director in the following manner: 
(a) declarations shall include the catches made by the vessel during each trip. They shall be transmitted to the Executive Director by electronic means, with a copy to the Delegation, at the end of each trip and, in all cases, before the vessel leaves FSM EEZ. Electronic receipts shall be sent at once to the vessel by both addressees, with a copy to the other; 
(b) the original of the declarations sent electronically during the annual period of validity of the licence within the meaning of point 2(a) above shall be transmitted on a physical medium to the Executive Director within 45 days following the end of the last trip made during the said period. Hard copies shall be sent to the European Commission at the same time; 
(c) Community vessels shall declare their catches on the corresponding catch report forms, as provided in Appendix 2a or 2b, as appropriate. The words "Outside Federated States of Micronesia EEZ" shall be entered in the abovementioned catch report in respect of periods during which the vessel is not in the waters of FSM; 
(d) on the catch report form the Community vessels shall be required to report the date, time and position of the vessel for each set made by the vessel as well as full and complete information as to the catch for each set. If no sets were made by a vessel for a particular day, or if a set is made and no fish are caught, the vessel shall be required to report this information on the daily catch report form. On days when no fishing operations are conducted, before midnight local time of that day, the vessel must record on the catch report form the fact that no operations were conducted; 
(e) each Community vessel shall make the daily catch reports immediately available for inspection by enforcement officers and other individuals and entities authorised by NORMA; 
(f) for incidental by-catch of species other than tuna, the Community vessels shall report the species of fish taken and the size and quantity of each species by weight or number, as specified in the catch report form whether the catch is kept on board the vessel or was returned to the sea; 
(g) the catch report forms shall be filled in legibly on a daily basis and signed by the master of the ship. 
3. Where the provisions set out in this chapter are not complied with, FSM reserves the right to suspend the licence of the offending vessel until formalities have been completed and to apply the penalty laid down in applicable FSM laws and regulations. The European Commission shall be informed thereof. 
CHAPTER IV 
EMBARKING SEAMEN 
1. Each Community vessel fishing under the Agreement shall undertake to employ at least one FSM national as a crew member. Condition of service for FSM nationals should be as standard for the industry in the FSM. 
2. In case a Community vessel is not in the condition to employ one FSM national as a crew member and for reasons other than that referred to in point 8 below, ship owners shall be obliged to pay a lump sum equivalent to the wages of two crew members for the duration of the fishing season in the FSM EEZ. That sum shall be used for the training of seamen/fishermen in FSM and shall be paid into the Account named in Article 2(7) of the Protocol. 
3. Shipowners shall be free to select the seamen they take on board their vessels from the names on a list submitted by the Executive Director. 
4. The shipowner or agent shall inform the Executive Director of the names of FSM seamen taken on board the vessel concerned, mentioning their position in the crew. 
5. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work shall apply as of right to seamen signed on by Community vessels. This concerns in particular the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 
6. FSM seamen's employment contracts, a copy of which shall be given to the signatories, shall be drawn up between the shipowners' agent(s) and the seamen and/or their trade unions or representatives in consultation with the Executive Director. These contracts shall guarantee the seamen the social security cover applicable to them, including life insurance and sickness and accident insurance. 
7. FSM seamen's wages shall be paid by the shipowners. They shall be fixed, before licences are issued, by mutual agreement between the shipowners or their agents and the Executive Director. However, the wage conditions granted to FSM seamen shall not be lower than those applied to FSM crews and shall under no circumstances be below ILO standards. 
8. All seamen employed aboard Community vessels shall report to the master of the vessel designated on the day before their proposed embarkation date. Where a seaman fails to report at the date and time agreed for embarkation, shipowners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the seaman on board. The Executive Director shall be promptly notified of the payment. 
CHAPTER V 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS 
The Community vessels shall comply with the measures taken by the FSM and by the Parties to the Palau Arrangement regarding fishing gear and the technical specifications thereof and all other technical measures applicable to their fishing activities. 
CHAPTER VI 
OBSERVERS 
1. At the time of lodging a licence application, each Community vessel concerned shall contribute an observer placement fee as specified in Section 1(6)(h) of Chapter I of this Annex into the account named in Article 2(7) of the Protocol, specifically for the observer's programme. 
2. Community vessels authorised to fish in the FSM EEZ under the Agreement shall take on board observers appointed by NORMA on the terms set out below: 
(a) the Executive Director shall determine each year the scope of the programme for observation on board on the basis of the number of vessels authorised to fish in the waters under its jurisdiction and the state of the resources targeted by those vessels. It shall determine accordingly the number or percentage of vessels by category of fishery which shall be required to take an observer on board; 
(b) the Executive Director shall draw up a list of vessels designated to take an observer on board and a list of appointed observers. These lists shall be kept up to date. They shall be forwarded to the Commission as soon as they have been drawn up and every three months thereafter where they have been updated; 
(c) the Executive Director shall inform the shipowners concerned, or their agents, of his intentions to take on board an appointed observer on their vessels at the time the licence is issued, or no later than 15 days before the observer's planned embarkation date and whose name shall be notified as soon as possible. 
3. The time spent on board by observers shall be fixed by the Executive Director but, as a general rule, it should not exceed the time required to carry out their duties. The Executive Director shall inform the shipowners or their agents thereof when notifying them of the name of the observer appointed to be taken on board the vessel concerned. 
4. Within two weeks and giving 10 days' notice, the shipowners concerned shall make known at which FSM ports and on what dates they intend to take observers on board. 
5. Where observers are taken on board in a foreign port, their travel costs shall be borne by the shipowner. Should a vessel with an observer from FSM on board leave the FSM EEZ, all measures must be taken to ensure the observer's return to the FSM as soon as possible at the expense of the ship owner. 
6. If the observer is not present at the time and place agreed and during the six hours following the time agreed, shipowners shall be automatically absolved of their obligation to take the observer on board. 
7. Observers shall be treated as officers. They shall carry out the following tasks: 
(a) observe the fishing activities of the vessels; 
(b) verify the position of vessels engaged in fishing operations; 
(c) perform biological sampling in the context of scientific programmes; 
(d) note the fishing gear used; 
(e) verify the catch data for FSM EEZ recorded in the catch report; 
(f) verify the percentages of by-catches and estimate the quantity of discards of species of marketable fin-fish, crustaceans, cephalopods and marine mammals; 
(g) report fishing data once a week by radio, including the quantity of catches and by‚Äêcatches on board. 
8. Captains and masters shall permit authorised observers of the FSM to board the authorised vessels operating within the FSM EEZ and shall do everything in their power to ensure the physical safety and welfare of observers during performance of their duties: 
(a) the captain or master shall allow and assist such authorised observer to board the vessel for scientific, monitoring, and other functions; 
(b) the captain or master shall assist the observer to have full access and to use facilities and equipment on board the vessel, which the authorised observer may determine necessary to carry out the observer's duties; 
(c) observers shall have access to the bridge, fish on board and areas, which may be used to hold, process, weigh and store fish; 
(d) observers may remove a reasonable number of samples and shall have full access to the vessel's records, including its logs, catch reports, and documentation for the purpose of inspection and copying; and 
(e) observers shall be allowed to gather any other information relating to fisheries in the EEZ. 
9. While on board, observers shall: 
(a) take all appropriate steps to ensure that their presence on the vessel does not interfere in the normal operation of the vessel; 
(b) respect the material and equipment on board and the confidentiality of all documents belonging to the said vessel. 
10. At the end of the observation period and before leaving the vessel, the observer shall draw up an activity report to be signed in the presence of the master who may provide additional comments considered relevant, followed by the master's signature. Copies of the report shall be provided to the master when the observer is put ashore and to the Delegation. 
11. Shipowners shall bear the cost of accommodating observers in the same conditions as the officers on the vessel. 
12. The salary and social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the FSM Government. 
CHAPTER VII 
VESSEL IDENTIFICATION AND ENFORCEMENT 
1. For fisheries and marine safety purposes, every vessel shall be marked and identified in accordance with the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) approved standard specification for the marking and identification of fishing vessels. 
2. The name of the vessel will be printed clearly in Latin characters on the bow and the stern of the vessel. 
3. Any vessel not displaying its name and radio call sign or signal letters in the prescribed manner may be escorted to a FSM port for further investigation. 
4. A vessel operator shall ensure the continuous monitoring of the international distress and calling frequency (2182) kHz (HF), and/or the international safety and calling frequency (156,8) MHz (Channel 16, VHF-FM) to facilitate communication with the fisheries management, surveillance and enforcement authorities of the FSM Government. 
5. A vessel operator shall ensure that a recent and up to date copy of the International code of Signals (Interco) is on board and accessible at all times. 
CHAPTER VIII 
COMMUNICATION WITH PATROL VESSELS OF THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA 
Communication between the permitted vessels and the patrol vessels of the Government shall be made by international signal codes as follows: 
International Signal Code ‚Äî Meaning: 
L ‚Ä¶ | Stop immediately | 
SQ3 ‚Ä¶ | Stop or slow down, I wish to board your vessel |

QP ‚Ä¶ | We will lay our vessel alongside your vessel | 
CHAPTER IX 
MONITORING 
1. The European Commission shall keep an up-to-date list of the vessels to which a fishing licence has been issued under this Protocol. This list shall be notified to the FSM authorities responsible for fisheries inspection as soon as it is drawn up and each time it is updated. The ship owner may then obtain a certified copy of this list to be kept on board instead of the fishing licence until the licence has been issued. 
2. Entering and leaving the zone 
(a) Community vessels shall notify the Executive Director at least 24 hours in advance of their intention to enter and immediately upon departure from the FSM EEZ. As soon as the vessels enter the FSM EEZ, they shall inform the Executive Director by fax or e‚Äêmail in accordance with the specimen provided in Appendix 3 or by radio. 
(b) When notifying departure, vessels shall also communicate their position and the volume and species in catches kept on board in accordance with the specimen provided in Appendix 3. These communications shall be made preferably by fax, but failing this, in the case of vessels without a fax, by e-mail or by radio. 
(c) Vessels found to be fishing without having informed the Executive Director shall be regarded as vessels without a licence. 
(d) Vessels shall also be informed of the fax and telephone numbers and e-mail address of NORMA when the fishing licence is issued. 
3. Control procedures 
(a) Captains or masters of Community vessels engaged in fishing activities in the FSM EEZ shall allow and facilitate boarding and the discharge of their duties by any FSM authorised enforcement official responsible for the inspection and control of fishing activities at any time within the FSM EEZ or the Territorial Waters or internal waters of each State of the FSM. 
(b) Enforcement officials shall have full access to the vessel's records, including its logs, catch reports, documentation and any electronic device used for recording or storing data, and the captain or master of the vessel shall permit such authorised officials to make notation on any permit issued by NORMA or other documentation required under the Agreement. 
(c) The captain or master shall immediately comply with all reasonable instructions given by the authorised officials, and shall facilitate safe boarding, and facilitate the inspection of the vessel, gear, equipment, records, fish and fish products. 
(d) The vessel's captain, master or crew shall not assault, obstruct, resist, delay, refuse boarding, intimidate, or interfere with an authorised official in the performance of duties. 
(e) These officials shall not remain on board for longer than is necessary for the discharge of their duties. 
(f) Once the inspection has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel. 
4. Arrest of fishing vessels 
(a) The Executive Director shall inform the Delegation, within 48 hours, of all arrests and penalties imposed on Community vessels in the FSM EEZ. 
(b) The Delegation shall at the same time receive a brief report of the circumstances and reasons leading to the arrest. 
5. Statement of arrest 
(a) After the inspection officer has drawn up a statement, the master of the vessel shall sign it. 
(b) This signature shall not prejudice the rights of the master or any defence which he may make to the alleged infringement. 
(c) The master shall take the vessel to a port designated by the inspection officer. In the case of minor infringements, the Executive Director may authorise the boarded vessel to continue its fishing activities. 
6. Consultation meeting in the event of arrest 
(a) Before any measures regarding the master or the crew of the vessel or any action regarding the cargo and equipment of the vessel are considered, other than those to safeguard evidence relating to the presumed infringement, a consultation meeting shall be held, within one working day of the receipt of the above information, between the Delegation and the Executive Director, possibly attended by a representative of the Member State concerned. 
(b) At the meeting, the Parties shall exchange any relevant documentation or information helping to clarify the circumstances of the established facts. The shipowner or its agent shall be informed of the outcome of the meeting and of any measures resulting from the arrest. 
7. Settlement of arrest 
(a) Before any judicial procedure, an attempt shall be made to resolve the presumed infringement through a compromise procedure. This procedure shall end no later than four working days after the arrest. 
(b) In the event of an amicable settlement, the amount of the fine shall be determined in accordance with FSM legislation. 
(c) If the case cannot be settled by amicable procedure and has to be brought before a competent judicial body, a bank security set to take account of the arrest costs and the fines and compensation payable by the parties responsible for the infringement shall be paid by the ship owner into the account named in Article 2(7) of the Protocol. 
(d) The bank security shall be irrevocable until the legal proceedings have been concluded. It shall be released once legal proceedings end without a conviction. Similarly, in the event of a conviction leading to a fine of less than the security lodged, the balance shall be released by the competent judicial body in charge of the legal proceedings. 
(e) The vessel shall be released and its crew authorised to leave the port: 
1. once the obligations arising under the amicable settlement have been fulfilled; or 
2. when the bank security referred to in point 7(c) has been lodged and accepted by the competent judicial body, pending completion of the legal proceedings. 
8. Transhipment 
(a) Community vessels wishing to tranship catches in the waters of FSM shall do so within FSM designated ports. 
(b) The owners of such vessels must notify the following information to the Executive Director at least 48 hours in advance in accordance to the specimen provided in Appendix 3(4). 
(c) Transhipment shall be considered as an exit from FSM EEZ. Vessels must therefore submit their catch declarations to the Executive Director and state whether they intend to continue fishing or leave the FSM EEZ. 
(d) Any transhipment of catches not covered above shall be prohibited in the FSM EEZ. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties under the FSM laws. 
9. Bunkering 
Where bunkering takes place during a voyage in the FSM, the Community vessels shall report such activity in accordance with the specimen provided in Appendix 3(6). 
10. Captains of Community fishing vessels engaged in landing or transhipment operations in a FSM port shall allow and facilitate the inspection of such operations by FSM inspectors. Once the inspection has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the Captain of the vessel. 
CHAPTER X 
VESSEL MONITORING SYSTEM 
1. Each Community vessel shall be required to comply with the regional Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) currently applicable in the FSM EEZ. Each Community vessel shall have installed, maintained, and fully operational at all times on board, an automatic location communicator (ALC). The vessel and the operator agree not to tamper with, remove or have removed any ALC from the vessel after installation, except for the purposes of maintenance and repair as required. The operator and each vessel shall be responsible for the purchase, maintenance and operational costs of the ALC, and shall cooperate fully with NORMA in its utilisation. 
2. Point 1 above does not preclude the Parties from considering alternative VMS options. 
CHAPTER XI 
ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY 
1. Community vessels recognise the need to preserve the fragile (marine) environmental conditions of the lagoons and atolls of the FSM and the Community vessels shall not discharge any substance that is likely to cause damage to, or deterioration in, the quality of marine resources. 
2. Community vessels shall not discharge fish or by-catch into any port or give away fish or by‚Äêcatch to any persons or entities without prior written authorisation by the appropriate authority in the affected FSM State and prior written approval from NORMA. 
CHAPTER XII 
OPERATOR LIABILITY 
1. The operator shall ensure that its vessels are seaworthy and contain adequate life safety equipment and survival gear for each passenger and member of the crew. 
2. For the protection of the FSM, its States, and the citizens and residents thereof, the operator shall maintain adequate and complete insurance coverage on its vessel through an internationally recognised insurance carrier acceptable to NORMA for all areas under the jurisdiction of the FSM, including areas within the lagoons and atolls, the Territorial Sea, submerged reefs, and the EEZ as evidenced by the certificate of insurance referred to in Section 1(6)(f) of Chapter 1 of this Annex. 
3. In the event a Community vessel is involved in a maritime accident or incident in FSM waters (including internal waters, the Territorial Sea and the EEZ), resulting in damages of any kind to the environment, to property or to any person, the vessel and the operator shall immediately notify NORMA and the FSM Secretary of the Department of Transportation, Communications and Infrastructure. 
CHAPTER XIII 
APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS 
The vessel and its operators shall strictly comply with this Annex and with the laws, rules, and regulations of the FSM and its States and international treaties, conventions, and fisheries management agreements to which the FSM is a party. Failure to comply strictly with this Annex and with the laws, rules, and regulations of the FSM and its States may result in substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties.
