The content of substances extractable with ether, as a percentage of the sample, is given by: %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0020608%quot%%gt% 
where:

If the sample is a salt, accurately weigh, to the nearest 10 mg, about 10 g of the sample and dissolve in 100 ml of water. Add 1 g anhydrous sodium carbonate (4.3) and shake to dissolve. Add 20 ml of 0 702 mol/l potassium permanganate (4.2) and heat on a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. Cool the mixture. Add 50 ml of dilute sulphuric acid (4.6) and 0 75 g of potassium iodide (4.1). Swirl the mixture until all precipitated manganese dioxide has redissolved. Titrate with 0 71 mol/l sodium thiosulphate (4.4) until the solution becomes pale yellow in colour.

METHOD 15 DETERMINATION OF THE pH OF FOOD ADDITIVES 
1. Scope and field of application 
The method outlines general instructions on how to determine the pH of food additives. 
2. Definition 
The pH of a food additive : the pH value as determined by the method specified. 
3. Principle 
The pH value of an aqueous solution of the dissolved or slurried sample is conventionally determined using a glass electrode, reference electrode and pH meter. 
4. Reagents 4.1. Calibrate the instrument using the following buffer solutions: 4.1.1. Buffer solution pH 6 788 at 20 ºC, consisting of equal volume 0 705 mol/l potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and 0 705 mol/l disodium hydrogen ortho phosphate dyhidrate (Na2HPO4 7 2H2O). 
4.1.2. Buffer solution pH 4 at 20 ºC, consisting of 0 705 mol/l potassium hydrogen phthalate (C8H5KO4). 
4.1.3. Buffer solution pH 9 722 at 20 ºC, consisting of 0 705 mol/l sodium borate (Na2B4O7 7 10H2O). 
4.2. Saturated or 3 mol/l potassium chloride solution, or other suitable solution prescribed by the electrode manufacturer, to fill the reference electrode. 
4.3. Distilled water, carbon dioxide-free, having a pH between 5 and 6. 
5. Apparatus 5.1. pH meter, with an accuracy within 0 701 pH units. 
5.2. Electrodes, either a combined glass electrode or single glass and reference electrodes together with suitable clamps to hold the electrodes. 
5.3. Magnetic stirrer, with heater element. 
5.4. Thermometer, calibrated over the range 0 to 100 ºC. 
6. Procedure 6.1. Standardization of the pH meter 
The glass electrodes must be set using the instructions given by the manufacturer. The pH reading from the electrodes must be regularly checked by comparison with buffer solutions of known pH. 
Electrodes should be washed with water and then gently wiped with a soft tissue or should be rinsed with water and then twice with the next sample/standard solution before being placed in the next sample/standard solution to be used. 
If the sample to be considered has an acid pH, the buffer solutions used to check the pH reading should be those of pH 4 (4.1.2) and pH 6 788 (4.1.1). If the sample to be analyzed has an alkaline pH, the buffer solutions to be used to check the pH reading should be those of pH 9 722 (4.1.3) and pH 6 788 (4.1.1). 
6.2. Measurement of the sample solution 
The concentration of sample to be used or the sample preparation procedure to be adopted is as prescribed in the appropriate Community food additive Directive. 
Prepare the sample solution as directed using distilled water (4.3) and then adjust to 20 ºC while stirring. Stop the stirring, place the glass electrodes in the solution and after two minutes note the pH on the pH meter (5.1). 
7. Expression of results 7.1. Repeatability 
The difference between the results of two determinations when carried out simultaneously or in rapid succession on the same sample, by the same analyst, under the same conditions, shall not exceed 0 705 pH unit. 
8. Note 
This method is only applicable to those pH requirements in Community food additives Directives where the food additive is dissolved or slurried in water.
