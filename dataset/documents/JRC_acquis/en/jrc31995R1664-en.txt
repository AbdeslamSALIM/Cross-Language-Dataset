THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95 (2), and in particular Article 13 (1) thereof, 
Whereas with effect from 1 February 1995, Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 alters the value in ecus of certain prices and amounts in order to neutralize the effects of the abolition of the corrective factor of 1,207509 which until 31 January 1995 affected the conversion rates used for agriculture; 
Whereas the new values in ecus of the prices and amounts concerned have been established as of 1 February 1995 according to the rules laid down in Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and Article 18 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural conversion rates (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1053/95 (4); 
Whereas, in accordance with Article 18 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, in order to avoid confusion and to facilitate the application of the common agricultural policy, replacement prices and values in ecu should be fixed to apply at least from: 
- 1 January 1996 for amounts which are not affected by a marketing year, 
- from the beginning of the 1996 marketing year in the case of prices or amounts for which the marketing year begins in January 1996, and 
- from the beginning of the 1995/96 marketing year in the other cases, 
which are among the legal instruments coming into force before 1 February 1995; 
Whereas guarantees under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1528/95 (6), and its implementing Regulations are already at an appropriate level to ensure that obligation; whereas it is therefore not necessary to apply the conversion factor of 1,207509 to such guarantees; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees concerned, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
As a consequence of the adjustment of certain prices and amounts in ecus in the sector of cereals, oilseeds and protein crops coming into effect from 1 February 1995, pursuant to Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 and of Article 18 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the legal instruments referred to in Article 2 shall be amended as laid down therein.
