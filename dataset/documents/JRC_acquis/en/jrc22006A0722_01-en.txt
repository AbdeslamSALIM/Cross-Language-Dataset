A. Letter from the Community 
Sir, 
I have the honour to confirm that pending negotiations on amendments to be made to the Protocol currently in force ( 16 June 2001 to 15 June 2006) setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, as revised from 16 June 2004, we agree to the following interim arrangements: 
1. From 16 June 2006 to 15 June 2007 the arrangements applicable since 16 June 2004 will continue in operation. 
The Community's financial contribution under the interim arrangements will correspond to the amount provided for in Article 3 of the revised Protocol currently in force (EUR 7260000). That amount is to be treated entirely as financial compensation and will be paid no later than 31 December 2006. 
2. During this period, fishing licences will be granted within the limits set in Article 1 of the revised Protocol currently in force, by means of fees or advances corresponding to those fixed in point 1 of the Annex to the Protocol. 
I should be obliged if you would acknowledge receipt of this letter and confirm that you are in agreement with its terms. 
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.
