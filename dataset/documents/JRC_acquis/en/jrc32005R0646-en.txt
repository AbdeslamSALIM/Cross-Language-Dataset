of 27 April 2005 
amending Regulation (EC) No 94/2005 on the issue of import licences for rice originating in the ACP States and the overseas countries and territories against applications submitted in the first five working days of January 2005 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 638/2003 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 638/2003 of 9 April 2003 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 and to Council Decision 2001/822/EC as regards the arrangements applicable to imports of rice originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and the overseas countries and territories (OCT) [1], and in particular Article 17(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
Having checked the quantities booked by product category for the January 2005 tranche, a Member State was found to have made a booking error. As a result of this error, the quantities available for the May 2005 tranche in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 94/2005 [2] were less than they should have been. The Regulation in question should therefore be amended to take account of the applications actually lodged for the January tranche and to make them available for the May tranche, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 94/2005 is replaced by the Annex hereto. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
