THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 of 16 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards intervention on the market in butter and cream [2], and in particular Article 2 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 343/2006 [3] establishes the list of Member States in which buying-in for butter is open, as provided for in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.

Intervention buying-in should therefore be opened in those Member States. Italy should therefore be added to the list established in Regulation (EC) No 343/2006.
