THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof,

RECALLING the provision in Article XIV.2 of the Treaty for a Conference to be convened, at the request of a majority of the States that have ratified, to examine the extent to which the requirement set out in paragraph 1 of this Article has been met and to consider and decide by consensus what measures consistent with international law may be undertaken to accelerate the ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of this Treaty, 
HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING COMMON POSITION: 
Article 1

Article 2 
The European Union shall in particular contribute to a successful outcome of the first conference pursuant to Article XIV of the CTBT, which is expected to take place in Vienna in October 1999, aiming at accelerating the CTBT-ratification process in order to facilitate the early entry into force of the CTBT.
