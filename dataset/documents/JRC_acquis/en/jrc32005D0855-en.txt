THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,

(1) To monitor the situation in the Member States, the Commission adopted Decision 2005/732/EC of 17 October 2005 approving the programmes for the implementation of Member States' surveys for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds during 2005 and laying down reporting and eligibility rules for the Community financial contribution to the implementation costs of those programmes [2]. 
(2) In order to reduce the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 being introduced into poultry farms and other premises where birds are kept in captivity via wild birds, Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk [3] was adopted. 
(3) Pursuant to that Decision, Member States are to identify individual holdings keeping poultry or other captive birds which, according to epidemiological and ornithological data, should be considered particularly at risk from the avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 spreading via wild birds. 
(4) In the light of the epidemiological and ornithological developments, provision should be made to review such risks on a regular and ongoing basis with a view to adjusting the areas identified as particularly at risk. 
(5) Clarification is necessary with regard to the epidemiological role of birds participating in point-to-point races within the framework of cultural events. 
(6) In addition, provision should be made for the period of application of the measures provided for in Decision 2005/734/EC to be extended in the light of the epidemiological and ornithological developments. 
(7) Decision 2005/734/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
