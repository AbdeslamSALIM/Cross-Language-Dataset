Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters on the provisional application of the Protocol setting out, for the period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles

(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Protocol annexed to the fisheries Agreement between the European Community and Seychelles expires on 17 January 2005. A new Protocol was initialled by the two parties on 23 September 2004 establishing the technical and financial conditions under which Community fishing vessels can fish in Seychelles waters for the period 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011. 
The new Protocol grants fishing possibilities for 40 tuna seiners and 12 surface longliners. 
The financial compensation is fixed at 4,125,000 € per year and covers a catch weight in the waters of Seychelles of 55,000 tons of catches per year. Part of the financial compensation equivalent to 1,485,000 Euro per year (36% of financial compensation) shall be earmarked to enhancing and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Seychelles with a view to promote responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in its waters. 
The new Protocol is in line with the partnership approach in the fisheries sector, as defined by the Council in its recent conclusions on a Communication from the Commission on an integrated framework for Fisheries Partnership Agreements with third countries (Document n° 15243/02 PECHE 224, referred to document COM(2002) 637 final ). 
According to the Protocol, the Commission and Seychelles shall agree on overall objectives to be achieved in the area of sustainable fishing and on the way to review the performance of such objectives, through a constant political dialogue. This shall go much beyond the current reporting procedures, (submission of annual detailed reports and verification). 
The Commission shall, in particular, encourage the authorities of the Seychelles to adopt all necessary conservation and management measures, on non-discriminatory basis, in order to ensure sustainable exploitation of highly migratory species and to protect the environment in its waters. 
Both Parties should exchange information on the implementation of IOTC recommendations against IUU within their jurisdiction (prohibition of landings by vessels not listed on the “white” list). 
Finally, both Parties shall seek to identify concrete issues of mutual interest and agree the form in which the political dialogue will be undertaken. 
The Commission is accordingly proposing that the Council adopt by Decision the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters concerning the provisional application of the new Protocol, pending its definitive entry into force. 
A proposal for a Council Regulation concerning the conclusion of the new Protocol is subject to a separate procedure.

PROTOCOL 
Protocol setting out, for the period from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles 
Article 1 Period of application and fishing opportunities 
1. For a period of 6 years from 18 January 2005 to 17 January 2011, the fishing opportunities granted under Article 2 of the Agreement shall be as follows: 
(a) 40 ocean-going tuna seiners, and 
(b) 12 surface longliners. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 4 and 5 of this Protocol. 
3. Under Article 4 of the Agreement, vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Community may engage in fishing activities in the Seychelles waters only if they are in possession of a fishing licence issued under this Protocol in accordance with the Annex hereto. 
Article 2 Financial contribution - Methods of payment 
1. For the period referred to in Article 1, the financial contribution referred to in Article 6 of the Agreement shall be EUR 24 750 000. 
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply subject to Articles 4, 6 and 8 of this Protocol. 
3. The Community shall pay the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 at the rate of EUR 4 125 000 per year during the period of application of this Protocol. 
4. If the total quantity of tuna catches per year by Community vessels in Seychelles’ waters exceeds 55 000 tonnes, the total annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 75 per additional tonne of tuna caught. However, the total annual amount to be paid by the Community cannot exceed EUR 8 250 000. 
5. Payment shall be made no later than 30 September 2005 for the first year and no later than the anniversary date of the Protocol for the following years. 
6. Subject to Article 6 herewith, Seychelles shall have full discretion regarding the use to which this financial contribution is put. 
7. The financial contribution shall be paid into no more than two Public Treasury accounts opened with the Seychelles Central Bank. 
Article 3 Cooperation on responsible fishing 
1. The two parties hereby undertake to promote responsible fishing in Seychelles waters based on the principle of non-discrimination between the different fleets fishing in those waters. 
2. Based on the recommendations and resolutions taken within the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and the best available scientific advice and, where appropriate after a joint meeting of scientist, the two parties may consult each other within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement and, where necessary, and agree the measures to ensure the sustainable management of fisheries resources. 
Article 4 Review of fishing opportunities 
1. The fishing opportunities referred to in Article 1 may be increased by mutual agreement insofar as the conclusions of the joint meeting of scientists referred to in Article 3(2) confirm that such an increase will not endanger the sustainable management of Seychelles’ resources. In this case the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) shall be increased proportionately and pro rata temporis . However, the total amount of the financial contribution paid by the European Community shall not be more than twice the amount indicated in Article 2(1). In the event that the quantities caught by Community fishing vessels exceed the quantity which correspond to the total amount of financial contribution, the Parties shall consult each other as soon as possible in order to establish the amount due for the quantity caught in excess of this limit. 
2. Conversely, if the parties agree to reduce the fishing opportunities provided for in Article 1, the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionally and pro rata temporis. 
3. The allocation of the fishing opportunities among different categories of vessels may also be reviewed by mutual agreement between the parties, provided that any changes comply with any recommendations or resolutions adopted by the IOTC regarding the management of stocks liable to be affected by such redistribution. The parties shall agree on the corresponding adjustment of the financial contribution where the redistribution of fishing opportunities so warrants. 
Article 5 New fishing opportunities 
1. In the event that Community fishing vessels become interested engaging in fisheries not provided for in Article 1, the Parties shall consult each other before authorisation is granted for any such activities and, where appropriate, agree to the conditions for such fishing including effecting corresponding amendments to this Protocol and the Annex thereto. 
2. The parties should encourage experimental fishing, specially relating to deep water species, present in Seychelles waters. To this end and on the request of one party, they shall consult each other and determine on a case by case basis, the species, conditions and other parameters that are relevant. 
The parties shall carry out experimental fishing in accordance with parameters that will be agreed by both parties in an administrative arrangement where appropriate. The authorisations for experimental fishing should be agreed for a maximum period of 6 months. 
In the event that the parties consider that experimental campaigns have given positive results, the Government of Seychelles may allocate fishing possibilities of the new species to the community fleet until the expiration of the present protocol. The financial compensation mentioned in article 2.1 of the current protocol shall consequently be increased. 
Article 6 Suspension and review of the payment of the financial contribution 
1. Where as a result of circumstances solely attributable to the fault or negligence of Seychelles fishing activities in Seychelles waters cannot be carried out in Seychelles waters, the European Community may, after prior consultation with the Seychelles, suspend payment of the financial contribution provided that the Community has paid in full any amounts due at the time of suspension. 
2. Payment of the financial contribution shall recommence once the situation has returned to normal and following consultation and agreement between the two Parties confirming that the situation is likely to allow a return to normal fishing activities. 
Article 7 Promoting responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in Seychelles waters 
1. A share of at least 36 % of the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) shall be put towards defining and implementing a sectoral fisheries policy in Seychelles with a view to promote responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries in its waters. This contribution shall be managed in the light of objectives identified by mutual agreement between the two parties, and the annual and multiannual programming to attain them. 
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, as soon as this Protocol enters into force and no later than three months after that date, the Community and Seychelles shall agree, within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement, on a multiannual sectoral programme and detailed implementing rules covering, in particular: 
(a) annual and multiannual guidelines for using the percentage of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1; 
(b) the objectives, both annual and multiannual, to be achieved with a view to introducing, over time, responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries, taking account of the priorities expressed by Seychelles in its national fisheries policy and other policies relating to or having an impact on the promotion of responsible fishing and sustainable fisheries; 
(c) criteria and procedures for evaluating the results obtained each year. 
3. Any proposed amendments to the multiannual sectoral programme must be approved by both parties within the Joint Committee. 
4. Each year, Seychelles shall allocate the percentage of the financial contribution referred to in paragraph 1 with a view to implementing the multiannual programme. For the first year of application of the Protocol, that allocation must be notified to the Community at the time when the multiannual sectoral programme is approved within the Joint Committee. For each year thereafter, Seychelles shall notify the Community of the allocation no later than 1st December of the previous year. 
5. Where the annual evaluation of the progress made in implementing the multiannual sectoral programme so warrants, the European Community may ask with the approval of the Joint Committee for the financial contribution referred to in Article 2(1) of this Protocol to be modified with a view to bringing the actual amount of financial resources allocated to implementation of the programme into line with its results. 
Article 8 Disputes - suspension of application of the Protocol 
1. Any dispute between the parties over the interpretation of this Protocol or its application shall be the subject of consultations between the parties within the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement, in a special meeting if necessary. 
2. Without prejudice to Article 9, application of the Protocol may be suspended at the initiative of one party if the dispute between the parties is deemed to be serious and if the consultations held within the Joint Committee under paragraph 1 have not resulted in an amicable settlement.

4. In the event of suspension, the parties shall continue to consult with a view to finding an amicable settlement to their dispute. Where such settlement is reached, application of the Protocol shall resume and the amount of the financial contribution shall be reduced proportionately and pro rata temporis according to the period during which application of the Protocol was suspended. 
Article 9 Suspension of application of the Protocol on grounds of non-payment 
Subject to Article 3, if the European Community fails to make the payments provided for in Article 2, Seychelles may suspend the implementation of this Protocol. 
Article 10 National law 
The activities of Community fishing vessels in Seychelles are subject to the national laws and regulations unless otherwise provided under this Protocol and the Annex thereto. 
Article 11 Revision clause 
Following the third anniversary of this Protocol and the Annex thereto, the Parties will review the application of the Protocol and the Annex thereto and, where appropriate, consult on any amendments of their provisions. Any such amendments may include the reference tonnage and the standard amounts paid for licences and the ratio between the amount per tonne set out in Article 2 (4) and the amount indicated in section 2 (2) of the Annex to this Protocol. 
Article 12 Repeal 
The Protocol and Annex I, dated 17 January 2002, to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Seychelles on fishing off Seychelles, which came into force on 28 October 1987, is hereby repealed and replaced by this Protocol and the Annex thereto.

The European Community shall keep an up-to-date list of the vessels to which a fishing licence has been issued under this Protocol. This list shall be notified to the authorities of Seychelles responsible for fisheries inspection as soon as it is drawn up and each time it is updated. 
2. Vessels Monitoring System: 
Community vessels shall be monitored, inter alia, by vessel monitoring systems, without discrimination, in accordance with the provisions set out in appendix 4. 
3. Entering and leaving Seychelles waters: 
3.1 Community vessels shall notify the competent authorities of Seychelles at least (3) hours in advance of their intention to enter or leave Seychelles’ waters and every three days during their fishing activities in Seychelles waters of their catches during this period. 
3.2 When notifying entry/leaving, vessels shall also communicate their position at the time of communication and the volume and species in catches kept on board. These communications shall be made in the format set out in appendix 5, by fax or e-mail, to the addresses provided therein. However, the competent authorities of the Seychelles may exempt surface long liners not fitted with the appropriate communication equipment from this obligation by authorising communication by radio. 
3.3 Community fishing vessels found to be fishing without having informed the competent authorities of Seychelles shall be deemed as vessels without a licence. The sanctions referred to in Chapter X, point 1 will be applicable in such cases. 
4. Control procedures 
4.1 Masters of Community fishing vessels engaged in fishing activities in Seychelles waters shall cooperate with any Seychelles official carrying out inspection and control of fishing activities. 
4.2 These officials shall not remain on board for longer than is necessary for the discharge of their duties. 
4.3 Once an inspection has been completed, a copy of the inspection report shall be given to the master of the vessel. 
5. Transhipment 
5.1 All Community vessels wishing to tranship catches in Seychelles waters shall do so within Seychelles ports. 
5.2 The owners of such vessels must notify the following information to the competent authority of Seychelles at least 24 hours in advance: 
- the names of the transhipping fishing vessels, 
- the names of the cargo vessels, 
- the tonnage by species to be transhipped, 
- the day of transhipment. 
5.3 Transhipment shall be considered as an exit from ’Seychelles waters. Vessels must therefore submit their catch declarations to the competent authorities of Seychelles. 
5.4 Any transhipment of catches not covered above shall be prohibited in Seychelles waters. Any person infringing this provision shall be liable to the penalties provided for by the Seychelles law. 
5.5 Masters of Community fishing vessels engaged in landing or transhipment operations in a port of Seychelles shall allow and facilitate the inspection of such operations by Seychelles inspectors. Once the inspection has been completed, a certificate shall be issued to the master of the vessel. 
CHAPTER X - ENFORCEMENT 
1. Sanctions 
Failure to observe any one of the above rules, the management and conservation of living resources measures or the Seychelles legislation may be penalised by suspension, revocation or non-renewal of the vessel’s fishing licence. 
The flag Member State and the European Commission will immediately be fully informed of any suspension or revocation and of all relevant facts related thereto. During the period of the suspension of a licence or during the remaining period of the validity of a licence which has been revoked, the European Commission may request another licence which would have otherwise have been applicable, for a vessel from another ship-owner, in accordance with the procedure set out in point 1.11 of chapter I. 
2. Arrest of fishing vessels 
The Seychelles authorities shall inform the Delegation of the Commission responsible for the Seychelles and the flag State, within 48 hours, of the arrest of any fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State of the Community fishing under the Agreement in Seychelles fishing zone and shall transmit a brief report of the circumstances and reasons leading to such arrest.

PROVISIONS 
ESTABLISHING THE METHOD TO BE USED FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF DATA RELATING TO SATELLITE MONITORING OF THE POSITION OF EC VESSELS FISHING UNDER THE EC/SEYCHELLES FISHERY AGREEMENT 
As the Republic of Seychelles has introduced a vessel monitoring system (VMS) applicable to all foreign vessels fishing in Seychelles waters, on a non-discriminatory basis, and has extended VMS surveillance to its own national fleet of the same category, and 
Considering that EC fishing vessels are already subject to satellite tracking under the Community legislation since January 2000, 
It is recommended that the flag States and the authorities of the Republic of Seychelles implements a satellite monitoring of the EC vessels fishing under the EC/Seychelles Fishery Agreement in accordance with the following conditions: 
1. For the purposes of satellite monitoring, the Seychelles authorities shall communicate to the Fisheries Monitoring Centres (FMCs) of the flag States the co-ordinates (latitudes and longitudes) of the Seychelles waters. 
The Seychelles authorities will transmit this information in electronic format, expressed in degrees decimal in the Wgs-84 system datum. 
2. The Seychelles authorities and the national FMCs will exchange information on their respective electronic addresses in X.25 format or where appropriate other secure communication protocol and the specifications to be used in their respective FMCs in accordance with the conditions established in points 4 and 6. This information will include, as far as possible, the names, the telephone, and fax numbers and the electronic addresses (Internet), which can be used for the general communications between the FMCs. 
3. The position of the vessels will be determined with a margin of error of less than 500 metres and with a confidence interval of 99%. 
4. When a vessel fishing under the EC/Seychelles Agreement and subject to satellite tracking under the Community legislation enters into the Seychelles waters, subsequent position reports shall be communicated by the FMC of the flag State to the Monitoring Centre of Seychelles automatically, in real time, at least every hour ( frequency ). These messages are identified as Position Reports. 
5. The messages referred to in item 4 shall be transmitted electronically in X.25 format, or other secure communication protocols subject to prior agreement between the relevant FMCs. All messages will be communicated automatically, in real time, in accordance with the definitions given in Attachment 1. 
It is prohibited for a vessel to switch off its satellite tracking device when operating in Seychelles waters. 
6. In the event of a technical problem or malfunction of the satellite monitoring device installed on board the fishing vessel, the master of that vessel shall communicate in good time by fax, or e-mail to the FMC of the Flag State concerned the information specified in item 4. At least one global position Report every four hours shall be sufficient under such circumstances as long as the vessel stays in Seychelles waters. This global position Report will include the hourly positions as registered by the master of that vessel during those four hours. The FMC of the flag State or the vessel itself shall forward these messages to the Seychelles Monitoring Centre without delay. In case of necessity or doubts, the Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) could ask for a determine vessel a transmission of the position report every hour. Defective equipment shall be repaired or replaced as soon as the vessel concludes its fishing trip or within a month at a maximum. Past this period, a new fishing trip may not begin until the equipment has been repaired or replaced. 
7. The Vessel Monitoring System hardware and software components shall be temper proof, i.e. shall not permit the input or output of false positions and must not be capable of being manually over-ridden. The system shall be fully automatic and operational at all times regardless of environmental conditions. It shall be prohibited to destroy, damage, render inoperative or otherwise interfere with the satellite tracking device. 
In particular, the master shall ensure that: 
- data are not altered in any way; 
- the antenna or the antennas connected to the satellite tracking devices are not obstructed in any way; and 
- the power supply of the satellite tracking devices is not interrupted in any way. 
Any breach of the above-mentioned obligations may render the master liable under the laws and regulations of Seychelles, provided that the vessel is operating in Seychelles waters. 
8. The FMCs of the Flag States shall monitor the tracking of their vessels when the latter are in the Seychelles waters, at one hour intervals. If the tracking of the vessels is not carried out under the conditions envisaged, the Seychelles Monitoring Centre is immediately informed and the procedure provided for in item 6 will be applicable. 
9. Relevant FMCs and the Seychelles Monitoring Centre shall co-operate to ensure the implementation of these provisions. If the Seychelles Monitoring Centre establishes that the flag State is not transmitting the data in conformity with item 4 above, the other party shall be immediately notified. Upon receipt of notification, the latter shall respond within twenty-four (24) hours by informing the Seychelles Monitoring Centre of the reasons for non-transmission and indicating a reasonable delay for compliance with these provisions. In case of failure to comply within this delay, the two parties will settle such problems in writing or as provided for by point 13 of these provisions. 
10. Monitoring data transmitted in accordance with these provisions shall be used exclusively for control, management, monitoring and enforcement by the Seychelles authorities of the Community fleet fishing under the EC/Seychelles fishery agreement These data cannot be communicated to other parties under any circumstances, except with the written consent of the flag State concerned, on a case by case basis, or by an order of the Court in Seychelles. 
11. It is agreed that, at the request of either party, there will be an exchange of information on the equipment used for satellite tracking, in order to ensure that the said equipment is fully compatible with the requirements of the other party for the purposes of these provisions. 
12. The Parties agree to review these provisions as and when appropriate, including all cases of malfunctioning or anomalies related to individual vessels. All such cases will have to be notified by the SFA to the EC flag Member States at least 15 days before the review meeting. 
13. Any dispute concerning the interpretation or the application of these provisions shall be subject to consultation between the Parties within the framework of the Joint Committee provided for in Article 7 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles concerning fishing in Seychelles waters. 
14. These provisions shall enter into force on 18th January 2005.
