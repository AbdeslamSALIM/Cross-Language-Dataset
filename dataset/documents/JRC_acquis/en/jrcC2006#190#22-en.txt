Case C-269/06: Action brought on 15 June 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Centre de traduction des organes de l'Union européenne (CDT) 
Action brought on 15 June 2006 — Commission of the European Communities v Centre de traduction des organes de l'Union européenne (CDT) 
Parties 
Applicant: Commission of the European Communities (represented by: J.-F. Pasquier and D. Martin, Agents) 
Defendant: Centre de traduction des organes de l'Union européenne (CDT) 
Form of order sought 
The applicant claims that the Court should: 
- annul the CDT's decision not to pay employer's contributions to the Community pension scheme; 
- order the CDT to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
Under Article 83a(2) of the new Staff Regulations, %quot%agencies which do not receive a subsidy from the general budget of the European Union shall pay into that budget the entire amount of the contributions needed to finance the scheme.%quot% 
On that basis, the Commission requested that CDT pay into the budget sums corresponding to the employer's contribution to the pension scheme for 2005 and subsequent years. 
The CDT nonetheless refused, denying that it was a self-financed agency. The CDT claims that it should be regarded as a subsidised agency. According to the Commission, however, it is not in dispute that the CDT has received no operating subsidies from the general budget of the European Union since 1998; it has received merely a remuneration commensurate with its services to inter-institutional cooperation in the form of translation.
