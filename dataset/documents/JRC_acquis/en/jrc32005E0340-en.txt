Council Common Position 2005/340/CFSP 
of 25 April 2005 
extending restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar and amending Common Position 2004/423/CFSP 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) On 26 April 2004, the Council adopted Common Position 2004/423/CFSP renewing restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar [1]. 
(2) On 25 October 2004, the Council adopted Common Position 2004/730/CFSP on additional restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar and amending Common Position 2004/423/CFSP [2]. 
(3) On 21 February 2005, the Council adopted Common Position 2005/149/CFSP amending Annex II to Common Position 2004/423/CFSP [3]. 
(4) The Council would recall its position on the political situation in Burma/Myanmar and considers that recent developments do not justify suspension of the restrictive measures. 
(5) The restrictive measures against Burma/Myanmar set out in Common Position 2004/423/CFSP, as amended by Common Positions 2004/730/CFSP and 2005/149/CFSP respectively, should therefore remain in force. 
(6) The Council considers that, although certain measures imposed by Common Position 2004/423/CFSP are directed at persons associated with the Burmese/Myanmar regime and members of their families, children under 18 should not, in principle, be targeted. 
(7) Technical amendments should be made to the lists annexed to Common Position 2004/423/CFSP. 
(8) In the event of a substantial improvement in the overall political situation in Burma/Myanmar, the suspension of these restrictive measures and a gradual resumption of cooperation with Burma/Myanmar will be considered, after the Council has assessed developments. 
(9) Action by the Community is needed in order to implement some of these measures, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS COMMON POSITION:

Annexes I and II to Common Position 2004/423/CFSP shall be replaced by Annexes I and II to this Common Position.
