Proposal for a 
COUNCIL (EC, EURATOM) REGULATION 
adjusting with effect from 1 July 2004 the remuneration and pensions of officials and other servants of the European Communities and the correction coefficients applied thereto 
(presented by the Commission){SEC (2004) 1445 } 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
PREAMBLE 
In accordance with Article 1 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, Eurostat has drawn up a report on changes in the cost of living in Brussels, changes in the purchasing power of remuneration in national civil services, and the economic parities from which the correction coefficients derive. 
Under Article 3 of that Annex XI, the Council, acting on a Commission proposal, is to take a decision before the end of each year adjusting remuneration and pensions, with effect from 1 July. 
Changes in the purchasing power of remuneration of national civil servants (specific indicator) 
Eurostat has worked out the changes in the net remuneration, exclusive of inflation, of national civil servants in central government in the eight Member States listed in Article 1(4) of Annex XI on the basis of information provided by those Member States. 
The average change in the purchasing power of national civil servants in central government in the period July 2003 - July 2004 measured by the specific indicator is equal to -1.2%. 
Changes in the cost of living for Brussels (international index) 
Eurostat has determined, on the basis of data provided by the Belgian authorities, the changes in the cost of living for officials of the European Communities in Brussels. 
The change in the cost of living in Brussels in the period June 2003 - June 2004 measured by the international indicator calculated by Eurostat is equal to 1.9%. 
Adjustment of remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg 
The amount of the adjustment is equal to the product of the Brussels International Index (1.9%) and the specific indicator (-1.2%). 
[(101.9% x 98.8%) / 100] –100 = 0.7% 
The net adjustment of remuneration and pensions in Belgium and Luxembourg is therefore 0.7%. 
Under Article 3 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations, no correction coefficient is applicable in Belgium and Luxembourg. 
Adjustment of remuneration and pensions outside Belgium and Luxembourg 
Outside Belgium and Luxembourg the adjustment of remuneration and pensions is obtained by multiplying the net adjustment in Belgium and Luxembourg and the change in correction coefficients and in the exchange rate. 
The correction coefficients applicable to remuneration, pensions and transfers of part of the remuneration that are set out in the Regulation have been calculated as follows: 
Correction coefficients for officials outside Belgium and Luxembourg 
Eurostat has calculated, in agreement with national statistical institutes, the economic parities which fix purchasing power parities on 1 July 2004 between the remuneration paid by the European Communities in the reference city, Brussels, and in the other places of employment. 
The correction coefficients applying to the remuneration of officials of the European Communities serving in the Member States outside Belgium and Luxembourg are directly determined by the ratios between these economic parities and the exchange rates applying to the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities on 1 July 2004. 
Correction coefficients for pensioners outside Belgium and Luxembourg and correction coefficients for transfers 
Eurostat has calculated, in agreement with national statistical institutes, the economic parities which fix purchasing power parities on 1 July 2004 between the pension paid by the European Communities in the reference country, Belgium, and that paid in the other places of residence. 
The correction coefficients calculated for the pensions of individuals living outside Belgium and Luxembourg in the various countries are determined by the ratios between these economic parities and the exchange rates on 1 July 2004. 
Under Article 17 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, these correction coefficients are directly applied to transfers made by officials and other agents from 1 January 2005. 
Under Article 20 of Annex XIII to the Staff Regulations, correction coefficients apply to the part of the pension corresponding to pension rights acquired before 1 May 2004. 
Under Article 20(2) thereof, the correction coefficients applicable to pensions are calculated by adding 80% of the correction coefficients applicable to officials and 20% of the correction coefficients calculated for pensions. 
From 1 May 2005, the correction coefficients will be calculated by adding 60% of the correction coefficients applicable to officials to 40% of the correction coefficients calculated for pensions. 
Date on which correction coefficients enter into effect 
These correction coefficients take effect on 1 July 2004 for all places except those with a high cost-of-living increase, for which the correction coefficient is to come into effect on 16 May if the increase in the cost of living is greater than 6.3%, or 1 May if it is greater than 12.6%. 
Changes in the cost of living outside Belgium and Luxembourg are measured by the change in the implicit indices. These indices are calculated by multiplying the Brussels International Index by the change in the economic parity. 
The date on which this adjustment shall enter into effect is earlier for the places listed below: 
- correction coefficients for officials: nowhere; 
- correction coefficients for pensioners: nowhere. 
Other factors affecting net remuneration 
When the Council adopted its decision of 22 March 2004 renewing the method of adjusting remuneration (Annex XI to the Staff Regulations), it also decided: 
- to introduce a special levy on remuneration at a rate increasing from 2.50% to 2.93%, with effect on 1 January 2005; 
- to provide for a new method for adjusting the staff rate of contribution to the pension scheme. As a result, the rate will increase from 9.25% to 9.75%, with effect on 1 July 2004.
