Explanatory notes adopted in accordance with the procedure defined in Article 10 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff [1] 
The explanatory notes to the Combined Nomenclature of the European Communities [2] shall be amended as follows: 
On page 288 insert the following text: 
"72155011 to 72155080 | Other, not further worked than cold-formed or cold-finished | 
| Hot-rolled bars may be cold-finished by drawing or other process â&#x20AC;&#x201D; notably rectification or calibration â&#x20AC;&#x201D; giving the product a better finish. The amelioration of the finish is the reduction of the tolerances on the diameter and on the ovalisation and the elimination from the surface of any default such as micro-cracks or decarburized zones. This operation renders them classifiable as "cold-formed" or "cold-finished". They generally have a smooth and rather homogeneous surface. They are free from grooves and other superficial defects, although the sized bars can have very weak to average roughness, according to the degree of rectification. Surface treatments in addition to that mentioned above, such as polishing, are excluded (See the Explanatory Notes to subheading 72159000)." | 
On page 344 insert the following text: 
"85414090 | Other | 
| This subheading includes photovoltaic cells assembled in modules or made up into panels incorporating bypass diodes (but no blocking diodes). The bypass diodes are not elements which supply the power directly to, for example, a motor (see the HS Explanatory Notes to headings 8501 and 8541)." |
