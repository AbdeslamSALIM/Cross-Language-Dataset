REGULATION (EEC) No 142/75 OF THE COMMISSION of 20 January 1975 amending Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 as regards export levies on olive oil 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC (1) of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1707/73 (2); 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 162/66/EEC (3) of 27 October 1966 on trade in oils and fats between the Community and Greece; 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 171/67/EEC (4) of 27 June 1967 on export refunds and levies on olive oil, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2429/72 (5), and in particular Article 11 thereof; 
Whereas, under Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (6) of 27 March 1972 on detailed rules for the application of export refunds and levies on olive oil, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2563/72 (7), the Commission is to fix export levies for olive oil put up in packings of a capacity exceeding 5 kg where the difference specified in the first subparagraph of Article 10 (2) of Regulation No 171/67/EEC exceeds a certain amount ; whereas experience has shown that the application of this provision has led to export levies being fixed even where exports do not threaten to disturb the Community or the world market in olive oil ; whereas provision should therefore be made for levies to be fixed under the same conditions for the oil referred to above as for oil put up in small quantities; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats.
