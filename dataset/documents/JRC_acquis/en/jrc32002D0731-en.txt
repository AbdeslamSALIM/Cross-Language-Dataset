2002/731/EC: Commission Decision of 30 May 2002 concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the control-command and signalling subsystem of the trans-European high-speed rail system referred to in Article 6(1) of Council Directive 96/48/EC (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 1947) 
Commission Decision 
of 30 May 2002 
concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the control-command and signalling subsystem of the trans-European high-speed rail system referred to in Article 6(1) of Council Directive 96/48/EC 
(notified under document number C(2002) 1947) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2002/731/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 96/48/EC of 23 July 1996 on the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail network(1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with Article 2(c) of Directive 96/48/EC, the trans-European high-speed rail system is subdivided into structural or functional subsystems. These subsystems are described in Annex II to the Directive. 
(2) In accordance with Article 5(1) of the Directive, each of the subsystems shall be covered by a technical specification for interoperability (TSI). 
(3) In accordance with Article 6(1) of the Directive, draft TSIs shall be drawn up by the joint representative body. 
(4) The Committee set up pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 96/48/EC has appointed the European Association for Railway Interoperability (AEIF) as the joint representative body in accordance with Article 2(h) of the Directive. 
(5) The AEIF has been given a mandate to draw up a draft TSI for the control-command and signalling subsystem in accordance with Article 6(1) of the Directive. This mandate was established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21(2) of the Directive. 
(6) The AEIF has drawn up the draft TSI, together with an introductory report containing a cost-benefit analysis as provided for in Article 6(3) of the Directive. 
(7) The draft TSI has been examined by the representatives of the Member States, in the framework of the Committee set up by the Directive, in the light of the introductory report. 
(8) As specified in Article 1 of Directive 96/48/EC, the conditions for achieving interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system concern the design, construction, upgrading and operation of the infrastructures and rolling stock contributing to the functioning of the system to be put into service after the date of entry into force of the Directive. With regard to the infrastructures and rolling stock already in service at the time of entry into force of this TSI, the TSI should be applied from the time when work is envisaged on these infrastructures and rolling stock. However, the degree to which the TSI is applied will vary according to the scope and extent of the works foreseen and the costs and the benefits generated by the intended applications. In order for such partial works to concur into achieving full interoperability, they need to be underpinned by a coherent implementation strategy. In this context, a distinction should be made between upgrading, renewal and maintenance-related replacement. 
(9) It is recognised that Directive 96/48/EC and the TSIs do not apply to renewals or maintenance-related replacement. It is desirable however that the TSIs should apply to renewals, as will be the case for the TSIs for the conventional rail system under Commission Directive 2001/16/EC(2). In the absence of a mandatory requirement and taking into account the extent of the renewal work, Member States are encouraged, where they are able to do so, to apply the TSIs to renewals and maintenance-related replacement. 
(10) Existing high-speed lines and rolling stock are already equipped with control-command and signalling systems that meet the essential requirements of Directive 96/48/EC. Such systems were developed and implemented according to national rules. In order to allow the operation of interoperable services, it is necessary to develop interfaces between those existing systems and new TSI compatible equipment. Basic information concerning those existing systems is provided in Annex B to the attached TSI. Given that verification of interoperability has to be established by reference to the TSIs, in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 96/48/EC, it is necessary, during the transition period between the publication of this Decision and the full implementation of the TSI attached, to lay down the conditions to be complied with in addition to the attached TSI. For these reasons it is necessary that each Member State informs the other Member States and the Commission, for each one of the systems mentioned in Annex B, of the technical rules in use for achieving interoperability and meeting the essential requirements of Directive 96/48/EC. In addition, those rules being national, it is necessary that each Member State informs the other Member States and the Commission of the bodies it appoints for carrying out the procedure for the assessment of conformity or suitability for use as well as the checking procedure in use for verifying the interoperability of subsystems within the meaning of Article 16(2) of Directive 96/48/EC. Member States shall apply, as far as possible, the principles and criteria provided for in Directive 96/48/EC for the implementation of Article 16(2) in the case of those national rules. As to the bodies in charge of those procedures, Member States will make use, as far as possible, of bodies notified under Article 20 of Directive 96/48/EC. The Commission will carry out an analysis of this information (national rules, procedures, bodies in charge of implementing procedures, duration of these procedures) and, where appropriate, will discuss with the Committee the necessity of any measure to be taken. 
(11) The TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, does not impose the use of specific technologies or technical solutions except where this is strictly necessary for the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail network. 
(12) The TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, is based on best available expert knowledge at the time of preparation of the corresponding draft. Developments in technology or social requirements may make it necessary to amend or supplement this TSI. Where appropriate, a review or updating procedure will be initiated in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 96/48/EC. 
(13) In some cases, the TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, allows a choice between different solutions, making it possible to apply definitive or transitional interoperable solutions that are compatible with the existing situation. In addition, Directive 96/48/EC provides for special implementing provisions in certain specific cases. Furthermore, in the cases provided for in Article 7 of the Directive Member States must be allowed not to apply certain technical specifications. It is therefore necessary that the Member States ensure that an infrastructure register and a rolling stock register are published and updated each year. These registers will set out the main characteristics of the national infrastructure and rolling stock (e.g. the basic parameters) and their concordance with the characteristics prescribed by the applicable TSIs. To this end, the TSI, which is the subject of this Decision, indicates precisely which information must appear in the registers. 
(14) The application of the TSI which is the subject of this Decision must take into account specific criteria relating to technical and operational compatibility between the infrastructures and the rolling stock to be placed in service and the network into which they are to be integrated. These compatibility requirements entail a complex technical and economical analysis that is to be done on a case-by-case basis. The analysis should take into account: 
- the interfaces between the different subsystems referred to in Directive 96/48/EC, 
- the different categories of lines and rolling stock referred to in that Directive, and 
- the technical and operational environments of the existing network. 
That is why it is essential to establish a strategy for the implementation of the TSI which is the subject of this Decision, which should indicate the technical stages to move from the present network conditions to a situation where the network is interoperable. 
(15) The target system described in the attached TSI builds upon computer-based technology with a life expectancy significantly lower than current traditional railway signalling and telecommunication facilities. As such, they call for a proactive rather than reactive deployment strategy to avoid potential system obsolescence prior to system deployment reaching maturity levels. In addition, the adoption of a too fragmented deployment throughout the European rail network would give rise to major costs and operational overheads. The development of a coherent trans-European implementation plan for the target system would contribute to a harmonious development of the whole of the trans-European rail network in compliance with the EU strategy for the TEN-transport network. Such a plan should build upon the corresponding national implementation plans and should provide an appropriate knowledge base for decision support by the different stakeholders, in particular, by the Commission in the allocation of financial support to railway projects. The Commission will coordinate the development of such a plan, in accordance with Article 155(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 
(16) The provisions of this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Committee set up by Directive 96/48/EC, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
The TSI relating to the %quot%control-command and signalling%quot% subsystem of the trans-European high-speed rail system referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 96/48/EC is hereby adopted by the Commission. The TSI is set out in the Annex to this Decision. The TSI is fully applicable to the infrastructure and rolling stock of the trans-European high-speed rail system as defined in Annex I to Directive 96/48/EC, taking into account Article 2 and Article 3 hereunder. 
Article 2 
1. With regard to the systems referred to in Annex B to the attached TSI, the conditions to be complied with for the verification of the interoperability within the meaning of Article 16(2) of Directive 96/48/EC are the applicable technical rules in use in the Member State which authorises the placing in service of the subsystem concerned by this Decision. 
2. Each Member State shall notify to the other Member States and to the Commission within six months of the notification of this Decision: 
- the list of the applicable technical rules mentioned under Article 2(1), 
- the conformity assessment and checking procedures to be applied with regard to the application of these rules, 
- the bodies it appoints for carrying out those conformity assessment and checking procedures. 
Article 3 
1. For the purposes of this Article: 
- %quot%upgrading%quot% means major work to modify a subsystem or part of a subsystem which changes the performance of the subsystem, 
- %quot%renewal%quot% means major work to replace a subsystem or part of a subsystem which does not change the performance of the subsystem, 
- %quot%maintenance-related replacement%quot% means replacement of components by parts of identical function and performances in the context of predictive or corrective maintenance. 
2. In the case of upgrading, the contracting entity will submit a dossier describing the project to the Member State concerned. The Member State will examine the dossier and, taking into account the implementation strategy in Chapter 7 of the attached TSI, will (where appropriate) decide whether the scale of the work requires the need for a new authorisation for placing in service under Article 14 of Directive 96/48/EC. Such authorisation for placing in service is necessary whenever the level of safety may objectively be affected by the work envisaged. 
Where a new authorisation for placing in service under Article 14 of Directive 96/48/EC is necessary, the Member State decides whether: 
(a) the project includes full application of the TSI, in which case the subsystem will be subject to the EC verification procedure in Directive 96/48/EC; or 
(b) full application of the TSI is not yet possible. In this case the subsystem will not be in full conformity with the TSI and the EC verification procedure in Directive 96/48/EC shall be applied only in respect of the parts of the TSI applied. 
In these two cases the Member State will inform the Committee set up pursuant to Directive 96/48/EC of the dossier including the parts of TSI being applied and the degree of interoperability being achieved. 
3. In the case of renewal and maintenance-related replacement, application of the attached TSI is voluntary. 
Article 4 
Member States shall establish a national implementation plan of the attached TSI according with the criteria specified in its Chapter 7. They shall forward this implementation plan to the other Member States and the Commission not later than six months after notification of this Decision. 
Article 5 
Commission Decisions 1999/569/EC(3) and 2001/260/EC(4) have no further effect from the date of entry into force of the attached TSI. 
Article 6 
The attached TSI shall enter into force six months after notification of this Decision.

ANNEX 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR INTEROPERABILITY RELATING TO THE CONTROL-COMMAND AND SIGNALLING SUBSYSTEM 
1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. TECHNICAL SCOPE 
This TSI concerns the control-command and signalling subsystem, which is one of the subsystems listed in Annex II(1) to Directive 96/48/EC. It is referred to in this document as %quot%control-command%quot% or %quot%CC%quot%. 
This TSI is part of a set of six TSIs, which cover all the eight subsystems defined in the Directive. The specifications concerning the %quot%users%quot% and %quot%environment%quot% subsystems, which are necessary to ensure interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system in compliance with the essential requirements, are set out in the TSIs concerned. 
More information about the control-command and signalling subsystem is given in Chapter 2. 
1.2. GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE 
The geographical scope of this TSI is the trans-European high-speed rail system as described in Annex I to Directive 96/48/EC. 
Reference shall be made in particular to the lines of the trans-European rail network described in Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network or in any update to the same Decision as a result of the revision provided for in Article 21 of that Decision. 
1.3. CONTENT OF THIS TSI 
In accordance with Article 5(3) of and with Annex I(1)(b) to Directive 96/48/EC, this TSI: 
(a) specifies the essential requirements for the subsystems and their interfaces (Chapter 3); 
(b) establishes the basic parameters described in Annex II(3) to that Directive, which are necessary to meet the essential requirements (Chapter 4); 
(c) establishes the conditions to be complied with to achieve the specified performances for each of the following categories of line (Chapter 4): 
- category I: specially built high-speed lines equipped for speeds generally equal to or greater than 250 km/h, 
- category II: specially upgraded high-speed lines equipped for speeds of the order of 200 km/h, 
- category III: specially upgraded high-speed lines which have special features as a result of topographical, relief or town-planning constraints, on which the speed must be adapted to each case; 
(d) establishes implementing provisions in certain specific cases (Chapter 7); 
(e) determines the interoperability constituents and interfaces which must be covered by European specifications, including European standards, which are needed in order to achieve interoperability within the trans-European high-speed rail system while meeting the essential requirements (Chapter 5); 
(f) states, in each case under consideration, which of the modules defined in Decision 93/465/EEC or, where appropriate, which specific procedures are to be used in order to assess either the conformity or the suitability for use of the interoperability constituents, as well as %quot%EC%quot% verification of the subsystems (Chapter 6). 
2. SUBSYSTEM DEFINITION AND SCOPE 
2.1. GENERAL 
Definition: control-command subsystem. The control-command subsystem is defined as that set of functions and their implementation which allow the safe and predictable movement of rail traffic in order to meet the desired operational activities. 
Scope: The TSI control-command defines the essential requirements for those parts of the control-command subsystem that have relevance to interoperability, and therefore are subject to EC declaration of verification. 
The features of the control-command subsystem that are related to the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system are determined by: 
(1) the Functions that are essential for the safe control of the railway traffic, and that are essential for operations, including those required under degraded conditions; 
(2) Interfaces, 
(3) the level of Performance required to meet the essential requirements. 
The requirements on the necessary functions, interfaces and performance are introduced in the characterisation of control-command, which is described in section 4 where the supporting standards are referenced. 
2.2. OVERVIEW 
The interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail network depends in part on the ability of the on-board control-command equipment to work with the various trackside equipment installed upon it(1). 
2.2.1. INTEROPERABILITY 
Technical interoperability ensures that the trains are able to run safely on the interoperable lines, receiving the necessary control-command data from the trackside. Technical interoperability is obtained by providing the trains with the correct functions, interfaces and performance for the infrastructure over which the service is to pass. Technical interoperability is the prerequisite for operational interoperability, in which the driving is based on consistent information displayed in the cabs and is in accordance with signalling principles defined for the high-speed network that are independent of the technology used. 
2.2.2. CLASSES OF CONTROL-COMMAND INTERFACES BETWEEN TRACK AND TRAIN 
Interoperability of the control-command functions is to be founded upon the development of unified specifications of the interfaces which provide for interoperability. In the meantime, the specification of the interfaces presently used for interoperable services (termed class B) are subject to the requirements of this TSI. Each class B specification shall be managed as follows. Member States have the responsibility to ensure that during their life the class B systems are managed in the interests of interoperability, in particular any changes to these specifications are to be managed such that interoperability is not prejudiced. 
Two classes of control-command interfaces between track and train are defined: 
class A: the unified control-command interfaces - these interfaces are defined in Chapter 4. Annex A includes the specifications that define the interoperability requirements of the class A control-command interfaces, 
class B: control-command interfaces and applications existing before entry into force of Directive 96/48/EC limited to those described in Annex B. These can be implemented as STMs(2). 
In order to achieve interoperability, the trains' on-board control-command assembly will consist of: 
- the class A radio and data communication interfaces to the infrastructure, in case of operation with class A Infrastructure, 
- the class B radio and data communication interfaces to the infrastructure, in case of operation with class B infrastructure. 
Section 7 describes the requirements for the transition phase from the class B interfaces to the class A interfaces for radio and for signalling purposes. 
2.2.3. LEVELS OF APPLICATION 
Control-command interfaces provide for the means of data transmission to, and sometimes from, the trains. The class A specifications called up by this TSI provide options from which a project may choose the means of transmission that meet its requirements. By convention, three levels of application are defined: 
level 1: the data transmission requirement is met by intermittent (Eurobalise) and in some cases semi continuous (Euroloop or radio infill) transmission along the track. The detection of trains is achieved by track-based equipment, usually track circuits or axle counters. Information is communicated to the driver from either the line side, or cab-signalling, 
level 2: the data transmission requirement is met by radio (GSM-R) transmission along the track. For some functions, the radio transmission requires complementing by intermittent (Eurobalise) transmission. The detection of trains is achieved by track-based equipment, usually track circuits or axle counters. Information is communicated to the driver by cab-signalling, 
level 3: the data transmission requirement is met by radio (GSM-R) transmission along the track. For some functions, the radio transmission requires complementing by intermittent (Eurobalise) transmission. The detection of trains is achieved by train-based equipment reporting to the command-control data-processing system. Information is communicated to the driver by cab-signalling. 
The requirements of this TSI apply to all levels of application. The implementation issue is addressed in Chapter 7. A train equipped with class A interfaces for a given level of application shall be able to operate with that level of application and any lower one. 
2.2.4. NETWORK BORDERS 
The localised interfaces between the trackside control-command systems of neighbouring railways shall provide for the passage without restrictions of trains operating the high-speed services between the networks. 
3. THE ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONTROL-COMMAND SUBSYSTEM 
3.1. GENERAL 
Article 4(1) of Interoperability Directive 96/48/EC, requires that the trans-European high-speed rail system, subsystems and their interoperability constituents meet the essential requirements set out in general terms in Annex III to the Directive. The essential requirements are: 
- safety, 
- reliability and availability, 
- health, 
- environmental protection, 
- technical compatibility. 
The Directive allows that the essential requirements may be generally applicable to the whole trans-European high-speed rail system or be specific to each subsystem and its interoperability constituents. 
3.2. SPECIFIC ASPECTS FOR THE CONTROL-COMMAND SUBSYSTEM 
The essential requirements are taken in turn, below. The requirements apply to all control-command systems employing class A interfaces. The class B interfaces have specific features. 
3.2.1. SAFETY 
Every project to which this specification is applicable shall put into effect the measures necessary to demonstrate that the level of risk of an incident occurring that is within the scope of the control-command systems is not higher than the objective required for the service. For this purpose, Annex A, index 1, shall be used. 
For class A equipment, the global safety objective for the subsystem is apportioned between the on-board and trackside assemblies. For the safety-related part of one on-board assembly as well as for one trackside assembly, the safety requirement for ETCS level 2 is: tolerable hazard rate of 10-9/hour (for random failures) corresponding to safety integrity level 4 (preliminary value to be confirmed and to be extended for other ETCS levels). The detailed requirements are specified in Annex A, index 2a. 
For class B equipment used for high speed operation, it is the responsibility of the Member State to guarantee that appropriate safe speed enforcement is performed by the class B system, and to state the speed limit. 
3.2.2. RELIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY 
(a) For class A interfaces, the global reliability and availability objectives for the subsystem are apportioned between the on-board and trackside assemblies. The requirements are specified in Annex A, index 2b. 
(b) The quality of the maintenance organisation for all systems comprising the control-command subsystem shall ensure that the level of risk is controlled regarding constituent age and wear. The quality of the maintenance shall ensure that safety is not prejudiced because of these activities. Annex A, index 2c shall be applied. 
3.2.3. HEALTH 
Precautions shall be taken to ensure that the materials used in and the design of control-command systems do not constitute a health hazard to persons having access to them. 
This TSI does not introduce any additional requirement to the ones already requested by applicable European regulations. 
3.2.4. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 
3.2.4.1. The control-command systems, if subjected to excessive heat or fire, shall not exceed limits for the emission of fumes or gases which are harmful to the environment. 
3.2.4.2. The control-command systems shall not contain substances which may during their normal use abnormally contaminate the environment. 
3.2.4.3. The control-command systems shall be subject to the European legislation in force controlling the limits to the emission of and the susceptibility to electromagnetic interference along the boundaries of railway property. 
This TSI does not introduce any additional requirement to the ones already required by applicable European regulations. 
3.2.5. TECHNICAL COMPATIBILITY 
Technical compatibility includes the functions, interfaces and performances required to achieve interoperability. In order to fulfil this essential requirement and achieve interoperability, the requirements of section 4 of this TSI must be met in full. 
The requirements of technical compatibility are therefore presented in two categories: 
- the first category sets out the general engineering requirements for interoperability, that is environmental conditions, internal electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) within the railway boundaries, and installation. These compatibility requirements are defined in this section; 
- the second category describes what the control-command subsystem has to do in order that interoperability is achieved. This category forms the major part of this interoperability specification. 
3.2.5.1. Engineering compatibility 
3.2.5.1.1. Physical environmental conditions 
(a) Systems complying with the class A interface requirements shall be capable of operating under the climatic and physical conditions which exist along the relevant part of the trans-European high-speed network (e.g. defined according to climatic zones). For this purpose Annex A, index 3, shall be used. 
(b) The systems complying with the class B interface requirements shall conform at least to the physical environmental specifications applying to the corresponding class B system, in order to be capable of operating under the climatic and physical conditions which exist along the high-speed lines concerned. 
3.2.5.1.2. Electromagnetic compatibility 
The electromagnetic compatibility requirements (which include train detection requirements) are: 
(a) internal control-command compatibility 
On-board and trackside control-command assemblies shall not interfere with each other. 
Class A and class B systems shall not interfere with each other. 
(b) Compatibility between the control-command subsystem and other TSI subsystems. 
Class A control-command equipment shall not interfere with other TSI subsystems, nor be interfered with by other TSI subsystems. 
Neither the train operators nor the infrastructure controllers may install new systems which are not compatible with class A control-command equipment emissions and susceptibility. 
(c) Compatibility between the railway and systems external to the trans-European high-speed network 
This TSI does not introduce any requirements additional to those specified by applicable European regulations. 
The following standards shall be applied: 
- Annex A, index 4a (emission and susceptibility limits of control-command electronic equipment), 
- Annex A, index 4b (immunity characteristics of train detection systems), 
- Annex A, indices 12a and 12b (emission and susceptibility limits of balise and loop interfaces), 
- Annex A, index 12c (emission and susceptibility limits of train radio interfaces). 
3.2.5.2. Control-command compatibility 
Section 4, supported by Annexes A and B, defines the requirements for the interoperability of the control-command subsystem for each class of interface, class A and class B. 
4. CHARACTERISATION OF THE SUBSYSTEM 
The trans-European high-speed rail system, to which Directive 96/48/EC applies and of which the control-command subsystem is a part, is an integrated system which requires the functions, interfaces and performance (all of which are basic parameters) to be verified, in particular so as to ensure that the system is interoperable and that the essential requirements are met. Annex A lists the mandatory European specifications for the class A functions, interfaces and performance; Annex B lists the characteristics of the class B systems and the responsible Member States. The control-command characterisation is presented in the following order: 
- functions 
- interfaces internal to control-command 
- interfaces to other TSIs 
- performance. 
The STMs, which enable the class A system to operate over class B infrastructure, are subject to the class B system requirements. The implementation of the class A functions and interfaces and the transition to it from the class B systems are subject to the requirements of section 7. 
The TSI control-command describes the ERTMS characteristics, in accordance with the Directive 96/48/EC. 
The basic parameters of the class B equipment are the subject of Annex B. 
4.1. BASIC PARAMETERS OF THE SUBSYSTEM - CLASS A EQUIPMENT 
4.1.1. BASIC PARAMETERS OF THE SUBSYSTEM: INTERNAL FUNCTIONS 
This section specifies the functions of control-command class A equipment that are essential to interoperability. The ETCS functions required for interoperability are: 
- the cab-signalling function, 
- the automatic train protection function, comprising: 
- selecting the speed supervision mode, 
- defining and providing the intervention function, 
- setting the train characteristics, 
- proving train integrity(3) (note: rolling stock TSI is also concerned), 
- equipment health monitoring and failure mode support, comprising: 
- initialising the subsystem, 
- testing the subsystem in service, 
- testing the subsystem in depot, 
- providing failure mode support, 
- exchanging data between the trackside assembly and the on-board assembly, 
- managing the STMs, 
- support to cab-signalling and automatic train protection, comprising: 
- supporting driving, 
- providing odometry, 
- recording data, 
- the vigilance function. 
To achieve interoperability it is not necessary to standardise all the functions within the whole control-command and signalling subsystem. The principle followed is the definition of: 
- trackside standard functions, able to read data from national interlocking and signalling systems and to translate such data into standard messages for the trains, 
- standard interfaces for track-to-train and train-to-track communication, 
- on-board standard functions, ensuring that every train will react to data received from trackside in a predictable way. 
Only the above mentioned functionality is considered in this chapter. 
The GSM-R functions required for interoperability are the voice and data communication between trackside and on-board. 
- In Annex A, index 0a, the ETCS functional requirement specifications are indicated. 
- In Annex A, index 0b, the GSM-R functional requirement specifications are indicated. 
The control-command functions are classified in three categories: 
M: standard functions whose implementation is mandatory. For example: the ETCS end-of-movement authority, 
O: functions for which the implementation is optional, but if implemented a standard specification applies. For example: GSM-R fax transmission, 
N: functions of the national part of control-command. For example: interlocking functions. 
The classification of the functions is indicated within the text of the ETCS FRS and the GSM-R FRS. 
ETCS functions shall be implemented in accordance with the technical specifications indicated in Annex A, indices 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and their performance shall conform to indices 2 and 18. 
The vigilance function shall be implemented on-board in accordance with Annex A, index 10. Implementation may be: 
- outside the ERTMS/ETCS, with an optional interface to the ERTMS/ETCS equipment on-board, or 
- inside the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment. 
The infill data transmission function in ETCS level 1 applications is only mandatory on-board under the conditions defined in section 7. 
GSM-R radio functions shall be implemented in accordance with the technical specifications indicated in Annex A, index 11. 
4.1.2. BASIC PARAMETERS OF THE SUBSYSTEM: INTERNAL INTERFACE 
Definition: internal interfaces are defined as those matters which concern two control-command interoperability constituents or assemblies, and describe the functional, electrical and/or mechanical conditions applying to the links between them. The voice and data transmission between the train and the trackside are part of the internal interfaces. 
This section specifies the functions of control-command class A internal interfaces which are essential for interoperability. 
4.1.2.1. Interface between on-board and trackside assembly 
(a) Radio communications with the train 
Class A radio communication interfaces shall operate in the GSM-R bands, including the public bands and those frequency bands that are exclusively allocated for use by the railways. Annex A, index 12, shall apply to radio communications. 
There shall be formalised procedures created which conform to the needs of a multilingual environment. 
(b) Balise and loop communications with the train 
Class A balise and loop communication interfaces shall comply with Annex A, index 12. 
4.1.2.2. Interfaces between on-board interoperability constituents essential to interoperability 
The data communications characteristics of each interface shall be such as to enable the requirements of the functions and failure modes to be met. 
(a) The interface between the class A radio and the cab-signalling/automatic train protection functions. These requirements are specified in Annex A, index 13a. 
(b) Access to data recorded on-board for regulatory purposes. Each Member State shall have access to the recorded data that meets obligatory data-recording requirements for official and investigative purposes. This interface and the data formats are specified in Annex A, index 13b. 
(c) Odometry: the interface between the odometry function and ETCS on-board functions shall meet the requirements of Annex A, index 13c. 
(d) The STM interface: the interface between the class A functions and the STMs of Annex B is defined in Annex A, index 6. 
4.1.2.3. Interfaces between trackside interoperability constituents essential to interoperability 
(a) Between the class A radio system and the ERTMS/ETCS: these requirements are specified in Annex A, index 14a. 
(b) Between Eurobalise and the LEU: these requirements are specified in Annex A, index 14b. 
(c) Between Euroloop and the LEU: these requirements are specified in Annex A, index 14c. 
(d) Between the ERTMS/ETCS centres of neighbouring infrastructure controllers: these requirements are specified in Annex A, index 14d. 
4.1.2.4. Key management 
Safety related data transmitted via radio are protected by mechanisms that need cryptographic keys. The infrastructure manager shall provide a management system that controls and manages the keys. A key management interface is required: 
- between the key management systems of different infrastructure managers, 
- between the key management system and the on-board and track-side ETCS. 
The security of key management affects the safety of the control-command subsystem. Therefore a security policy is required for the key management system. 
The requirements are specified in Annex A, index 15. 
4.1.3. INTERFACES TO OTHER CC EQUIPMENT 
The control-command track-side functions addressed by this TSI shall be able to read information from interlocking and other signalling systems and, depending upon the functions implemented, to transmit information to them. 
Standardisation of this interface is not necessary to achieve interoperability, therefore this interface is not defined in European specifications. 
4.2. INTERFACES OF THE SUBSYSTEM TO OTHER SUBSYSTEMS 
Definition: external interfaces are defined as those matters that concern two TSI subsystems. 
4.2.1. THE EXTERNAL CLASS A INTERFACES REQUIRED FOR INTEROPERABILITY 
This section specifies the external interfaces of the control-command subsystem, as defined in this TSI, to the other TSI subsystems that are essential to interoperability. For the energy TSI, there are indirect requirements via the rolling stock TSI concerning in particular EMC. The external interfaces are: 
the operations interfaces, comprised of: 
A. functional and procedural requirements, ergonomics, and understanding of the MMI; 
B. functional requirements of data-recording; 
C. role of radio, and understanding; 
the rolling stock interfaces, comprised of: 
A. the guaranteed train braking performance and characteristics; 
B. compatibility between track-based systems and the rolling stock (ETCS Level 1 and 2); 
C. vehicle geometry and movement; the relationship of the antennae to the structure and kinematic gauges and track-geometry, including vehicle behaviour; 
D. installation matters: 
- the physical environment, 
- electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) with the on-board electrical environment; 
E. train data interfaces: 
- brakes, 
- train integrity, 
- train length; 
F. Electromagnetic compatibility between rolling stock and infrastructure systems; 
the infrastructure interfaces, comprised of: 
installation requirements. 
The relevant standards are referenced, and these are listed in Annex A. The following explanations cover the major issues. 
4.2.1.1. The operation interfaces 
The European high-speed network will be subject to unified operational requirements. These concern principally the trains. For the purposes of interoperability, the class A control-command interfaces shall provide the operators with the technical capability for: 
A. compatibility with the operational requirements. 
A unified set of cab-equipment associated with the class A interfaces. This will include the facility to enter the train characteristics as required by the automatic train protection logic. 
The requirements for driving ergonomics. 
Aid to limit misunderstanding due to differences in language (use of icons, formalised procedures); 
B. the use of data-recording; 
C. the use of radio for voice communication for operational purposes. 
4.2.1.2. Rolling stock interfaces 
A. The train braking performance: 
(i) the rolling stock TSI defines the braking performance of interoperable trains; 
(ii) the class A control-command system shall provide the adaptability necessary to the real braking performance of the rolling stock; 
(iii) upon a call for the emergency brake, the rolling stock subsystem shall prevent traction being applied. This requirement is promulgated in the rolling stock TSI. 
B. Compatibility with track-based train detection: 
(i) the rolling stock shall have the characteristics necessary for the operation of train detection systems. Annex A, index 16 shall be used; 
(ii) rail-mounted train detection systems shall have the characteristics necessary to be activated by rolling stock which conforms to the rolling stock TSI. 
C. Vehicle geometry and movement: 
(i) the on-board antennae shall be positioned such that the vehicle kinematic gauge is respected as defined by the rolling stock TSI; 
(ii) the position of the antennae on the rolling stock shall be such that reliable data communication is assured at the extremes of the track geometry capable of being traversed by the rolling stock. The movement and behaviour of the rolling stock shall be taken into account. 
D. Installation matters: 
(i) environmental conditions. the resistance to the on-board physical environment is defined in Annex A, index 3; 
(ii) electromagnetic compatibility with the on-board electrical environment. To ensure that the on-board equipment for the control-command systems may be universally used for new rolling stock accepted for operation upon the trans-European high-speed network, there shall be applied to the electrical environment of the rolling stock and the susceptibility of the interoperable control-command system to electrical interference a common specification of electromagnetic compatibility as defined in Annex A, index 4a. Integration tests will be required; 
(iii) isolation of ETCS on-board equipment. 
E. Data interfaces: 
the following sets of data interfaces with the train are required by class A equipment: 
- brakes, 
- train integrity (ETCS level 3), 
- train length. 
These interfaces shall be adaptable for rolling stock operating in multiple units. 
The interface requirements between the radio communications and the rolling stock subsystem are specified in Annex A, index 11. The other interface requirements between the control-command functions and the rolling stock subsystem are specified in Annex A, index 17. 
F. Electromagnetic compatibility between rolling stock and control-command trackside equipment: to ensure that new rolling stock accepted for use on all or part of the trans-European high-speed network will be compatible with the associated control-command infrastructure, there shall be a common specification describing the limits to conducted and induced traction current as well as electromagnetic field characteristics to be permitted; refer to Annex A, index 4b. 
4.2.1.3. Infrastructure interfaces 
The infrastructure installation shall ensure that: 
(a) the train detection system respects the requirements quoted in 4.2.1.2(B), above; 
(b) the position of the antennae of the trackside subsystems is such that reliable data communication is assured at the extremes of the track geometry capable of being traversed by the rolling stock. The movement and behaviour of the rolling tock shall be taken into account. By definition, the communication antennae at the trackside shall not infringe the network's structure gauge. The respect of the structure gauge requirement of the European high-speed network is a matter for the infrastructure manager. 
4.2.2. THE EXTERNAL CLASS B INTERFACES REQUIRED FOR INTEROPERABILITY 
Only the following class A requirements shall apply to external class B interfaces: 
- vehicle geometry and movement (see 4.2.1.2(C)), 
- EMC (see section 7). 
All other requirements are to be found by reference to Annex B. 
4.3. SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE FOR INTEROPERABILITY 
Class A systems have to fulfil technical performance requirements in accordance with Annex A, index 18. 
Class B systems on interoperable trains have to offer all their available parameters and ranges of parameter values for optimal train running; in particular speed and braking performance of trains must be made usable by control-command braking parameters as far as economically reasonable. 
4.4. SPECIAL CASES: APPLICATION MODALITIES 
This subject is addressed in Chapter 7. 
5. INTEROPERABILITY CONSTITUENTS 
Section 5 describes the interoperability constituents adopted for the control-command subsystem. 
5.1. CONTROL-COMMAND INTEROPERABILITY CONSTITUENTS 
As described in section 2, the control-command subsystem is divided into two assemblies, trackside and on-board. An interoperability constituent can only belong to one of these assemblies. 
The interoperability constituents in the control-command subsystem are listed in Tables 5.1 and 5.2: 
- Table 5.1 lists the interoperability constituents of the control-command on-board assembly. 
- Table 5.2 lists the interoperability constituents of the control-command trackside assembly. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
For each interoperability constituent the reference to European specifications to be applied is given in Annex A. 
These interoperability constituents are specific to railway applications. 
5.2. GROUPING OF INTEROPERABILITY CONSTITUENTS 
The control-command interoperability constituents defined in Tables 5.1 and 5.2 may be combined to form a larger unit. The group is then defined by the functions of the integrated interoperability constituents and the remaining inter-faces on the outside of the group. The groups are defined in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Each group has to be supported by European specifications. A group so formed is then to be considered as an interoperability constituent. 
The declaration of conformity for an interoperability constituent requires that each of its interfaces referred to in Table 5 is supported by one or more European specifications. The specifications concerned will be referenced by Annex A. As long as a European specification is not available to support an interface given in Table 5, this interoperability constituent cannot be supported by a declaration of conformity. Therefore the interoperability constituent concerned shall be integrated into a group of interoperability constituents for which a declaration of conformity is then possible.

6. ASSESSMENT OF CONFORMITY AND/OR SUITABILITY FOR USE AND EC DECLARATION OF VERIFICATION 
6.1. INTEROPERABILITY CONSTITUENTS 
6.1.1. CONFORMITY AND SUITABILITY FOR USE ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES (MODULES) 
This section deals with the EC declaration of conformity for the control-command interoperability constituents. 
An EC declaration of suitability for use is not required for interoperability constituents of the control-command subsystem. 
The assessment procedure for conformity of interoperability constituents as defined in Chapter 5 of this TSI shall be carried out by application of modules as specified in Annex E to this TSI. 
The specifications for the performance, interfaces and functions required of each class A interoperability constituent are obtained by reference to Annex A. Tables 5.1a, 5.1b, 5.2a and 5.2b indicate for each interoperability constituent the indices of Annex A to be applied. The tests and test tool requirements which are mandatory to assess the conformity of the performance, interfaces and functions of each interoperability constituent are also obtained from these tables. Those European specifications to be applied to the defined interoperability constituents are identified in point 5.1. 
The conformity assessment shall include safety, e.g. the demonstration that the application software is implemented in a safety platform that has a prior declaration of conformity in a way that achieves safety acceptance according to the Annex A, index 1. This shall also include the demonstration that other software modules possibly installed in the same platform do not interfere with ERTMS/ETCS application. 
If interoperability constituents are combined into a group, the conformity assessment shall cover the remaining interfaces and the functions of the integrated interoperability constituents as identified in point 5.2. 
The independent assessment in the safety acceptance and approval process as described in Annex A, index 1 may be accepted by the notified body, without it being repeated. 
6.1.1.1. The specific transmission module (STM) 
The STM has to meet national requirements, and its approval is a responsibility of the Member State as stated in Annex B. 
The verification of the STM interface to the ERTMS/ETCS on-board and certain associated external interfaces to the rolling stock TSI subsystem, as indicated in Table 5.1 require a conformity assessment carried out by a notified body. The notified body shall verify that the Member State has approved the national part of the STM. 
6.1.1.2. EC declaration of conformity 
For each interoperability constituent or group of interoperability constituents, the content of the declaration must conform to Annex IV to Directive 96/48/EC. 
An interoperability constituent is the smallest item for which a declaration of conformity may be obtained. 
6.1.2. APPLICATION OF MODULES 
6.1.2.1. Assessment of conformity 
For the assessment procedure of interoperability constituents of the control-command subsystem the manufacturer or his authorised representative established within the Community may choose the modules according to the indications in Tables 5.1a, 5.1b, 5.2a and 5.2b. 
6.1.2.2. Definition of assessment procedures 
The assessment procedures are defined in Annex E to this TSI. 
The module D may only be chosen where the manufacturer operates a quality system for production, final product inspection and testing, approved and surveyed by a notified body. 
The module H2 may only be chosen where the manufacturer operates a quality system for design, production, final product inspection and testing, approved and surveyed by a notified body. 
6.2. CONTROL-COMMAND SUBSYSTEM 
This section deals with EC declaration of verification of the control-command subsystem. As stated in dection 2 the application of the control-command subsystem is treated as two assemblies: 
- the on-board assembly, 
- the trackside assembly. 
For each assembly a declaration of verification is needed. The scope of the EC declaration of verification, according to Directive 96/48/EC, includes the verification of the integration of the interoperability constituents that are part of the relevant subsystem. Tables 6.1 and 6.2 define the characteristics to be verified, and reference European specifications to be applied. 
The line specific implementation of the trackside assembly is defined in the register of infrastructure in accordance with Annex C. 
The train specific implementation for the on-board assembly is defined in the register of rolling stock in accordance with Annex C. 
The declaration of verification of trackside assembly and on-board assembly shall contain the information upon which the content of the register of infrastructure/register of rolling stock is based. The registers shall be verified and issued under the responsibility of the Member State which authorises the placing into service of the assembly. Verification of the register of infrastructure and register of rolling stock means that these are consistent with the formats given in Annex C and reflect the effective configuration of the assembly. 
The following requirements apply to both the on-board assembly and the trackside assembly. Each assembly shall satisfy: 
- the EC verification requirements of Directive 96/48/EC (Annex VI), 
- the requirements on the EC declaration of verification of Directive 96/48/EC (Annex V). 
The EC declaration of verification is the task of the awarding entity (this could be e.g. the infrastructure manager or the train operator). 
The declaration of verification of on-board and trackside assemblies, together with the certificates of conformity, is sufficient to ensure that an on-board assembly will operate with a trackside assembly equipped with corresponding functions as defined in the register of rolling stock and in the register of infrastructure without an additional subsystem declaration of verification. 
The references to the integration procedures and the test requirements of the on-board and trackside assemblies are specified in Annex A, indices 32 and 33. 
Trackside assembly functional integration verification: 
European specifications must be complemented by national specifications covering: 
- the description of the line, characteristics such as gradients, distances, positions of route elements and balises/loops, locations to be protected, 
- the signalling data and rules required to be handled by the ERTMS system. 
A notified body is required for that part of the control-command trackside assembly for which European specifications are established. 
The awarding entity may have the national elements of the trackside assembly assessed by an independent body to ensure that the application of national specifications fulfils the essential requirements. 
The awarding entity may chose to use a notified body for this purpose. 
The awarding entity shall present to the Member State evidence of the correct integration of the part described by the European specifications within control-command and signalling. 
Assessment procedures (modules) 
When requested by the adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community, the notified body undertakes the EC verification in accordance with Article 18(1) and Annex VI to Directive 96/48/EC and in accordance with the provisions of the relevant modules as specified in Annex E to this TSI. 
Assessment procedures for the EC verification of the trackside and on-board assemblies of the control-command subsystem, list of specifications and descriptions of the testing procedures are indicated in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 of this TSI. 
As far as specified in this TSI, the EC verification of the trackside and on-board assemblies of the control-command subsystem shall take account of its interfaces with other subsystems of the trans-European high-speed rail system. 
The adjudicating entity shall draw up the EC declaration of verification for the trackside and on-board assemblies of the control-command subsystem in accordance with Article 18(1) of and Annex V to Directive 96/48/EC. 
The independent assessment in the safety acceptance and approval process as described in Annex A, index 1, may be accepted by the notified body, without it being repeated. 
6.2.1. APPLICATION OF MODULES 
The adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community may choose for the verification procedure of the on-board assembly of the control-command subsystem either: 
- the type-examination procedure (module SB) indicated in Annex E to this TSI for the design and development phase in combination with either the production quality assurance procedure (module SD) indicated in Annex E to this TSI for the production phase or the product verification procedure (module SF) indicated in Annex E to this TSI, or 
- the full quality assurance with design examination procedure (module SH2(4)) indicated in Annex E to this TSI. 
For the verification procedure of the trackside assembly of the control-command subsystem, the adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community may choose either: 
- the unit verification procedure (module SG) indicated in Annex E to this TSI, or 
- the type-examination procedure (module SB) indicated in Annex E to this TSI for the design and development phase in combination with either the production quality assurance procedure (module SD) indicated in Annex E to this TSI for the production phase or the product verification procedure (module SF) indicated in Annex E to this TSI, or 
- the full quality assurance with design examination procedure (module SH2) indicated in Annex E to this TSI. 
The module SH2 may be chosen only where all activities contributing to the subsystem project to be verified (design, manufacturing, assembling, installation) are subject to a quality system for design, production, final product inspection and testing, approved and surveyed by a notified body.

7. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TSI CONTROL-COMMAND 
7.1. PRINCIPLES AND DEFINITIONS 
As specified in Article 1 of Directive 96/48/EC, the conditions to achieve the interoperability of the trans-European high-speed rail system concern projects for and the construction, upgrading and operation of the infrastructure and rolling stock which contribute to the functioning of the system to be put into service after the date of entry into force of the Directive. 
Regarding infrastructures and rolling stock already in service when this TSI enters into force, the TSI shall be applied when works are planned; however, the degree of application of the TSI varies as a function of the entity of such works. 
In the case of control-command, the criteria defined in the following sections shall be applied. 
7.2. SPECIFIC ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TSI CONTROL-COMMAND 
7.2.1. INTRODUCTION 
7.2.1.1. General migration criteria 
It is recognised that ERTMS cannot be installed on all existing high-speed routes instantly for reasons which include installation capability aspects and economic considerations. 
In the transition period between the current (pre-unified) situation and the universal application of control-command class A interfaces(5), there will be a number of interoperability solutions in the framework of this TSI, for both the European high-speed infrastructure including connecting lines and the European high speed trains. The unified concept recognises this and provision is made for modules known as STMs (specific transmission modules) to be added to the unified ERTMS system to enable a train fitted with appropriate STMs to operate over existing pre-unified infrastructure; alternatively an infrastructure may be equipped with both class A and class B(6) systems. 
7.2.1.2. Use of class B systems for interoperable trains 
In a migration phase from pre-unified national systems to the unified system, if only part of the fleet is equipped with an on-board system able to handle the unified system according to class A, it may be neces-sary to have both systems fully or partially installed on a stretch of line. 
There is no functional link between the two on-board systems except to manage transitions during train operation (and as required to satisfy the needs of the STMs for class B systems when STMs are used). 
From a purely functional point, a system may also be built combining components from the unified and a pre-unified system. An example is the combination of an ERTMS/ETCS system level 1 using Eurobalise as a spot-transmission means and an infill function not based on a unified solution, but on a national system. This solution requires a data link between the unified and the pre-unified system. Therefore, the solution is not in accordance with either class A or class B. It cannot be declared interoperable. 
There is, however, the possibility to use the combination as a national enhancement of an interoperable line. This is only permitted if trains not equipped with the data link between both systems can operate either on the unified or on the pre-unified system without information from the other system. If this is not possible, the line cannot be declared interoperable for the control-command subsystem. 
7.2.1.3. Compatibility with other trains 
An interoperable infrastructure may be used for the movement of trains not compliant with the requirements of this TSI, according to Article 5(4) of Directive 96/48/EC, provided this does not create prejudice to the fulfilment of essential requirements. 
Such trains may use a class B signalling infrastructure, if existing. ERTMS/ETCS also offers the possibility of sending information for an on-board class B apparatus via class A track-to-train communication. If this solution is applied, in any case full ERTMS/ETCS functionality shall be installed trackside and the corresponding information shall be sent to the trains, to allow movement of interoperable trains. Trains equipped with on-board class B systems modified to receive information from class A track-to-train communication may not be declared interoperable. 
7.2.1.4. Registers 
For every implementation of the control-command subsystem on a given line, Annex C gives the list of the requirements for the on-board, to be addressed in the registers of infrastructure (TEN HS), indicating if these requirements concern M(7) or O(8) functions. These registers of infrastructure (TEN HS) shall be made available so that the constraints on train configuration may be known. 
7.2.1.5. Timing criteria 
ETCS and GSM-R are computer-based systems with a life expectancy significantly lower than current traditional railway signalling and telecommunication facilities. As such, they call for a proactive rather than reactive deployment strategy to avoid potential system obsolescence prior to system deployment reaching maturity levels. 
Notwithstanding this fact, the adoption of a too-fragmented deployment throughout the European rail network, mainly along the trans-European rail corridors, would give rise to major cost and operational overheads resulting from the needs to ensure backward compatibility and interconnection with a diversity of legacy facilities. Moreover, synergies in terms of time, cost and risk reduction might be reached by the reconciliation of common elements of different national implementation strategies - namely through joint procurement initiatives, collaboration in system validation and certification activities. 
This manifold background calls for the setting-up of a coherent trans-European implementation plan for ERTMS (ETCS and GSM-R) that should contribute to an harmonious development of the whole of the trans-European rail network in compliance with the EU strategy for the TEN-transport network. Such a plan should build upon the corresponding national implementation plans and should provide an appropriate knowledge base for decision support to the different stakeholders - in particular, to the Commission in the allocation of financial support to railway infrastructure projects. 
The emergence of a coherent European plan will necessarily require that the specific national implementation plans are underpinned by the adoption of a set of common generic guiding implementation principles that should be adhered to during its elaboration by the relevant railway authorities. Based on the criteria and requirements expressed in the previous paragraphs and the strategic objectives stated above these principles shall foresee: 
Trackside installations 
The fitting of ETCS or, respectively, GSM-R in the case of: 
- new installations of signalling or radio part of a CC assembly, 
- an upgrade of the signalling or the radio part of a CC assembly already in service that changes the functions or the performance of the subsystem, 
On-board installations 
The fitting of ETCS (if necessary complemented by STMs) or GSM-R in rolling stock intended for use on a line including at least a section equipped with class A interfaces (even if superimposed to a class B system), in the case of: 
- new installations of signalling or radio part of a CC assembly, 
- an upgrade of the signalling or the radio part of a CC assembly already in service that changes the functions or the performance of the subsystem, 
Legacy systems: 
The assurance that class B interfaces and functions are to remain as specified and that the Member State concerned shall provide the information required for their application, in particular, the information relevant to their approval. 
Any non-adherence to these general principles in the elaboration of a national implementation plan should be justified by the Member State concerned on the basis of a file setting out the principles it wishes not to apply and the technical, administrative or economic reasons which justify the non-adherence. 
Once a trans-European implementation plan is completed, all activities related to installation of control-command subsystems have to be justified by the contracting entities against this implementation plan in addition to all other applicable legislative requirements that are in force. Any proposed non-adherence by a contracting entity should be justified in the dossier submitted to the Member State in accordance with Article 3 of this TSI Decision. 
Necessarily, the ERTMS implementation plan will be an evolving document that will have to be updated in order to reflect the real evolution of the deployment throughout the European rail network. 
7.2.1.6. Competition criteria 
Any action to allow the movement of interoperable trains on other infrastructures or the movement of non-interoperable trains on interoperable infrastructures shall ensure that free competition between suppliers is not prejudiced. Specially, knowledge about relevant interfaces between already installed equipment and new equipment to be purchased shall be put at the disposal of all the interested suppliers. 
7.2.2. IMPLEMENTATION: INFRASTRUCTURE (STATIONARY EQUIPMENT) 
The following requirements apply to the three categories of line defined in Article 5c of the Directive: 
- lines specially built for high speed, 
- lines specially upgraded for high speed, 
- lines specially upgraded for high speed which have special features as a result of topographical, relief or town-planning constraints. 
The following cases in points 7.2.2.1, 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3 (according to Article 1 of the Directive) apply to the abovementioned categories. 
7.2.2.1. Lines to be constructed 
Lines to be constructed shall be equipped with the class A functions and interfaces according to the specifications referenced in Annex A. The control-command infrastructure shall provide the class A interfaces for the trains. 
7.2.2.2. Lines to be upgraded (re-signalled) 
When control-command and signalling is upgraded, a line shall be equipped with the class A functions and interfaces according to the specifications given in Annex A. The control-command infrastructure shall provide the class A control-command interfaces for the trains in the same way as for lines to be constructed. 
The upgrade may concern separately the GSM-R radio part, the ETCS part and the train detection part of the control-command subsystem. 
After the upgrade the existing class B equipment may remain in use simultaneously with class A according to point 7.2.1.2. 
Class B control-command equipment trackside EMC limits may remain in use until the control-command subsystem is upgraded. 
The time interval in which a certain line is equipped with both class A and class B control-command equipment is a trackside transition phase. During this transition phase, it is allowed to use existing class B equipment on-board as a fallback arrangement to class A system: this does not allow an infrastructure manager to require class B systems on-board the interoperable trains for running on such a line. 
7.2.2.3. Existing lines 
Lines existing before the entry in force of Directive 96/48/EC and, by extension and according to Article 7 of the Directive, lines belonging to a project which is at an advanced stage of development when this TSI is published may be declared as interoperable in the sense of this TSI (see Chapter 6) when they fulfil the requirements of the control-command subsystem described in this TSI. 
The existing class B control-command equipment may remain in use (without installation of class A systems) during its life cycle, under the conditions indicated in point 7.2.1.5. 
Class B control-command equipment trackside EMC limits may remain in use until the control-command subsystem is upgraded. 
7.2.2.4. Registers of infrastructure (TEN HS) 
When a line is declared interoperable, the infrastructure manager shall provide railway undertakings with class A and class B information written down in the registers of infrastructure (TEN HS), following Annex C requirements. 
In case European specifications for some interface between control-command and signalling and other subsystems are not available at the moment of installation (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility between train detection and RS), the corresponding characteristics and the standards applied shall be indicated in the registers of infrastructure (TEN HS). 
This shall be possible, in any case, only for the items listed in Annex C. 
7.2.3. IMPLEMENTATION: ROLLING STOCK (ON-BOARD EQUIPMENT) 
Rolling stock specially built or upgraded (re-signalled) for high speed shall be equipped with class A interfaces for use on the trans-European high-speed network and shall ensure that the on-board functions, interfaces and minimum performance required by this TSI are included according to the routes concerned as described in Annex C. 
Rolling stock equipment providing class A interfaces shall be able to accommodate additional modules providing class B interfaces (STMs) as may be required by the awarding authority. 
Rolling stock equipped with only class B systems shall be considered acceptable for use on interoperable lines equipped with class B interfaces when it fulfils the requirements of the control-command subsystem described in this TSI. The existing class B control-command equipment may remain in use during its life cycle. 
When running on a line which is equipped with both class A and class B systems, the class B systems may act as fallback arrangement for the class A system if the train is equipped with both class A and class B systems. 
Class B control-command equipment on-board shall not interfere with other TSI subsystems nor with the other equipment installed upon the infrastructure of the European high-speed network. 
Class B control-command equipment on-board shall not be susceptible to emissions from other TSI subsystems. 
7.2.3.1. Registers of rolling stock (TEN HS) 
When a train is declared interoperable, the train specific implementation for the on-board assembly is defined in the registers of rolling stock (TEN HS) following Annex C requirements. 
In case European specifications for some interface between control-command and signalling and other subsystems are not available at the moment of installation (e.g., electromagnetic compatibility between train detection and rolling stock, climatic conditions and physical conditions in which the train can work, geometric parameters of the train like length, maximal distance of axles in the train, length of the nose of the first and of the last car of the train, braking parameters), the corresponding characteristics and the standards applied shall be indicated in the registers of rolling stock (TEN HS). 
This shall be possible, in any case, only for the items listed in Annex C. 
7.2.4. CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH %quot%O%quot% FUNCTIONS ARE REQUIRED 
The %quot%O%quot% functions are required in the following cases: 
1. an ETCS level 3 trackside assembly requires train integrity supervision on-board; 
2. an ETCS level 1 trackside assembly with infill requires corresponding infill functionality on-board if the release speed is set to zero for safety reasons (e.g. protection of danger points); 
3. when ETCS requires data transmission by radio the data transmission services of GSM-R shall be implemented. 
7.2.5. CHANGE CONTROL PROCEDURE 
During the life cycle of the control-command and signalling subsystem, the evolution of the TSI requirements must be managed in the interest of interoperability. 
Any evolution concerning class A and class B functions and interfaces must be controlled following a procedure to be established by the joint representative body applying Article 6(2) of Directive 96/48/EC. 
(1) Assembly: because of the mobility of the on-board part, the control-command subsystem is divided in two parts: on-board assembly and trackside assembly (see Figure 1 in Annex D). 
(2) STM: the specific transmission module (STM) allows class A on-board equipment to operate on lines fitted with class B signalling by using the class B data. 
(3) Train integrity: the status of the completeness of the train according to operational rules. 
(4) Module SH2 can be applied only when a sufficient degree of confidence in the ERTMS technologies exists through return of experience from commercial installations. 
(5) Class A: see section 2. 
(6) Class B: see section 2. 
(7) M functions: see section 4. 
(8) O functions: see section 4. 
ANNEX A 
SPECIFICATIONS FOR INTEROPERABILITY 
This Annex deals with requirements of this TSI only. 
ERTMS references are to be reviewed after the consolidation phase. 
The complete text of a specification is relevant for this TSI, unless otherwise indicated. 
The European specifications quoted in this TSI are grouped into two columns: %quot%European specifications defining basic parameters%quot% and %quot%Other European specifications%quot%. To ensure interoperability, those European specifications defining basic parameters must be fully applied in every implementation; alternative solutions to satisfy the essential requirements are not allowed.

ANNEX B 
CLASS B 
USE OF ANNEX B 
This Annex presents the train-protection, control and warning systems and radio systems that predate the introduction of the class A train control systems and radio systems and that are authorised for use on the European high-speed network up to speed limits defined by the responsible Member State. These class B systems were not developed under unified European specifications, and therefore there may be proprietary specification rights with their suppliers. The provision and maintenance of these specifications shall not conflict with national regulations - especially those concerning patents. 
During the transition phase in which these systems will be gradually replaced by the unified system, there will be a need to manage the engineering specifications in the interests of interoperability. This is the responsibility of the Member State concerned or its representative in cooperation with the respective system supplier in accordance with point 7.2.1.5 of this TSI. 
Train operators needing to install one or more of these systems on their trains shall refer to the appropriate Member State. Annex C manages the corresponding geographical distribution of each system, requiring for each line a register of infrastructure describing the equipment type and the associated operational arrangements. By means of the register of infrastructure, the infrastructure manager ensures the coherence between the system and the rulebook under his authority. 
The Member State shall provide to the train operator the advice necessary to obtain a safe installation compatible with the requirements of this TSI and Annex C. 
The class B installations shall include the fallback arrangements, as required by Annex C. 
For the class B systems, this Annex provides basic information. For each system listed, the Member State identified shall guarantee that its interoperability is maintained and shall provide the information required for the purposes of its application, in particular the information relevant to its approval.

TPWS 
Description 
TPWS is to improve safety, principally at junctions. It includes the functionality of AWS, shown in italics. TPWS applies to all lines considered to be interoperable. 
The system assures the following functions. 
Warning to the driver at standard braking distance of the following restrictive conditions: 
- signals not at clear 
- permanent speed restrictions 
- temporary speed restrictions 
Train protection (predetermined train characteristics) under the following circumstances: 
- train exceeding permitted line speed at specified speed restrictions (speed trap) 
- train approaching a stop signal at excess speed (speed trap) 
- train passing a signal at danger (train stop) 
The system is based on permanent magnets and coils generating fields in the track. The system is not considered fail safe, but incorporates measures and principles to reduce the probability of misleading the driver as low as reasonably practicable. 
The TPWS indicates visually to the driver: 
- the state of the last magnet, clear or restrictive (the %quot%sunflower%quot% indicator), 
- that it is the cause of a brake application, 
- its fault/isolation status. 
The TPWS controls are: 
- an acknowledgement button for the warning of a restrictive condition, 
- a button to pass a signal at danger valid only for a limited time after operation, 
- isolation controls. 
The TPWS audio indications are: 
- a %quot%bell tone%quot% - signal at clear, 
- a %quot%horn tone%quot% - restrictive condition, that must be acknowledged. 
The TPWS system interfaces to the train brake system and provides a full emergency brake application if: 
- the %quot%horn tone%quot% is not acknowledged within 2,5 seconds, 
- immediately the train passes the %quot%speed trap%quot% at excess speed, 
- imediately if the train passes a signal at danger. 
The technology is not processor based, but this is not excluded. 
Other characteristics: 
- Sequence of magnetic fields (North Pole, South Pole) to provide details of signal clear or not clear 
- One of a selection of sinusoidal electromagnetic fields in the region of 60 kHz for the speed trap and train stop functions (up to eight frequencies used) 
- Train characteristics in terms of braking capacity are set by train wiring and give different maximum speeds at speed traps; no train characteristics input presently in service, but can be envisaged 
- Driver acknowledgement of a restrictive condition required within 2,5 seconds, otherwise the emergency brakes are called 
- The emergency brake is releasable one minute after the brake has been applied provided the brake demand has also been acknowledged

Introduction to United Kingdom systems 
The system called NRN (national radio network) is installed over the whole of the UK rail network including the high-speed lines which are the backbone of the UK high-speed network. These consist of: 
- west coast main line (London-Glasgow) 
- east coast main line (London-Edinburgh) 
- Great Western main line (London-Bristol/South Wales) 
The system called %quot%Cab secure%quot% is installed in high traffic suburban areas around London, Liverpool and Glasgow, some of which may include lines forming part of the high-speed network. In addition, all main lines in the south-east, including the existing channel tunnel route from the coast to London Waterloo, are equipped with the cab secure system. 
On lines where both systems exist, the main line passenger trains, plus freight and national trains are equipped with Cab secure radio. Trains are not equipped with both types of radio.

FS ETACS and GSM 
Description 
The solution for radio train-to-ground communication working today at FS is primarily based on the use of services supplied by the public operator on the analogue (ETACS) and the digital (GSM) mobile cellular networks in the 900 MHz band. These networks have been implemented with an external subsystem, developed by the operator together with FS in order to manage some special features as requested by FS, related for example to: 
- addressing of train and station calls through functional numbers in place of the terminal number 
- closed group features with specific barring conditions 
- configuration and handling of specialised databases directly by FS people to characterise access rights to services for each kind of users, and so on. 
Thanks to the wide radio coverage supplied by the two public cellular systems on the FS railway network, the general train-to-ground communication needs can be satisfied in this way. 
The additional features were negotiated and implemented by FS in cooperation with the public service provider. They are implemented in highly reliable distributed computer systems. They are therefore part of the application layer in the ISO/OSI layer model.

LINE-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS AND TRAIN-SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS FOR LINES AND TRAINS DECLARED AS INTEROPERABLE, AND RESULTING REQUIREMENTS 
1. General requirements 
As stated in section 7, the line-specific characteristics defined in this Annex shall be included in the register of infrastructure by the infrastructure manager of lines declared as interoperable by the responsible Member State (Article 14 of Directive 96/48/EC) in the frame of the trans-European high-speed rail system (Annex I to Directive 96/48/EC). 
As stated in section 7, the train-specific characteristics defined in this Annex shall be included in the register of rolling stock by the train operator of trains declared as interoperable in the frame of the trans-European high-speed rail system (Annex I to Directive 96/48/EC). 
As stated in section 6.2, as a precondition for operating a train, the corresponding register of rolling stock and register of infrastructure have to be cross-checked for the sake of interoperability. 
Annex C deals with those aspects of the control-command assemblies which are covered neither by Annex A nor by Annex B, and with the options permitted for class A and class B systems and interfaces (see Figure 1). 
2. Register of infrastructure 
This TSI allows some options of equipment, functions and infrastructure-related values. In addition, where European specifications do not cover the whole control-command trackside assembly, special requirements in the context of existing technical systems and in particular the use of specific operational requirements are possible and are the responsibility of the infrastructure controller. 
Such information concerns for example: 
- choices in the frame of technical compatibility requirements listed in Annex A, 
- choices in the frame of technical compatibility requirements listed in Annex B, 
- EMC-values (because of the use of equipment which is not covered by European specification referred to by TSIs, for instance axle-counter systems), 
- climatic conditions and physical conditions along the line. 
This information has to be available for and used by the train operators in the form of a line specific handbook (register of infrastructure) which can also contain other particularities of other TSIs (e.g., the TSI operation contains in the rule book Annex B systems and degraded modes) 
The register of infrastructure may be specific to one line or a group of lines having the same characteristics. 
The objective is that the requirements and characteristics stated in the register of infrastructure and in the register of rolling stock accord with the TSIs; particularly they must not be a hindrance to interoperability. 
3. Register of rolling stock 
In the frame of this TSI, for the train operator, some choices of equipment, functions and values related to the type of train are foreseen. In addition, because European specifications do not cover the whole onboard assembly control-command the infrastructure controller needs additional information concerning the use of class B systems, and the characteristics of the train which are relevant for trackside non-class B systems. This information concerns, for example: 
- choices in the frame of technical compatibility requirements listed in Annex A, 
- choices in the frame of technical compatibility requirements listed in Annex B, 
- EMC values (because of the use on the lines concerned of equipment which is not covered by European specification referred to by TSIs, for instance track circuits being sensitive to traction currents and their harmonics and axle-counters systems being sensitive to electromagnetic fields), 
- geometric and electrical parameters of the train such as length, maximal distance of axles in the train, length of the nose of the first and of the last car of the train, maximal electrical resistance between the wheels of an axle (in context with Annex A, item 16, because of the track-circuit design arrangement), 
- braking parameters for class A system, 
- braking parameters for class B systems, 
- general braking parameters, 
- types of brakes, 
- eddy current brake installed, 
- magnetic brake installed, 
- climatic conditions and physical conditions in which the train is specified to operate. 
This information has to be available for and to be used by the infrastructure managers by means of a train specific handbook (register of rolling stock) which can also address the possibility of or the need for auxiliary functions for the train to be manageable or to be managed by control-command, e.g., for passage of neutral sections, speed reduction in special circumstances depending of the train and line characteristics (tunnels) and particularities of other TSIs. 
The register of rolling stock can be specific to one train or a category of trains having the same characteristics 
4. Lists of specific characteristics and requirements 
The following list is the mandatory requirement for the register of infrastructure and for the register of rolling stock in order to describe sufficiently the specific characteristics and requirements, and to facilitate interoperability. The list deals only with technical issues, the operational issues are contained in the TSI operation. 
The requirements may be satisfied by the application of a standard. In this case, the reference concerned must be given in these handbooks. 
Otherwise, any special requirements (methods of measurement) must be inserted into or appended to the register of rolling stock and the register of infrastructure. 
For class B systems, the measures implemented in the context of the responsible Member State given in Annex B apply. The register of infrastructure shall include the following items: 
- responsible Member State, 
- name of Annex B system, 
- version and placing-into-service date, 
- speed restrictions and other class B specific conditions/requirements, due to system limitations, 
- further details according to the lists below.

- complies with the other regulations deriving from the Treaty and may be put into service. 
The notified body is carrying out the procedure, including a design examination of the subsystem under the condition, that the adjudicating entity and the manufacturers involved are satisfying the obligations of point 2. 
2. For the subsystem, being subject of the EC verification procedure, the adjudicating entity must contract only with manufacturers, whose activities contributing to the subsystem project to be verified (design, manufacturing, assembling, installation) are subject to an approved quality system for design, manufacture and final product inspection and testing as specified in point 3, and which shall be subject to surveillance as specified in point 4. 
The term %quot%manufacturer%quot% also includes companies: 
- responsible for the whole subsystem project (including in particular responsibility for subsystem integration (main contractor), 
- performing design services or studies (e.g. consultants), 
- performing assembling (assemblers) and installation of the subsystem. For manufacturers, performing only assembling and installation, a quality system for manufacture and final product inspection and testing is sufficient. 
The main contractor responsible for the whole subsystem project (including in particular responsibility for subsystem integration), must operate in any case an approved quality system for design, manufacture and final product inspection and testing, as specified in point 3 and which shall be subject to surveillance as specified in point 4. 
In the case, that the adjudicating entity is directly involved in the design and/or production (including assembling and installation), or that the adjudicating entity itself is responsible for the whole subsystem project (including in particular responsibility for subsystem integration), it has to operate an approved quality system for those activities, as specified in point 3 and subject to surveillance as specified in point 4. 
3. Quality system 
3.1. The manufacturer(s) involved and, if involved, the adjudicating entity must lodge an application for assessment of their quality system with a notified body of their choice. 
The application must include: 
- all relevant information for the subsystem envisaged, 
- the quality system's documentation. 
For manufacturers, only involved in a part of the subsystem project, the information is only requested for that specific relevant part. 
3.2. For the main contractor the quality system must ensure overall compliance of the subsystem with the requirements of Directive 96/48/EC and the TSI. For other manufacturers (subsuppliers) the quality system has to ensure compliance of their relevant contribution to the subsystem with the requirements of the TSI. 
All the elements, requirements and provisions adopted by the applicants must be documented in a systematic and orderly manner in the form of written policies, procedures and instructions. This quality system documentation shall ensure a common understanding of the quality policies and procedures such as quality programmes, plans, manuals and records. 
It must contain in particular an adequate description of the following items for all applicants: 
- the quality objectives and the organisational structure, 
- the corresponding manufacturing, quality control and quality assurance techniques, processes and systematic actions that will be used, 
- the examinations, the checking and tests that will be carried out before, during and after manufacture, assembling and installation and the frequency with which they will be carried out, 
- the quality records, such as inspection reports and test data, calibration data, qualification reports of the personnel concerned, etc., 
for the main contractor and for the subsuppliers (only as far as relevant for their specific contribution to the subsystem project): 
- the technical design specifications, including European specifications, that will be applied and, where the European specifications referred to in Article 10 of Directive 96/48/EC will not be applied in full, the means that will be used to ensure that the requirements of the TSI that apply to the subsystem will be met(22), 
- the design control and design verification techniques, processes and systematic actions that will be used when designing the subsystem, 
- the means to monitor the achievement of the required design and subsystem quality and the effective operation of the quality system). 
and for the main contractor: 
- responsibilities and powers of the management with regard to overall design and subsystem quality, including in particular the subsystem integration management. 
The examinations, tests and checking shall cover all of the following stages: 
- overall design, 
- structure of subsystem, including, in particular, civil-engineering activities, constituent assembly, final adjustment, 
- final testing of the subsystem, 
- and, where specified in the TSI, the validation under full operation conditions. 
3.3. The notified body referred to in point 3.1 must assess the quality system to determine whether it satisfies the requirements referred to in point 3.2. It shall presume compliance with these requirements in respect of quality systems that implement the relevant harmonised standard. This harmonised standard shall be EN ISO 9001 - December 2000, completed if necessary to take into consideration the specificity of the subsystem for which it is implemented. 
For applicants, which are only involved in assembling and installation, the harmonised standard shall be EN ISO 9001 - December 2000, completed if necessary to take into consideration the specificity of the subsystem for which it is implemented. 
The audit shall be specific for the subsystem concerned, taking into consideration the specific contribution of the applicant to the subsystem. The auditing team must have at least one member experienced as an assessor in the subsystem technology concerned. The evaluation procedure shall include an assessment visit to the applicant's premises. 
The decision must be notified to applicant. The notification must contain the conclusions of the examination and the reasoned assessment decision. 
3.4. The manufacturer(s) and, if involved the adjudicating entity must undertake to fulfil the obligations arising out of the quality system as approved and to uphold it so that it remains adequate and efficient. 
They must keep the notified body that has approved their quality system informed of any intended updating of the quality system. 
The notified body must evaluate the modifications proposed and decide whether the amended quality system will still satisfy the requirements referred to in point 3.2 or whether a re-assessment is required. 
It must notify its decision to the applicant. The notification shall contain the conclusions of the examination and the reasoned assessment decision. 
4. Surveillance of the quality system(s) under the responsibility of the notified body(ies) 
4.1. The purpose of surveillance is to make sure that the manufacturer(s) and if involved the adjudicating entity duly fulfil the obligations arising out of the approved quality system. 
4.2. The notified body(ies) as referred to under point 3.1 must have permanent access for inspection purposes to the locations of design, building sites, production workshops, locations of assembling and installation, storage areas and, where appropriate, prefabrication or testing facilities and, more general, to all premises which it considers necessary for its task, in accordance with the applicant's specific contribution to the subsystem project. 
4.3. The manufacturer(s) and, if involved the adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community must send the notified body referred to under point 3.1 (or have sent it) all the documents needed for that purpose and in particular the implementation plans and technical records concerning the subsystem (as far as relevant for the specific contribution of the applicant to the subsystem), in particular: 
- the quality system documentation, including the particular means implemented to ensure that: 
- (for the main contractor) overall responsibilities and powers of the management for the compliance of the whole entire subsystem are sufficiently and properly defined, 
- the quality systems of each manufacturer are correctly managed for achieving integration at subsystem level, 
- the quality records as foreseen by the design part of the quality system, such as results of analyses, calculations, tests, etc., 
- the quality records as foreseen by the manufacturing part (including assembling and installation) of the quality system, such as inspection reports and test data, calibration data, qualification reports of the personnel concerned, etc. 
4.4. The notified body(ies) must periodically carry out audits to make sure that the manufacturer(s) and, if involved the adjudicating entity maintain and apply the quality system and shall provide an audit report to them. 
The frequency of the audits shall be at least once a year, with at least one audit during the time period of performing relevant activities (design, manufacture, assembling or installation) for the subsystem being the subject of the EC verification procedure mentioned under point 6. 
4.5. Additionally the notified body(ies) may pay unexpected visits to the sites mentioned under point 4.2 of the applicant(s). At the time of such visits, the notified body may conduct complete or partial audits, in order to check the proper functioning of the quality system where necessary; it must provide the applicant(s) with an inspection report and, if an audit has been carried out, with an audit report. 
5. The manufacturer(s) and, if involved the adjudicating entity must, for a period of 10 years after the last subsystem has been manufactured, keep at the disposal of the national authorities: 
- the documentation referred to in the second indent of the second subparagraph of point 3.1, 
- the updating referred to in the second subparagraph of point 3.4, 
- the decisions and reports from the notified body which are referred to in the final subparagraph of point 3.4, and points 4.4 and 4.5. 
6. EC verification procedure 
6.1. The adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community must lodge an application for EC verification of the subsystem (through full quality assurance with design examination), including coordination of surveillance of the quality systems as under points 4.4 and 4.5, with a notified body of its choice. The adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community must inform the manufacturers involved of his choice and of the application. 
6.2. The application must enable the design, manufacture, installation and operation of the subsystem to be understood, and shall enable conformity with the requirements of the TSI to be assessed. 
It must include: 
- the technical design specifications, including European specifications, that have been applied, 
- the necessary supporting evidence for their adequacy, in particular where the European specifications referred to in the TSI have not been applied in full(23). This supporting evidence must include the results of tests carried out by the appropriate laboratory of the manufacturer or on his behalf, 
- the infrastructure or rolling stock register (as appropriate), including all indications as specified in the TSI, 
- the technical documentation as regards the manufacturing and the assembling of the subsystem, 
- a list of the interoperability constituents, to be incorporated into the subsystem, 
- a list of all manufacturers, involved in the subsystem's design, manufacturing, assembling and installation, 
- the demonstration, that all stages, as mentioned under point 3.2, are covered by quality systems of the manufacturer(s) and/or of the adjudicating entity involved, and the evidence of their effectiveness, 
- indication of the notified body(ies), responsible for the approval and surveillance of these quality systems. 
6.3. The notified body must examine the application concerning the design examination and where the design meets the provisions of Directive 96/48/EC and of the TSI that apply to it must issue a design examination report to the applicant. The report shall contain the conclusions of the design examination, conditions for its validity, the necessary data for identification of the design examined and, if relevant, a description of the subsystem's functioning. 
6.4. The notified body must, concerning the other stages of the EC verification examine, if all stages of the subsystem as mentioned under point 3.2 are sufficiently and properly covered by the approval and surveillance of quality system(s). 
If the compliance of the subsystem with the requirements of the TSI is based on more than one quality system, it has to examine in particular: 
- if the relations and interfaces between the quality systems are clearly documented, 
- and if overall responsibilities and powers of the management for the compliance of the whole entire subsystem for the main contractor are sufficiently and properly defined. 
6.5. The notified body responsible for the EC verification, if not carrying out the surveillance of the quality system(s) concerned as under point 4, must coordinate the surveillance activities of any other notified body responsible for that task, in order to be ensured that correct management of interfaces between the different quality systems in view of subsystem integration has been performed. This coordination includes the right of the notified body responsible for the EC verification, 
- to receive all documentation (approval and surveillance), issued by the other notified body(ies), 
- to witness the surveillance audits as under point 4.4, 
- to initiate additional audits as under point 4.5 under its responsibility and together with the other notified body(ies). 
6.6. Where the subsystem meets the requirements of Directive 96/48/EC and the TSI, the notified body must then, based on the design examination and the approval and surveillance of the quality system(s), draw up the certificate of EC verification intended for the adjudicating entity or its authorised representative established within the Community, which in turn draws up the EC declaration of verification intended for the supervisory authority in the Member State within which the subsystem is located and/or operates. 
The EC declaration of verification and the accompanying documents must be dated and signed. The declaration must be written in the same language as the technical file and must contain at least the information included in Annex V to Directive 96/48/EC. 
6.7. The notified body shall be responsible for compiling the technical file that has to accompany the EC declaration of verification. The technical file has to include at least the information indicated in Directive 96/48/EC, Article 18(3), and in particular as follows: 
- all necessary documents relating to the characteristics of the subsystem, 
- list of interoperability constituents incorporated into the subsystem, 
- copies of the EC declarations of conformity and, where appropriate, of the EC declarations of suitability for use, which said constituents must be provided in accordance with Article 13 of the Directive, accompanied, where appropriate, by the corresponding documents (certificates, quality system approval and surveillance documents) issued by the notified bodies on the basis of the TSI, 
- all elements relating to the conditions and limits for use, 
- all elements relating to the instructions concerning servicing, constant or routine monitoring, adjustment and maintenance, 
- certificate of EC verification of the notified body as mentioned under point 6.6, accompanied by corresponding calculation notes and countersigned by itself, stating that the project complies with the Directive and the TSI, and mentioning, where appropriate, reservations recorded during performance of the activities and not withdrawn; the certificate should also be accompanied by the inspection and audit reports drawn up in connection with the verification, as mentioned under point 4.4 and 4.5, 
- the infrastructure or rolling stock register (as appropriate), including all indications as specified in the TSI. 
7. The complete records accompanying the certificate of EC verification must be lodged with the adjudicating entity or its authorised representative in support of the certificate of EC verification issued by the notified body and must be attached to the EC declaration of verification drawn up by the adjudicating entity intended for the supervisory authority. 
8. The adjudicating entity or its authorised representative within the Community must keep a copy of the records throughout the service life of the subsystem; it must be sent to any other Member State which so requests.
