COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 88/98 of 18 December 1997 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
(1) Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1866/86 of 12 June 1986 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound (3) has been frequently and substantially amended; whereas for reasons of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be consolidated; 
(2) Whereas, pursuant to Articles 2 and 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture (4), the Council is responsible for adopting, in the light of the available scientific advice, the conservation measures necessary to ensure the rational and responsible exploitation of living marine aquatic resources on a sustainable basis; whereas, to that end, the Council may lay down technical measures concerning fishing gear and the ways in which it is used; 
(3) Whereas it is necessary to establish the principles and certain procedures for laying down the said technical measures at Community level so that each Member State can manage the fishing activities carried on in the maritime waters within its jurisdiction or under its sovereignty; 
(4) Whereas the accession of the Community to the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources in the Baltic Sea and the Belts, as amended by the Protocol to the Conference of the representatives of the States Parties to the Convention and hereinafter referred to as 'the Gdansk Convention`, was approved by Council Decision 83/414/EEC (5); 
(5) Whereas the Gdansk Convention entered into force in respect of the Community on 18 March 1984 and the Community accepted all the rights and obligations of Denmark and the Federal Republic of Germany as laid down by the Gdansk Convention; 
(6) Whereas the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission, set up by the Gdansk Convention, has adopted, since it was established, a body of measures for the conservation and management of fishery resources in the Baltic Sea and has, by its letters of 20 September 1985, 8 December 1986, 21 December 1987, 29 October 1988, 20 September 1993, 20 September 1994 and 11 September 1995, notified the Contracting Parties of certain recommendations to modify those technical measures; 
(7) Whereas the Gdansk Convention provides that the Community must give effect to the said recommendations in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound, subject to the objection procedure laid down in Article XI of the Convention; 
(8) Whereas the most effective means of minimising catches of small fish is to prohibit fishing in those areas where they are heavily concentrated, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Definition of the geographical area 
1. This Regulation concerns the taking and landing of fishery resources occurring in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound bounded to the west by a line drawn from Hasen√∏re Head to Gniben Point, from Korshage to Spodsbjerg and from Gilbjerg Head to the Kullen. It does not apply to waters within the baselines. 
2. It applies to: 
- Community fishermen in the geographical area described in paragraph 1, 
- all fishermen in the waters of this area which lie under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Member States. 
3. The geographical area is divided into 11 subdivisions numbered 22 to 32 which are described in Annex I. 
Article 2 
Ban on fishing for certain species in certain geographical areas during certain periods 
1. It shall be prohibited to retain on board the following species of fish which have been taken in the waters and during the periods listed below: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
2. By way of derogation from the provisions of paragraph 1, by-catches of flounder and plaice in fishing for cod, taken during the periods of prohibition referred to in that paragraph, may be retained on board within a limit of 10 % by weight of the total catch of cod on board the vessel. 
Article 3 
Minimum fish sizes 
1. A fish shall be regarded as undersized if it is smaller than the minimum size specified in Annex III for the species and waters in question. 
2. The size of a fish shall be measured from the tip of the snout, with mouth closed, to the extreme end of the tail fin. 
3. Fish smaller than the minimum size, even where such fish are part of a by-catch, shall not be retained on board or be transhipped, landed, transported, processed, preserved, sold or stored, displayed or offered for sale. They must be returned to the sea, if at all possible while still alive, immediately after being taken. 
4. By way of derogation from paragraph 3, undersized cod may be kept on board within a limit of 5 % by weight of the cod catch on board. 
5. The by-cach of cod taken when fishing for herring and sprat shall not exceed 10 % of the total weight of the catch. Of this by-catch of cod, no more than 5 % of undersized cod shall be kept on board. 
Article 4 
Determination of by-catch percentage 
1. The percentage of the by-catches referred to in Article 2(2) shall be measured as a proportion by weight of the total quantity of cod on board after sorting, or of all cod in the hold or on landing. 
2. The percentage of the by-catches referred to in Article 3(4) shall be measured as a proportion by weight of the total quantity of fish on board after sorting, or of all fish in the hold or on landing. 
3. Detailed rules for the determination of percentage by-catches may be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 13. 
Article 5 
Minimum mesh size 
1. It shall be prohibited to use or to tow any trawl, Danish seine or similar net having meshes of a smaller size than those laid down in Annex IV for the waters, species or group of species of fish concerned. 
2. It shall be prohibited to use anchored floating nets or drift nets having meshes of a smaller size than those laid down in Annex IV for salmon fishery. 
3. It shall be prohibited to use gill nets having meshes of a smaller size than those laid down in Annex IV for the waters, species or groups of species of fish concerned. 
Article 6 
Measurement of mesh size 
1. During the inspection of nets, meshes shall be measured using a flat gauge which is 2 mm thick and made of durable material that will retain its shape. It shall have several parallel-edge sides connected by intermediate tapering sides each with a taper of 1 cm in 8 cm or shall have tapering sides only, with the same taper as indicated above. The gauge shall be inscribed on its surface with the width in millimetres both on the parallel-sided section, where one exists, and on the tapering section. In the case of the latter, the width shall be inscribed every 1 mm interval, and the indication of the width shall appear at regular intervals. 
2. To measure the size of a mesh, the gauge shall be inserted by its narrowest extremity into the mesh opening in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the net so as to measure the long axis of the mesh when stretched diagonally lengthwise. The gauge shall be inserted into the mesh opening with manual force until it is stopped at the tapering edges by the resistance of the mesh. The size of an individual mesh shall be the width of the gauge at the point where the gauge is stopped. 
3. The mesh size of a net shall be the average size of at least one series of 20 consecutive meshes in the direction of the long axis of the net, chosen at random. Meshes less than 10 meshes and within 50 cm from lacings, ropes or codline shall not be measures. This distance shall be measured perpendicular to the lacings, ropes or codline with the net stretched in the direction of that measurement. 
4. The meshes of a net shall be measured only when the net is wet. 
5. An individual mesh shall not be considered undersized if the section of the gauge corresponding to the minimum size listed in Annex IV for the species, waters and type of net concerned, easily passes through it. 
Article 7 
Attachments to nets 
1. By way of derogation from Article 5(1) it shall be permitted to attach to the outside of the lower half of the codend of any trawl, Danish seine or similar net, any canvas, netting or other material which has the purpose of preventing or reducing wear. Such material shall be attached along the forward and lateral edges of the codend only. 
2. By way of derogation from Article 5(1), it shall be permitted to attach to the outside of the codend and the lengthening piece as strengthening bag. A strengthening bag is a cylindrical piece of netting completely surrounding the codend and the lengthening piece. It may be made of either the same or heavier material as the codend or lengthening piece. The mesh size of the strengthening bag shall be at least twice as large as that of the codend except that its minimum mesh size shall not be less than 80 mm. 
A strengthening bag may be attached at the following points: 
(a) at its forward edge; and 
(b) at its rear edge; and, either 
(c) laced circumferentially to the codend and the lengthening piece around one row of meshes; or 
(d) laced longitudinally along a single row of meshes. 
3. By way of derogation from Article 5(1), it shall be permitted to use in trawls, Danish seines and similar nets a non-return net or flapper which has a mesh size smaller than that of the codend. 
The flapper may be attached either inside the codend or in front of the codend. 
The distance from the point of forward attachment of the flapper to the rear end of the codend shall be at least three times the length of the flapper. 
Article 8 
Use of gear 
1. Gear that may not be used within a certain geographical area or during a certain period shall be stowed away on board in such a manner that it is not ready for use in the prohibited area or during the prohibited period. Reserve gear shall be stowed away separately and in such a manner that it is not ready for use. 
2. Fishing gear shall be considered not ready for use if: 
- in the case of trawls, Danish seines and similar nets, 
(a) the trawl boards are made fast to the inner or outer side of the bulwark or the gallows, and 
(b) sweep lines or warps are unschackled from the trawl boards or weights, 
- in the case of salmon-fishing gear, 
(a) the nets are stowed under a lashed cover, 
(b) the lines and hooks are kept in closed boxes, 
- in the case of purse seines, the main or bottom wire is unschackled from the seine. 
3. It shall be prohibited throughout the year, to fish with any trawl, Danish seine and similar net in the geographical area bounded by a line joining the following coordinates: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, during fishing for cod, only gear authorised for fishing for cod or gear with a larger mesh size than the sizes laid down in Annex IV may be allowed to be kept on board. If there is gear on board that is not authorised for fishing for cod, the landing of cod shall be prohibited. 
Article 9

SPECIAL SELECTIVITY DEVICES 
In order to guarantee the selectivity of trawls, Danish seines and similar nets with special mesh openings as referred to in Annex IV, the two models of exit windows below are authorised: 
Exit window (model 1) 
Two exit windows with plastic coated, fully opened diamond meshes shall be attached to the codend of trawls and Danish seines in the cod fishery. The mesh opening shall be no less than 105 mm. The exit windows shall be attached with a separate piece of netting (between the ordinary diamond meshes and the meshes of the exit window). The mesh size of the separate netting shall be identical to the bar length of the exit window times the square root of two. 
The exit window shall be attached on both sides of the codend, and the distance between the rear end of the codend and the window shall be 40 to 50 cm. The length of the window shall be 80 % of the total length of the codend and the height of the window shall be 50 cm. The window shall be mounted in a way that gives an opening between the upper and lower seams of the window of 15 to 20 cm. 
Exit window (model 2) 
Identification 
The windows shall be rectangular sections of netting in the codend. There shall be two windows in the codend. 
Size 
Each window shall have a minimum width of 45 cm along its entire length. Each window shall have a minimum length of 3,5 m measured along its sides (Figure 1 of diagram 2). 
Netting 
The meshes in the windows shall have a minimum size of 105 mm. They shall be square meshes, i.e. all four sides of the window netting will be cut by all bars (Figure 2 of diagram 2). The netting shall be mounted such that the bars run parallel and perpendicular to the length of the codend (Figure 2). The window width shall be eight open square meshes. The length shall be between 57 and 62 square meshes (Figure 2 of diagram 2). 
Location 
The codend shall be divided into upper and lower panels by selvedges running down the port and starboard sides (Figure 1 of diagram 2). The two windows shall be located in the lower panel, immediately adjacent to and below the selvedges (Figure 1 of diagram 2). The windows shall terminate a minimum of 2 m and a maximum of 2,5 m from the codline. 
The forward end of the window shall be joined to eight meshes' width of the normal codend netting (Figure 3 of diagram 2). One side shall join to the selvedge or be joined immediately adjacent to the selvedge and the other side shall be joined to the normal codend lower panel netting following a straight line of meshes all knots cut. 
Mesh size in the whole codend 
All parts of the codend shall conform to a minimum mesh size of 105 mm.
