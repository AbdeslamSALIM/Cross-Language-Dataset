Council Decision 
of 29 May 2000 
concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis 
(2000/365/EC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to Article 4 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, (hereinafter referred to as %quot%the Schengen Protocol%quot%), 
Having regard to the request by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by its letters to the President of the Council of 20 May 1999, 9 July 1999 and 6 October 1999, to participate in certain provisions of the Schengen acquis, as specified in the said letters, 
Having regard to the Opinion of 20 July 1999 of the Commission of the European Communities on the request, 
Whereas the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has a special position in respect of matters covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, as recognised in the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland and in the Protocol on the application of certain aspects of Article 14 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to the United Kingdom and to Ireland, annexed by the Treaty of Amsterdam to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community; 
Whereas the Schengen acquis was conceived and functions as a coherent ensemble which has to be fully accepted and applied by all States supporting the principle of the abolition of checks on persons at their common borders; 
Whereas the Schengen Protocol provides for the possibility of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to participate in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, because of the said special position of the United Kingdom; 
Whereas the United Kingdom will assume the obligations of a Member State arising from the Articles of the 1990 Schengen Convention listed in this Decision; 
Whereas having regard to the aforementioned special position of the United Kingdom, neither the United Kingdom nor the territories referred to in Article 5 participate by virtue of this Decision in the frontiers provisions of the 1990 Schengen Convention; 
Whereas taking account of the serious matters addressed by Articles 26 and 27 of the 1990 Schengen Convention, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar will apply these articles; 
Whereas the United Kingdom has requested to participate in the ensemble of the provisions of the Schengen acquis concerning the establishment and operation of the Schengen Information System (hereinafter referred to as the %quot%SIS %quot%), except in respect of the provisions concerning the alerts referred to in Article 96 of the Schengen Convention of 1990 and the other provisions which relate to those alerts; 
Whereas it is the view of the Council that any partial participation by the United Kingdom in the Schengen acquis must respect the coherence of the subject areas which constitute the ensemble of this acquis; 
Whereas the Council thus recognises the right of the United Kingdom to make, in accordance with Article 4 of the Schengen Protocol, a request for partial participation, noting at the same time that it is necessary to consider the impact of such participation of the United Kingdom in the provisions concerning the establishment and operation of the SIS on the interpretation of the other relevant provisions of the Schengen acquis and on its financial implications; 
Whereas the Mixed Committee, established pursuant to Article 3 of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application, and development of the Schengen acquis(1), has been informed about the preparation of this Decision in accordance with Article 5 of that Agreement,
