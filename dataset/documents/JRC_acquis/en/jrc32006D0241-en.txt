(notified under document number C(2006) 888) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/241/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [1], and in particular Article 22 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 97/517/EC of 1 August 1997 concerning certain protective measures with regard to certain products of animal origin, excluding fishery products, originating in Madagascar [2] has been substantially amended [3]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified. 
(2) Community inspections in Madagascar have shown that there are serious deficiencies with regard to infrastructure and hygiene in meat establishments and that there are not enough guarantees of the efficiency of the controls carried out by the competent authorities. Animal health management in Madagascar shows severe deficiencies and non-application of Community rules. There is a potential risk for public health with regard to the production and processing of animal products, excluding fishery products, in this country. 
(3) Imports of products of animal origin, excluding fishery products, from Madagascar should not be allowed until it can be guaranteed that no more risk exists. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Decision are in conformity with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
This Decision shall apply to products of animal origin, excluding fishery products, originating in Madagascar.
