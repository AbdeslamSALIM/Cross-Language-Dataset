Whereas, as a consequence of the embargo against Libya, the economic operators in the Community and third countries are exposed to the risk of claims by Libya; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council has adopted Resolution 883 (1993) of 11 November 1993 which, in its paragraph 8, deals with claims by Libya in relation to contracts and transactions the performance of which was affected by measures imposed by the Security Council pursuant to Resolution 883 (1993) and related resolutions;

Whereas the Community has agreed that Libya must comply in full with the provisions of paragraph 8 of United Nations Security Council Resolution 883 (1993) and considers that, in deciding whether to reduce or lift measures taken against Libya, particular account must be taken of any failure by Libya to comply with paragraph 8 of Resolution 883 (1993),
