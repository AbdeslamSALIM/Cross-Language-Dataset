COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1946/93 of 30 June 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 establishing a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Court of Auditors (3), 
Whereas the Treaty of 22 July 1975, amending certain financial provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities and of the Treaty establishing a single Council and a single Commission of the European Communities, modified the procedure for giving a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities; whereas therefore it is appropriate to update the procedure for giving a discharge to the Management Board of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, set up by Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 (4) by reference to the procedure so modified, as set out in Article 206b of the EEC Treaty; 
Whereas the Treaty of 22 July 1975 substituted the Court of Auditors for the Audit Board in all the texts referring to the Audit Board; 
Whereas the Acts of Accession of Greece, Spain and Portugal changed the composition of the Management Board; 
Whereas it is desirable to provide for the transmission of the annual general report on the Centre to all interested Community bodies; 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 should therefore be amended; 
Whereas the EEC Treaty does not provide powers of action other than those contained in Article 235 for the adoption of this Regulation,
