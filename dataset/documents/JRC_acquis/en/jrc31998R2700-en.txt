Turnover comprises the totals invoiced by the observation unit during the reference period, and this corresponds to market sales of goods or services supplied to third parties. 
Turnover includes all duties and taxes on the goods or services invoiced by the unit with the exception of the VAT invoiced by the unit vis-Ã -vis its customer and other similar deductible taxes directly linked to turnover. 
It also includes all other charges (transport, packaging, etc.) passed on to the customer, even if these charges are listed separately in the invoice. Reduction in prices, rebates and discounts as well as the value of returned packing must be deducted. 
Income classified as other operating income, financial income and extraordinary income in company accounts is excluded from turnover. Operating subsidies received from public authorities or the institutions of the European Union are also excluded. 
For NACE Rev. 1 classes 66.01 and 66.03, the corresponding title of this characteristic is 'Gross premiums written`. 
Note: indirect taxes can be separated into three groups. 
(i) The first comprises VAT and other deductible taxes directly linked to turnover which are excluded from turnover. These taxes are collected in stages by the enterprise and fully borne by the final purchaser. 
(ii) The second group concerns all other taxes and duties linked to products which are either (1) linked to turnover and not deductible or (2) taxes on products not linked to turnover. Included here are taxes and duties on imports and taxes on the production, export, sale, transfer, leasing or delivery of goods and services or as a result of their use for own consumption or own capital formation.

Definition 
The production value measures the amount actually produced by the unit, based on sales, including changes in stocks and the resale of goods and services. 
The production value is defined as turnover, plus or minus the changes in stocks of finished products, work in progress and goods and services purchased for resale, minus the purchases of goods and services for resale, plus capitalised production, plus other operating income (excluding subsidies). Income and expenditure classified as financial or extraordinary in company accounts is excluded from production value. Included in purchases of goods and services for resale are the purchases of services purchased in order to be rendered to third parties in the same condition. 
Specific calculation methods are needed for NACE Rev. 1 classes 66.01 and 66.03 
Note: capitalised production includes the own-account production of all goods that are retained by their producers as investment. The latter includes the production of fixed tangible assets (buildings etc.) as well as intangible assets (development of software etc.). Capitalised production is unsold production and is valued at production cost. Note that these capital goods are also to be included in investment. 
Note: other operating income is a company accounting heading. The contents of this heading may vary between sectors and over time and as such cannot be defined precisely for statistical purposes. 
Link to company accounts 
The components of production value are included in the following accounting headings: 
- net turnover, 
- part of other operating income - excluding subsidies, 
- Variation in stocks of finished goods and work in progress, part of raw materials and consumables relating to purchases and change in stocks of goods for resale, 
- work performed by the undertaking for its own purposes and capitalised. 
Link to other variables 
Production value is based on: 
Turnover (12 11 0), 
+/- Change in stocks of finished products and work in progress manufactured by the unit (13 21 3), 
+/- Change in stocks of goods and services purchased for resale in the same condition as received (13 21 1), 
- Purchases of goods and services purchased for resale in the same condition as received (13 12 0), 
+ Capitalised production, 
+ Other operating income (excluding subsidies). 
- Production value is used in the calculation of value-added at factor cost (12 15 0) and other aggregates and balances.

Definition 
Corresponds to the return on the activity of purchase and resale without further processing. It is calculated from turnover, purchases and changes in stocks of goods and services purchased for resale in the same condition as received. 
Included in turnover, purchases and changes in stocks of goods and services for resale are the sales, purchases and changes in stocks of services purchased in order to be rendered to third parties in the same condition. 
Also called gross trading margin. 
Link to company accounts 
These figures may not be isolated in company accounts. They are part of net turnover and raw materials and consumables.

Definition 
Value-added at basic prices is calculated from the production value plus subsidies on products less the purchases of goods and services (other than those purchased for resale in the same condition) plus or minus the change in stocks of raw materials and consumables less other taxes on products which are linked to turnover but not deductible. It represents the value added by the various factor inputs in the operating activities of the unit concerned. 
Income and expenditure classified as financial or extraordinary in company accounts is excluded from valued-added. 
Value-added at basic prices is calculated 'gross` because value adjustments (such as depreciation) are not subtracted. 
Note: operating subsidies can be separated into two groups. 
(i) Subsidies on products are subsidies payable per unit of a good or service. The subsidy may be a specific amount of money per unit of a good or service or it may be calculated ad valorem as a specified percentage of the price per unit. A subsidy on a product usually becomes payable when the good or service is produced, sold or imported, but it may also be payable in other circumstances such as when a good is transferred, leased, delivered or used for own consumption or own capital formation. 
(ii) Subsidies linked to production are subsidies received by a unit which are not linked to the quantity or the value of goods produced or sold. Notably these subsidies include subsidies on the payroll and workforce, subsidies for environmental protection and grants for interest relief. 
Investment subsidies are excluded. Specific calculation methods are needed for NACE Rev. 1 classes 66.01 and 66.03 
Note: indirect taxes can be separated into three groups. 
(i) The first comprises VAT and other deductible taxes directly linked to turnover which are excluded from turnover. These taxes are collected in stages by the enterprise and fully borne by the final purchaser. 
(ii) The second group concerns all other taxes and duties linked to products which are either (1) linked to turnover and not deductible or (2) taxes on products not linked to turnover. Included here are taxes and duties on imports and taxes on the production, export, sale, transfer, leasing or delivery of goods and services or as a result of their use for own consumption or own capital formation. 
(iii) The third group concerns taxes and duties linked to production. These are compulsory, unrequited payments, in cash or in kind which are levied by general government, or by the institutions of the European Union, in respect of the production and importation of goods and services, the employment of labour, the ownership or use of land, buildings or other assets used in production irrespective of the quantity or the value of goods and services produced or sold. 
Link to company accounts 
Value-added at basic prices can be calculated from the following accounting headings:

Value-added at factor cost is the gross income from operating activities after adjusting for operating subsidies and indirect taxes. 
It can be calculated from turnover, plus capitalised production, plus other operating income, plus or minus the changes in stocks, minus the purchases of goods and services, minus other taxes on products which are linked to turnover but not deductible, minus the duties and taxes linked to production. Alternatively it can be calculated from gross operating surplus by adding personnel costs.

Definition 
Gross operating surplus is the surplus generated by operating activities after the labour factor input has been recompensed. It can be calculated from the value-added at factor cost less the personnel costs. It is the balance available to the unit which allows it to recompense the providers of own funds and debt, to pay taxes and eventually to finance all or a part of its investment. 
Income and expenditure classified as financial or extraordinary in company accounts is excluded from gross operating surplus.

Definition 
Purchases of goods and services include the value of all goods and services purchased during the accounting period for resale or consumption in the production process, excluding capital goods the consumption of which is registered as consumption of fixed capital. The goods and services concerned may be either resold with or without further transformation, completely used up in the production process or, finally, be stocked. 
Included in these purchases are the materials that enter directly into the goods produced (raw materials, intermediary products, components), plus non-capitalised small tools and equipment. Also included are the value of ancillary materials (lubricants, water, packaging, maintenance and repair materials, office materials) as well as energy products. Included in this variable are the purchases of materials made for the production of capital goods by the unit. 
Services paid for during the reference period are also included regardless of whether they are industrial or non-industrial. In this figure are payments for all work carried out by third parties on behalf of the unit including current repairs and maintenance, installation work and technical studies. Amounts paid for the installation of capital goods and the value of capitalised goods are excluded. 
Also included are payments made for non-industrial services such as legal and accountancy fees, patents and licence fees (where they are not capitalised), insurance premiums, costs of meetings of shareholders and governing bodies, contributions to business and professional associations, postal, telephone, electronic communication, telegraph and fax charges, transport services for goods and personnel, advertising costs, commissions (where they are not included in wages and salaries), rents, bank charges (excluding interest payments) and all other business services provided by third parties. Included are services which are transformed and capitalised by the unit as capitalised production. 
Expenditure classified as financial expenditure or extraordinary expenditure in company accounts is excluded from the total purchases of goods and services. 
Purchases of goods and services are valued at the purchase price excluding deductible VAT and other deductible taxes linked directly to turnover. 
All other taxes and duties on the products are therefore not deducted from the valuation of the purchases of goods and services. The treatment of taxes on production is not relevant in the valuation of these purchases. 
Specific calculation methods are needed for NACE Rev.1 classes 66.01 and 66.03 
Link to company accounts

Definition 
Purchases for resale are purchases of goods for resale to third parties without further processing. It also includes purchases of services by 'invoicing` service companies, i.e. those whose turnover is composed not only of agency fees charged on a service transaction (as in the case of estate agents) but also the actual amount involved in the service transaction, e.g. transport purchases by travel agents. The value of goods and services which are sold to third parties on a commission basis are excluded since these goods are neither bought nor sold by the agent receiving the commission. 
When services for resale are referred to here, the services concerned are the output from service activities, rights to use predetermined services, or physical supports for services. Purchases of goods and services purchased for resale in the same condition as received are valued at the purchase price excluding deductible VAT and other deductible taxes linked directly to turnover. All other taxes and duties on the products are therefore not deducted from the valuation of the purchases of goods and services. 
The treatment of taxes on production is not relevant in the valuation of these purchases.

Change in stocks (positive or negative) is the difference between the value of the stocks at the end and the beginning of the reference period. Change in stocks may be measured by the value of entries into stocks less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in stocks. Stocks are recorded at purchaser's prices exclusive of VAT if they are purchased from another unit, otherwise at production cost. 
Among stocks (and the change in stocks), the following breakdown can be made: 
- stocks of finished goods, 
- stocks of work in progress, 
- stocks of goods and services purchased for resale in the same condition as received, 
- stocks of raw materials and consumables. 
Included are the stocks of finished products or in the course of production, which have been produced by the unit and which have not yet been sold.

The payments for long-term rental include all charges relative to the renting of tangible goods for a period greater than one year. 
Operational leases are those leases which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incident to legal ownership to the lessee. Under an operational lease, the lessee acquires the right to use a durable good for a certain period of time, which may be long or short and not necessarily settled in advance. When the leasing period expires, the lessor expects to receive his good back in more or less the same condition as when he hired it out, apart from normal wear and tear. Thus the leasing period does not cover all, or a predominant part of, the good's economic lifetime. Payments for the operational leasing of goods relate to the cost of using the tangible goods made available to the unit through these contracts.

Investment during the reference period in all tangible goods. Included are new and existing tangible capital goods, whether bought from third parties or produced for own use (i.e. capitalised production of tangible capital goods), having a useful life of more than one year including non-produced tangible goods such as land. The threshold for the useful life of a good that can be capitalised may be increased according to company accounting practices where these practices require, a greater expected useful life than the one-year threshold indicated above. 
All investments are valued prior to (i.e. gross of) value adjustments, and before the deduction of income from disposals. Purchased goods are valued at purchase price, i.e. transport and installation charges, fees, taxes and other costs of ownership transfer are included. Own produced tangible goods are valued at production cost. Goods acquired through restructuring (such as mergers, take-overs, break-ups, split-off) are excluded. Purchases of small tools which are not capitalised are included under current expenditure. 
Also included are all additions, alterations, improvements and renovations which prolong the service life or increase the productive capacity of capital goods. 
Current maintenance costs are excluded as is the value and current expenditure on capital goods used under rental and lease contracts. Investment in intangible and financial assets are excluded. 
Concerning the recording of investments where the invoicing, delivery, payment and first use of the good may take place in different reference periods, the following method is proposed as an objective: 
Investments are recorded when the ownership is transferred to the unit that intends to use them. Capitalised production is recorded when produced. Concerning the recording of investments made in identifiable stages, each part-investment should be recorded in the reference period in which they are made. 
In practice this may not be possible and company accounting conventions may mean that the following approximations to this method need to be used: 
(i) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are delivered, 
(ii) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they enter into the production process, 
(iii) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are invoiced, 
(iv) investments are recorded in the reference period in which they are paid for.

Under a financial lease the lessee acquires the right to use a durable good in exchange for rental payments over a predetermined and protracted term. If all risks and rewards of ownership are de facto though not de jure, transferred from lessor to lessee, the lease is a financial one. In financial leasing, the leasing period covers all, or most of, the economic lifetime of the durable good. At the end of the leasing period the lessee often has the option to buy the good at a nominal price. The lessor's role is purely financial. 
The value to be recorded corresponds to the market value of the good if it had been purchased. This value is in principle known in the contract or can be estimated by summing-up the part of the instalments that cover the capital reimbursement. The part of instalments corresponding to the interest payments are to be excluded. 
This value should be recorded at the time when the good is delivered to the lessee. 
Annual payments for assets used under financial leasing should be excluded. The value of goods used under leases other than financial ones should also be excluded.

Note: The value of tangible goods acquired through financial leasing is not referred to in the fourth Directive. However, some national accounting standards do permit these goods to be capitalised in the balance sheet.

The number of persons employed is defined as the total number of persons who work in the observation unit (inclusive of working proprietors, partners working regularly in the unit and unpaid family workers), as well as persons who work outside the unit who belong to it and are paid by it (e.g. sales representatives, delivery personnel, repair and maintenance teams). It includes persons absent for a short period (e.g. sick leave, paid leave or special leave), and also those on strike, but not those absent for an indefinite period. It also includes part-time workers who are regarded as such under the laws of the country concerned and who are on the payroll, as well as seasonal workers, apprentices and home workers on the payroll. 
The number of persons employed excludes manpower supplied to the unit by other enterprises, persons carrying out repair and maintenance work in the enquiry unit on behalf of other enterprises, as well as those on compulsory military service. 
Unpaid family workers refer to persons who live with the proprietor of the unit and work regularly for the unit, but do not have a contract of service and do not receive a fixed sum for the work they perform. This is limited to those persons who are not included on the payroll of another unit as their principal occupation. 
Note: In order to check the comparability of data, it is necessary to indicate whether voluntary workers have been included under this heading or not.

%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Definition 
The number of employees is defined as those persons who work for an employer and who have a contract of employment and receive compensation in the form of wages, salaries, fees, gratuities, piecework pay or remuneration in kind. 
The relationship of employer to employee exists when there is an agreement, which may be formal or informal, between an enterprise and a person, normally entered into voluntarily by both parties, whereby the person works for the enterprise in return for remuneration in cash or in kind. 
A worker is considered to be a wage or salary earner of a particular unit if he or she receives a wage or salary from the unit regardless of where the work is done (in or outside the production unit). A worker from a temporary employment agency is considered to be an employee of the temporary employment agency and not of the unit (customer) in which they work. 
In particular the following are considered as employees: 
- paid working proprietors, 
- students who have a formal commitment whereby they contribute to the unit's process of production in return for remuneration and/or education services, 
- employees engaged under a contract specifically designed to encourage the recruitment of unemployed persons, 
- homeworkers if there is an explicit agreement that the homeworker is remunerated on the basis of the work done and they are included on the payroll. 
The number of employees includes part-time workers, seasonal workers, persons on strike or on short-term leave, but excludes those persons on long-term leave. 
The number of employees does not include voluntary workers. 
The number of employees is calculated in the same manner as the number of persons employed, namely as the number of jobs and is measured as an annual average.

This is a division of the number of employees calculated by reference to the number of hours worked per week for which they are paid; this number of hours is considered in relation to the length of what is considered to be a full-time working week in the Member State or the sector of the unit or the unit itself. 
Part-time workers are persons whose usual hours of work are less than the normal working hours. This definition encompasses all forms of part-time work (half-day work, work for one, two or three days a week, etc.). This number may be established at the national, regional, industrial or unit level. 
The number of employees may be broken down according to the weekly number of hours which they work. This number of hours is considered in relation to the length of what is regarded as a standard full-time working week in the Member State, region, industry or unit. 
It should be noted that whereas the 'full-time employee` category is relatively homogeneous, the same cannot be said of the 'part-time employee` category since this can cover anything between 20 % or even less and 80 % or more of the normal working hours of the employing unit. 
It is impossible to establish an exact distinction between part-time and full-time work due to variation in working practices between Member States and industries. 
Part-time employees (duration of work less than the norm) and intermittent/seasonal employees (who may work full time but for a fixed short period, e.g. temporary workers, film crew, etc.) should not be confused.

Actions and activities which have a favourable impact on the environment but which do not come under environmental protection are excluded. Hence, excluded from this field are activities which, while beneficial to the environment, primarily satisfy technical needs or the internal requirements for health and safety of the enterprise. This restriction applies in most cases to recycling activities classified under NACE 37.00 (recycling).

Research and experimental development comprise creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications. 
Intra-mural expenditures are all expenditures for R %amp% D (Research %amp% Development) performed within the unit, regardless of the source of funds. 
R %amp% D must be distinguished from expenditures for a wide range of related activities. The following are therefore excluded from R %amp% D expenditure: 
- expenditures on education and training, 
- expenditures on other scientific and technological activities (e.g. information services, testing and standardisation, feasibility studies, etc.), 
- expenditures on other industrial activities (e.g. industrial innovations n.e.s.), 
- expenditures on purely financing activities (other administration and other indirect supporting activities are included). 
Intra-mural expenditures are valued at production cost and include all operating costs including the labour cost and capital expenditure. 
Link to company accounts 
Research and development expenditure may, depending upon national laws, be recorded in one of three places, movements in intangible assets, movements in tangible assets or operating expenditure. 
If under national law it may be partly or completely capitalised the expenditure is included in the movement of the intangible assets included in company accounts under fixed assets - intangible assets - costs of research and development. 
If under national law it is only partially capitalised or not capitalised at all, the current expenditure is part of Raw materials and consumables, other external charges, staff costs and other operating charges and the capital expenditure is included in the movement of the tangible assets included in company accounts under Fixed assets - tangible assets.

Payments to subcontractors are payments made by the unit to third parties in return for industrial goods and services supplied as part of a subcontracting relationship defined as follows: 
Two enterprises are linked by a subcontracting relationship whenever conditions A and B are met together: 
A. the customer enterprise, also said main-contractor, participates in the conception of the product providing, even partially, technical specifications to the supplier enterprise, also said subcontractor, and/or provides it with the materials to be processed; 
B. the customer enterprise sells the subcontracted product, either as such or as part of a more complex product, and takes on the after-sales liability for the product.
