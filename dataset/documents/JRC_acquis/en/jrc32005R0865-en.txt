(2) In order to facilitate national administrations and those charged with implementing the school milk scheme to process the aid payments, a transitional provision in the case of a change in the rate was introduced at the end of the school year 2003/2004 in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2707/2000 [2]. 
(3) Member States where the school year 2004/2005 ends after 30 June will still find difficulties in processing the aid payments because of the change in the aid rate. It is appropriate to extend the same provision to the school year 2004/2005. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 2707/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
