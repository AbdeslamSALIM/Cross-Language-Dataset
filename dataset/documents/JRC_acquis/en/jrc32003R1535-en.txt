Commission Regulation (EC) No 1535/2003 
of 29 August 2003 
laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the aid scheme for products processed from fruit and vegetables 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 453/2002(2), and in particular Article 1(3), Article 3(2), Article 6, Article 6b(3), Article 6c(7), Article 25, Article 26 and Article 27(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 introduces aid to producer organisations delivering tomatoes, peaches and pears for the production of the products listed in Annex I to that Regulation and aid for the production of prunes and figs. These products must be obtained from fruit and vegetables harvested in the Community. 
(2) To simplify and clarify the system, some of the rules of application of the aid scheme should be amended in the light of experience gained. For the sake of clarity, Commission Regulation (EC) No 449/2001 of 2 March 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the aid scheme for products processed from fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1426/2002(4), should be repealed and replaced. 
(3) To ensure that the scheme is applied uniformly, the products listed in Article 6a(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 and in Annex I thereto, the marketing years applicable to those products and the delivery periods for the raw materials should be defined. 
(4) Fruit in sugar syrup is produced in the European Union with a total sugar content of less than 14Â° Brix. The proportion of sugar in products eligible for aid should be reduced. The definition used should be based on the Codex Alimentarius Committee definition. 
(5) The scheme must be able to operate with a sufficient number of producer organisations and, for the sake of consistency and by analogy with Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 of 28 October 1996 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1933/2001(6), the term %quot%producer groups provisionally authorised%quot% referred to in the first subparagraphs of Article 3(1) and Article 6a(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 must include producer groups which have been granted preliminary recognition under Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(7), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 47/2003(8). 
(6) The production aid scheme is based on contracts between producer organisations recognised or granted preliminary recognition under Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and processors. Producers and producer organisations may also act as processors in certain circumstances. The types of contracts and the particulars to be included therein should be specified for the purposes of applying the aid scheme. 
(7) In order to improve the way the scheme operates, the competent authorities should be aware of all producer organisations marketing the production of their members, of members of other producer organisations and of individual producers wishing to qualify under the aid scheme. The competent authorities should also be aware of the processors signing contracts with such producer organisations, and such processors should send the authorities the information necessary to ensure that the scheme operates correctly. Processors of tomatoes, peaches and pears must be approved before they may conclude contracts. 
(8) Contracts must be concluded by a given date in the case of tomatoes, peaches and pears and before the beginning of each marketing year in the case of the other products. To ensure that the scheme is as effective as possible, the parties to such contracts should nevertheless be authorised to increase the quantities originally stipulated therein up to a given limit by means of amendments to the contracts. 
(9) The number of aid applications to be submitted by producer organisations and processors must be determined taking account of the processing process. Applications for aid must include all the information needed for checking eligibility. To compensate for the obligations imposed on producer organisations, provision should be made for the aid to be paid in advance, on condition that a security is lodged to ensure reimbursement if the requirements for receiving the advance payment are not complied with. 
(10) In order to ensure that the aid scheme is properly applied, producer organisations and processors must forward the necessary information and keep up-to-date suitable documentation and should, in particular, specify the areas under tomatoes, peaches and pears, on the basis of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(9), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 495/2001(10), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2419/2001 of 11 December 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92(11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2550/2001(12), for the purposes of all inspections and controls deemed necessary. 
(11) To meet the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 and for market reasons, processors should be allowed greater flexibility in the manufacture of mixtures of fruits and sauces made from raw materials for which aid is granted. 
(12) For the purposes of administering the aid scheme, procedures must be laid down for physical and documentary checks on delivery and processing operations, checks must cover a sufficiently representative number of aid applications and certain penalties must be laid down for producer organisations and processors who breach the rules, in particular by making false declarations or failing to process products delivered. 
(13) To ensure the quality and reliability of the checks made, the burden of compulsory checks on stocks should be reduced. Nevertheless, in the case of newly approved processing undertakings, there should be two checks in the first marketing year in which they participate in the scheme. 
(14) To ensure proper application of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96, the data used for calculating any overrun of the Community threshold for peaches, pears and tomatoes should be clearly defined. 
(15) To ensure that the system for calculating any overrun of the Community threshold meets the requirements, provision should be made for a transitional period based on the data on aid applications for the 2003/2004 marketing year. 
(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,

(a) by the percentage of the discrepancy established, if it is more than 5 % but no more than 20 % of the area determined, 
(b) by 30 % if the discrepancy is more than 20 % of the area determined. 
Where the area declared is less than the area actually determined, and the discrepancy is more than 10 % of the area determined, the aid payable to the producer organisation shall be reduced by half the percentage of the discrepancy established. 
2. The reductions provided for in paragraph 1 shall not apply where the producer organisation has submitted factually correct information or can show otherwise that it is not at fault. 
The reductions provided for in paragraph 1 shall not apply to data which the producer organisation or its members inform the competent authority in writing are incorrect or have become incorrect since the information referred to in Article 12(1) was sent, provided that the producer organisation or its members were not informed of the competent authority's intention to carry out an on-the-spot check and that it was not informed by the competent authority of any irregularity found. 
3. Where a producer organisation commits a repeated infringement, the Member State shall withdraw that organisation's recognition, or preliminary recognition in the case of a producer group granted preliminary recognition.

Except in cases of force majeure, where it is found that the full quantity of tomatoes, peaches or pears accepted for processing under contract has not been processed into one of the products listed in Article 6a(1) of and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2201/96, the processor shall pay the competent authorities an amount equal to twice the unit amount of the aid multiplied by the quantity of the raw material concerned which has not been processed, plus interest calculated in accordance with Article 33(1). 
In addition, except in cases duly justified to the satisfaction of the Member State, the processor's approval as provided for in Article 5 shall be suspended: 
(a) for the marketing year following the finding, if the difference found between the quantity accepted for processing and the quantity actually processed is more than 10 % but no more than 20 % of the quantity accepted for processing; 
(b) for two marketing years following the finding, if the difference is more than 20 %. 
For the purposes of applying the first and second subparagraphs, any quantities of raw materials used in the manufacture of finished products not complying with the minimum quality requirements, in excess of an 8 % tolerance, shall be treated as quantities not processed. 
2. Where the conditions for applying paragraph 1 are met, Member States shall provide that approval as referred to in Article 5 is to be withdrawn from processors in the following cases: 
(a) where the producer organisation makes false declarations with the collaboration of the processor, 
(b) where the processor fails to pay the price referred to in Article 7(1)(e), 
(c) where the processor fails to pay the penalties provided for in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1. 
The Member State shall decide on the length of time for which the processor may not submit a new application for approval having regard to the seriousness of the case.

Article 36 
Examination of compliance with processing thresholds 
In the case of tomatoes, peaches and pears, compliance with the Community and national processing thresholds as referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 shall be established in all Member States concerned on the basis of the quantities for which aid is granted during the last three marketing years for which definitive data are available. 
In the case of proven or suspected irregularities and where administrative or criminal enquiries have been launched to establish whether aid applications were justified, the disputed quantities shall not be taken into account for examining compliance with the thresholds. 
Article 37 
National penalties 
Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that both prices and aid are paid in accordance with Articles 22 and 27 respectively. They shall provide in particular for penalties to be imposed on the officers of the producer organisation commensurate with the seriousness of any irregularity.
