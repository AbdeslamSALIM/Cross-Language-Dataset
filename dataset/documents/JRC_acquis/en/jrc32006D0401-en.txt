CERTIFICATION 
I, … (state name in capitals, title and department), have examined the final statement of expenditure for the European Refugee Fund in … (indicate period covered) and the application to the Commission for payment of the balance. 
SCOPE OF THE EXAMINATION 
The certification aimed to provide assurance that: 
(a) the statement of expenditure is accurate and results from reliable accounting systems and is based on verifiable supporting documents; 
(b) the expenditure declared complies with applicable Community and national rules and has been incurred in respect of projects selected for funding in accordance with the criteria applicable to the annual programme and complying with the applicable Community and national rules; 
(c) for the purposes of certification, the Certifying Authority has received adequate information from the Responsible Authority on the management procedures operated, the projects co-financed by the fund and the controls carried out in relation to expenditure included in statements of expenditure; 
(d) the results of all audits carried out by the Control Authority have been duly taken into account; 
(e) the recovery of any amounts of Community funds found to have been unduly paid as a result of irregularities detected, together with interest where appropriate has been duly deducted from the declaration of expenditure. 
OBSERVATIONS 
1. The scope of the examination has been limited by the following: 
(a) … 
(b) … 
(c) etc 
(Indicate any obstacles encountered in the examination, for example systemic problems, management weaknesses, lack of audit trail, lack of supporting documentation, cases under legal proceedings, etc; estimate the amounts of expenditure affected by these obstacles and the corresponding Community co-financing) 
2. The examination, together with the conclusions of other national or Community controls to which I have had access, reveal a low/high (indicate as appropriate; if high please explain) frequency of errors/irregularities. The errors/irregularities reported have been satisfactorily dealt with by the responsible authorities and they do not appear to affect the amount of Community co-financing payable, with the following exceptions: 
(a) … 
(b) … 
(c) etc 
(Indicate the errors/irregularities which have not been satisfactorily dealt with, and for each case, the possible systemic character and extent of the problem and the amounts of Community co-financing which appear to be affected) 
CONCLUSION 
Either: 
If no obstacles were encountered in the examination, the frequency of errors found is low and all problems have been satisfactorily dealt with: 
(a) In the light of the examination and the conclusion of other national or community checks to which I have access, it is my opinion that the final statement of expenditure presents fairly, in all material aspects, the expenditure incurred in accordance with Decision 2004/904/EC, and the request to the Commission for payment of the balance of the Community co-financing appears to be valid. 
Or: 
If certain obstacles were encountered in the examination, but the frequency of errors is not high, or if some problems have not been satisfactorily dealt with: 
(b) Except for the matters referred to at point 3 and/or the errors/irregularities referred to at point 4 which do not appear to have been satisfactorily dealt with, it is my opinion, based on the examination and the conclusions of other national or Community checks to which I have had access, that the final statement presents fairly, in all material respects the expenditure incurred in accordance with Decision 2004/904/EC and its implementing rules, and that the application to the Commission for payment of the balance of the Community co-financing appears to be valid. 
Or: 
If major obstacles were encountered in the examination or the frequency of errors found is high even if the reported errors/irregularities have been satisfactorily dealt with: 
(c) in view of the matters referred to at point 3 and/or given the high frequency of errors reported at point 4, I am not in a position to express an opinion on the final statement of expenditure and the application to the Commission for payment of the balance of the Community co-financing.
