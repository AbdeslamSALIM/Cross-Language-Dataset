COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
of 17 September 1990 
amending Directive 87/404/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to simple pressure vessels 
(90/488/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Directive 87/404/EEC (4) provides for the complete harmonization of the standards for simple pressure vessels manufactured in series; 
Whereas in the absence of harmonized standards Directive 87/404/EEC requires EC-type examination of the vessels in question; whereas those standards will not be available by the date of application of the Directive; 
Whereas Directive 87/404/EEC has not provided for a transitional period during which it would be permitted to market stocks of vessels manufactured in accordance with national rules still applicable before that Directive takes effect; 
Whereas manufacturers must have the time needed to apply the EC-type examination procedure and it is necessary to set a transitional period to allow vessels in stock to be marketed, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
