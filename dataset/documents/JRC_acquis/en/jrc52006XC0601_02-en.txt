4. Specification 
(summary of requirements under Article 4(2)) 
Name : Exairetiko partheno elaiolado %quot%Troizinia%quot% 
Description - Colour: yellow to yellowish green, depending on the degree of ripeness of the fruit when harvested. 
- flavour: has a pleasant taste with a sweet or bitter basis (over several months the bitterness steadily abates), and 
- aroma: newly picked fruit predominates. 
Geographical area (a) Methana (also including the administrative districts of Kounopitsa, Kipseli and Megalokhorio) 
(b) Poros, and 
(c) Trizinia (Galatas and the administrative districts of Ano Fanario, Driopi, Karatzas, Taktikoupoli and Trizinia). 
Proof of origin : Production, processing, packing and bottling are all carried out in the defined area. The growers register their olive groves in a register which is kept up to date. Processing and bottling facilities are also recorded in special registers. These registers are kept and updated by the Rural Development Directorate and the quantity of olives processed and the amount of olive oil produced are announced each year. In this way, all the stakeholders involved are recorded in the special registers and closely supervised to ensure that they fulfil their obligations, thereby ensuring the traceability of the product. 
Method of production (a) Cultivation techniques 
The soil is worked mechanically but no herbicide is used. 
25 % of the trees are watered using a hose or a trickle or sprinkler system. 
Suitable pruning, water and fertilizer application leads to roughly the same yield from each tree every year. 
Fertiliser provision and plant protection are carried out using mild methods compatible with the environment (organic fertilizers, suspended olive fly traps, bait spraying, etc.). 
(b) Harvesting 
Almost all the fruit is harvested when its colour changes from green to dark violet. Harvesting extends from November (fruits slightly unripe) to February with the bulk in December and January. The fruit is not left to over-ripen on the tree, which would result in a loss in its weight and bulk, a poorer aroma and higher acidity of the oil. 
Harvesting is traditionally carried out using rakes alone or by hand, which is beneficial for the quality of the product and good for the health of the olive trees. 
(c) Collection/storage 
The picked fruit is immediately %quot%bagged%quot% in sacks made of plant fibres (jute), which facilitates aeration, and taken to the mill on the same day. On the rare occasions when it has to be stored for 24 hours the sacks are placed on pallets in roofed areas where they are well ventilated but protected from sun and rain. 
(d) Extraction 
The procedure followed is: reception, feeding, deleafing, watering, breaking, grinding, kneading, reception of oil from paste, final separation. 
All the appropriate rules are complied with on cleanliness, kneading speed (17–19 rev/min), kneading time (20-30 min.) and above all temperature, which must in no case exceed 28–29 °C. 
(e) Packaging 
Before being sent to the market and the final consumer, the oil is stored in stainless tanks and then packaged in 5 litre tins and dark-coloured bottles of 0,1 to 1 litre. 
Packaging of the end product takes place only in the geographical area, to protect quality, ensure that the end product can be inspected, of course after taking account of the economic parameters and benefits of having the final packaging done in the region. 
Lastly, it is considered both necessary and right that all activity take place within the geographical area, to ensure protection of the name and guarantee the quality and authenticity of the product. 
Link : 
The exceptional quality of the area's oil is due largely to its particular soil and weather conditions, the cultivation techniques used, method and time of cropping, and processing and packaging using traditional or modern methods that are technically and scientifically sound. 
Its mountain and hill terrain, (favouring unusually intense illumination and ventilation of the trees, well known determinants for outstanding quality), moderate rainfall (about 550 mm), mild spring, relatively dry and warm summer (during which however a beneficial 15 % of total annual rainfall occurs), high level of sunshine and moderately strong north winds, conduce to production of an oil that is of a rich colour and pleasing delicate flavour. A slightly chalky soil of neutral or slightly alkaline pH and generally high concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, boron etc. are very important for production of an oil that is naturally translucent and rich in aromatic substances.
