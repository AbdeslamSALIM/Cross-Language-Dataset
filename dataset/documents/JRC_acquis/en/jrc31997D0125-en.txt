COMMISSION DECISION of 24 January 1997 authorizing the indelible printing of prescribed information on packages of seed of oil and fibre plants and amending Decision 87/309/EEC authorizing the indelible printing of prescribed information on packages of certain fodder plant species (97/125/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed (1), as last amended by Directive 46/72/EC (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) (a) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 69/208/EEC of 30 June 1969 on the marketing of seed of oil and fibre plants (3), as last amended by Directive 96/72/EC, and in particular Article 10 (1) (a) thereof, 
Whereas fodder plant seed and seed of oil and fibre plants may not normally be placed on the market unless the packages are labelled with an official label in accordance with the provisions laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC and in Directive 69/208/EEC respectively; 
Whereas, however, the indelible printing of the required information on the package itself, on the basis of the model laid down for the label, may be authorized; 
Whereas the Commission has already granted such an authorization by Decision 80/755/EEC (4), as amended by Decision 81/109/EEC (5), in the case of cereal seed and Decision 87/309/EEC (6), as amended by Decision 88/493/EEC (7), in the case of seed of certain fodder plant species; 
Whereas under those Decisions the authorizations were granted, under certain conditions which ensure that responsibility remained with the certification authority; 
Whereas that system has proved to be useful; 
Whereas it is now desirable to grant a similar authorization in respect of seed of oil and fibre plants; 
Whereas it is also desirable in the case of fodder plant species to extend the authorization to all species covered by Directive 66/401/EEC; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
