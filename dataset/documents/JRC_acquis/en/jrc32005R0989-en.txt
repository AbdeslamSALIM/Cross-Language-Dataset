Council Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;989/2005 of 27 June 2005 amending Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;1255/96 temporarily suspending the autonomous common customs tariff duties on certain industrial, agricultural and fishery products 
Council Regulation (EC) No 989/2005 
of 27 June 2005 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 temporarily suspending the autonomous common customs tariff duties on certain industrial, agricultural and fishery products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) It is in the interest of the Community to suspend partially or totally the autonomous common customs tariff duties for a number of new products not listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 [1]. 
(2) A number of products which are referred to in the said Regulation should be withdrawn from the list in the Annex because it is no longer in the Community’s interest to maintain suspension of autonomous common customs tariff duties or because the description needs to be altered in order to take account of technical product developments and economic trends on the market. 
(3) Accordingly, products whose description needs to be altered should be regarded as new products. 
(4) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 accordingly. 
(5) In view of the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely upon the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. 
(6) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 July 2005, it should enter into force immediately, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1255/96 is hereby amended as follows: 
1. The products set out in Annex I to this Regulation shall be inserted. 
2. The products for which the codes are set out in Annex II to this Regulation shall be deleted. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
It shall apply with effect from 1 July 2005. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Luxembourg, 27 June 2005. 
For the Council 
The President
