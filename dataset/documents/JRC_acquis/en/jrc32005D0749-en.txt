2005/749/EC: Commission Decision of 24 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Croatia (notified under document number C(2005) 4229) (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Decision 
of 24 October 2005 
concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Croatia 
(notified under document number C(2005) 4229) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/749/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products. 
(2) Croatia has notified to the Commission the isolation of an H5 avian influenza virus collected from a clinical case in a wild species. The clinical picture allows the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza pending the determination of the neuraminidase (N) type and of the pathogenicity index. 
(3) In view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, it is therefore appropriate as an immediate measure to suspend imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game birds, live birds other than poultry and hatching eggs of these species from Croatia. 
(4) As Croatia is authorised for imports of game trophies, eggs for human consumption and untreated feathers, imports into the Community of these products should be suspended as well because of the animal health risk involved. 
(5) Furthermore the importation into the Community from Croatia should be suspended for fresh meat of wild feathered game and importation of meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat of those species. 
(6) Certain products derived from poultry slaughtered before 1 August 2005 should also continue to be authorised, taking into account the incubation period of the disease. 
(7) Commission Decision 2005/432/EC of 3 June 2005 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of meat products for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decisions 97/41/EC, 97/221/EC and 97/222/EC [3] lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products and establishes treatment regimes considered effective in inactivating the respective pathogens. In order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products, appropiate treatment must be applied depending on the health status of the country of origin and the species the product is obtained from. It appears therefore appropriate, that imports of wild feathered game meat products originating in Croatia and treated to a temperature of at least 70 ì§¸C throughout the product should continue to be authorised. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision shall be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

4.
