of 28 May 2003 
setting for the marketing year 2003/04 the aid for peaches and pears for processing under Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 453/2002(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 449/2001 of 2 March 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the aid scheme for products processed from fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1426/2002(4), requires the Commission to publish the aid rates to be applied for peaches and pears after checking compliance with the thresholds set in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2201/96. 
(2) The average quantity of peaches processed under the aid scheme over the past three marketing years is below the Community threshold. The aid rate to be applied for 2003/04 in each Member State must therefore be that set in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96. 
(3) The average quantity of pears processed under the aid scheme over the last three marketing years is above the Community threshold. The aid rate to be applied for 2003/04 in Member States that have not overrun their national threshold must therefore be that given in Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96. In each of the other Member States that rate must be reduced according to the individual threshold overrun as adjusted by allocation of the unprocessed quantities as specified in the third subparagraph of Article 5(2) of that Regulation. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Processed Fruit and Vegetables,
