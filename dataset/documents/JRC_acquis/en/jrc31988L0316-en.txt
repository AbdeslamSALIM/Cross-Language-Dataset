COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
of 7 June 1988 
amending Directive 75/106/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making-up by volume of certain prepackaged liquids 
(88/316/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 A thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
In cooperation with the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Whereas, since the adoption of Directive 75/106/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 85/10/EEC (4), total harmonization of the ranges of nominal quantities for certain liquids referred to in that Directive has appeared necessary; 
Whereas Directive 75/106/EEC contains no provision on containers or their use; whereas matters concerning the recycling of containers for liquids for human consumption are governed by Directive 85/339/EEC (5); whereas it is therefore necessary to repeal Article 5 (4) of Directive 75/106/EEC; 
Whereas it is advisable, whenever possible, to ensure total harmonization of ranges of prepackaged products in order to establish a transparent market for them, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
