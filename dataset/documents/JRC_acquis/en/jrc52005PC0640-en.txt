Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1) CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL 
- Grounds for and objectives of the proposal 
The aim of this draft Council Regulation is to suspend customs duty autonomously for an indefinite period, on certain goods contained in Chapter 27 (petroleum waste oils), and hence amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff. 
- General context 
Chapter 27 of the Combined Nomenclature covers various items, including a number of mineral fuels and mineral oils. 
Heading 2710 relates more specifically to petroleum oils (light oils, oils other than light oils and waste oils). 
Petroleum oils and other products listed in Chapter 27, when they are processed in manner described in the Chapter's additional notes, are autonomously exempted from customs duty, provided the processing has taken place. 
This condition is checked in application of the provisions laid down in the Customs Code and its implementing measure (Articles 291 to 300 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (OJ L 253 of 11.10.1993, p. 1) and subsequent amendments). 
At present, however, waste oils (code 2710 99 00) do not enjoy duty exemption, even when they are intended for those specific processes. 
It is in the interest of the Community to apply the same tariff treatment to both the waste oils and the oils themselves. It is therefore proposed that customs duties on waste oils be treated using the specific processes described in additional note 4 be autonomously suspended, subject to the checks laid down in the Customs Code and its implementing provisions.

Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) In the Combined Nomenclature in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87[1], customs duty is suspended, autonomously and for an indefinite period, on certain goods in Chapter 27 when they are intended for specific processes, provided that certain conditions laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Customs Code[2] are met. 
(2) Certain waste oils intended for recycling, classed under heading NC 2710 99 00, do not currently enjoy this exemption. 
(3) For environmental reasons connected to the recycling of waste oils, the same tariff treatment should be applied to waste oils and oils from the same group, provided that the legal and technical conditions are met. It is therefore in the interest of the Community to suspend, autonomously and for an indefinite period, customs duty on such products. 
(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) Since the amendment introduced by this Regulation is to be applied from the same date as the Combined Nomenclature for 2006, laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1719/2005, this Regulation should enter into force immediately and apply from 1 January 2006,

Nevertheless, on the basis of the imports realized in 2004, the maximum loss of revenue has been estimated to EURO 744 000 (before deduction of the 25 %), which would be the loss for 2004 if the whole heading would have been duty free.
