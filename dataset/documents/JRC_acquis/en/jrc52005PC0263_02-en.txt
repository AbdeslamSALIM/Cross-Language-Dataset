EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. INTRODUCTION 
In September 2003 the Commission published a Communication[1], with an accompanying Impact Assessment on the Sugar Sector[2], on the options for reform of the EU sugar regime, which were followed in July 2004 by a Communication outlining the Commission’s proposal for the future of the EU sugar regime[3]. 
From the resulting debate, the Commission has sought to take into account the views expressed by the Council, the European Parliament[4], the European Economic and Social Committee[5] and other Consultative Committees, as well as civil society, and to incorporate new elements into the present legislative proposal. 
Furthermore, the recent findings of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) panel challenging the EU sugar export regime, as upheld by the WTO Appellate Body[6], make necessary a number of changes to the EU sugar export regime, in order to comply with the EU’s international commitments. 
Towards a sustainable long-term policy perspective for the EU sugar sector 
There is a clear political consensus that the EU sugar sector must: 
- move away from the attrition scenario under the current regime, which would drastically curtail sugar production under quota in both the EU’s most and least competitive sugar producing regions; 
- be brought in line with the CAP reform process, in particular the new orientation given with the introduction of decoupling, the single payment scheme and the application of cross-compliance rules; 
- develop, without delaying the necessary economic adjustments, within a sustainable market environment, based upon improved competitiveness and greater market orientation; 
- attain a sustainable market balance, in relation to domestic production levels and international commitments; 
- be provided with a long-term policy framework, not requiring any review in 2008. 
In this context, the Commission proposes that: 
- the EU institutional price, net of the restructuring amount, will be cut by 39%, over two years, to ensure a sustainable EU market balance, consistent with the EU’s international commitments; 
- the national envelopes for the farmer direct payments in each Member State will grant 60% of the estimated revenue loss from this 39% institutional price cut; 
- the sugar quota regime will be extended until the end of the 2014/15 marketing year. 
Environmentally and socially acceptable competitiveness for the EU sugar sector 
With regard to the necessary economic adjustments in the sector, there has been widespread reticence over the idea of transferability of quotas between Member States. Such a position makes compulsory quota cuts, to maintain internal market balance as from 2006/07, an unviable proposition, in particular in the light of the outcome of the WTO sugar panel. 
The question of the necessary tools for the restructuring of the sector has therefore been reframed. The Commission is now proposing an ambitious, voluntary and temporary restructuring scheme for the EU sugar sector, to be implemented over a four-year period. The scheme will provide: 
- a high, degressive per-tonne restructuring aid, available to EU sugar factories, isoglucose and inulin syrup producers, which will be granted for factory closure and renunciation of the quota; 
- a top-up payment, to ensure sugar beet growers the possibility of receiving the full, final direct payment, as from the first marketing year, in the event that they abandon production, owing to the fact that the factory, with which they have sugar beet delivery rights, has closed under the restructuring scheme. 
Financing for the restructuring scheme will come from a specific amount, charged on all sweetener quota. Full-time sugar refiners and sugar undertakings in outermost regions will not be part of the scheme. 
The Commission also considers that developments taking place in the framework of the Biofuels Policy represent an interesting opportunity for the sugar sector. To encourage these developments, before the end of 2006, the Commission will amend the relevant regulations to allow sugar beet to qualify for set-aside payments, when cultivated as a non-food crop, and also be made eligible for the energy crop aid of € 45/ha provided under the 2003 CAP reform. 
Keeping the EU sugar regime in line with international commitments 
Without prejudice to the EU’s stated intention to phase-out agricultural export subsidies in the framework of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), the report of the WTO requires certain changes in order to ensure that EC export subsidy commitments are respected. 
In order to maintain a certain production level in current “C” sugar producing Member States, the Commission proposes that: 
- an additional amount of 1 million tonnes of quota shall be made available to those Member States; 
- at the time of allocation of that quota to sugar producers, a one-off, per-tonne amount will be charged, equal to the level of the year 1 restructuring aid. 
The Commission considers that the duty-free imports, foreseen for Least Developed Countries (LDC) under the “Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative as from 2009/10, should be maintained and that EBA countries should also be provided with a stable, long-term perspective for the development of their economy. These countries should benefit from the same guaranteed prices as those provided in the ACP sugar protocol. 
Moreover it has to be made sure that EBA imports are not misused by shipping to the EU sugar of non-LDC origin. The best way to achieve this is to negotiate at international level a specific safeguard clause. 
However, with the non-participation of EU sugar refiners in the restructuring scheme, the minimum guaranteed import price for ACP Protocol sugar will move in line with the EU institutional price and preferential sugar suppliers will therefore benefit from a delay in the cut of their preferential raw sugar price compared to EU producer prices. 
A dialogue is currently taking place with ACP countries, regarding the Commission’s Working Paper[7] for an “Action Plan on accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime.” These measures aim to help Sugar Protocol countries to adjust to the changing market conditions by enhancing competitiveness of their sugar sectors, by diversifying into other economic activities or by addressing broader social, economic and/or environmental impacts of these changes. 
In addition to the ongoing dialogue with Croatia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) for Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Serbia-Montenegro has been introduced[8], as from 1 July 2005. 
The consequences of the Accession of Bulgaria and Romania have also been taken into account in the proposed changes to the EU sugar regime. 
These three key elements of the EU sugar regime will be addressed through three legal instruments: proposed measures for the reform of the sugar common market organisation (CMO), measures for the restructuring of the EU sugar sector and measures for direct income support for sugar beet producers. 
2. PROPOSED MEASURES FOR REFORM OF THE SUGAR CMO 
2.1. Duration of the sugar regime 
The EU sugar regime will be prolonged until the end of the 2014/15 marketing year and there will be no review in 2008. 
2.2. Prices 
Intervention and start date of the sugar campaign 
In order to further the move away from public intervention mechanism for EU market sectors, it is proposed to abolish the intervention mechanism and intervention price for sugar. 
In order to ease the implementation of the price cuts, it is proposed to change the start date of the sugar campaign from 1 July to 1 October, starting in the 2007/08 campaign. 
Reference Price 
The intervention price will be replaced by a reference price for sugar. To boost EU competitiveness and lessen the gap with the prevailing world sugar price, the reference price will be set at a level 39% lower than the current intervention price. The price decrease will be achieved within two years, beginning in the 2006/07 campaign. 
The reference price will serve in the establishment of the trigger level for private storage. 
Minimum Sugar Beet Price 
The minimum price for sugar beet has been calculated, in line with the proposed reference price cuts, net of the restructuring amount. However, in order to take account of the move away from a rigid price support system, through the abolition of the intervention mechanism, a flexibility clause has been introduced, which would grant sugar beet growers the possibility to negotiate the sugar beet price down to 10% below that guaranteed minimum price. The schedule for the price reductions is given in Annex. 
Price Reporting 
A price reporting mechanism for sugar shall be put in place in time for operational use, as from the 2006/07 campaign. 
2.3. Quotas 
Setting up a Single EU Quota 
The current quota arrangements proposal will be simplified, by merging the “A” and “B” quotas into one single quota. An additional amount of 1 million tonnes of quota shall be made available to current “C” sugar producing Member States. At the time of allocation of that quota to sugar producers, a one-off, per-tonne amount will be charged, equal to the level of the year 1 restructuring aid. 
A surplus amount mechanism will be established, to bring an overall consistency to the single quota system, distinguishing clearly the different sources of sugar and ensuring the legal security of the system. 
Quota Reductions 
There will be no compulsory quota reductions during the restructuring period. Market balance will be ensured by the amounts of sugar quota entering the restructuring scheme and the market balance tools proposed below. At the end of the restructuring period, quota cuts will be applied, if needed, on the basis of a flat-rate, percentage cut in the total quota of each Member State. 
Isoglucose 
Owing to the relationship between the isoglucose and sugar markets, the proposed price reductions will also impact on the EU isoglucose sector revenue. Therefore, the isoglucose sector will need to be in a position to profit from economies of scale, in order to have a long-term prospect of economic viability. Under these circumstances, a progressive and proportional increase of isoglucose quotas, of 100 000 t/year for three years beginning in 2006/07, is proposed. 
2.4. Market Balance Tools 
Carry forward mechanism 
As in the current regime, sugar factories will be allowed to carry forward any overshoot of quota in a given marketing year to the quota of the following marketing year. 
Withdrawal Mechanism 
Moreover, the Commission will retain the possibility of dealing with market imbalance, in a given marketing year, by withdrawing a percentage of quota sugar from the market until the beginning of the following marketing year. However, when setting the quota for that following marketing year, the Commission will take into account not only the quantities withdrawn but also the quantities renounced through the restructuring scheme. 
Private Storage 
A private storage scheme is proposed, in order to open the possibility of temporarily withdrawing sugar from the market. It will be implemented, as appropriate, by the Commission, should the market price fall below the reference price. Quantities withdrawn will not be eligible for private storage support. 
2.5. Specific measures for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
It is proposed that the current arrangements for excluding the sugar used for alcohol, including rum, bio-ethanol and yeast production from the production quotas will continue and will be extended to those quantities of sugar used by chemical and pharmaceutical industries, for end products with a high utilisation of sugar. 
In view of the possibility that the chemical and pharmaceutical industries may fail to obtain, during an extended period, supplies of sugar at a price in line with world market prices, it is proposed that the production refund mechanism will be retained, in order to ensure adequate sugar supplies to these industries. However, if further difficulties make it necessary, the possibility of opening of a specific TRQ for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries will be envisaged. 
2.6. International Commitments 
Under the Traditional Supply Need mechanism, import certificates for preferential sugar for refining will be reserved for full-time refiners. A complementary import TRQ would be opened, if necessary, to ensure the supply of these refiners. From 2009/10, once the EBA initiative is fully implemented, the management of preferential imports will be partially opened to other operators, including non full-time refiners. 
The Commission will continue to have the possibility to ensure, if needed, that Sugar Protocol commitments on quantities to be imported at the minimum guaranteed import price up to 2007, or new ones deriving from future Economic Partnership Agreements (EPA), are fulfilled. 
3. PROPOSED MEASURES FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE EU SUGAR SECTOR 
3.1. Restructuring Scheme 
The Commission proposes a new, voluntary and temporary restructuring scheme for the EU sugar sector, which will operate for four years (2006/07 to 2009/10). 
The restructuring fund has three main objectives: firstly to provide incentives to encourage less competitive producers to leave the industry, secondly to provide money to cope with the social and environmental impacts of factory closure (financing of social plans or redeployment programs and reconversion measures to bring the site into good environmental condition) and thirdly to provide funds for the most affected regions. The conditions for having access to the restructuring fund are to be fixed on Community level in accordance with the economic, social and environmental objectives of the fund. The fulfilment of these conditions has to be controlled by the Member States; restructuring aid can only be granted once the closing factory is clearly committed to the respect of these conditions. 
Financing for the restructuring scheme will come from a specific, per-tonne amount, charged over three years on all sweetener quota. The restructuring amount will be set at € 126.40/t in 2006/07, € 91.00/t in 2007/08 and € 64.50/t in 2008/09. 
The scheme will provide a high, degressive per-tonne aid, available only to EU sugar factories, isoglucose and inulin syrup producers, wishing to cease production. In year 1, the aid will be set at € 730/t of quota, falling gradually to € 420/t of quota in year 4. In order to encourage an early uptake of the scheme, sugar factories closing as from 1 July 2005 will be eligible for the restructuring aid. 
Furthermore, as from 2008/09, a part of the restructuring aid may be earmarked for diversification measures in regions most affected by the sugar reform. Note should also be taken of the additional possibilities provided for by the instruments of European Cohesion policy, to assist the economic restructuring and the retraining of workers in zones that are particularly hard hit by the consequences of the reform. 
3.2. Top-up Payment for Sugar Beet Growers 
Through the restructuring scheme budget, sugar beet growers will receive a top-up payment, to ensure the possibility of receiving the full, final direct payment to those growers, who have to abandon production owing to the closure of the factory with which they have sugar beet delivery rights, from year 1 of the price cuts. 
4. PROPOSED MEASURES FOR DIRECT INCOME SUPPORT FOR SUGAR BEET PRODUCERS 
The Commission proposes to grant direct payments to farmers on the global base of those who produced sugar beet under quota in the historical reference period, 2000–2002. However, Member States may, for reasons of fairness, exercise flexibility in calculating the direct payment of individual farmers over a different period. 
The national envelopes for each Member States for the direct payments will represent 60% of the estimated revenue loss from the two-step, 39% institutional price cuts. The revenue loss was estimated taking into account the change in the weighted minimum sugar beet price in each Member State, multiplied by the quota level (see Annex 2). Member States will also receive an additional envelope destined to compensate growers in their territory supplying chicory for the production of inulin syrup. 
The direct payment for Outermost Regions will be brought into the single framework for the POSEI, currently under discussion, and will thus be excluded from the single payment scheme. Moreover, the French outermost regions that were the only ones to benefit from disposal aid will receive an additional amount corresponding to current disposal measures under the reference period. 
5. BUDGETARY IMPACT OF THE PROPOSALS FOR THE SUGAR REFORM 
For the period, the cost of the proposed reform respects the status quo expenditure, as proposed at the time of the CAP Reform proposals of January 2003. The costs of the new measures proposed for this sector, for which the direct decoupled payment to producers represents the major element, will be mainly offset by the savings resulting from a substantial reduction in export refund expenditure and abolition of the refining aid. 
When the proposed measures for the sector have been fully implemented, the envelopes for direct income support will involve an annual cost of EUR 1 542 million. Any costs in respect of the private storage scheme should be limited and only arise if market prices risk falling significantly below the reference price. 
With regard to the restructuring scheme, an ad hoc restructuring amount will be charged to finance it and will be assigned to a restructuring fund. The amount of EUR 4 225 million will be charged over three marketing years (2006/07 up to 2008/09) and the restructuring aid will be available for four marketing years (2006/07 to 2009/10).

In the marketing year 2006/2007 an isoglucose quota of 100 000 tonnes is added to the total of the isoglucose quota fixed in Annex III. In each of the marketing years 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 a further isoglucose quota of 100 000 tonnes is added to the quota of the preceding marketing year. 
Member States shall allocate the additional quotas to undertakings, proportionately to the isoglucose quota that have been allocated in accordance with Article 7(2). 
Article 10 Quota management 
1. In accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), the quotas set out in Annex III shall be adjusted by 30 September 2006 at the latest for the marketing year 2006/2007 and by the end of February at the latest of the previous marketing year for each of the marketing years 2007/2008, 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011. The adjustments shall include the results from the application of Article 8, of paragraph 2 of this Article, of Article 14 and Article 19 of this Regulation and of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No …./2005 (restructuring Regulation). 
2. Taking into account the results of the restructuring scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No …./2005 (restructuring scheme), the Commission shall decide by the end of February 2010 at the latest, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), the common percentage needed to reduce the existing quotas for sugar, isoglucose and inuline syrup per Member State or region with a view to avoid market imbalances in the marketing years as from 2010/2011. 
3. The Member States shall adjust the quota of each undertaking accordingly. 
Article 11 National quota reallocation 
1. Member States may transfer quotas between undertakings in accordance with the rules laid down in Annex V and taking into consideration the interests of each of the parties concerned, particularly sugar beet and cane growers. 
However, a Member State shall not reduce the quota of an undertaking producing sugar or isoglucose-, established in its territory, by more than 10% of the quota as allocated. 
2. The quantities withdrawn pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be allocated by the Member State in question to one or more undertakings in its territory, whether or not holding a quota. 
CHAPTER 3 OUT-OF-QUOTA PRODUCTION 
Article 12 Scope 
The sugar, isoglucose or inuline syrup produced during a marketing year in excess of the quota referred to in Article 7 shall be: 
(a) used for the processing of certain products as referred to in Article 13;

Article 19 Withdrawal of sugar 
1. In order to preserve the structural balance of the market at a price level which is close to the reference price, taking into account the obligations of the Community resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, a percentage, common to all Member States, of quota sugar, quota isoglucose and quota inuline syrup may be withdrawn from the market until the beginning of the following marketing year. 
In that case, the traditional supply need for refining imported raw sugar referred to in Article 29(1) of this Regulation shall be reduced by the same percentage for the marketing year concerned. 
2. The withdrawal percentage referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined by 31 October of the marketing year concerned at the latest on the basis of expected market trends during that marketing year. 
3. Each undertaking provided with a quota shall store at its own expense during the period of withdrawal the quantities of sugar corresponding to the application of the percentage referred to in paragraph 1 to its production under quota for the marketing year concerned. 
The sugar quantities withdrawn during a marketing year shall be treated as the first quantities produced under quota for the following marketing year. However, taking into account the expected sugar market trends, it may be decided, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), to consider, for the current and/or the following marketing year, all or part of the withdrawn sugar, isoglucose or inuline syrup as: 
- surplus sugar, surplus isoglucose or surplus inuline syrup available to become industrial sugar, industrial isoglucose or industrial inuline syrup, or 
- supplementary quota production; 
4. If sugar supply on the Community is inadequate, it may be decided, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 39(2), that a certain quantity of withdrawn sugar, isoglucose and inuline syrup may be sold on the Community market before the end of the period of withdrawal.

ANNEX V DETAILED RULES ON TRANSFERS OF SUGAR OR ISOGLUCOSE QUOTAS 
Point I 
For the purposes of this Annex: 
(a) ‘merger of undertakings’ means the consolidation of two or more undertakings into a single undertaking; 
(b) ‘transfer of an undertaking’ means the transfer or absorption of the assets of an undertaking having quota to one or more undertakings; 
(c) ‘transfer of a factory’ means the transfer of ownership of a technical unit, including all the plant required to manufacture the product concerned, to one or more undertakings, resulting in the partial or total absorption of the production of the undertaking making the transfer; 
(d) ‘lease of a factory’ means the leasehold contract of a technical unit including all the plant required for the manufacture of sugar, with a view to its operation, concluded for a period of at least three consecutive marketing years, which the parties agree not to terminate before the end of the third marketing year, with an undertaking which is established in the same Member State, as the factory concerned, if, after the lease takes effect, the undertaking which rents the factory can be considered a solely sugar-producing undertaking for its entire production. 
Point II 
1. Without prejudice to paragraph 2, in the event of the merger or transfer of sugar-producing undertakings or the transfer of sugar factories, the quota shall be adjusted as follows: 
(a) in the event of the merger of sugar-producing undertakings, the Member States shall allocate to the undertaking resulting from the merger a quota equal to the sum of the quotas allocated prior to the merger to the sugar-producing undertakings concerned; 
(b) in the event of the transfer of a sugar-producing undertaking, the Member State shall allocate the quota of the transferred undertaking to the transferee undertaking for the production of sugar or, if there is more than one transferee undertaking, the allocation shall be made in proportion to the sugar production absorbed by each of them; 
(c) in the event of the transfer of a sugar factory, the Member State shall reduce the quota of the undertaking transferring ownership of the factory and shall increase the quota of the sugar-producing undertaking or undertakings purchasing the factory in question by the quantity deducted in proportion to the production absorbed. 
2. Where a number of the sugar-beet or cane growers directly affected by one of the operations referred to in paragraph 1 expressly show their willingness to supply their beet or cane to a sugar-producing undertaking which is not party to those operations, the Member State may make the allocation on the basis of the production absorbed by the undertaking to which they intend to supply their beet or cane. 
3. In the event of closure, in circumstances other than those referred to in paragraph 1, of: 
(a) a sugar-producing undertaking, 
(b) one or more factories of a sugar-producing undertaking, 
the Member State may allocate the part of the quotas involved in such closure to one or more sugar-producing undertakings. 
Also in the case referred to in point (b) of the preceding subparagraph, where some of the producers concerned expressly show their willingness to supply their beet or cane to a given sugar-producing undertaking, the Member State may allocate the proportion of the quotas corresponding to the beet or cane concerned to the undertaking which they intend to supply with those products 
4. Where the derogation referred to in Article 6(6) is invoked, the Member State concerned may require the beet growers and the sugar undertakings concerned by that derogation to include in their agreements within the trade special clauses enabling the Member State to apply paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Point. 
5. In the event of the lease of a factory belonging to a sugar-producing undertaking, the Member State may reduce the quota of the undertaking offering the factory for rent and allocate the portion by which the quota was reduced to the undertaking which rents the factory in order to produce sugar in it. 
If the lease is terminated during the period of three marketing years referred to in Point I (d) the adjustment of quota under the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be cancelled retroactively by the Member State as at the date on which the lease took effect. However, if the lease is terminated by reason of force majeure , the Member State shall not be bound to cancel the adjustment.

7. Where a Member State grants a sugar producing undertaking price and outlet guarantees for processing sugar beet into ethyl alcohol, the Member State may, in agreement with that undertaking and the beet growers concerned, allocate all or part of the sugar production quotas to one or more undertakings for one or more marketing years. 
Point III 
In the event of the merger or transfer of isoglucose-producing undertakings or the transfer of an isoglucose-producing factory, the Member State may allocate the quotas involved for the production of isoglucose to one or more other undertakings, whether or not they have a production quota. 
Point IV 
The measures taken pursuant to Points II and III may take effect only if the following conditions are met: 
(a) the interests of each of the parties concerned are taken into consideration; 
(b) the Member State concerned considers that they are likely to improve the structure of the beet, cane and sugar-manufacturing sectors; 
(c) they concern undertakings established in the same territory for which the quota is set in Annex III.

Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 37(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee, 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No ……/2005 (sugar reform) on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector[15] provides for an important reform of the sugar common market organisation. The measures introduced by that Regulation include a significant reduction in the institutional support price for Community sugar in two steps. 
(2) As a consequence of reduced market support in the sugar sector, income support measures for sugar beet growers should be introduced. That measure should take the form of a payment to sugar beet and chicory growers the overall level of which should develop in parallel with the gradual reduction of market supports. 
(3) The de-coupling of direct producer support and the introduction of the single payment scheme are essential elements in the process of reforming the common agricultural policy aimed at moving away from a policy of price and production support to a policy of farmer income support. Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003[16] introduced those elements for a variety of agricultural products. 
(4) In order to meet the objectives underlying the reform of the common agricultural policy, the support for sugar beet should be de-coupled and integrated into the single payment scheme. 
(5) Consequently, the rules on direct support schemes laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be adapted. 
(6) Sugar beet and chicory growers in the new Member States have benefited since accession from price support in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector[17]. Therefore, the sugar payment and the sugar and chicory components in the single payment scheme should not be subject to the application of the schedule of increments provided for in Article 143a. 
(7) The level of individual income support should be calculated on the basis of the average number of hectares under sugar beet or chicory used for the production of A and B sugar or inuline syrup covered by a delivery contract concluded, in accordance with Article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, with a sugar or inuline syrup undertaking for one or more marketing years to be determined by Member States. 
(8) To ensure the proper application of the support scheme and for reasons of budget control, provision should be made for keeping the overall income support within the limit of national envelopes calculated on the basis of a historical reference year. 
(9) Member States that have opted or will opt for applying the single payment scheme only as from 1 January 2007 should be enabled to grant income support to growers of sugar beet and chicory used for the production of inuline syrup in 2006 in the form of a payment based on the number of hectares of sugar beet or chicory delivered. As for the calculation of the sugar beet and chicory component in the single payment scheme, Member States should have the possibility to determine the marketing years to be taken into account on a representative basis. 
(10) In order to solve, where the case may be, problems arising from the change-over from the current regime to the single payment scheme, it is appropriate to confer the power on the Commission to adopt the relevant transitional rules by way of amendment of the current Article 155 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. 
(11) In order to earmark the sugar payment provided for in Article 110p as direct payments Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be amended accordingly. 
(12) In order to take account of the amount of income support provided for with regard to the sugar payment, the national ceilings provided for in Annexes II, VIII and VIIIa to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should be adapted accordingly. 
(13) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 is amended as follows: 
(1) In Article 37(1) the following subparagraph is added: 
“For sugar beet and chicory used for the production of inuline syrup the reference amount shall be calculated and adjusted in accordance with Annex VII, point K.” 
(2) Point (a) of Article 43(2) is replaced by the following: 
"(a) in case of potato starch, dried fodder, seed, olive groves, tobacco and sugar beet and chicory aids listed in Annex VII, the number of hectares whose production has been granted the aid or, in the case of sugar beet and chicory used for the production of inuline syrup, the amount of support in the reference period as calculated in points B, D, F, H, I and K of Annex VII;"; 
(3) In Section 1 of Chapter 5 of Title III, the following Article is added: 
"Article 63aSugar beet and chicory payments 
In relation to the inclusion of the sugar beet and chicory payments component in the single payment scheme, Members States may decide to apply the derogation provided for in Article 63(3) by 1 March 2006.” 
(4) Article 71c is replaced by the following: 
" Article 71cCeiling 
The national ceilings of the new Member States shall be those listed in Annex VIIIa. Except the sugar and chicory component thereof, the ceilings are calculated taking account of the schedule of increments provided for in Article 143a, and therefore do not need to be reduced.” 
(5) In Title IV, the following Chapter is inserted: 
« CHAPTER 10eSUGAR PAYMENT 
Article 110pSugar payment 
1. In case of application of Article 71, for 2006, growers of sugar beet and chicory used for the production of inuline syrup shall qualify for a sugar payment. It shall be granted for the average number of hectares under sugar beet or chicory used for the production of A and B sugar or inuline syrup covered by the delivery contracts concluded by the grower in accordance with Article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001* for a representative period of one or more marketing years as from the marketing years 2000/2001, to be determined by the Member State concerned in accordance with objective and non-discriminatory criteria. 
2. Without prejudice to Article 71(2), for the purpose of calculating the amount of the sugar payment the average number of hectares under sugar beet or chicory referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall be multiplied by the respective amount per tonne listed for the year 2006 in point K of Annex VII. 
3. Articles 143a and 143c shall not apply to the sugar payment.” 
______________________ 
(*) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1”. 
(6) The following point (d) b is inserted in Article 145: 
"(d) b detailed rules relating to the inclusion of sugar beet and chicory support in the single payment scheme; "
