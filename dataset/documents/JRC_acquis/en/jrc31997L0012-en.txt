Where this derogation is accorded, animal movements to that part of the territory from other regions which are not part of the network system shall be subject to the provisions of this Directive. 
The competent authority shall lay down the obligations and rights incumbent upon the approved veterinarians, the persons responsible for the holdings or their owners and any other participants in the system including the persons responsible for issuing health certificates. 
3. The competent authority shall ensure that the obligations referred to in paragraph 2 at least include the following: 
A. Every owner of or person responsible for a holding must: 
(i) secure, by contract or legal instrument, the services of a veterinarian approved by the competent authority; 
(ii) immediately call in the approved veterinarian for the holding when he suspects the occurrence of an infectious disease or of any notifiable disease; 
(iii) notify the approved veterinarian of all arrivals of animals on his holding;

B. The approved veterinarians as provided for by Article 2 (2) (m) shall be under the control of the competent authority and must comply with the following requirements. 
They must: 
(i) meet the conditions for pursuing the veterinary profession; 
(ii) have no financial interest or family links with the owner of or person responsible for the holding; 
(iii) possess particular knowledge in the field of animal health as it applies to animals of the species concerned. This means that they must: 
- regularly update their knowledge, especially as regards the relevant health regulations, 
- meet the requirements laid down by the competent authority to ensure the proper functioning of the network, 
- provide the owner of or person responsible for the holding with information and assistance in order that all steps are taken to ensure that the holding's status is maintained, particularly on the basis of programmes agreed with the competent authority, 
- ensure compliance with the requirements concerning: 
(i) the identification and health certification of the animals of the herd, the animals introduced and those traded; 
(ii) compulsory reporting of infectious animal diseases and any other risk factor for animal health or welfare, and for human health; 
(iii) establishing as far as possible the cause of death of animals and where they are to be consigned; 
(iv) the hygiene conditions of the herd and of the livestock production units. 
If the proper functioning of the system so requires, each Member State may limit the veterinarians' responsibility to a specific number of holdings or to a specific geographical area. 
The competent authority shall draw up lists of approved veterinarians and of the approved holdings participating in the network. If the competent authority finds that a participant in the network no longer fulfils the conditions set out above, it shall suspend or withdraw approval, without prejudice to any penalties that may be applied. 
C. The computer database must contain at least the following information: 
(1) For each animal: 
- identification code, 
- date of birth, 
- sex, 
- breed or colour of coat, 
- identification code of the mother or, in the case of an animal imported from a third country, the identification number given following inspection under Directive 92/102/EEC and corresponding to the identification number of origin, 
- identification number of the holding where born, 
- identification numbers of all holdings where the animal has been kept and the dates of each change of holding, 
- date of death or slaughter. 
(2) For each holding: 
- an identification number consisting of not more than 12 figures (apart from the country code), 
- name and address of the holder. 
(3) The database must be able to supply the following particulars at any time: 
- the identification number of all animals of the bovine species present on a holding, or in the case of groups of animals of the porcine species, the registration number of the holding of origin or herd of origin and the number of the health certificate where applicable, 
- a list of all changes of holding for each animal of the bovine species starting from the holding of birth, or the holding of importation in the case of animals imported from third countries; and for groups of pigs the registration number of the last holding or last herd and for imported animals from third countries the holding of importation. 
These particulars will be held on the database until three consecutive years have elapsed since the death of the bovine animal or until three consecutive years have elapsed since the record was made in the case of records for pigs. 
However, only paragraphs 2 and 3 shall be applicable to pigs. 
4. All participants in the surveillance network other than those provided for in 3A and B shall be accountable to the competent authority. The competent authority in each Member State shall be responsible for setting up the network and shall carry out regular checks to ensure that it operates properly. 
5. Member States which introduce a system of surveillance networks as outlined in paragraphs 1 to 4, operational for a period of at least 12 months, shall apply to the Commission to have it approved under the procedure provided for in Article 17. 
For this purpose the Commission shall examine documentation submitted by Member States. 
The Commission experts shall validate the systems by means of a system of audits. Where the result of the audit is favourable the Commission shall within 90 days of receipt of the request for approval make a report to the SVC together with appropriate proposals. 
Where repeated offences are noted, the approval of the surveillance network system can be suspended according to the procedure laid down in Article 17, at the request of the Commission or of one or more Member States. 
6. Member States which have implemented in all their territory a recognized surveillance network system as laid down in this Article shall be authorized not to apply the provision referred to in Article 3 (2) (a), second indent to animal movements referred to by this Directive within their own territory. 
7.

ANNEX A 
I. Officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd 
1. A bovine herd is officially tuberculosis free if: 
(a) all the animals are free from clinical signs of tuberculosis; 
(b) all the animals over six weeks old have reacted negatively to at least two official intradermal tuberculin tests carried out in accordance with Annex B, the first six months after the elimination of any infection from the herd and the second six months later or, where the herd has been assembled solely from animals that originate in officially tuberculosis-free herds, the first test shall be carried out at least 60 days after assembly and the second shall not be required; 
(c) following the completion of the first test referred to in (b), no bovine animal over six weeks old has been introduced into the herd unless it has reacted negatively to an intradermal tuberculin test performed and assessed according to Annex B and carried out either in the 30 days prior to, or the 30 days after the date of its introduction into the herd. 
This test shall not be necessary in Member States or regions of a Member State where the percentage of bovine herds infected with tuberculosis is less than 0,2 % or if the animal originates in an officially tuberculosis-free herd. 
2. A bovine herd will retain officially tuberculosis-free status if: 
(a) the conditions detailed in 1 (a) and (c) continue to apply; 
(b) all animals entering the holding come from herds of officially tuberculosis-free status; 
(c) all animals in the holding, with the exception of calves under six weeks old which were born in the holding, are subjected to routine tuberculin testing in accordance with Annex B at yearly intervals. 
However, the Commission, in accordance with the procedure in Article 17, may, for a Member State or part of a Member State where all the bovine herds are subject to official operations to combat tuberculosis, alter the frequency of the routine tests as follows: 
- if the percentage of bovine herds infected with tuberculosis is not more than 1 % on average during the two most recent annual supervisory periods, the interval between routine herd tests may be increased to two years, 
- if the percentage of infected bovine herds is not more than 0,2 % on average during the two most recent biennial supervisory periods, the interval between routine tests may be increased to three years, 
- if the percentage of infected bovine herds is not more than 0,1 % on average during the two most recent triennial supervisory periods, the interval between routine tests may be increased to four years and/or the age at which animals have to undergo these tests may be increased to 24 months. 
The Commission may also, in accordance with Article 17, take a decision increasing the frequency of routine tuberculin testing if the level of disease appears to have increased. 
When a Member State operates a system of identification and registration of bovine animals which provides for identification of herds of origin and transit, if the percentage of infected herds is not greater than 0,1 % on average during the two most recent control periods, it may dispense with the annual tuberculin test of the herds on condition that: 
(1) before the introduction into the herd all the bovine animals are subjected to an intradermal tuberculin test with negative results; 
(2) all bovine animals slaughtered are examined for lesions of tuberculosis and any such lesions are submitted to a bacteriological examination for evidence of tuberculosis bacteria. 
3. The officially tuberculosis-free status of a herd shall be suspended if: 
(a) the conditions detailed in 2 have not been complied with; 
(b) an animal is deemed to have reacted positively to a routine tuberculin test, or a case of tuberculosis has been diagnosed at routine post-mortem examination. 
In these cases, the status shall remain suspended until such time as all the remaining animals over six weeks of age have reacted negatively to at least two official intradermal tuberculin tests in accordance with Annex B, the first one carried out at least two months after elimination of the animal from the holding and the second one at least 42 days after the first. 
However, by way of derogation, if during a routine herd test one or more animals react positively to a tuberculin test, and bovine tuberculosis is not considered to be the cause of this reaction, the suspected case(s) of tuberculosis shall be fully investigated, including in particular the tracing and checking of the herd of residence at the time of the test and of any previous herd considered necessary by the competent authority and all examinations including appropriate post-mortem tests and laboratory examinations. 
While such examinations take place the officially tuberculosis-free status of the herd referred to shall be suspended until investigations and laboratory examinations or tuberculin tests have ruled out the presence of bovine tuberculosis. If the presence of tuberculosis is not confirmed the status of the herd may be restored. 
However, where the routine herd test detailed in 2 (c) has not been performed on time, the status of the herd shall not be suspended provided that the test is carried out not later than 60 days after it was originally due, and provided that subsequent testing takes place according to the original timetable; 
(c) the herd contains animals of unresolved status as described in Annex B, point 32. In this case the status of the herd shall remain suspended until the animals' status has been clarified. 
4. A Member State or part of a Member State may be declared officially tuberculosis free according to the procedure laid down in Article 17 if it meets the following conditions: 
(a) the percentage of infected bovine herds has not been more than 0,01 % for six consecutive years and at least 99,9 % of the herds have been declared officially tuberculosis free for 10 years; 
(b) an identification system making it possible to identify the herds of origin and transit for each bovine animal is in existence; 
(c) all bovine animals slaughtered must be subjected to a post-mortem examination by an official veterinarian; 
(d) all suspected cases of tuberculosis must be fully investigated, including tracing and checking any herds of origin or transit and carrying out all appropriate laboratory examinations. While such examinations take place the officially tuberculosis-free status of the herds of origin or transit shall be suspended until clinical or laboratory examinations or tuberculin tests have ruled out the presence of bovine tuberculosis. 
5. The Member State or part of a Member State will retain officially tuberculosis-free status if: 
(a) the conditions 4 (a) to (d) continue to apply; 
(b) when a case of tuberculosis is confirmed, the officially tuberculosis-free status of the herd of origin and transit is withdrawn; 
(c) the officially tuberculosis-free status of herds where tuberculosis has been confirmed remains withdrawn until: 
- all the animals that have been deemed to be infected have been slaughtered, 
- disinfection of the premises and utensils has taken place, 
- all the remaining bovine animals over six weeks of age have reacted negatively to at least two official intradermal tests in accordance with Annex B, the first at least six months after the removal of the infected animals, the second six months after the first. 
6. If there is evidence of a significant change in the situation as regards tuberculosis in a Member State or part of a Member State which has been recognized as officially tuberculosis free, the Commission may in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 take a decision suspending or revoking the status and requiring routine tuberculin tests to be carried out in accordance with one of the schedules in 2 (c). 
II. Officially brucellosis-free and brucellosis-free bovine herds 
For the purposes of this Section 'bovine animals` means all bovine animals with the exception of males castrated before the age of four months. 
1. A bovine herd is officially brucellosis free if: 
(a) it contains no bovine animals which have been vaccinated against brucellosis, except females which have been vaccinated at least three years previously; 
(b) all the bovine animals have been free from clinical signs of brucellosis for at least six months; 
(c) all the bovine animals over 12 months old have been subjected to one of the following test regimes with negative results in accordance with Annex C: 
(i) two serum agglutination tests at an interval of more than three months and less than 12 months; 
(ii) three ring tests at three-monthly intervals followed at least six weeks later by a serum agglutination test; 
(iii) two buffered brucella antigen tests at an interval of more than three months and less than 12 months; 
(iv) two micro-agglutination tests at an interval of more than three months and less than 12 months. 
2. A bovine herd will retain officially brucellosis-free status if: 
(a) one of the following test regimes is carried out annually with negative result in accordance with Annex C: 
(i) three ring tests carried out at intervals of at least three months; 
(ii) three milk Elisas carried out at intervals of at least three months; 
(iii) two ring tests carried out at an interval of at least three months followed at least six weeks later by a serological test; 
(iv) two milk Elisas carried out at an interval of at least three months followed at least six weeks later by a serological test; 
(v) two serological tests carried out at an interval of at least three months and not more than six months. 
However, the Commission, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17, may, for a Member State or part of a Member State which is not officially brucellosis free but where all the bovine herds are subject to official operations to combat brucellosis, alter the frequency of the routine tests as follows: 
- where not more than 1 % of bovine herds are infected, it may be sufficient to carry out each year two ring tests or two milk Elisas at an interval of at least three months, or one serological test, 
- where at least 99,8 % of bovine herds have been recognized as officially brucellosis free for at least four years, the interval between checks may be extended to two years and the checks must be carried out using one of the serological tests referred to in paragraph 7 (a); 
(b) all bovine animals entering the herd come from herds of officially brucellosis-free status and, in the case of bovine animals over 12 months old, have shown a brucella count of less than 30 IU of agglutination per ml when given a serum agglutination test in accordance with Annex C during the 30 days prior to introduction into the herd. 
However, the serum agglutination test described in point (b) need not be required in Member States, or regions of Member States, where the percentage of bovine herds infected with brucellosis has not exceeded 0,2 % for at least two years and where the animal comes from an official brucellosis-free bovine herd within that Member State or region and has not during transportation come into contact with bovine animals of lesser status; 
(c) notwithstanding point (b), bovine animals from a brucellosis-free bovine herd may be introduced into an officially brucellosis-free herd if they are at least 18 months old and, if vaccinated against brucellosis, the vaccination was carried out more than a year previously. 
Such animals must have shown, in the 30 days prior to introduction, a brucella count lower than 30 IU of agglutination per ml and a negative result when given a complement fixation test, both in accordance with Annex C. 
If, however, a bovine animal from a brucellosis-free herd is introduced into an officially brucellosis-free bovine herd, under these provisions, that herd shall be considered to be brucellosis free for two years from the date on which the animal was introduced. 
3. The officially brucellosis-free status of a herd may be suspended or withdrawn if: 
(a) the conditions detailed in paragraphs 1 and 2 have not been complied with; or 
(b) as a result of laboratory tests or on clinical grounds one or more bovine animals are suspected of having brucellosis. 
If one or more bovine animals in an officially brucellosis-free herd are suspected of having brucellosis, the status of the herd may be suspended, rather than withdrawn, if the animal or animals are immediately destroyed or isolated. 
Where the animal has been destroyed, the suspension may be lifted if two serum agglutination tests, carried out in accordance with Annex C on all bovine animals in the herd over 12 months old, show a count lower than 30 IU of agglutination per ml. The first test shall be carried out at least 30 days after the removal of the animal and the second at least 60 days later. 
Where the animal has been isolated, it may be reintroduced into the herd and the status of the herd may be restored, if it subsequently shows a serum agglutination count lower than 30 IU of agglutination per ml and has given a negative result to a complement fixation test, these tests being carried out in accordance with Annex C. 
Where, as a result of laboratory tests or epidemiological investigations, brucella infection has been confirmed in a herd, the status of that herd shall not be restored until all bovine animals that were pregnant at the time of the outbreak have given negative results to the above tests, the final test having being carried out at least 21 days after calving. 
4. A bovine herd is brucellosis free if it complies with the conditions in 1 (a), (b) and (c), except that: 
(i) female bovine animals may be vaccinated: 
- before the age of six months old with live strain 19 vaccine or other vaccines approved under the procedure laid down in Article 17, or 
- before the age of 15 months old with killed 45/20 adjuvant vaccine which has been officially inspected and recognized; 
(ii) bovine animals under 30 months old which have been vaccinated with live strain 19 vaccine may give a serum agglutination test result greater than 30 IU but less than 80 IU of agglutination per millilitre provided that, on the complement fixation test, they give a result less than 30 EEC units in the case of females vaccinated less than 12 months previously or less than 20 EEC units in all other cases; 
(iii) in addition to those tests listed in 1 (c), the following test regimes will also be approved in order to attain brucellosis-free status; 
(a) two buffered brucella antigen tests carried out at an interval of more than three months and less than 12 months; 
(b) two micro-agglutination tests carried out at an interval of more than three months and less than 12 months in accordance with the provisions of Annex C. 
5. A bovine herd will retain brucellosis-free status if: 
(i) it is subject to one of the testing regimes listed in 2 (a); 
(ii) bovine animals entering the herd comply with the requirements of 2 (b); or 
- come from herds of brucellosis-free status, and in the case of bovine animals over 12 months old, have shown, in the 30 days prior to introduction into the herd, less than 30 IU of agglutination per ml when given a serum agglutination test and a negative complement fixation test in accordance with Annex C, or 
- come from herds of brucellosis-free status, are under 30 months old and have been vaccinated with live strain 19 vaccine may give a serum agglutination test result greater than 30 IU but less than 80 IU of agglutination per millilitre provided that, on the complement fixation test, they give a result less than 30 EEC units in the case of females vaccinated less than 12 months previously or less than 20 EEC units in all other cases. 
6. The brucellosis-free status of a herd shall be suspended or withdrawn if: 
(a) the conditions detailed in paragraphs 4 and 5 have not been complied with; or 
(b) as a result of laboratory tests or on clinical grounds one or more bovine animals over 30 months old are suspected of having brucellosis. 
If one or more bovine animals, over 30 months old, in a brucellosis-free herd are suspected of having brucellosis, the status of the herd may be suspended, rather than withdrawn, if the animal or animals are immediately destroyed or isolated. 
Where the animal has been destroyed, the suspension may be lifted if two serum agglutination tests, carried out in accordance with Annex C on all bovine animals in the holding over 12 months old, show a count lower than 30 IU of agglutination per ml. The first test shall be carried out at least 30 days after the removal of the animal and the second at least 60 days later. 
Where the animal has been isolated, it may be reintroduced into the herd and the status of the herd may be restored, if it subsequently shows a serum agglutination count lower than 30 IU of agglutination per ml and has given a negative result to a complement fixation test, these tests being carried out in accordance with Annex C. 
Where, as a result of laboratory tests or epidemiological investigations, brucella infection has been confirmed in a herd, the status of that herd shall not be restored until all bovine animals that were pregnant at the time of the outbreak have given negative results to the above tests, the final test having being carried out at least 21 days after calving. 
7. A region of a Member State may be declared officially brucellosis free according to the procedure laid down in Article 17 if it meets the following conditions: 
(a) no case of abortion due to brucella infection has been recorded for at least three years and at least 99,8 % of the herd have been declared officially brucellosis free for 10 years; 
(b) an identification system making it possible to identify the herds of origin and transit for each bovine animal is in existence. 
8. Subject to point 9, a region declared officially brucellosis free shall retain this status if all bovine animals over 24 months old are subjected to either two ring tests or one serological test every three years. In the event of a positive result the provisions of point 6 shall apply. 
9. A region declared officially brucellosis free shall report the occurrence of all cases of brucellosis to the Commission. The Commission may according to the procedure laid down in Article 17 propose that the status be suspended or revoked and require that routine brucellosis testing be carried out in accordance with one of the schedules in paragraph 2. 
10. A Member State may be declared officially brucellosis free according to the procedure laid down in Article 17 if it meets the following conditions: 
(a) no case of abortion due to brucella infection has been recorded for at least three years and at least 99,8 % of the holdings have been declared officially brucellosis free for 10 years; 
(b) an identification system making it possible to identify the herds of origin and transit for each bovine animal is in existence. 
11. A Member State declared officially brucellosis free shall retain this status if: 
- every bovine animal suspected of being infected with brucellosis is notified to the competent authority and undergoes official investigation for brucellosis comprising at least two serological blood tests, including the complement fixation test, and a microbiological examination of appropriate samples taken in the case of an abortion, 
- during the period of suspicion, which shall continue until negative results have been obtained from the tests provided for in the first indent, the officially brucellosis-free status of the herd of origin or transit of the suspected bovine shall be suspended, 
- in the event of a positive result, the provisions of point 6 apply. 
12. A Member State declared officially brucellosis free shall report the occurrence of all cases of brucellosis to the Commission. The Commission may, according to the procedure laid down in Article 17, propose that the status be suspended or revoked and require that routine brucellosis testing be carried out in accordance with one of the schedules in paragraph 2. 
13. (a) For the purposes of Section II, a serological test shall mean either a serum agglutination test, buffered brucella antigen test, complement fixation test, plasma agglutination test, plasma ring test, micro-agglutination test or individual blood Elisa, as described in Annex C. 
(b) Where ring tests are carried out on bulk tanks, the number of those tests referred to in this Annex shall be doubled and the intervals between the tests shall be halved.

27. Community laboratories designated in accordance with Article 17 will be made responsible for the additional examination of routine issue field tuberculins used in the Member States to ensure that the potency of each of these tuberculins is adequate in relation to the appropriate Community standard tuberculin. These examinations must be carried out, in tuberculous bovine animals, in suitably sensitized guinea-pigs and by appropriate chemical tests. 
28. The following shall be recognized as official intradermal tuberculin tests: 
(a) the single intradermal test - this test requires a single injection of bovine tuberculin;

(2) Not less than 2 000 IU of avian tuberculin W15; 
The volume of each injection dose shall not exceed 0,2 ml. 
30. Tuberculin tests shall be carried out by injecting tuberculin(s) into the skin of the neck. The injection sites shall be situated at the border of the anterior and middle thirds of the neck. When both avian and bovine tuberculins are injected in the same animal, the site for injection of avian tuberculins shall be about 10 cm from the crest of the neck and the site for the injection of bovine tuberculin about 12,5 cm lower on a line roughly parallel with the line of the shoulder or on different sides of the neck; in young animals in which there is not room to separate the sites sufficiently on one side of the neck, one injection shall be made on each side of the neck at identical sites in the centre of the middle third of the neck. 
31. The technique of tuberculin testing and interpretation of reactions shall be as follows: 
(a) Technique 
Injection sites shall be clipped and cleansed. A fold of skin within each clipped area shall be taken between the forefinger and thumb and measured with callipers and recorded. A short sterile needle, bevel edge outwards, with graduated syringe charged with tuberculin attached shall be inserted obliquely into the deeper layers of the skin. The dose of tuberculin shall then be injected. A correct injection shall be confirmed by palpating a small pea-like swelling at each site of injection. The skin-fold thickness of each injection site shall be remeasured 72 hours after injection and recorded. 
(b) Interpretation of reactions 
The interpretation of reactions shall be based on clinical observations and the recorded increase(s) in skin-fold thickness at the sites of injection 72 hours after injection of tuberculin(s). 
(ba) Negative reaction: if only limited swelling is observed, with an increase of not more than 2 mm in the thickness of the fold of skin without clinical signs such as diffuse or extensive oedema, exudation, necrosis, pain or inflammation of the lymphatic ducts in that region or of the lymph nodes. 
(bb) Inconclusive reaction: if no clinical signs such as mentioned in (ba) are observed and if the increase in skin-fold thickness is more than 2 mm and less than 4 mm. 
(bc) Positive reaction: if clinical signs such as mentioned in (ba) are observed or there is an increase of 4 mm or more in the thickness of the fold of skin at the injection site. 
32. The interpretation of official intradermal tuberculin tests shall be as follows: 
(a) Single intradermal test: 
positive: a positive bovine reaction as defined in paragraph 31 (bc); 
inconclusive: an inconclusive reaction as defined in paragraph 31 (bb); 
negative: a negative bovine reaction as defined in paragraph 31 (ba). 
Animals inconclusive to the single intradermal test shall be subjected to another test after a minimum of 42 days. 
Animals which are not negative to this second test shall be deemed to be positive to the test. 
Animals positive to the single intradermal test may be subjected to an intradermal comparative test. 
(b) Intradermal comparative test for the establishment and maintenance of officially tuberculosis-free herd status: 
positive: a positive bovine reaction which is more than 4 mm greater than the avian reaction, or the presence of clinical signs; 
inconclusive: a positive or inconclusive bovine reaction which is from 1 to 4 mm greater than the avian reaction, and the absence of clinical signs; 
negative: a negative bovine reaction, or a positive or inconclusive bovine reaction but which is equal to or less than a positive or inconclusive avian reaction and the absence of clinical signs in both cases. 
Animals inconclusive to the intradermal comparative test shall be subjected to another test after a minimum of 42 days. Animals which are not negative to this second test shall be deemed to be positive to the test. 
(c) Officially tuberculosis-free herd status may be suspended and animals from the herd shall not be allowed to enter intra-Community trade until such time as the status of the following animals is resolved: 
(1) animals which have been deemed to be inconclusive to the single intradermal tuberculin test; 
(2) animals which have been deemed to be positive to the single intradermal tuberculin test but are awaiting retest with an intradermal comparative test; 
(3) animals which have been deemed to be inconclusive to the intradermal comparative test. 
(d) Where animals are required by Community legislation to be subjected to an intradermal test prior to movement, the test shall be interpreted so that no animal which shows an increase in skin-fold thickness greater than 2 mm or the presence of clinical signs is entered into intra-Community trade.

(b) they should be mixed with an applicator stick, first in a straight line and then in a circle of about 10 to 12 mm diameter; 
(c) the plate should then be rocked back and forth for four minutes (about 30 times per minute); 
(d) readings should be taken in a good light; if there is no evidence of agglutination, the test shall be regarded as negative; any degree of agglutination shall be regarded as positive, unless there has been excessive drying round the edges. 
(b) Automated method 
The automated method must be at least as sensitive and accurate as the manual method. 
E. Plasma ring test 
(a) Extraction of the plasma 
The tube containing blood, coagulation of which has been inhibited by the addition of EDTA, should be centrifuged for three minutes at 3 000 r/min and subsequently kept at 37 Â°C for 12 to 24 hours. 
(b) Evaluation

4. The standard serum must be supplied by the Bundesgesundheitsamt, Berlin. 
5. The micro-agglutination test shall be carried out on plates bearing wells with conical bottoms of a volume of 0,250 ml. The test shall be carried out as follows: 
(a) predilution of the serum: 0,050 ml of each serum to be tested are added to each well containing 0,075 ml of diluent. The mixtures are shaken for 30 seconds; 
(b) gradual serum dilution: prepare at least three dilutions for each serum. To this end from the predilutions (1:2,5) 0,025 ml of each serum is taken and transferred to a well containing 0,025 ml of diluent. In this way the first dilution reaches a strength of 1:5 and the following dilutions are carried out by doubling; 
(c) addition of antigen: 0,025 ml of antigen is added to each well containing the different serum dilutions. After being shaken for 30 seconds the plates are closed with their respective lids and kept at 37 Â°C for 20 to 24 hours in a humidified atmosphere; 
(d) reading the results: assessment of the aspect of the sedimentation of the antigen is made by examining the bottom of the well reflected in a concave mirror placed above it. If there is a negative reaction, the antigen forms a sediment in the form of a compact button with clear edges and having an intense red colour. If there is a positive reaction on the other hand, a diffused pink veil is formed that is evenly distributed. The different percentages of agglutination are determined by comparison with antigen checks indicating 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % agglutination. The title of each serum is expressed in international units of agglutination per ml. Controls with negative and positive serum diluted so as to contain 30 international units of agglutination per ml should be included in the test. 
H. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) for detecting bovine brucellosis 
1. The material and reagents to be used are as follows: 
(a) solid-phase microplates, cuvettes or any other solid phase; 
(b) the antigen is fixed to the solid phase with or without the aid of polyclonal or monoclonal catching antibodies; 
(c) the biological fluid to be tested; 
(d) a corresponding positive and negative control; 
(e) conjugate; 
(f) a substrate adapted to the enzyme used; 
(g) a stopping solution, if necessary; 
(h) solutions for the dilution of the test samples for preparations of the reagents and for washing; 
(i) a reading system appropriate to the substrate used. 
2. Standardization and sensitivity of test 
(1) Bulk milk samples are classified negative if they give a reaction less than 50 % of that given by a 1 in 10 000 dilution of the second international brucellosis standard serum made up in negative milk. 
(2) Individual serum samples are classified negative if they give a reaction less than 10 % of that given by a 1 in 200 dilution of the second international brucellosis standard serum made up in saline solution or in any other recognized dilution, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 after receiving the opinion of the Scientific Veterinary Committee. 
The brucellosis Elisa standards shall be as specified in A.1 and 2 (to be used at the dilutions indicated on the label). 
3. Conditions for use of the Elisa test for bovine brucellosis

(ii) all animals aged over 24 months must react negatively to two tests carried out in accordance with Chapter II at an interval of at least four months and no more than 12 months; 
(iii) all other animals must, after identification, remain on the holding until they are aged over 24 months and have satisfied the tests referred to in (ii); 
(iv) an epidemiological inquiry must be conducted, and the herds linked epidemiologically to the infected herd must be subjected to the measures laid down in (ii). 
However, the competent authority may grant a derogation from the obligation to slaughter the calf of an infected cow where it was separated from its mother after calving. In this case, the calf must be made subject to the requirements provided for in 2 (iii). 
3. Where the officially enzootic-bovine-leukosis-free status of a herd has been suspended for any other reason, all animals in the herd aged over 24 months must give a negative reaction to a serological test carried out in accordance with Chapter II. 
E. In accordance with the procedure in Article 17, the Commission may propose that a Member State or region of a Member State may become officially enzootic-bovine-leukosis-free if: 
(a) at least 99,8 % of the bovine herds are officially enzootic bovine leukosis free herds within the meaning of A; 
or 
(b) no case of enzootic bovine leukosis has been confirmed in the Member State or region for the past three years and 
in the case of a Member State, all animals aged over 24 months in at least 10 % of herds, selected randomly, have been tested with negative results in accordance with Chapter II in the previous 24 months or 
in the case of a region or a Member State, all animals aged over 24 months have undergone a test provided for in Chapter II with negative result. 
F. A Member State or a region of a Member State shall retain officially enzootic-bovine-leukosis-free status if: 
(i) every year either a random sample with a confidence rating of 99 % has established that less than 0,2 % of the herds were infected or not less than 20 % of bovine animals over two years of age have been tested and have reacted negatively to a test carried out in accordance with Chapter II; 
or 
(ii) where no case of enzootic bovine leukosis has been recorded in the Member State or region in a proportion of one herd out of 10 000 for at least three years, a decision may be taken in accordance with Article 17 to cease routine serological testing provided that: 
- all cattle slaughtered within the territory of that Member State or region are submitted to a post-mortem examination by an official veterinarian who must issue notification of all tumours with a view to laboratory examination, and 
- the Member State shall report the occurrence of all cases of enzootic bovine leukosis in the region affected by the decision to the Commission. The Commission may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17, propose that the decision to cease routine serological testing be suspended or revoked, and 
- any cattle which react positively to an immune-diffusion test are slaughtered and the herd remains subject to restrictions until re-establishment of its status pursuant to Chapter I.D. 
G. (i) The officially enzootic-bovine-leukosis-free status of a Member State or region of a Member State shall be suspended, in accordance with the procedure in Article 17, if enzootic bovine leukosis is detected and confirmed in more than 0,2 % of holdings in the region or Member State. 
(ii) The officially enzootic-bovine-leukosis-free status may be restored, in accordance with the procedure in Article 17, if: 
(a) in addition to the measures provided for in paragraphs D.1 and 2, at least 20 % of the other herds, selected randomly, in the region or Member State have, within a 12-month period, undergone one of the tests referred to in Chapter II; 
(b) the results of this testing establish, with a confidence rating of 99 %, that less than 0,2 % of herds are infected. 
CHAPTER II TESTS FOR ENZOOTIC BOVINE LEUKOSIS 
Tests for enzootic bovine leukosis shall be carried out by the immune-diffusion test under the conditions described in A and B or by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) under the conditions described in C. The immune-diffusion method may only be used for individual tests. If test results are the subject of a duly-substantiated challenge, an additional check shall be carried out by means of the immune-diffusion test. 
A. Agar gel immune-diffusion test for enzootic bovine leukosis 
1. The antigen to be used in the test must contain bovine leukosis virus glycoproteins. The antigen must be standardized against a standard serum (El serum) supplied by the State Veterinary Serum Laboratory, Copenhagen.

(o) Sweden: Statens veterinÃ¤rmedicinska anstalt, Uppsala. 
3. The standard antigens used in the laboratory must be submitted at least once a year to the EEC reference laboratories listed in 2 for testing against the official EEC standard serum. Apart from this standardization, the antigen in use can be calibrated in accordance with B. 
4. The reagents for the test shall consist of: 
(a) antigen: the antigen must contain specific glycoproteins of enzootic bovine leukosis virus which has been standardized against the official EEC serum; 
(b) the test serum; 
(c) known positive control serum; 
(d) agar gel: 
0,8 % agar, 
8,5 % NaCl, 
0,05 M Tris-buffer pH 7,2; 
15 ml of this agar must be introduced into a petri dish of 85 mm diameter, resulting in a depth of 2,6 mm of agar. 
5. A test pattern of seven moisture-free wells must be cut in the agar to the bottom of the plate; the pattern must consist of one central well and six wells in a circle around it. 
Diameter of central well: 4 mm 
Diameter of peripheral wells: 6 mm 
Distance between central and peripheral wells: 3 mm 
6. The central well must be filled with the standard antigen. Peripheral wells 1 and 4 (see diagram below) are filled with the known positive serum, wells 2, 3, 5 and 6 with the test sera. The wells must be filled until the meniscus disappears. 
7. This results in the following quantities being obtained: 
antigen: 32 Ã¬l 
control serum: 73 Ã¬l 
test serum: 73 Ã¬l. 
8. Incubation must be for 72 hours at room temperature (20 to 27 Â°C) in a closed humid chamber. 
9. The test may be read at 24 and 48 hours but a final result may not be obtained before 72 hours: 
(a) a test serum is positive if it forms a specific precipitin line with the BLV antigen and forms a complete line of identity with the control serum; 
(b) a test serum is negative if it does not form a specific precipitin line with the BLV antigen and if it does not bend the line of the control serum; 
(c) the reaction cannot be considered conclusive if it: 
(i) bends the line of the control serum towards the BLV antigen well without forming a visible precipitin line with the antigen; 
or 
(ii) if it cannot be read either as negative or as positive. 
In inconclusive reactions the test may be repeated and concentrated serum utilized. 
10. Any other well configuration or pattern may be utilized provided that the E4 serum diluted 1:10 in negative serum can be detected as positive. 
B. Method for antigen standardization 
Solutions and materials required 
1. 40 ml of 1,6 % agarose in 0,05 M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7,2 with 8,5 % NaCl; 
2. 15 ml of a bovine leukosis serum, having antibody only to bovine leukosis virus glycoproteins, diluted 1:10 in 0,05 M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7,2 with 8,5 % NaCl; 
3. 15 ml of a bovine leukosis serum, having antibody only to bovine leukosis virus glycoproteins, diluted 1:5 in 0,05 M Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7,2 with 8,5 % NaCl; 
4. four plastic petri dishes with a diameter of 85 mm; 
5. a punch with a diameter of 4 to 6 mm; 
6. a reference antigen; 
7. the antigen which is to be standardized; 
8. a water bath (56 Â°C). 
Procedure 
Dissolve the agarose (1,6 %) in the Tris/HCl buffer by carefully heating to 100 Â°C. Place in 56 Â°C water bath for approximately one hour. Also, place the bovine leukosis serum dilutions in a 56 Â°C water bath. 
Now mix 15 ml of the 56 Â°C agarose solution with the 15 ml bovine leukosis serum (1:10), quickly shake and pour 15 ml into each of two petri dishes. Repeat this procedure with the bovine leukosis serum diluted 1:5. 
When the agarose has hardened, holes are made in it as follows: 
Addition of antigen 
(i) Petri dishes 1 and 3: 
well A - undiluted reference antigen, 
well B - 1:2 diluted reference antigen, 
wells C and E - reference antigen, 
well D - undiluted test antigen. 
(ii) Petri dishes 2 and 4: 
well A - undiluted test antigen, 
well B - 1:2 diluted test antigen, 
well C - 1:4 diluted test antigen, 
well D - 1:8 diluted test antigen. 
Additional instructions 
1. The experiment shall be carried out with two serum dilutions (1:5 and 1:10) in order to achieve optimal precipitation 
2. If the precipitation diameter is too small with both dilutions, then the serum must be further diluted. 
3. If the precipitation diameter in both dilutions is too large and faint, then a lower serum must be chosen. 
4. The final concentration of the agarose must be 0,8 %; that of the sera 5 and 10 % respectively. 
5. Plot the measured diameters in the following coordinate system. The dilution of the antigen to be tested with the same diameter as the reference antigen is the working dilution. 
C. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Elisa) for detecting enzootic bovine leukosis 
1. The material and reagents to be used are as follows: 
(a) solid-phase microplates, cuvettes or any other solid phase; 
(b) the antigen is fixed to the solid phase with or without the aid of polyclonal or monoclonal catching antibodies. If antigen is coated directly to the solid phase, all test samples giving positive reactions have to be retested against control antigen in the case of EBL. The control antigen should be identical to the antigen except for the BLV antigens. If catching antibodies are coated to the solid phase, the antibodies must not react to antigens other than BLV antigens; 
(c) the biological fluid to be tested; 
(d) a corresponding positive and negative control; 
(e) conjugate; 
(f) a substrate adapted to the enzyme used; 
(g) a stopping solution, if necessary; 
(h) solutions for the dilution of the test samples for preparations of the reagents and for washing; 
(i) a reading system appropriate to the substrate used. 
2. Standardization and sensitivity of test 
The sensitivity of the Elisa assay must be of such a level that E4 serum is scored positive when diluted 10 times (serum samples) or 250 times (milk samples) more than the dilution obtained of individual samples when these are included in pools. In assays where samples (serum and milk) are tested individually E4 serum diluted 1 to 10 (in negative serum) or 1 to 250 (in negative milk) must be scored positive when tested in the same assay dilution as used for the individual test samples. The official institutes listed in A.2 will be responsible for checking the quality of the Elisa method, and in particular for determining, for each production batch, the number of samples to be pooled on the basis of the count obtained for the E4 serum. 
The E4 serum will be supplied by the National Veterinary Laboratory, Copenhagen. 
3. Conditions for use of the Elisa test for EBL 
The Elisa method may be used on a sample of milk or whey taken from the milk collected from a farm with at least 30 % of dairy cows in milk. 
If this method is used, measures must be taken to ensure that the samples taken can be identified with the animals from which the milk or sera examined were taken.
