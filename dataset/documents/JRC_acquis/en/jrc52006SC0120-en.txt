THE JOINT COMMITTEE, 
Having regard to the Agreement between the European Economic Community, of the one part, and the Swiss Confederation, of the other part signed in Brussels on 22 July 1972, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Agreement’, as amended by the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending the Agreement as regards the provisions applicable to processed agricultural products signed in Luxembourg on 26 October 2004, and its Protocol No 2, and in particular Article 7 thereof,

(2) Whereas the Swiss customs tariff does not classify products containing fat in tariff no 1901.2099. Therefore, the standard recipe of this tariff number in the Appendix to Table IV shall be adapted by removing the butter content and replacing it partially by an increased wheat flour content, 
(3) Whereas beverages containing milk components shall be subject to price compensation measures and therefore listed in Table I of Protocol No 2. Following the modification of Table I, Table II of Protocol No 2 must also be amended. As no import duties are imposed on preferential imports to Switzerland, these products shall be listed in Table IVc) of Protocol No 2 as well,
