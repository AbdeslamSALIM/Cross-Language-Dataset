COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2203/90 
of 24 July 1990 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 1581/86 laying down general rules for intervention on the market in cereals and Regulations No 724/67/EEC and (EEC) No 2754/78 on intervention in the oils and fats sector 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1340/90 (2), and in particular Article 7 (5) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2902/89 (4), and in particular Articles 12 (3) and 26 (2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas a feature of the Community cereals and olive oils sectors is a structural imbalance between supply and demand; whereas the search for new uses in an appropriate means for remedying the situation; 
Whereas, in these two sectors and in the oilseeds sector, the search for non-food uses is an appropriate way of opening up new prospects for Community agriculture; 
Whereas the search for new outlets for cereals and oils and fats outside the food sector should accordingly be supported; whereas that support may involve making cereals and oils and fats held by intervention agencies available to researchers on favourable terms laid down in advance for the execution of projects approved according to a procedure ensuring close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; 
Whereas such cooperation may be realized under the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research; 
Whereas it is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1581/86 (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 195/89 (6), Regulation No 724/67/EEC (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1230/89 (8), and Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 (9).
