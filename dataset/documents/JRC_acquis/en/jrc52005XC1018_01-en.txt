Aid No: XA 42/05 
Member State: Netherlands 
Title of aid scheme or name of company receiving individual aid: Aid for TSE tests on goats for slaughter 
Legal basis: 
Begroting van het Ministerie van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit. Budget of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. 
Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 214/2005, obliges Member States to test goats for TSEs. In accordance with the budget, costs connected with those tests are not passed on to goat-owners 
Annual expenditure planned under the scheme or overall amount of individual aid granted to the company: The overall budgetary allocation amounts to a maximum of around EUR 84000 per year. This is based on a maximum of 7000 goats 
Maximum aid intensity: The total cost of a test is EUR 42. The Netherlands contributes EUR 12 per goat for slaughter (over 18 months old), which complements the amount of EUR 30 part-financed by the European Commission 
Date of implementation: The obligation to test goats came into effect under Regulation (EC) No 214/2005 amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. On account of the very swift entry into force of this Community requirement, the testing of goats got under way immediately in the Netherlands. Test costs are not passed on to the original goat-owner 
Duration of scheme or individual aid award: The aid will be granted in this form until the European Commission takes a decision on whether to continue TSE testing of goats for slaughter. The Commission has indicated that it will take a decision in autumn 2005. As soon as a decision has been taken on the continuation or otherwise of TSE testing of goats, a new decision will have to be taken on whether aid is to be granted and, if so, in what form 
Objective of aid: 
The Dutch Government considers that this aid falls within the scope of Article 15 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1/2004 of 23 December 2003. 
The objective is to gather epidemiological data on TSEs in goats. 
The background to the aid lies in the compulsory TSE testing of goats imposed by Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. This was to be carried out over a short period in order to determine the prevalence of BSE in goats. However, the revenue from a goat is so small that it is substantially exceeded by the cost of a TSE test. Passing on the cost of testing would deter goat-owners from offering their animals for slaughter. This would mean that no tests could be carried out and, therefore, no epidemiological data could be collected, which would be highly undesirable in view of its importance to public health. Refunding test costs in full ensures that goats are offered for slaughter so that TSE tests may be performed and test results collected 
Economic sector(s) concerned: Agricultural undertakings, particularly goat-owners 
Name and address of the granting authority: Ministerie van Landbouw Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit 
Website: www.minlnv.nl/loket 
Other information: As indicated, this is a temporary measure. Aid for BSE and TSE testing is permitted under the Community guidelines for State aid concerning TSE tests, fallen stock and slaughterhouse waste (OJ C 324, 24.2.2002)

- Articles L 1511-1 et suivants du Code général des collectivités territoriales 
Annual expenditure planned under the scheme: EUR 100000 
Maximum aid intensity: 
20 % of eligible investments up to a maximum of EUR 1400. 
Where investments are made by young farmers during the five years following set-up, the maximum aid intensity is increased to 25 % up to a maximum of EUR 1450 
Where additional financing is provided by other local authorities, the rate of financing from the Conseil général is reduced on a case-by-case basis so as to comply with the maximum authorised rate of public aid 
Implementation date: After the receipt advice slip has been received from the European Commission 
Duration of the scheme: Until 31.12.2009 at the latest 
- the purchase of secure buildings for the storage of drums and small containers and fitting those buildings out (thermal insulation, shelving systems, absorbent floor coverings for chemicals, etc.); 
- the fitting out of existing buildings and structures (safety cabinets, storage bins, ventilation of premises, spillage retention trays, etc.); 
- the installation of specific, professional protection equipment for the on-farm storage of plant-health products and of external equipment and optional material (galvanising of storage modules, protective covers, etc.) 
The scheme complies with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2004 
The scheme promotes investments to ensure the security of plant-health product storage facilities in order to protect the health of those working on agricultural holdings and does not therefore relate to the environment, the hygiene conditions of livestock enterprises or animal welfare, compliance with the minimum Community requirements for which will be subject to prior verification. The objective of the scheme is solely to ensure public health, a field governed by a corpus of rules whose scope extends beyond the agricultural sector

Title of aid scheme or name of company receiving an individual aid: Aid towards the cost of preparing falling stock (bovine animals, sheep and goats) for the taking of samples in the context of the rapid tests for BSE/TSE performed on fallen stock (bovine animals, sheep and goats) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Beneficiaries are the respective livestock owners who are to be regarded as small or medium-sized enterprises within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1/2004 
Legal basis: Richtlinien für die Gewährung von Beihilfen im Rahmen der Bekämpfung Transmissibler Spongiformer Enzephalopathien bei Rinder, Schafen und Ziegen (TSE-Beihilfe-Richtlinien) in der Fassung vom 16. Dezember 2004 
Annual expenditure planned under the scheme or overall amount of individual aid granted to the company: 
Cost of preparing the fallen stock (bovine animals, sheep and goats) for the taking of samples: EUR 770000 in 2005. 
From 2006, EUR 161000 a year 
Maximum aid intensity: 100 % or EUR 7,41 for preparing each sample in the case of bovine animals; EUR 3,86 for preparing each sample in the case of sheep and goats 
Date of implementation Note: The delayed notification is only appearing now because there was a previous attempt to file a single aid application for the Federal Republic of Germany (Aid No 373/2003). Since this was not successful and exemption Regulation (EC) No 1/2004 has in the meantime entered into force, a separate request for exemption is being filed for Schleswig-Holstein 
Duration of scheme or individual aid award: Aid will be granted for as long as the examination is required under Annex III, Chapter A, Number I. 3 and Number II.3 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 
Objective of aid: 
Livestock owners in Schleswig-Holstein are obliged in principle to bear the costs of diagnostic measures which need to be performed on their stock under animal health rules. The objective of the measure is therefore to ensure that fallen stock, too, is monitored for TSE by settling the fee which owners of fallen bovine animals, sheep and goats are required to pay to prepare such fallen stock for sampling in carcass disposal establishments. 
The basis for the exemption is Article 16(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2004 
Economic sector(s) concerned: Agriculture. Owners of bovine animals, sheep and goats at the production stage.
