Council Decision 
of 23 January 2006 
amending Decision 90/424/EEC on expenditure in the veterinary field 
(2006/53/EC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [1], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza, previously called %quot%avian plague%quot%, is a very severe infection of birds that causes a very serious risk for animal health. The influenza virus of avian origin may, in certain conditions, also pose a risk for human health. 
(2) Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field [3] provides for the possibility of a financial contribution from the Community to the Member States for the eradication of certain animal diseases. This Decision envisages the possibility of granting such contribution for the eradication of avian influenza caused by the so-called %quot%highly pathogenic%quot% strains of virus. 
(3) During recent avian influenza epidemics, outbreaks of disease caused by low pathogenic avian influenza viruses subsequently mutated into highly pathogenic viruses causing devastating consequences and risks for public health. Once mutation has occurred, the virus is extremely difficult to control. Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza [4], establishes compulsory surveillance and control measures also in relation with the low pathogenic viruses, so that outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza may be prevented. 
(4) In the light of the adoption of Directive 2005/94/EC it is appropriate to modify Decision 90/424/EEC so that Community financial assistance may also be granted for those eradication measures carried out by the Member States to combat avian influenza virus strains of low pathogenicity that may mutate into highly pathogenic strains, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
