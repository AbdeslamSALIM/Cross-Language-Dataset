Council Regulation (EC) No 1081/2000 
of 22 May 2000 
prohibiting the sale, supply and export to Burma/Myanmar of equipment which might be used for internal repression or terrorism, and freezing the funds of certain persons related to important governmental functions in that country 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60 and 301 thereof, 
Having regard to Common Position 2000/346/CFSP of 26 April 2000 extending and amending Common Position 96/635/CFSP on Burma/Myanmar(1), 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) In view of continued severe and systematic violations of human rights by the Burmese authorities, and in particular continuing and intensified repression of civil and political rights, and the failure of those authorities to take steps towards democracy and reconciliation, Common Position 2000/346/CFSP provides that the restrictive measures applicable to Burma/Myanmar, as laid down in Common Position 96/635/CFSP(2) and 98/612/CFSP(3), should be expanded by means of, inter alia, a freezing of the funds of senior members of the State Peace and Development Council, Burmese authorities in the tourism sector, senior members of the military, the Government or the security forces who formulate, implement or benefit from policies that impede Burma/Myanmar's transition to democracy, and their families, and by a prohibition of sales, supplies and exports of equipment which might be used for internal repression or terrorism. 
(2) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty. 
(3) Therefore, and with a view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary for the implementation of the said measures as far as the territory of the Community is concerned. Such territory is deemed to encompass, for the purposes of this Regulation, all the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty. 
(4) The competent authorities of the Member States should, where necessary, be empowered to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation. 
(5) There is a need for the Commission and the Member States to inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation, without prejudice to existing obligations with regard to certain items concerned. 
(6) It is desirable that it should be possible for sanctions for violations of this Regulation to be imposed after its entry into force,
