derogating from Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards the import arrangements for milk and milk products and opening tariff quotas, and amending that Regulation 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 26(3), Article 29(1) and Article 40 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The bilateral agreement concluded between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning trade in agricultural products, signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999 and approved by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom of the Council and of the Commission(3) (hereinafter called the %quot%Agreement with Switzerland%quot%), concerns in particular the opening of quotas and reductions in customs duties on certain milk products originating in Switzerland. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(4) should therefore be amended. 
(2) The Agreement with Switzerland enters into force on 1 June 2002. Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 provides for the management of tariff quotas on the basis of six-month periods commencing on 1 January and 1 July each year. In the interests of coordination and in compliance with the annual quantities provided for in the Agreement with Switzerland, the quotas provided for in that Agreement should be managed on the basis of the same intervals. 
(3) Under Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, in order to qualify for reduced customs duty on imports of certain cheeses from Switzerland, a minimum free-at-frontier value must be observed and a penalty is provided for in the event of failure to comply. Since the Agreement with Switzerland no longer provides for compliance with a minimum free-at-frontier value, that Article should be deleted. 
(4) In order to enable importers who are intending to participate in the allocation of quotas opened under the Agreement with Switzerland to comply with the approval arrangements laid down in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, the deadline for the submission of requests for approval should be extended. 
(5) The Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, of the other part, signed in Brussels on 24 November 1997 and approved by Decision 2002/357/EC, CECA of the Council and of the Commission(5) (hereinafter called the %quot%Agreement with Jordan%quot%) concerns in particular tariff concessions for certain types of cheese originating in Jordan. This quota should be managed in accordance with the rules laid down in Title 2, Chapter I, of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 by including the necessary provisions. 
(6) Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 provides for the fixing of the maximum quantities for which importers may lodge licence applications. Under Article 16(2), where the quantity allocated in the first period is less than the quantity available, the Commission will determine the quantity which will be added to that available for the second period of the quota year. It should be made clear that in that case the quantities referred to in Article 13 will be adjusted accordingly. 
(7) Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 provides that the competent authorities of the Member States will send the Commission their lists of approved importers. In order to enable each applicant to be identified more easily, the data to be forwarded for each importer should be specified. 
(8) In a spirit of cooperation with the candidate countries and in order to facilitate maximum use of the quotas and tariff concessions granted to those countries, it should be made possible also, at the request of the country concerned, to forward the lists of approved importers, in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data(6). 
(9) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 requires licence applicants to specify the products which are to be imported, indicating on the licence application and the licence the exact fat content and dry matter content. Tariff quotas managed in accordance with Title 2, Chapter I, are frequently the subject of import licence applications which far exceed the available quotas and result therefore in the application of minimum allocation coefficients and the allocation to individual applicants of quantities representing a fraction only of those applied for. For that reason, when applications are lodged, these importers are unable to conclude contracts and consequently the exact composition of the products they are intending to import under the codes shown in the licence application is not available to them. Given that the exact composition of the product is available to importers when the import declaration is made, the provisions concerned should be replaced therefore by a requirement that the importer indicate the content of the products on the import declaration when completing the customs formalities. 
(10) In order to monitor the trend of the contents of certain of these products, provision should be made also for this information to be forwarded to the Commission. However, in order not to further encumber the national administrations, the competent authorities should be requested to forward only data concerning contents that exceed representative reference values. To that end, these values should be established on the basis of the contents defined in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(7), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2002(8), and the contents defined in Sector 9 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural products nomenclature for export refunds(9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 749/2002(10). 
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
