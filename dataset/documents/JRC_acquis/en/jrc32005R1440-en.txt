Council Regulation (EC) No 1440/2005 of 12 July 2005 on administering certain restrictions on imports of certain steel products from Ukraine and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2266/2004 
Council Regulation (EC) No 1440/2005 
of 12 July 2005 
on administering certain restrictions on imports of certain steel products from Ukraine and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2266/2004 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
(1) The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States and Ukraine [1], hereinafter referred to as "the PCA", entered into force on 1 March 1998. 
(2) Article 22(1) of the PCA provides that trade in certain steel products shall be governed by Title III thereof, with the exception of Article 14 thereof, and by the provisions of an Agreement on quantitative arrangements. 
(3) On 29 July 2005, the European Community and the Government of Ukraine concluded such an Agreement on trade in certain steel products [2], hereinafter referred to as "the Agreement". 
(4) It is necessary to provide the means for administering the terms of the Agreement within the Community, taking into account the experience gained from previous Agreements concerning a similar regime. 
(5) It is appropriate to classify the products in question on the basis of the combined nomenclature (CN) established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff [3]. 
(6) It is necessary to ensure that the origin of the products in question is checked and appropriate methods of administrative cooperation are set up to that end. 
(7) The effective application of the Agreement requires the introduction of a requirement of a Community import authorisation for entry into free circulation in the Community of the products in question together with a system for administering the granting of such Community import authorisations. 
(8) Products placed in a free zone or imported under the arrangements governing customs warehouses, temporary importation or inward processing (suspension system) should not be counted against the limits established for the products in question. 
(9) In order to ensure that these quantitative limits are not exceeded, it is necessary to establish a management procedure whereby the competent authorities of the Member States will not issue import authorisations before obtaining prior confirmation from the Commission that appropriate amounts remain available within the quantitative limit in question. 
(10) The Agreement provides for a system of cooperation between Ukraine and the Community with the aim of preventing circumvention by means of transhipment, rerouting or other means. A consultation procedure should be established under which an agreement can be reached with the country concerned on an equivalent adjustment to the relevant quantitative limit when it appears that the Agreement has been circumvented. Ukraine has agreed to take the necessary measures to ensure that any adjustments could be rapidly applied. In the absence of agreement within the time limit provided, the Community should, where there is clear evidence of circumvention, have the possibility to apply the equivalent adjustment. 
(11) From 1 January 2005 imports into the Community of products covered by this Regulation have been subjected to a licence pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2266/2004 of 20 December 2004 on trade in certain steel products between the Community and Ukraine [4]. The Agreement provides that those imports are to be counted against the limits established for 2005 in this Regulation. 
(12) For reasons of clarity it is therefore necessary to replace Regulation (EC) No 2266/2004 by this Regulation, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
CHAPTER I 
GENERAL PROVISIONS 
Article 1 
1. This Regulation applies to imports into the Community of steel products listed in Annex I, originating in Ukraine. 
2. The steel products shall be classified in product groups as set out in Annex I. 
3. The origin of the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall be determined in accordance with the rules in force in the Community. 
4. The procedures for verification of the origin of the products referred to in paragraph 1 are laid down in Chapters II and III. 
Article 2 
1. The importation into the Community of the products listed in Annex I originating in Ukraine shall be subject to the annual quantitative limits laid down in Annex V. The release for free circulation in the Community of the products listed in Annex I originating in Ukraine shall be subject to the presentation of a certificate of origin, as set out in Annex II, and of an import authorisation issued by the Member States' authorities in accordance with the provisions of Article 4. 
The authorised imports shall be counted against the quantitative limits laid down for the year in which the products are shipped in the exporting country. 
2. In order to ensure that quantities for which import authorisations are issued do not exceed at any moment the total quantitative limits for each product group, the competent authorities of the Member States shall issue import authorisations only upon confirmation by the Commission that there are still quantities available within the quantitative limits for the relevant product group of steel products in respect of the supplier country, for which an importer or importers have submitted applications to those authorities. The competent authorities of the Member States for the purposes of this Regulation are listed in Annex IV. 
3. Imports of products as from 1 January 2005, for which a licence was required pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2266/2004 shall be counted against the relevant limits for 2005 laid down in Annex V. 
4. For the purposes of this Regulation and as from the date of its application, shipment of products shall be considered as having taken place on the date on which they were loaded on to the exporting means of transport. 
Article 3 
1. The quantitative limits referred to in Annex V shall not apply to products placed in a free zone or free warehouse or imported under the arrangements governing customs warehouses, temporary importation or inward processing (suspension system). 
2. Where the products referred to in paragraph 1 are subsequently released for free circulation, either in the unaltered state or after working or processing, Article 2(2) shall apply and the products so released shall be counted against the relevant quantitative limit set out in Annex V. 
Article 4 
1. For the purpose of applying Article 2(2), before issuing import authorisations, the competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the Commission of the amounts of the requests for import authorisations, supported by original export licences, which they have received. By return, the Commission shall notify its confirmation that the requested amount(s) of quantities are available for importation in the chronological order in which the notifications of the Member States have been received. 
2. The requests included in the notifications to the Commission shall be valid if they establish clearly in each case the exporting country, the product group concerned, the amounts to be imported, the number of the export licence, the quota year and the Member State in which the products are intended to be put into free circulation. 
3. As far as possible, the Commission shall confirm to the authorities of the Member States the full amount indicated in the requests notified for each product group. Moreover, the Commission shall contact the competent authorities of Ukraine immediately in cases where requests notified exceed the limits in order to seek clarification and a rapid solution. 
4. The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the Commission immediately after being informed of any quantity that is not used during the duration of validity of the import authorisation. Such unused quantities shall automatically be transferred into the remaining quantities of the total Community quantitative limit for each product group. 
5. The notifications referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall be communicated electronically within the integrated network set up for this purpose, unless for imperative technical reasons it is necessary to use other means of communication temporarily. 
6. The import authorisations or equivalent documents shall be issued in accordance with Chapter II. 
7. The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the Commission of any cancellation of import authorisations or equivalent documents already issued in cases where the corresponding export licences have been withdrawn or cancelled by the competent authorities of Ukraine. However, if the Commission or the competent authorities of a Member State have been informed by the competent authorities of Ukraine of the withdrawal or cancellation of an export licence after the related products have been imported into the Community, the quantities in question shall be counted against the quantitative limit for the year during which shipment of products took place. 
Article 5 
For the purposes of applying Article 3(3) and 3(4) of the Agreement, the Commission is hereby authorised to make the necessary adjustments. 
Article 6 
1. Where, following the enquiries carried out in accordance with the procedures set out in Chapter III, the Commission notes that the information in its possession constitutes proof that products listed in Annex I originating in Ukraine have been transhipped, rerouted or otherwise imported into the Community through circumvention of the quantitative limits referred to in Article 2 and that there is a need for the necessary adjustments to be made, it shall request that consultations be opened so that agreement may be reached on an equivalent adjustment of the corresponding quantitative limits. 
2. Pending the outcome of the consultations referred to in paragraph 1, the Commission may ask Ukraine to take the necessary precautionary steps to ensure that adjustments to the quantitative limits agreed following such consultations may be carried out for the year in which the request for consultations was lodged or for the following year, if the quantitative limits for the current year are exhausted, where there is clear evidence of circumvention. 
3. If the Community and Ukraine fail to arrive at a satisfactory solution and if the Commission notes that there is clear evidence of circumvention, the Commission shall deduct from the quantitative limits an equivalent volume of products originating in Ukraine. 
Article 7 
This Regulation shall not constitute in any way a derogation from the provisions of the Agreement which, in all cases of conflict, shall prevail. 
CHAPTER II

2. Products shipped before the date of application of the decision shall remain subject to earlier classification practice, provided that the goods in question are entered to importation within 60 days of that date. 
Article 13 
Where a classification decision adopted in accordance with the Community procedures in force referred to in Article 12 involves a product group subject to a quantitative limit, the Commission shall, where necessary, initiate consultations without delay in accordance with Article 9, in order to reach agreement on any necessary adjustments to the corresponding quantitative limits provided for in Annex V. 
Article 14 
1. Without prejudice to any other provision on this subject, where the classification indicated in the documentation necessary for importation of the products covered by this Regulation differs from the classification determined by the competent authorities of the Member State into which they are to be imported, the goods in question shall be provisionally subject to the import arrangements which, in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation, are applicable to them on the basis of the classification determined by the aforementioned authorities. 
2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform the Commission of the cases referred to in paragraph 1, indicating in particular:

Article 23 
Import authorisations or equivalent documents shall be issued by the competent authorities of the Member States in conformity with Article 2(2) and without discrimination to any importer in the Community, wherever the place of his establishment may be in the Community, without prejudice to other conditions required under the current rules. 
Article 24 
1. If the Commission finds that the total quantities covered by export licences issued by Ukraine for a particular product group in any year exceed the quantitative limit established for that product group, the competent authorities in the Member States shall be informed immediately in order to suspend the further issue of import authorisations. In this event, consultations shall be initiated forthwith by the Commission.

2. The duplicate shall bear the date of the original licence or certificate. 
SECTION 4 
Community import authorisation — common form 
Article 28 
1. The forms to be used by the competent authorities of the Member States for issuing the import authorisations referred to in Article 21 shall conform to the model of the import authorisation set out in Annex III. 
2. Import authorisation forms and extracts thereof shall be drawn up in duplicate, one copy, marked "Holder's copy" and bearing the number 1 to be issued to the applicant, and the other, marked "Copy for the issuing authority" and bearing the number 2, to be kept by the authority issuing the licence. For administrative purposes the competent authorities may add additional copies to form 2.

9. The reverse of copy No 1 and copy No 2 shall bear a box in which quantities may be entered, either by the customs authorities when import formalities are completed, or by the competent administrative authorities when an extract is issued. If the space set aside for debits on a licence or extract thereof is insufficient, the competent authorities may attach one or more extension pages bearing boxes matching those on the reverse of copy No 1 and copy No 2 of the licence or extract. The debiting authorities shall place their stamp so that one half is on the licence or extract thereof and the other half is on the extension page. If there is more than one extension page, a further stamp shall be placed in like manner across each page and the preceding page. 
10. Import authorisations and extracts issued, and entries and endorsements made, by the authorities of one Member State shall have the same legal effect in each of the other Member States as documents issued, and entries and endorsements made, by the authorities of such Member States. 
11. The competent authorities of the Member States concerned may, where indispensable, require the contents of licences or extracts to be translated into the official language or one of the official languages of that Member State. 
CHAPTER III 
ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION 
Article 29 
The Commission shall supply the Member States' authorities with the names and addresses of authorities in Ukraine competent to issue certificates of origin and export licences together with specimens of the stamps used by these authorities. 
Article 30 
1. Subsequent verification of certificates of origin or export licences shall be carried out at random, or whenever the competent authorities of the Member States have reasonable doubt as to the authenticity of the certificate of origin or export licence or as to the accuracy of the information regarding the true origin of the products in question. 
In such cases the competent authorities of the Community shall return the certificate of origin or the export licence or a copy thereof to the competent authorities of Ukraine, giving, where appropriate, the reasons of form or substance for an enquiry. If the invoice has been submitted, such invoice or a copy thereof shall be attached to the certificate of origin or export licence or copy thereof. The competent authorities shall also forward any information that has been offered suggesting that the particulars given on the certificate of origin or the export licence are inaccurate. 
2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to subsequent verifications of declarations of origin. 
3. The results of the subsequent verifications carried out in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the Community within three months at the latest. The information communicated shall indicate whether the disputed certificate, licence or declaration applies to the goods actually exported and whether the goods are eligible for export to the Community under this Chapter. The competent authorities of the Community may also request copies of all documentation necessary to determine the facts fully, including, in particular, the origin of the goods. 
4. Should such verifications reveal abuse or major irregularities in the use of declarations of origin, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission of this fact. The Commission shall pass the information on to the other Member States. 
5. Random recourse to the procedure specified in this Article shall not constitute an obstacle to the release for free circulation of the products in question. 
Article 31 
1. Where the verification procedure referred to in Article 30 or where information available to the competent authorities of the Community indicates that the provisions of this Chapter are being contravened, the said authorities shall request Ukraine to carry out appropriate enquiries or arrange for such enquiries to be carried out concerning operations which are or appear to be in contravention of the provisions of this Chapter. The results of these enquiries shall be communicated to the competent authorities of the Community together with any other pertinent information enabling the true origin of the goods to be determined. 
2. In pursuance of the action taken in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter, the competent authorities of the Community may exchange any information with the competent authorities of Ukraine which is considered to be of use in preventing the contravention of the provisions of this Chapter. 
3. Where it is established that the provisions of this Chapter have been contravened, the Commission may take such measures as are necessary to prevent recurrence of such contravention. 
Article 32 
The Commission shall coordinate the action undertaken by the competent authorities of the Member States under the provisions of this Chapter. The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of action which they have undertaken and the results obtained. 
CHAPTER IV
