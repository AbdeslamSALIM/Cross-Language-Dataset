REGULATION (EEC) No 1634/71 OF THE COMMISSION of 27 July 1971 amending Commission Regulation (EEC) No 821/68 of 28 June 1968 on the definition, applicable to the granting of export refunds, of hulled grains and pearled grains of cereals 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community; 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 120/67, EEC 1 of 13 June 1967 on the common organisation of the market in cereals, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1528/71 2, and in particular Article 16 (6) thereof; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 821/68 3 of 28 June 1968 adopted a definition, applicable to the granting of export refunds, of hulled grains and pearled grains of cereals; 
Whereas there exist on the market pearled grains of good quality which do not, however, meet the requirements relating to the regularity of the grains laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 821/68 and which, since they do not correspond to the definition laid down for that purpose, cannot qualify for the export refund on these products ; whereas, so that this class of products can qualify for the refund, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 821/68 should be adopted; 
Whereas the measures provided for in the Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals: 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Part B of the %quot%Definition of %quot%hulled grains%quot% (shelled or husked) and %quot%pearled grains%quot%%quot% set out in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 821/68 shall be amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.
