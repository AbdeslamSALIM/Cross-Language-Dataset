Commission Regulation (EC) No 1830/2006 
of 13 December 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef originating in Switzerland 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal [1], and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 [2] opens, on a multi-annual basis for periods from 1 January to 31 December, a duty-free import tariff quota for the import of 1200 tonnes of dried boneless beef falling within CN code ex02102090 and originating in Switzerland. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences [3] applies to import licences for import tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed provisions on applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. That Regulation provides that import tariff quotas shall be opened for a period of 12 consecutive months and limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004, without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down in that Regulation. As Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 provides that the quota in question is managed on the basis of certificates of authenticity issued by the Swiss authorities and import licences, it is necessary to align the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 on Chapter I and III of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 where appropriate. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
