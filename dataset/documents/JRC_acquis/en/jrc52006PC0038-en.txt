- General context 
Annex A to Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in Article 2(a) of the Regulation. Annex C lists the liquidators referred to in Article 2(b). 
The annexes to Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 were amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 603/2005 of 12 April 2005. 
France notified the Commission on 29 November 2005 of further amendments to the lists set out in Annexes A and C.

3. LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL 
- Summary of the proposed action 
The proposal aims at amending the Annexes of Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 in order to take account of amendments to the domestic insolvency law of Member States. 
- Legal basis 
The proposal is based on Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000. 
- Subsidiarity principle 
The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. 
- Proportionality principle 
The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reasons: 
The Commission Proposal replaces the lists for France in Annexes A and C to Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 with new lists taking into account the information notified by France. 
The Regulation is directly applicable in the Member States and it does not require any implementation measures. It is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, therefore its contents are accessible to all interested parties. 
- Choice of instruments 
The proposed instrument is a regulation. 
Other means would not be adequate for the following reasons: 
By virtue of Article 45 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000, the Annexes to the Regulation can only be amended by the Council on the initiative of Member States or on a proposal by the Commission. This shared initiative was possible for the five-year period following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty (ART. 67(1) EC), however since the entry into force of the Nice Treaty (ART. 67(2) EC), the initiative belongs to the Commission only. Therefore it is up to the Commission to propose to the Council amendments to the Annexes to the Regulation according to Article 45 of the Regulation. 
4. BUDGET IMPLICATIONS 
The proposal has no budgetary implications. 
5. SIMPLIFICATION 
The proposal provides for simplification of administrative procedures for public authorities (EU or national), simplification of administrative procedures for public private parties. 
Courts of the Member States will be informed timeously about insolvency proceedings that are to be recognised. 
Creditors, debtors and insolvency practitioners will be informed about insolvency proceedings under the scope of the Regulation.
