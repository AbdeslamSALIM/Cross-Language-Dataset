Discussions with representatives of Member States are also necessary in order to define the categories of aid which might be considered compatible with the Treaty. In order to proceed with the current consultations and the analysis of their results, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Regulations (EC) No 2204/2002, (EC) No 70/20012 and (EC) No 68/2001 until the end of 2007. 
(3) Regulations (EC) No 2204/2002, (EC) No 68/2001 and (EC) No 70/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
