Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems originating in Japan 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal This proposal concerns the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2117/2005 ("the basic Regulation") and aims at including television camera systems in an Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. This annex contains a list of television camera systems which, although falling in the product description, cannot be regarded as broadcast camera systems and therefore have to be exempted from the anti-dumping duty. | 
120 | General context This proposal is made in the context of the implementation of the basic Regulation and is the result of an investigation which was carried out in line with the substantive and procedural requirements laid out in the basic Regulation. | 
139 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal There are no existing provisions in the area of the proposal. | 
141 | Consistency with other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | 
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | 
Consultation of interested parties | 
219 | Interested parties concerned by the proceeding have already had the possibility to defend their interests during the investigation, in line with the provisions of the basic Regulation. | 
Collection and use of expertise | 
229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 
230 | Impact assessment This proposal is the result of the implementation of the basic Regulation. The basic Regulation does not foresee a general impact assessment but contains an exhaustive list of conditions that have to be assessed. | 
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 
305 | Summary of the proposed action The Commission received requests from two Japanese exporting producers of television camera systems to add certain models of professional camera systems and their accessories to the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus exempt them from the application of the duty. All models concerned were considered as professional camera systems which should be exempted from the application of the duty. It is therefore proposed to exempt all models exported by Hitachi and Matsushita under Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and consequently add them to the Annex. It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached proposal for a Regulation. | 
310 | Legal basis Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2117/2005 of 21 December 2005. | 
329 | Subsidiarity principle The proposal falls under the exclusive competence of the Community. The subsidiarity principle therefore does not apply. | 
Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s). | 
331 | The form of action is described in the above-mentioned basic Regulation and leaves no scope for national decision. | 
332 | Indication of how financial and administrative burden falling upon the Community, national governments, regional and local authorities, economic operators and citizens is minimized and proportionate to the objective of the proposal is not applicable. | 
Choice of instruments | 
341 | Proposed instruments: regulation. | 
342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). The above-mentioned basic Regulation does not foresee alternative options. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 
409 | The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. | 
1. Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems originating in Japan 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community[1], (’the basic Regulation’), 
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, 
Whereas: 
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURES 
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94[2], imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems (’TCS’) originating in Japan. 
(2) In September 2000, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000[3], confirmed the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 (as subsequently amended) pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation. 
(3) In Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000, the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty camera systems listed in the Annex to that Regulation (’the Annex’), representing high-end professional camera systems technically falling within the product definition under Article 1(2) of that Regulation, but which cannot be regarded as television camera systems. 
(4) The Commission, by notice of 29 September 2005[4], initiated a review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation concerning the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of TCS originating in Japan. 
B. INVESTIGATION CONCERNING NEW MODELS OF PROFESSIONAL CAMERA SYSTEMS 
1. PROCEDURE 
(5) Two Japanese exporting producers, Matsushita and Hitachi Denshi (Europa) GmbH (‘Hitachi’) informed the Commission that they intended to introduce new models of professional camera systems into the Community market and requested the Commission to add these new models of professional camera systems and their accessories to the Annex of Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus exempt them from the scope of the anti-dumping duties. 
(6) The Commission informed the Community industry accordingly and commenced an investigation limited to the determination of whether the products under consideration fall within the scope of the anti-dumping duties and whether the operative part of Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly. 
2. MODELS UNDER INVESTIGATION 
(7) The requests for exemption were received for the following models of camera systems, supplied with the relevant technical information: 
Matsushita: 
- Camera head AK-HC910L; 
- Camera head AK-HC1500G; 
- Camera control unit AK-HRP900; 
- Camera control unit AK-HRP150. 
All models were presented as successors of models already excluded from the anti-dumping measures in force. 
Hitachi: 
- Camera head DK-H31; 
- Remote Control Panel RU-3300N. 
Both models were presented as models closely resembling models already excluded from the anti-dumping measures in force. They are not offered in combination with a triax system or triax adaptor and they are used for camera surveillance and teleconferencing as well as in laboratories and libraries. 
3. FINDINGS 
2. Camera heads AK-HC910L and AK-HC1500G, camera control units AK-HRP900 and AK-HRP150 
(8) The camera heads AK-HC910L and AK-HC1500G and camera control units AK-HRP900 and AK-HRP150 fall within the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. However, they are mainly used for professional applications and were found to be professional camera systems within the meaning of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. They should therefore be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. 
(9) In accordance with the established Community institutions' practice, these television camera systems should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore, all imports of the following cameras imported on or after 5th September 2005 should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from this date: 
Matsushita: 
- Camera head AK-HC910L; 
- Camera head AK-HC1500G; 
- Camera control unit AK-HRP900; 
- Camera control unit AK-HRP150. 
- Camera heads DK-H31 and remote control panel RU-3300N 
(10) Camera head DK-H31 and remote control panel RU-3300N fall within the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. However, they are mainly used for professional applications and are not sold with the corresponding triax system or adaptor on the Community market. Therefore, it was concluded that they should be regarded as professional camera systems within the meaning of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. As a result, they should be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. 
(11) In accordance with the established Community institutions' practice, these television camera systems should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore, all imports of the following cameras imported on or after 3rd November 2005 should be exempted from the anti-dumping duty from this date: 
Hitachi: 
- Camera head DK-H31; 
- Remote control panel RU-3300N. 
4. INFORMATION OF THE INTERESTED PARTIES AND CONCLUSIONS 
(12) The Commission informed the Community industry and the exporters of the TCS of its findings and provided them with an opportunity to present their views. None of the parties objected to the Commission's findings. 
(13) On the basis of the above, Council Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly,
