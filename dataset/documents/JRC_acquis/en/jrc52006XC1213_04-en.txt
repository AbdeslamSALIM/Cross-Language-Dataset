Objective of aid | Aid to SMEs | Yes This R%amp%D project is developing knowledge and technology in the field of reinforced fibre composites in an industrial heat exchanger. The research will focus on the technical and operational requirements for heat exchangers under various operating conditions. The key issue is the fall in temperature and pressure in the chemical composition of the medium to be cooled. These requirements guide research into suitable composites, fibre technology, detailed design and structural design. Since this is a non-uniform material — owing to the application of fibres — and injection moulding is under consideration, the interaction between matierals, structural design and manufacturing method plays a major — but still unknown — role. The material's chemical resistance, anti-fouling properties and lifetime are unknown. The direction and density of the fibres determine heat conduction and transfer. This is a new advantage for metal heat exchangers, but it is also a complicating factor. It plays no role in the current generation of metal heat exchangers. They, moreover, can be assembled by conventional methods. This is also an unknown factor with reinforced fibre composites. The project involves R%amp%D staff from a number of parties. They include materials scientists, injection moulders, chemists and process experts. The ECN research institute is taking part at its own risk and expense; it is providing scientific knowledge and is responsible for designing the heat exchanger |

Objective of aid | Aid to SMEs | Yes This R%amp%D project is developing knowledge and technology in the field of composite materials and structures for application in the construction sector. Current knowledge and technology in the field of composites often relate to high-end applications. Other applications pose different operational requirements, making equipment, resin and fibre technologies too costly in relation to the technical specifications. This R%amp%D project is aimed at developing knowledge and technology in the field of composite materials and structures for use by architects and builders. The structures in question are load-bearing. This requirement underpins the requisite R%amp%D. Knowledge will be researched and tested in a range of practical settings. There is little or no know-how and experience among customers and producers in the field of building structures. Research must produce technical requirements and specifications for the development of certifiable structures. Achieving this would open the way for the application of composite structures in building. This is still some way off. This project is aimed at bringing application one step closer. TNO Bouw is taking part in the project at its own expense and risk. It is providing scientific know-how and is involved in the testing and certification of the materials |

Objective of aid | Aid to SMEs | Yes This R%amp%D project is developing knowledge and technology in the field of automated crowd-control systems. The combination of various new sensor and data-processing technologies is intended to ensure that offenders in a public area can automatically be reliably identified among thousands of individuals. The project involves the industrial development of optical and acoustic sensors and automatic online data acquisition, data processing and still-to-be-developed security technologies. A test set-up is being developed, and data acquisition will be conducted in a realistic practical environment. This data acquisition and processing are intended to provide the requisite knowledge for detailed R%amp%D at component and system levels. The TNO research institute is developing sensors and data-acquisition and –processing technologies and providing scientific know-how. TNO is responsible for laboratory testing of the system and for testing subsystems in the practical environment. ADO Den Haag is providing knowledge of operating conditions, and other firms involved are developing security technologies |
