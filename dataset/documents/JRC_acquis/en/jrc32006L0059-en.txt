Commission Directive 2006/59/EC 
of 28 June 2006 
amending Annexes to Council Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for carbaryl, deltamethrin, endosulfan, fenithrothion, methidathion and oxamyl 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables [1], and in particular Article 5 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals [2], and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin [3], and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables [4], and in particular Article 7 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market [5], and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In the case of cereals and products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables, residue levels reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides necessary to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is as low as is practicable and toxicologically acceptable, having regard, in particular to the protection of the environment and the estimated dietary intake of consumers. In the case of foodstuffs of animal origin, residue levels reflect the consumption by animals of cereals and products of plant origin treated with pesticides and, where relevant, the direct consequences of the use of veterinary medicines. Community maximum residue levels (MRLs) represent the upper limit of the amount of such residues that might be expected to be found in commodities when good agricultural practices have been respected. 
(2) MRLs for pesticides are kept under review and changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported by the necessary data. 
(3) The Commission was informed that for several pesticides current MRLs may need to be revised in the light of the availability of new information on the toxicology and consumer intake. The Commission has asked the relevant rapporteur Member States to make proposals for the review of Community MRLs. Such proposals were submitted to the Commission. 
(4) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to the pesticides referred to in this Directive via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation [6]. On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure. 
(5) Where relevant, the acute exposure of consumers to those pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. It is concluded that the presence of pesticide residues at or below the new MRLs will not cause acute toxic effects. 
(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Communityâ€™s trading partners have been consulted about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels have been taken into account. 
(7) The Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. 
They shall apply those provisions from 30 December 2006, except the provisions for oxamyl which shall apply from 30 December 2007. 
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made.
