amending Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 laying down certain rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [1], and in particular Article 53 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with Article 37(1)(e)(ii) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 [2], third countries may use, as optional particulars, additional traditional terms listed in Annex III to that Regulation, provided the conditions laid down in that Article are fulfilled. 
(2) South Africa has requested to be able to use on the Community market the terms "ruby", "tawny" and "vintage". These terms, which are identical to Community additional traditional terms listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 753/2002, are used for fortified wines, are regulated in South Africa and have been traditionally used for more than 10 years in the territory of that country. As these terms are strictly defined in an equivalent way as they are for certain Community wines and are used on labels indicating the true place of origin of the wines in question, they are not, therefore, used in a manner so as to mislead consumers. Accordingly, their use should be permitted on the Community market. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 should therefore, be amended accordingly. 
(4) The Management Committee for Wine has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its Chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 is amended as follows: 
1. the part of Annex III referring to Portugal is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation; 
2. Annex IX is replaced by Annex II to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
