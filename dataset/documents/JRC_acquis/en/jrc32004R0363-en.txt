Commission Regulation (EC) No 363/2004 
of 25 February 2004 
amending Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to training aid 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 994/98 of 7 May 1998 on the application of Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty establishing the European Community to certain categories of horizontal State aid(1) and in particular point (a)(iv) of Article 1(1) thereof, 
Having published a draft of this Regulation(2), 
Having consulted the Advisory Committee on State Aid, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 68/2001(3) provides for special conditions in respect of aid to be granted for small and medium-sized enterprises. The definition of small and medium-sized enterprises in Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 is that used in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises(4). That Recommendation has been replaced by Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises(5) with effect from 1 January 2005. In the interests of legal certainty, the definition used in Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 should be the same as that used in Commission Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid to small and medium-sized enterprises(6). 
(2) Experience has shown that it is desirable to have a unified and simplified reporting system of annual reports adopted pursuant to Article 27 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty(7). The specific reporting provisions laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 should therefore only apply until such time as a general reporting system has been adopted. 
(3) It is necessary to lay down provisions for the assessment of the compatibility with the common market of any training aid granted without prior authorisation of the Commission before the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 68/2001. 
(4) Regulation (EC) No 68/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly,
