Proof of origin : 
The inspection and certification procedures comprise the factors proving that the product originates in the area. 
The milk will come exclusively from livestock farms listed in the Regulatory Council's register of livestock farms. The natural and salted butter will be produced and packaged exclusively in establishments listed in the register of milk plants. The sweet butter will be produced and packaged exclusively in establishments listed in the Regulatory Council's register of pastry plants. 
The livestock farms, milk plants and pastry product plants will have to undergo an initial assessment with a view to registration, and periodic follow-up assessments in order to remain in the register concerned. 
Only butter which has passed all the procedural checks will be placed on the market with a guarantee of origin endorsed by the Regulatory Council's label. 
The number of labels or back labels supplied by the Regulatory Council to the milk plants will depend on the quantities of milk delivered to them; those supplied to pastry plants will depend on the quantities of natural butter acquired. 
The Regulatory Council will check the method used by the livestock farms to produce and preserve the milk; it will inspect the method of production used at the milk and pastry plants, check documentation, stocks, sampling and product testing. 
The Regulatory Council will, where appropriate, apply the penalties regime provided for in its rules should any infringements be detected. 
Method of production Production of milk in the livestock holdings 
The milk will come from Friesian or Pardo-Alpina breeds of milk cow or cross-breeds between the two. 
The livestock holdings will have to have a milk refrigeration tank with sufficient capacity to store the milk produced for two days until it is collected. It will be stored at a temperature below or equal to 5 °C. The period between milking and collection will not exceed two days. During transportation to the milk plants, the temperature of the milk will not be allowed to exceed 9 °C. 
Production of %quot%natural%quot% Mantequilla de Soria 
In the milk plant, the milk will undergo heat treatment using a plate heat exchanger, followed by centrifugation to skim and clean it. 
The cream will be obtained at a temperature of 30 to 40 °C and have to have a fat content of 38 to 45 %, and an acidity of less than 13° Dornic. It will be pasteurised and cooled so that it reaches the maturation tank at a temperature of 12 to 15 °C. A mixture of the lactic cultures Lactococcus lactis lactis, L. lactis cremoris and L. lactis lactis diacetylactis will be added to the tank. Maturation will take place over 12 to 15 hours, at a temperature of 12 to 15 °C, with the cultures added 3-4 hours after commencement of the ripening process. Once the cream reaches an acidity of 18 to 28° Dornic, it will be cooled down to slow the ripening process. From there, the cream will be taken to the churn and churned for two to three hours. The amount placed in the churn will constitute approximately 40 % of the churn's capacity, in order to promote homogenisation. The whey will be removed by gravity, the fat will then be washed twice using drinking water, and there will be a process of draining the whey and churning. The fat will then be kneaded slowly for 60 to 120 minutes in a non-continuous butter churn until the butter is formed. From there, it will go to the packing plant where it will be shaped using different nozzles. It will be packaged in the plant itself, in the containers in which it is to be marketed. 
Production of %quot%salted%quot% Mantequilla de Soria 
Production of the salted butter will involve the same steps as for the natural butter, except that, when kneading begins, there is a final addition of up to 2.5 % m/m of salt. Similarly, it will be packaged in the plant itself. 
Production of %quot%sweet%quot% Mantequilla de Soria 
A water and sucrose mixture will be prepared and boiled until syrup is obtained. It will then be mixed together with %quot%natural%quot% butter by churning, and packed in the plant itself. The packaging will be stiff and open at the top, and the visible surface will be garnished with sweet butter previously coloured with beta-carotene or cochineal extract. The garnish will not exceed 15 % of the contents. 
Link Historical/literary 
There are numerous literary references, some of which have been found in Soria's public library: 
%quot%SORIA. 1845-1850%quot% (facsimile edition) by PASCUAL MADOZ. 
This is a dictionary containing geographical, statistical and historical information about the province of Soria. It mentions the land and villages which together made up the Valle de Tera, a valley where the dairy herd was concentrated and where the butter was produced. Page 203 states that the %quot%the manufacturing industry outside the workshops and factories in the main towns .. is limited to the production of cow's butter%quot%. Page 268 goes on to mention the %quot%production of the delicious and renowned Soria butter%quot% . 
%quot%EL NOTICIERO DE SORIA%quot%OF 25 OCTOBER 1899 
This newspaper carries an advertisement announcing that Silvino Paniagua's pastry shop %quot%La Azucena%quot% will be producing butter. The shop is stated as being a purveyor to the royal household and as having won a prize for butter production at the Logroño Regional Fair. 
%quot%NOMENCLATOR HISTÓRICO, GEOGRÁFICO, ESTADÍSTICO Y DESCRIPTIVO DE LA PROVINCIA DE SORIA%quot% (1909) BY MANUEL BLASCO JIMÉMENZ 
This describes the characteristics of Soria's villages. The chapter on Valdeavellano de Tera again mentions butter from Soria: %quot%because the renowned Soria butter, which is still delicious, is made from its milk%quot%. 
%quot%LA REGIÓN DE EL VALLE%quot%, BY ANASTASIO GONZÁLEZ GÓMEZ (LAS HERAS PRINTING PRESS, 1931) 
Pages 29, 30 and 31 detail the process for producing the butter and the equipment used, referring to the jargon or terminology specific to the region of El Valle. The only date mentioned is 1910, in connection with the Soria Dairy Cooperative Society and the latter's developing more modern production processes at its Valdeavellano butter production plant. 
%quot%MANTEQUILLA DE SORIA%quot%, BY PEDRO J. IGLESIA HERNÁNDEZ (CELTIBERIA No 14, CENTRO DE ESTUDIOS SORIANOS 1957) 
This work deals specifically with butter from Soria, in the context of the first National Bromatology Congress. It refers to Soria butter as one of the things for which Soria was famous not only in Spain, but also in Latin America via emigrants from the province. 
Natural 
The characteristics of butter from Soria are linked to the fact that it is made from the milk of cows whose food comes from an area with a high average altitude (1026 metres above sea level). Soria is thus one of the provinces with the highest average altitudes and most rugged terrains in the meseta. This, together with the extremely harsh weather conditions, produces a distinctive livestock diet: the toughness and dryness of the pasture, alongside the characteristic flora, give the milk specific qualities which are passed on to the butter. 
Human and production factors 
In the past, natural butter was produced by using a manzadero [wooden tube where milk was beaten]; it is now produced using a non-continuous churning cylinder. Both systems involve the binding together of fat globules. In the case of the manzadero, the globules were beaten by hand with a piston-like action until they fused. The non-continuous churning cylinder used nowadays produces a similar effect through the pressure created by the churn's movement. Also distinctive is the fact that lactic cultures are not added until 3 or 4 hours after ripening commences. For its part, the syrup of the sweet variety is prepared in accordance with the old recipes, and the product is presented in a way which retains the aesthetic appearance and shapes of the past.
