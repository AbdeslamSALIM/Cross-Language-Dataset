B. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR HEADLAMPS [7] 
5. GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS 
5.1. Each sample shall conform to the specifications set forth in paragraphs 6 to 8 below. 
5.2. Headlamps shall be so made as to retain their prescribed photometric characteristics and to remain in good working order when in normal use, in spite of the vibrations to which they may be subjected. 
5.2.1. Headlamps shall be fitted with a device enabling them to be so adjusted on the vehicles as to comply with the rules applicable to them. Such a device may or may not provide horizontal adjustment, provided that the headlamps are so designed that they can maintain a proper horizontal aiming even after the vertical aiming adjustment. Such a device need not be fitted on units in which the reflector and the diffusing lens cannot be separated, provided the use of such units is confined to vehicles on which the headlamp setting can be adjusted by other means. 
Where a headlamp providing a passing beam and a headlamp providing a driving beam, each equipped with its own filament lamp, are assembled to form a composite unit the adjusting device shall enable each optical system individually to be duly adjusted. 
5.2.2. However, these provisions shall not apply to headlamp assemblies whose reflectors are indivisible. For this type of assembly the requirements of paragraph 6.3 of this Regulation apply. 
5.3. The headlamp shall be equipped with filament lamp(s) approved according to Regulation No 37. Any Regulation No 37 filament lamp may be used, provided that: 
(a) no restriction on the application is made in the table of contents of that Regulation; 
(b) for Class A and B, its reference luminous flux for dipped-beam does not exceed 600 mm; 
(c) for Class C and D, its objective luminous flux for dipped-beam does not exceed 2000 mm. 
5.4. The components by which a filament lamp is fixed to the reflector shall be so made that, even in darkness, the filament lamp can be fixed in no position but the correct one [8]. 
5.5. The filament lamp holder shall conform to the characteristics given in IEC Publication 61-2, third edition, 1969. The holder data sheet relevant to the category of filament lamp used, applies. 
5.6. In addition, Class B or C or D headlamps shall be complementary tested according to the requirements of annex 4 to ensure that in use there is no excessive change in photometric performance. 
5.7. If the lens of a Class B or C or D headlamp is of plastic material, tests shall be done according to the requirements of annex 6. 
5.8. On headlamps designed to provide alternately a driving beam and a passing beam, any mechanical, electromechanical or other device incorporated in the headlamp for switching from one beam to the other shall be so constructed that: 
5.8.1. the device is strong enough to withstand 50000 operations without suffering damage despite the vibrations to which it may be subjected in normal use; 
5.8.2. in the case of failure it shall automatically obtain the passing beam position; 
5.8.3. either the passing beam or the driving beam shall always be obtained without any possibility of the mechanism stopping in between the two positions; 
5.8.4. the user cannot, with ordinary tools, change the shape or position of the moving parts. 
6. ILLUMINATION 
6.1. General provisions 
6.1.1. Headlamps shall be so made that they give adequate illumination without dazzle when emitting the passing beam, and good illumination when emitting a driving beam. 
6.1.2. The illumination produced by the headlamp shall be determined by means of a vertical screen set up 25 m forward of the headlamp and at right angles to its axes as shown in annex 3 to this Regulation. 
6.1.3. Headlamps shall be checked by means of an uncoloured standard (étalon) filament lamp designed for a rated voltage as indicated in the relevant data sheet of Regulation No 37. During the checking of the headlamp, the voltage at the terminals of the filament lamp shall be regulated so as to obtain the reference luminous flux as indicated at the relevant data sheet of Regulation No 37. 
6.1.4. The headlamp shall be considered acceptable if it meets the requirements of this paragraph 6 with at least one standard (étalon) filament lamp, which may be submitted with the headlamp. 
6.2. Provisions concerning passing beams 
6.2.1. The passing beam must produce a sufficiently sharp "cut-off" to permit a satisfactory adjustment with its aid. The "cut-off" must be substantially horizontal and as straight as possible over a horizontal length of at least ± 3° for Class A, C and D headlamps and at least ± 5° for Class B headlamps. 
6.2.2. The headlamp shall be so aimed that: 
6.2.2.1. laterally, the beam is as symmetrical as possible with the reference to line V-V, except for Class A or B headlamps that have no mechanism to adjust horizontal aim. Such headlamps shall be aligned so that they are in the same attitude as on the vehicle; 
6.2.2.2. vertically, the headlamp shall be so aimed that the "cut-off" is situated 250 mm below the line H-H. It shall be as horizontal as possible. 
6.2.3. When so aimed, the headlamp need, if its approval is sought solely for provision of a passing beam [9], comply only with the requirements set out in paragraphs 6.2.5 to 6.2.6 below; if it is intended to provide both a passing beam and a driving beam, it shall comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 6.2.5, 6.2.6 and 6.3. 
6.2.4. Where a headlamp so aimed does not meet the requirements set out in paragraphs 6.2.5, 6.2.6 and 6.3, its alignment may be changed, except for headlamps that have no mechanism to adjust horizontal aim, on condition that the axis of the beam is not displaced laterally by more than 1 degree (= 44 cm) to the right or left [10]. To facilitate alignment by means of the "cut-off", the headlamp may be partially occulted in order to sharpen the "cut-off". However, the "cut-off" should not extend beyond the line H-H. 
6.2.5. The illumination produced by the passing beam on the screens in annex 3 shall meet the following illumination requirements:

6.3.2.1. The point of intersection (HV) of lines H-H and V-V shall be situated within the isolux 80 per cent of maximum illumination. This maximum value (EM) shall not be less than 32 lux for Class B or C headlamps and 51.2 lux for Class D headlamps. The maximum value shall in no circumstances exceed 240 lux in the case of Class B headlamps and 180 lux in the case of Class C and D headlamps. 
6.3.2.1.1. The maximum intensity (IM) of the driving beam expressed in thousands of candelas shall be calculated by the formula: 
6.3.2.1.2. The reference mark (I′M) of this maximum intensity, referred to in paragraph 4.2.2.6 above, shall be obtained by the ratio: 
This value shall be rounded off to the value 7,5 — 10 — 12,5 — 17,5 — 20 — 25 — 27,5 — 30 — 37,5 — 40 — 45 — 50.

In the case of a Class C and D headlamp, the intensities shall conform to the tables A or B in annex 3. Table A applies in the case where a primary driving beam is being produced with a single light source. Table B applies in the case where the driving beam is being produced by a secondary driving beam headlamp operated with a harmonized passing beam headlamp or a primary driving beam headlamp. 
6.4. In the case of headlamps with an adjustable reflector, additional tests shall be made after the reflector has been moved vertically ±2 degrees or at least into the maximum position, if less than 2 degrees, from its initial position by means of the headlamp adjusting device. The whole headlamp shall then be re-positioned (for example by means of the goniometer) by moving it through the same number of degrees in the opposite direction to the movement of the reflector. The following measurements shall be made and the points shall be within the required limits: 
passing beam : points HV and 0.86D-V

Passing beam only: 0,50U/1,5L &amp; 1,5R and 0,86D/V 
1.2.1.3. Measuring equipment 
The measuring equipment shall be equivalent to that used during headlamp approval tests. A standard (étalon) filament lamp shall be used for the photometric verification. 
2. TEST FOR CHANGE IN VERTICAL POSITION OF THE CUT-OFF LINE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HEAT 
This test consists of verifying that the vertical drift of the cut-off line under the influence of heat does not exceed a specified value for an operating passing lamp. 
The headlamp tested in accordance with paragraph 1, shall be subjected to the test described in 2.1, without being removed from or readjusted in relation to its test fixture. 
2.1. Test 
The test shall be carried out in a dry and still atmosphere at an ambient temperature of 23 °C ±5 °C. 
Using a mass production filament lamp which has been aged for at least one hour the headlamp shall be operated on passing beam without being dismounted from or readjusted in relation to its test fixture. (For the purpose of this test, the voltage shall be adjusted as specified in paragraph 1.1.1.2). The position of the cut-off line in its horizontal part (between the vertical lines passing through point 50 L and 50 R for Class B headlamp, 3,5 L and 3,5 R for Class C and D headlamp) shall be verified 3 minutes (r3) and 60 minutes (r60) respectively after operation. 
The measurement of the variation in the cut-off line position as described above shall be carried out by any method giving acceptable accuracy and reproducible results. 
2.2. Test results 
2.2.1. The result in milliradians (mrad) shall be considered as acceptable for a passing lamp, only when the absolute value ΔrI = |r3 – r60| recorded on the headlamp is not more than 1,0 mrad (ΔrI ≤ 1,0 mrad). 
2.2.2. However, if this value is more than 1,0 mrad but not more than 1,5 mrad (1,0 mrad &lt; ΔrI ≤ 1,5 mrad) a second headlamp shall be tested as described in paragraph 2.1 after being subjected three consecutive times to the cycle as described below, in order to stabilize the position of mechanical parts of the headlamp on a base representative of the correct installation on the vehicle: 
Operation of the passing beam for one hour (the voltage shall be adjusted as specified in paragraph 1.1.1.2), 
Period of rest for one hour. 
The headlamp type shall be considered as acceptable if the mean value of the absolute values ΔrI measured on the first sample and ΔrII measured on the second sample is not more than 1,0 mrad. 
[1] For the test schedule see annex 8 to this Regulation. 
[2] When the tested headlamp includes signalling lamps, the latter shall be lit for the duration of the test. In the case of a direction indicator lamp, it shall be lit in flashing mode with an on/off time of approximately one to one. 
[3] Should two or more lamp filaments be simultaneously lit when headlamp flashing is used, this shall not be considered as being normal use of the filaments simultaneously. 
[4] NaCMC represents the sodium salt of carboxymethylcellulose, customarily referred to as CMC. The NaCMC used in the dirt mixture shall have a degree of substitution (DS) of 0,6-0,7 and a viscosity of 200-300 cP for a 2 per cent solution at 20 °C. 
[5] The tolerance on quantity is due to the necessity of obtaining a dirt that correctly spreads out on all the plastic lens.

APPENDIX 2 
METHOD OF MEASUREMENT OF THE DIFFUSION AND TRANSMISSION OF LIGHT 
1. EQUIPMENT (see figure) 
The beam of a collimator K with a half divergence β/2 = 17,4 × 104 rd is limited by a diaphragm Dτ with an opening of 6 mm against which the sample stand is placed. 
A convergent achromatic lens L2, corrected for spherical aberrations links the diaphragm Dτ with the receiver R; the diameter of the lens L2 shall be such that it does not diaphragm the light diffused by the sample in a cone with a half top angle of β/2 = 14°. 
An annular diaphragm DD, with angles αo/2 = 1° and αmax/2 = 12° is placed in an image focal plane of the lens L2. 
The non-transparent central part of the diaphragm is necessary in order to eliminate the light arriving directly from the light source. It shall be possible to remove the central part of the diaphragm from the light beam in such a manner that it returns exactly to its original position. 
The distance L2 Dτ and the focal length F2 [1] of the lens L2 shall be so chosen that the image of Dτ completely covers the receiver R. 
When the initial incident flux is referred to 1000 units, the absolute precision of each reading shall be better than 1 unit. 
2. MEASUREMENTS 
The following readings shall be taken: 
Reading | With sample | With central part of DD | Quantity represented | 
T1 | no | no | Incident flux in initial reading | 
T2 | yes (before test) | no | Flux transmitted by the new material in a field of 24° | 
T3 | yes (after test) | no | Flux transmitted by the tested material in a field of 24° | 
T4 | yes (before test) | yes | Flux diffused by the new material | 
T5 | yes (after test) | yes | Flux diffused by the tested material | 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
[1] For L2 it is recommended to use a focal distance of about 80 mm.

APPENDIX 3 
SPRAY TESTING METHOD 
1. TEST EQUIPMENT 
1.1. Spray gun 
The spray gun used shall be equipped with a nozzle 1,3 mm in diameter allowing a liquid flow rate of 0,24 ±0,02 l/minute at an operating pressure of 6,0 bars – 0, +0,5 bar. 
Under these operation conditions the fan pattern obtained shall be 170 mm ±50 mm in diameter on the surface exposed to deterioration, at a distance of 380 mm ±10 mm from the nozzle. 
1.2. Test mixture 
The test mixture shall be composed of: 
Silica sand of hardness 7 on the Mohr scale, with a grain size between 0 and 0,2 mm and an almost normal distribution, with an angular factor of 1,8 to 2; 
Water of hardness not exceeding 205 g/m3 for a mixture comprising 25 g of sand per litre of water. 
2. TEST 
The outer surface of the lamp lenses shall be subjected once or more than once to the action of the sand jet produced as described above. The jet shall be sprayed almost perpendicular to the surface to be tested. 
The deterioration shall be checked by means of one or more samples of glass placed as a reference near the lenses to be tested. The mixture shall be sprayed until the variation in the diffusion of light on the sample or samples measured by the method described in appendix 2, is such that: 
Several reference samples may be used to check that the whole surface to be tested has deteriorated homogeneously.

APPENDIX 4 
ADHESIVE TAPE ADHERENCE TEST 
1. PURPOSE 
This method allows to determine under standard conditions the linear force of adhesion of an adhesive tape to a glass plate. 
2. PRINCIPLE 
Measurement of the force necessary to unstick an adhesive tape from a glass plate at an angle of 90°. 
3. SPECIFIED ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS 
The ambient conditions shall be at 23 °C ±5 °C and 65 ±15 per cent RH. 
4. TEST PIECES 
Before the test, the sample roll of adhesive tape shall be conditioned for 24 hours in the specified atmosphere (see para. 3 above). 
Five test pieces each 400 mm long shall be tested from each roll. These test pieces shall be taken from the roll after the first three turns were discarded. 
5. PROCEDURE 
The test shall be under the ambient conditions specified in paragraph 3. 
Take the five test pieces while unrolling the tape radially at a speed of approximately 300 mm/s, then apply them within 15 seconds in the following manner: 
Apply the tape to the glass plate progressively with a slight length-wise rubbing movement of the finger, without excessive pressure, in such a manner as to leave no air bubble between the tape and the glass plate. 
Leave the assembly in the specified atmospheric conditions for 10 minutes. 
Unstick about 25 mm of the test piece from the plate in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the test piece. Fix the plate and fold back the free end of the tape at 90°. Apply force in such a manner that the separation line between the tape and the plate is perpendicular to this force and perpendicular to the plate. 
Pull to unstick at a speed of 300 mm/s ±30 mm/s and record the force required. 
6. RESULTS 
The five values obtained shall be arranged in order and the median value taken as a result of the measurement. This value shall be expressed in Newtons per centimetre of width of the tape.
