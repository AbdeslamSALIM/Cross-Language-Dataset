Whereas Article 149 (1) of the 1994 Act of Accession provides for a period during which transitional measures may be adopted to facilitate the transition from the regime existing in Austria, Finland and Sweden at the time of Accession to those resulting from the application of the common organization of the market under the conditions set out in the said Act and, in particular, to overcome the serious difficulties in applying the new regime from the date laid down; whereas that period expires on 31 December 1997;
