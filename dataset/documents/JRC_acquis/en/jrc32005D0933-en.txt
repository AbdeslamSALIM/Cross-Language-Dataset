Commission Decision 
of 21 December 2005 
amending for the second time Decision 2005/693/EC concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in Russia 
(notified under document number C(2005) 5563) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2005/933/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [1], and in particular Article 18(7) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [2], and in particular Article 22 (6) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. 
(2) Commission Decision 2005/693/EC of 6 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to avian influenza in Russia [3] was adopted following outbreaks of avian influenza in Russia. That Decision suspends the importation of birds, other than poultry, from Russia and of unprocessed feathers and unprocessed parts of feathers from those regions of Russia listed in Annex I to that Decision. 
(3) Outbreaks of avian influenza continue to occur in certain parts of Russia and it is therefore necessary to prolong the measures provided for in Decision 2005/693/EC. The Decision can however be reviewed before this date depending on information supplied by the competent veterinary authorities of Russia. 
(4) The outbreaks in the European part of Russia have all occurred in the central area and no outbreaks have occurred in the northern regions. It is therefore no longer necessary to continue the suspension of imports of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers from the latter. 
(5) Decision 2005/693/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
