s1 s1a s1b s2 s3 MOUNTING AND FIXING CONDITIONS AND DEFINITIONS OF TEST PARAMETERS REGARDING ELECTRIC CABLES (AS MENTIONED IN FOOTNOTE (5) OF TABLE 4) 
1. Mounting and fixing conditions 
1.1. Mounting of the test sample general for classes B1ca, B2ca, Cca and Dca 
The cables shall be mounted on the front of a standard ladder (EN 50266-1). Lengths of 3,5 m of cables shall be used. The lower part of the electric cables shall be 20 cm under the lower edge of the burner. The cables shall be positioned in the middle of the ladder (with respect to its width). 
Each test piece or bundle shall be attached individually to each rung of the ladder by means of a metal wire (steel or copper). For electric cables up to and including 50 mm diameter, use wire between 0,5 mm and up to and including 1,0 mm in diameter. For cables above 50 mm diameter use wire between 1,0 mm and 1,5 mm in diameter. 
When mounting the test pieces, the first test piece shall be positioned approximately in the centre of the ladder and further test pieces shall be added on either side so that the whole array of test pieces is approximately centred on the ladder. 
The spacing and bundling is explained further below. 
At each height of 25 cm a horizontal line shall be drawn in order to measure the flame spread as a function of time. The first line (i.e. zero line) shall be at the same height as the burner. 
The cables shall be mounted as follows depending on the classification that is applied for. 
1.1.1. Class B2ca, Cca and class Dca 
The selected mounting procedure depends on the electric cable diameter according to Table 4.1. 
Table 4.1 
MOUNTING AS A FUNCTION OF CABLE DIAMETER 
Cable diameter | Mounting | 
Larger than or equal to 20 mm | 20 mm spacing between cables | 
Between 5 and 20 mm | One cable diameter spacing between cables | 
Less than or equal to 5 mm | The cables shall be bundled in bundles of 10 mm diameter. The bundles shall not be twisted. The spacing between bundles shall be 10 mm. | 
The threshold values are determined with the diameter rounded to nearest mm, except for cables with a diameter of less than 5 mm, where the diameter shall not be rounded. 
The following formulae are used for determination of the number of cable lengths per test. 
1.1.1.1. For cables with diameter greater than or equal to 20 mm 
The number of cables, N, is given by: 
N = int300 + 20dc + 20 equation 1 
where: 
dc is the diameter of the cable (in mm and rounded to the nearest mm). 
int function = the integer part of the result (i.e. the value rounded down). 
1.1.1.2. For cables with a diameter greater than 5 mm but less than 20 mm 
The number of cables, N, is given by: 
N = int300 + dc2dc equation 2 
where: 
dc is the diameter of the cable (in mm and rounded). 
int function = the integer part of the result (i.e. the value rounded down). 
1.1.1.3. For cables or wires with a diameter less than or equal to 5 mm 
The number of 10 mm bundles, Nbu, of cables is given by: 
Nbu = int300 + 1020 = 15 equation 3 
Thus 15 bundles with 10 mm distance between the bundles shall be mounted. 
The number of cables in each bundle (n) is: 
n = int100dc2 equation 4 
where: 
dc is the diameter of the cable (in mm and not rounded). 
The number of cable lengths (CL) for wires or cables with a diameter less than 5 mm will hence be: 
CL = n × 15 equation 5 
1.1.1.4. Total length of cable per test 
The total length L (m) per test is: 
L = n × 15 × 3,5 for dc ≤ 5 mm 
or 
L = N × 3,5 for dc %gt% 5 mm equation 6 
1.1.2. Class B1ca 
At the back of the cable tray a non-combustible calcium silicate board shall be mounted with a density 870 ± 50 kg/m3 and a thickness of 11 ± 2 mm. This board can be mounted in two parts. 
In all other aspects the mounting of the cables is identical to class B2ca, Cca and Dca. 
2. Definitions of test parameters
