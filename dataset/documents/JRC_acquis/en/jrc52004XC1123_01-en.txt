Notice of initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain aluminium foil originating in Russia 
(2004/C 285/03) 
The Commission has received a request for a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 [1] (the basic Regulation). 
1. Request for review 
The request was lodged by Open Joint Stock Company Rusal Sayanal (the applicant), an exporter from Russia. 
2. Product 
The product under review is aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0,009 mm and not more than 0,018 mm, not backed, not further worked than rolled, in reels of a width not exceeding 650 mm originating in Russia (the product concerned), normally declared within CN code ex76071110. This CN code is given only for information. 
3. Existing measures 
The measures currently in force are definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 [2] on imports of aluminium foil originating, inter alia, in Russia. 
4. Grounds for the review 
The request pursuant to Article 11(3) is based on the prima facie evidence that the circumstances on the basis of which measures were established have changed and that these changes are of a lasting nature. 
The applicant alleges and provides evidence showing that a comparison of normal value based on its own costs and prices, and export prices to the EU, would lead to a reduction of dumping significantly below the level of the current measures. Therefore, the continued imposition of measures at the existing levels, which were based on the level of dumping previously established, is no longer necessary to offset dumping. 
5. Procedure for the determination of dumping 
Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission hereby initiates a review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as the applicant is concerned. 
The investigation will assess the need for the continuation, removal or amendment of the existing measures in respect of the applicant. 
(a) Questionnaires 
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the applicant and to the authorities of the exporting country concerned. This information and supporting evidence should reach the Commission within the time limit set in point 6(a) of this notice. 
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings 
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known, submit information other than questionnaire replies and to provide supporting evidence. This information and supporting evidence must reach the Commission within the time limit set in paragraph 6(a) of this notice. 
Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard. This request must be made within the time limit set in paragraph 6(b) of this notice. 
6. Time limits 
(a) For parties to make themselves known, to submit questionnaire replies and any other information 
All interested parties, if their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days of the date of publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, unless otherwise specified. Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the aforementioned period. 
(b) Hearings 
All interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40-day time limit. 
7. Written submissions, questionnaire replies and correspondence 
All submissions and requests made by interested parties must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified) and must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax, and/or telex numbers of the interested party. All written submissions, including the information requested in this notice, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis shall be labelled as "Limited" [3] and, in accordance with Article 19(2) of the basic Regulation, shall be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which will be labelled "For inspection by interested parties".

8. Non-cooperation
