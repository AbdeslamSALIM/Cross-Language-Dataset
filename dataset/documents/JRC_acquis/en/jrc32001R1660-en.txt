amending Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Articles 33 and 36 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 58 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1282/2001(4), lays down rules on the remaining quantities to be delivered by producers under their obligations. In the light of experience gained, the time limit should be put back. 
(2) Article 63 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 provides for the introduction of an aid scheme for the distillation of potable alcohol from wine. That scheme was first introduced for the 2000/01 wine year. Changes are required in line with experience gained in the first year of application. In particular, distillation should be opened later in the year and the percentage of production that wine producers can deliver for distillation should be smaller. In addition, a time limit must be set for distillation. 
(3) Articles 86 to 102 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 lay down detailed rules for the disposal of alcohol held by the intervention agencies. Certain material errors should be corrected and in particular the amount to be paid for samples should be adjusted and the tolerance for bio-ethanol involving products requiring rectification should be the same as that for new industrial uses. 
(4) The Management Committee for Wine has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,
