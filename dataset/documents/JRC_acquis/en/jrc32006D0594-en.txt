THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Whereas: 
(1) Pursuant to point (a) of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 the Convergence objective aims at speeding up the convergence of the least developed Member States and regions. 
(2) Pursuant to point (a) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (hereinafter the Funds) contribute towards achieving the objectives referred to in point (a) of Article 3(2) of that Regulation. 
(3) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 the breakdown of the resources available for commitment from the Funds shall be such to achieve a significant concentration on the regions of the Convergence objective. 
(4) Pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 81,54 % of the resources available for commitment from the Funds for the period 2007 to 2013 are to be allocated to the Convergence objective, including 4,99 % for the transitional and specific support referred to in Article 8(1), 23,22 % for the financing referred to in Article 5(2) and 1,29 % for the transitional and specific support referred to in Article 8(3) of that Regulation. 
(5) It is necessary to make indicative breakdowns by Member States of the resources to be allocated to the Convergence objective. Pursuant to Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, this should be done in accordance with the criteria and methodology set out in Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. 
(6) The first and the second points of Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 establish the method for allocating available resources, respectively, to the regions eligible for support from the Convergence objective and to the Member States eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund. 
(7) Points 6(a) and 6(c) of Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 establish the method for determining the allocations under the transitional supports referred to respectively under points 1 and 3 of Article 8 of that Regulation. 
(8) Point 7 of Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 determines the maximum level of transfer from the Funds to each individual Member State. 
(9) Points 12 to 31 of Annex II of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 fix the amounts pertaining to certain specific cases for the period 2007 to 2013. 
(10) Pursuant to Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 0,25 % of the resources available for commitment from the Funds for the period 2007 to 2013 shall be devoted to finance technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission; the indicative allocation by Member States should therefore be exclusive of the amount corresponding to technical assistance,
