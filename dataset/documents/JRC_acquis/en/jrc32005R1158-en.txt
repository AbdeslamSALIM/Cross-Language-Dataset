Regulation (EC) No 1158/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6&amp;nbsp;July 2005 amending Council Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;1165/98 concerning short-term statistics 
Regulation (EC) No 1158/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 6 July 2005 
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 concerning short-term statistics 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285(1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank [1], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 [3] established a common basic framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of Community business statistics for the purpose of the analysis of the economic cycle. 
(2) The implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 effected by Commission Regulations (EC) No 586/2001 [4], (EC) No 588/2001 [5], and (EC) No 606/2001 [6], concerning respectively the definition of Main Industrial Groupings, the definition of variables and the granting of derogations to Member States, has created a body of practical experience that allows measures for further improvements in short-term statistics to be identified. 
(3) In its Action Plan on EMU Statistical Requirements and in subsequent progress reports on the implementation of that plan, the Ecofin Council identified additional fundamental aspects for improving the statistics covered by Regulation (EC) No 1165/98. 
(4) For its monetary policy, the European Central Bank (ECB) needs short-term statistics to be further developed, as is stated in its document ECB Statistical Requirements in the field of General Economic Statistics, and, in particular, it needs timely, reliable and meaningful aggregates for the euro zone. 
(5) The Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom [7], has identified Principal European Economic Indicators (PEEI) that go beyond the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1165/98. 
(6) It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 in areas of particular importance to monetary policy and to the study of the business cycle. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee. 
(8) The implementation of the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment includes the reduction of unnecessary burdens on businesses and the dissemination of new technologies, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Regulation (EC) No 1165/98 shall be amended as follows:

European sample schemes may target the conditions, the level of detail and the deadlines for data transmission."; 
(b) the following subparagraph shall be added: 
"Compulsory surveys shall be used to obtain information that is not already available (within the required timelines) in other sources, such as registers. Surveys shall be performed using electronic questionnaires and web-questionnaires where applicable.";

(a) paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following: 
"3. The quality of the variables shall be tested regularly by comparing them with other statistical information, such comparison to be effected by each Member State and the Commission (Eurostat). In addition they shall be checked for internal consistency."; 
(b) paragraph 4 shall be replaced by the following: 
"4. Quality evaluation shall be carried out comparing the benefits of the availability of the data with the costs of collection and the burden on businesses, especially on small enterprises. For the purpose of this evaluation, Member States shall transmit to the Commission, at its request, the necessary information according to a common European methodology developed by the Commission in close cooperation with the Member States."; 
3. Article 12(1) shall be replaced by the following: 
"1. The Commission, after consulting the Statistical Programme Committee, shall publish by 11 February 2006 an advisory methodological manual which explains the rules set out in the Annexes and also contains guidance concerning short-term statistics.";

It shall report on best practices for lessening the burden on business and shall indicate ways of reducing the burden and costs."; 
5. The following point shall be added to Article 17: 
"(j) the establishment of European sample schemes (Article 4).";
