(2) In order to prevent the spread of the disease and to help eradicate it as quickly as possible, the Community should contribute financially towards the eligible expenditure incurred by the Member State under the emergency measures taken to combat the disease, as provided for in Decision 90/424/EEC. 
(3) Commission Decision 2003/749/EC of 10 October 2003 on the financial contribution from the Community towards the eligible costs of the eradication of avian influenza in Belgium in 2003 [2] granted a financial contribution from the Community to Belgium towards the expenditure incurred under the emergency measures to combat avian influenza implemented in 2003. 
(4) In accordance with that Decision, a first instalment of EUR 3000000 was granted. 
(5) Pursuant to that Decision, the balance of the Community contribution is to be based on the claims submitted by Belgium on 13 January and 24 March 2004, documents confirming the figures in the claims, and the results of the on the spot checks carried out by the Commission. The amount set out in these claims submitted by Belgium was EUR 18035727,78 for which the Community financial contribution may not be higher than 50 % of the total eligible expenditure. 
(6) In view of these considerations, the total amount of the Community’s financial contribution to the eligible expenditure incurred associated with the eradication of avian influenza in Belgium in 2003 should now be fixed. 
(7) The results of the checks carried out by the Commission in compliance with the Community veterinary rules and the conditions for granting Community financial support mean the entire amount of the expenditure submitted cannot be recognised as eligible for a Community financial contribution.
