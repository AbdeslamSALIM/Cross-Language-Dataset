Commission Decision 
of 22 February 2006 
concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry in the Community 
(notified under document number C(2006) 597) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2006/135/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market [1], and in particular Article 9(4) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market [2], and in particular Article 10(4) thereof, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of 26 May 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [3], and in particular Article 18 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC [4], and in particular Article 66(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. Under certain circumstances the disease may also pose a risk to human health. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread to other holdings, to wild birds and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products. 
(2) Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 has been isolated from wild birds in certain parts of the Community and in third countries adjacent to the Community or populated by migratory birds during winter. The likelihood of virus introduction with wild birds is increasing during the forthcoming migratory season. 
(3) Where an H5 avian influenza virus collected from poultry is isolated on the territory of a Member State and where, pending the determination of the neuraminidase (N) type or of the pathogenicity index, the clinical picture and the epidemiological circumstances justify the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by highly pathogenic influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 or the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza, in particular of that subtype, has been confirmed, the affected Member State should apply certain protection measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. 
(4) These protective measures should be implemented in addition to those foreseen in the framework of Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza [5]. 
(5) However, the measures provided for in Directive 92/40/EEC are minimum control measures and require supplementary provisions notably on the movement of certain birds and of products from poultry and other birds originating in the zone affected by the disease. 
(6) Given the particular disease risk and the epidemiological situation with regard to highly pathogenic avian influenza and taking into account the severe economic impact the disease may have, in particular when occurring in Densely Populated Poultry Areas, supplementary measures should aim at reinforcing the local control measures, regionalising the affected Member State by separating the affected part of the territory from the disease free part thereof, and providing reassurance to the poultry sector and the trade partners about the safety of products dispatched from the disease free part of the country. 
(7) Taking account of the differences in disease risk in case of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, a high risk area and a low risk area should be established by the affected Member State in close collaboration with the Commission. 
(8) If the epidemiological situation so requires, measures appropriate in relation to the areas concerned by the outbreak or suspected outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza should be taken, in particular by describing these areas, and keeping this description updated depending on the situation, in Annex I to the present Decision in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 10(3) or (4) of Directive 90/425/EEC and Article 9(3) or (4) of Directive 89/662/EEC. 
(9) In the interests of consistency, it is appropriate to apply for the purposes of this Decision certain definitions provided for in Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC [6], Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs [7], Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin [8], Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [9]. 
(10) The measures laid down in Commission Decision 2005/734/EC of 19 October 2005 laying down biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza virus A subtype H5N1 from birds living in the wild to poultry and other captive birds and providing for an early detection system in areas at particular risk [10] should be implemented in the areas affected by the disease. 
(11) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC [11] provides for approved bodies, institutes and centres and a model certificate to accompany animals or their gametes between such approved premises in different Member States. A derogation from the transport restrictions should be envisaged for birds coming from and proceeding to bodies, institutes and centres approved in accordance with that Directive. 
(12) Transport of hatching eggs from the protection zones should be permitted under certain conditions. The dispatch of hatching eggs to other countries may be permitted subject in particular to compliance with the conditions referred to in Directive 2005/94/EC. In such cases the animal health certificates provided for in accordance with Directive 90/539/EEC should include a reference to this Decision. 
(13) The dispatch from protection zones of meat, minced meat, meat preparations and meat products should be permitted subject to certain conditions, in particular as regards compliance with certain requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [12]. 
(14) Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [13] establishes a list of treatments rendering meat from restricted areas safe, provides for the possibility to establish a specific identification mark and sets up the identification mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons. It is appropriate to permit the dispatch from the protection zones of meat bearing the health mark provided for in that Directive and meat products subjected to treatment referred to therein. 
(15) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption [14] authorises the placing on the market of a range of animal by-products, such as gelatine for technical use, materials for pharmaceutical use and others, originating in areas of the Community under animal health restrictions, because those products are considered safe due to the specific conditions of production, processing and utilisation that effectively inactivate possible pathogens or prevent contact with susceptible animals. 
(16) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of the transposition of Directive 2005/94/EC by Member States. 
(17) Given the disease risk, protection measures should be adopted at Community level in order to address the particular risks in different areas. 
(18) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
