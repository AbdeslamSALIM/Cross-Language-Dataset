Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2002 of 5 April 2002 amending and rectifying Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refunds 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 595/2002 
of 5 April 2002 
amending and rectifying Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refunds 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2580/2000(2), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refund(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(4), should be amended to provide that the detailed rules as laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001 of 26 November 2001 laying down detailed rules for the export of products supplied as food aid(5), are applicable to applications for refund certificates and refund certificates issued for the export of products supplied as food aid. 
(2) The deadline for lodging the specific application, where the export declaration is not the specific application, as provided for in Article 7(4), second subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, is giving rise to difficulties in some Member States. It is appropriate that these difficulties be addressed and that the resolution be applied to files which are still open at the time of entry into force of this Regulation. 
(3) Annex B provides for the payment of sugar refunds in respect of CN codes 2101 30 11 and 2101 30 91. These codes are not listed in Annex V to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(6). Therefore, Annex B requires rectification. 
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 should therefore be amended and rectified. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on Horizontal Questions concerning Trade in Processed Agricultural Products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,
