amending Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine, as regards production potential 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 11 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Articles 11 and 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 lay down that the restructuring and conversion of vineyards involves the grubbing-up and replanting of wine-growing areas covered by plans drawn up by the Member States. However, in certain cases the structural situation requires that new planting rights be allocated. The allocation of such rights must be limited to the area strictly necessary from the technical point of view to achieve the objective of restructuring. Account should therefore be taken of that possibility and the provisions concerned supplemented accordingly. 
(2) In practice, the agricultural tasks involved in restructuring and converting a vineyard are carried out at parcel level. In order to facilitate the implementation of plans, the conditions on which producers are eligible for advance payment of aid before a particular measure has been carried out should be stipulated. 
(3) The wording of Article 16(1)(a) is not correctly reproduced in Table 4.1 in the Annex (except in the Portuguese, English, German and Finnish versions). In order to avoid any confusion, the two texts should be aligned. 
(4) The Management Committee for Wine has not issued an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
