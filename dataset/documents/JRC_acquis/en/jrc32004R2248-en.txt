Commission Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;2248/2004 of 27 December 2004 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for 2005 for manioc originating in Thailand 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 2248/2004 
of 27 December 2004 
opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for 2005 for manioc originating in Thailand 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV(6) negotiations [1], and in particular Article 1(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) During the World Trade Organisation multilateral trade negotiations, the Community undertook to open a tariff quota restricted to 21 million tonnes of products falling within CN codes 07141010, 07141091 and 07141099 originating in Thailand per four-year period, with customs duty reduced to 6 %. This quota must be opened and administered by the Commission. 
(2) It is necessary to keep an administration system which ensures that only products originating in Thailand may be imported under the quota. The issue of an import licence should therefore continue to be subject to the presentation of an export certificate issued by the Thai authorities, a specimen of which has been notified to the Commission. 
(3) Since imports to the Community market of the products concerned have traditionally been administered on the basis of a calendar year, this system should be retained. A quota must therefore be opened for 2005. 
(4) The import of products covered by CN codes 07141010, 07141091 and 07141099 is subject to the presentation of an import licence in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [2] and with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice [3]. 
(5) In the light of past experience and taking into account that the Community concession provides for an overall quantity for four years with an annual maximum of 5500000 tonnes, it is advisable to maintain measures which, under certain conditions, either facilitate the release for free circulation of quantities of products exceeding those given in the import licences, or allow the difference between the figure given in the import licences and the smaller figure actually imported to be carried forward. 
(6) In order to ensure the correct application of the agreement, a system of strict and systematic controls is needed that take account of the information given on the Thai export certificates and the Thai authorities’ procedures for issuing export certificates. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
CHAPTER I

The original of the export certificate shall be retained by the body which issues the import licence.

Only the quantity indicated under "shipped weight" on the export certificate shall be taken into consideration for the issue of the import licence. 
Article 5 
Where it is found that the quantities actually unloaded in a given consignment are greater than the total figuring on the import licence or licences issued for this consignment, the competent authorities who issued the import licence or licences concerned shall, at the request of the importer, communicate to the Commission by telex or fax, case by case and as soon as possible, the number or numbers of the Thai export certificates, the number or numbers of the import licences, the excess quantity concerned and the name of the cargo vessel.
