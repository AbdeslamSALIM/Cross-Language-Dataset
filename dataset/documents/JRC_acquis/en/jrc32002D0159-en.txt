ANNEX 
ON A COMMON FORMAT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF SUMMARIES OF NATIONAL FUEL QUALITY DATA 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/71/EC(2), sets the environmental specifications for all petrol and diesel fuel marketed in the European Union. These specifications can be found in Annexes I to IV of the Directive. Article 8(1) obliges the Member States to monitor the compliance with these fuel quality specifications according to the analytical measurement methods referred to in the Directive. By no later than 30 June each year the Member States must submit a summary of the fuel quality monitoring data collected during the period January to December of the previous calendar year. The first report must be made by 30 June 2002. The reporting format contained herein has been established by the European Commission in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 98/70/EC and this Decision. 
2. DETAILS OF THOSE COMPILING THE FUEL QUALITY MONITORING REPORT 
The authorities responsible for compiling the fuel quality monitoring report are requested to complete the table below.

3. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION 
Parent fuel grade: Directive 98/70/EC sets the environmental specifications for petrol and diesel fuel marketed in the EU. The specifications in the Directive can be thought of as %quot%parent fuel grades%quot%. These include (i) regular unleaded petrol (RON %amp%gt; 91), (ii) unleaded petrol (RON %amp%gt; 95) and (iii) diesel fuel. 
National fuel grade: Member States may, of course, define %quot%national%quot% fuel grades which must still, however, respect the specification of the parent fuel grade. For example, national fuel grades may comprise super unleaded petrol (RON %amp%gt; 98), lead replacement petrol, zero sulphur petrol, 50 ppm sulphur petrol, zero sulphur diesel, 50 ppm sulphur diesel, etc. 
Zero sulphur or sulphur-free fuels are petrol and diesel fuels which contain less than 10 mg/kg (ppm) of sulphur. 
4. DESCRIPTION OF FUEL QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM 
Member States should provide a description on the operation of their national fuel quality monitoring systems. 
5. TOTAL SALES OF PETROL AND DIESEL 
Member States are requested to complete the following table detailing the quantities of each grade of petrol and diesel marketed in their territory. 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002053EN.003201.TIF%quot%%gt% 
6. GEOGRAPHICAL AVAILABILITY OF SULPHUR-FREE FUELS 
The Member States are requested to provide a description on the extent to which (i.e. geographic availability) sulphur-free fuels are marketed in their territory. 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002053EN.003202.TIF%quot%%gt% 
7. DEFINITION OF SUMMER PERIOD FOR PETROL VOLATILITY 
Directive 98/70/EC requires the vapour pressure of petrol to be less than 60,0 kPa during the summer period which spans 1 May until 30 September. However, for those Member States which experience %quot%arctic conditions%quot% the Summer period covers the period 1 June to 31 August and the vapour pressure must not exceed 70 kPa. Member States are requested to define the Summer period implemented in their territories.

8. REPORTING FORMAT FOR PETROL 
Member States should submit a summary report for the petrol quality monitoring data (for both nationally defined and parent grades) that they have collected in a given calendar year (January to December). This summary table is attached at Appendix I. Test methods shall be those included in EN228: 2000 or later version as appropriate. 
9. REPORTING FORMAT FOR DIESEL FUEL 
Member States should submit a summary report for the diesel fuel quality monitoring data (for nationally defined and parent grades) that they have collected in a given calendar year (January to December). This summary table is attached at Appendix II. Test methods shall be those included in EN590: 2000 or later versions as appropriate. 
10. Submission of fuel quality monitoring report 
The fuel quality monitoring report should be submitted formally to the following person: The Secretary General The European Commission Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat 200 B - 1049 Brussels. 
In addition, the report should be submitted in electronic form to the following email address: env-report-98-70@cec.eu.int
