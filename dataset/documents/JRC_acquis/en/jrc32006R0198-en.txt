(1) Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005 establishes a common framework for the production of Community statistics on vocational training in enterprises. 
(2) In order to implement Regulation (EC) No 1552/2005, measures concerning the sampling and precision requirements and sample size needed to meet these requirement, and the detailed NACE and size categories into which the results can be broken down, should be adopted. 
(3) The Commission should define the specific data to be collected with respect to the training and non-training enterprises and to the different forms of vocational training. 
(4) Implementing measures concerning the quality requirements for the data to be collected and transmitted for Community statistics on vocational training in enterprises, the structure of the quality reports and any measures necessary for assessing or improving the quality of the data should be adopted. 
(5) The first reference year for which the data are to be collected should be established. 
(6) Provisions should also be adopted concerning the appropriate technical format and interchange standard of the electronically transmitted data. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee,

ANNEX II 
SAMPLE 
1. The Statistical Business Register (SBR) referred to in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 [1] shall normally be taken as the main source of the sampling frame. A nationally representative stratified probability sample of enterprises shall be taken from this frame. 
2. The sample shall be stratified by NACE and size category according to the following minimum specification: 
- 20 NACE rev1.1 categories (C, D (15-16, 17-19, 21-22, 23-26, 27-28, 29-33, 34-35, 20 + 36-37), E, F, G (50, 51, 52), H, I (60-63, 64), J (65-66, 67), K + O) 
- 3 enterprise size categories, according to their number of persons employed: (10-49) (50-249) (250 and more) 
3. A sample size shall be calculated to assure a maximum half length of the 95 % confidence interval of 0,2 for the estimated parameters, which are a proportion of %quot%training enterprises%quot% (after allowance for the non-response rate in the sample) for each of the 60 stratified elements identified above. 
4. The following formula may be used in determining the sample size: 
nh = 1/[c2 . teh + 1/Nh] / rh 
Where: 
nh = the number of sampling units in the stratum cell, h 
rh = the anticipated response rate in the stratum cell, h 
c = maximum length of half the confidence interval 
teh = the anticipated proportion of training enterprises in the stratum cell, h 
Nh = the total number of enterprises (training and non-training) in the stratum cell, h 
[1] OJ L 196, 5.8.1993, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). 
-------------------------------------------------- 
ANNEX III 
Imputation principals and record weighting 
Countries shall take all appropriate measures to reduce item and unit non-response. Prior to imputation countries shall make all reasonable efforts to use other data sources. 
Core variables, for which no missing value shall be accepted, nor imputation permitted are: 
- A1, A2tot05, B1a, B1b, B2aflag, B2bflag, B2cflag, B2dflag, B2eflag, F1tot05. 
Key variables, for which every effort should be made to avoid missing values and for which imputation is recommended are: 
- A2tot04, A4, A5, C1tot, C3tot, C4tot, C7sub, C7tot, PAC, F2tot. 
Imputation for item non-response shall be recommended within the following general limits (Member State experts should at all times apply their professional judgement in the application of these rules): 
1. When a record contains less than 50 % of variables presented then this record shall normally be considered as a unit non-response. 
2. For a single NACE/size cell imputations shall not be allowed if more than 50 % of the responding enterprises have missing data for more than 25 % of the quantitative variables. 
3. For a single NACE/size cell no imputation shall be performed on a quantitative variable if the proportion of responding enterprises for that particular variable is less than 50 %. 
4. For a single NACE/size cell no imputation shall be performed on a qualitative variable if the proportion of responding enterprises for that particular variable is less than 80 %. 
Quantitative and qualitative variables are identified in Annex 1. 
Departures from these principals shall be fully documented and justified in the national quality report. 
Member States shall calculate and transmit a weight to be applied to each data record together with any auxiliary variables, which may have been used in the calculation of this weight. These auxiliary variables should be recorded as the variables EXTRA1, EXTRA2, EXTRA3 as necessary. The methodology adopted for establishing the weights shall be detailed in the quality report. 
-------------------------------------------------- 
ANNEX IV 
Data file format and transmission rules 
Data shall be transmitted to the Commission (Eurostat) in electronic form by means of a secure data transmission software application (STADIUM/EDAMIS) to be made available by the Commission (Eurostat). 
Countries shall transmit two checked data sets to ESTAT: 
(a) the data set prior to imputation with preliminary checks; 
(b) the fully checked data set after imputation. 
Both data sets shall contain the variables identified in Annex 1. 
Both files shall be presented in comma separated variable (.csv) format. The first record in each file shall be a header record containing the %quot%variable names%quot% as defined in Annex 1. Subsequent records shall detail the values of these variables for each responding enterprise.

7. BURDEN AND BENEFIT 
- Analysis of the burden and benefit at the national level through for example a consideration of: 
- Average time for answering to the each questionnaire. 
- Problematic questions and variables.

- Different burden for small and large enterprises. 
- Efforts made to reduce burden. 
[1] The coefficient of variation is the ratio of the square root of the variance of the estimator to the expected value. It is estimated by the ratio of the square root of the estimate of the sampling variance to the estimated value. The estimation of the sampling variance must take into account the sampling design and changes of strata. 
[2] The unit response rate is the ratio of the number of in scope respondents to the number of questionnaires sent to the population selected. 
[3] The item response rate for a variable is the ratio of the number of available data to the number of available and missing data (equal to the number of in scope respondents).
