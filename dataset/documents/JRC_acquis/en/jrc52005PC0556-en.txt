Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
On the Principles, Priorities and Conditions contained in the Accession Partnership with Croatia 
(presented by the Commission) {SEC(2005) 1424} 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
In Thessaloniki, the European Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 reiterated its determination to fully and effectively support the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. It endorsed the Council’s Conclusions of 16 June 2003 on the Western Balkan countries including the annex “The Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans: moving towards European integration”, which introduced the Partnerships as a means to materialise the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. 
In 2004, the Commission presented a first European Partnership with Croatia. It was adopted by the Council on 13 September 2004. The Commission considers it appropriate to update this first Partnership on the basis of its findings in the 2005 Progress Report on Croatia. 
On 3 October 2005, the Member States started negotiations with Croatia on its accession to the European Union. The Commission therefore deemed it appropriate to adopt an Accession Partnership; which updates the previous Partnership. The Commission has proposed to modify accordingly Council Regulation (EC) No 533/2004, the legal basis of the present Decision. In anticipation of the adoption of that proposal, the Commission has in parallel drafted the text of the present proposal to the new situation. 
This renewed Partnership lists short- and medium-term priorities for the country’s preparations for further integration with the European Union. The country is expected to respond to the Accession Partnership by preparing a plan with a timetable and specific measures in terms of how it intends to address the Accession Partnership’s priorities. The progress in implementing the priorities will be monitored regularly by the Commission, through the Progress Reports and through other structures set up under the Stabilisation and Association Process. 
The Accession Partnership priorities should form the basis for programming the financial assistance of the Community, which will continue to be provided under relevant financial instruments, in particular Council Regulation 3906/89 of 18 December 1989 (PHARE), Council Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999 of 21 June 1999 (ISPA) and Council Regulation (EC) 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 (SAPARD), as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2257/2004 of 20 December 2004, allowing Croatia to benefit from pre-accession instruments. 
The proposed Council Decision has no financial implications. In view of the above, the Commission invites the Council to adopt the attached draft Council decision.

ANNEX 
CROATIA: ACCESSION PARTNERSHIP 2005 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The European Council endorsed the introduction of the Partnerships as a means to materialise the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process. 
A European Partnership with Croatia was adopted by the Council on 13 September 2004. On 3 October 2005, the Member States started negotiations with Croatia on its accession to the European Union. It is appropriate to adopt an Accession Partnership which updates the previous Partnership on the basis of the findings of the 2005 Commission’s Progress Report on Croatia. This new Accession Partnership identifies new priorities for action. The new priorities are adapted to the country’s specific needs and stage of preparation and will be updated as necessary. The Accession Partnership also provides guidance for financial assistance to the country. 
Croatia is expected to develop a plan including a timetable and specific measures to address the Accession Partnership priorities. 
2. PRINCIPLES 
The Stabilisation and Association Process remains the framework for the European course of the Western Balkan countries, all the way to their future accession. 
The main priorities identified for Croatia relate to its capacity to progress in preparing for accession, and in particular to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the conditions set for the Stabilisation and Association Process, notably the conditions defined by the Council in its Conclusions of 29 April 1997 and 21 and 22 June 1999, the content of the final declaration of the Zagreb Summit of 24 November 2000 and the Thessaloniki Agenda, and the requirements of the negotiating framework adopted by the Council on 3 October 2005. 
3. PRIORITIES 
The priorities listed in this Accession Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Croatia can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. A distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within three to four years. The priorities concern both legislation and the implementation thereof. Taking into account the substantial costs required for the implementation and enforcement of the acquis as well as the complexity of the EU requirements in certain areas, this partnership does not include all important tasks at this stage. Future partnerships will include further priorities in line with progress made by the country. 
Among the short term priorities, the key priorities have been identified and grouped together at the beginning of section 3.1. The order of these key priorities does not imply a ranking in their importance. 
3.1. Short-term priorities

- Adopt and begin implementation of a national strategy for preventing and combating corruption and provide for the required coordination among the relevant government departments and bodies involved in its implementation, including making the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime fully operational.

4. PROGRAMMING 
Community assistance under the Stabilisation and Association Process to the Western Balkan countries will be provided under the existing financial instruments, in particular by the CARDS Regulation[3] and the PHARE[4] SAPARD[5] and ISPA[6] pre-accession instruments.

5. CONDITIONALITY 
Community assistance under the Stabilisation and Association Process to the Western Balkan countries is conditional on further progress in satisfying the Copenhagen criteria as well as progress in meeting the specific priorities of this Accession Partnership. Failure to respect these conditions could lead the Council to take appropriate measures on the basis of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000[7]. Community assistance shall also be subject to the conditions defined by the Council in its Conclusions of 29 April 1997, and 21-22 June 1999 in particular as regards the recipients’ undertaking to carry out democratic, economic and institutional reforms. 
Community assistance for financing projects through the three pre-accession instruments PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD is further conditional on respect by Croatia of its commitments under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and in particular progress in meeting the specific priorities of this Accession Partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98.
