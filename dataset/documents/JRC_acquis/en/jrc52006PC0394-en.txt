Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part, was signed in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006. It will be concluded once Albania, the Communities and the Member States have completed the ratification process. 
On 12 June 2006 the Council concluded an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part, which provides for the early entry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. This agreement will enter into force the first day of the second month following the date of deposit of the last instrument of ratification or approval. 
An Implementing Regulation is required to lay down the procedures for applying certain provisions of the said Agreements in order to ensure their correct implementation. 
It is therefore proposed that the Council adopt the attached regulation.

Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas: 
1. A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part,[1] (hereinafter referred to as ‘SAA’) was signed in Luxembourg on 12 June 2006. The SAA is in the process of ratification. 
2. On 12 June 2006 the Council concluded an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part,[2] (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Interim Agreement’) which provides for the early entry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the SAA. The Interim Agreement will enter into force the first day of the second month following the date of deposit of the last instrument of ratification or approval. 
3. It is necessary to lay down the procedures for applying certain provisions of both the SAA and the Interim Agreement. Since the trade and trade-related provisions of these instruments are to a very large extent identical, this regulation should also apply to the implementation of the SAA after its entry into force. 
4. The SAA and the Interim Agreement stipulate that fishery products originating in Albania may be imported into the Community at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of these tariff quotas. 
5. Where trade defence measures become necessary, they should be adopted in accordance with the general provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 of 22 December 1994 on the common rules for imports[3], Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of 20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports[4], Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community[5] or, as the case may be Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community[6]. 
6. For the purposes of implementing the relevant provisions of this Regulation the Commission should be assisted by the Customs Code Committee established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing Community Customs Code[7]. 
7. The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[8], 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
