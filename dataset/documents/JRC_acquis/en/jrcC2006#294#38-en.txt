v Land Niedersachsen 
Referring court 
Oberlandesgericht Celle 
Parties to the main proceedings 
Applicant: Rechtsanwalt Dr Dirk Rüffert, as the liquidator of the assets of Objekt und Bauregie GmbH %amp% Co KG 
Defendant: Land Niedersachsen 
Question referred 
Does it amount to an unjustified restriction on the freedom to provide services under the EC Treaty if a public contracting authority is required by statute to award contracts for building services only to undertakings which, when lodging a tender, undertake in writing to pay their employees, when performing those services, at least the remuneration prescribed by the collective agreement in force at the place where those services are performed?
