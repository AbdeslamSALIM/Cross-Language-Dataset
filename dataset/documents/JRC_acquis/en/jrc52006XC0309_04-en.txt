Note 1 Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal (%quot%dow%quot%), set by the European Standardisation Organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise. 
Note 2.1 The new (or amended) standard has the same scope as the superseded standard. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive. 
Note 3 In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 3) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive. 
NOTE: 
- Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European Standardisation Organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to Directive 98/34/EC [2] of the European Parliament and of the Council amended by Directive 98/48/EC [3]. 
- Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages. 
- This list replaces all the previous lists published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Commission ensures the updating of this list.
