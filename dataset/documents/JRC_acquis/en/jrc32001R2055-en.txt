of 19 October 2001 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2603/1999 laying down rules for the transition to the rural development support provided for by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations(1), and in particular Article 53(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) For the Regulations referred to in Article 4(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2603/1999(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1929/2000(3), Article 4(2) sets a date until which an application for payments must be received by the Commission in order to continue to be financed by the Guidance Section of the EAGGF. This provision shortens the time limit previously foreseen by the Commission Decisions granting support from the Guidance Section of the EAGGF, in conjunction with Article 21(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94(5). 
(2) This shorter deadline by which the Commission must have received applications for payments could result in a significant underspending of the EAGGF Guidance Section; for this reason it is advisable to extend the date in question in order to permit the full consumption of available credits under the Guidance Section of the EAGGF. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,
