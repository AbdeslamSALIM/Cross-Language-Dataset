2. The EEA Joint Committee should therefore adopt the attached decision to amend Annex II to the EEA Agreement by adding new Community acquis in field of technical regulations, standards, testing and certification. The decision concerns the following directive:

4. Article 1(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 concerning the arrangements for implementing the EEA Agreement envisages that the Council establishes the Community position for decisions extending Community legislation with substantial changes.
