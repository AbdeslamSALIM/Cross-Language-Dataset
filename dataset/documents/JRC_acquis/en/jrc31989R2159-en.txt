***** 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2159/89 
of 18 July 1989 
laying down detailed rules for applying the specific measures for nuts and locust beans as provided for in Title IIa of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1119/89 (2), and in particular Article 14g thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4), and in particular Article 5 (3) thereof, 
Whereas Title IIa of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 provides for various specific measures to make good the inadequacy of production and marketing facilities for certain nuts and locust beans; whereas the aids provided for are granted to producers' organizations which have received specific recognition and which have submitted a plan approved by the competent national authority for improving the quality and the marketing of their produce; 
Whereas it should be made clear that such specific recognition is not subject to prior recognition under Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72; whereas it is granted irrespective of the latter once the special conditions laid down for the granting thereof have been met; 
Whereas the conditions laid down for the granting of recognition must provide some reasonable assurance that the producers' organizations receiving Community aid will, by virtue of the scope and duration of their activities and the very manner of their operation, help to bring about the desired improvement in production and marketing facilities for the products in question; whereas, to ensure that such producers' organizations enjoy at least a degree of stability, minimum limits should be laid down for the number of members and for the quantities of nuts and locust beans produced, depending on the characteristics of the various Community regions; whereas, to the same end, it must be made a requirement that the statutes of such organizations are to include clauses which explicitly state that the producers are to control the decisions and verify the operation of the organization and clauses laying down penalties for any infringement of the agreed rules; 
Whereas, in the interests of efficiency and good management, the aid granted by the Member State and the Community towards plans for the improvement of quality and marketing arrangements should be used only to finance marginal plantations; whereas the minimum area of a specialized orchard should even be defined for each region of production; 
Whereas definitions should be laid down for the types of measures which may be included in plans where the primary objective is to improve the quality of production pursuant to Article 14d of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72; whereas, although the national authorities will be responsible for approving the plans, there must be consultation and administrative cooperation with the Commission so that the aims of the regulations are upheld and so that the Commission can, if necessary, request alterations to the draft plan or even refuse to approve the granting of national or Community financial aid; 
Whereas it should be made clear what measures to develop and improve Community consumption and utilization of nuts and locust beans will qualify for financial aid from the Community; whereas, to this end, the plans submitted must offer some guarantee that they are in the Community interest, that the measures taken will be effective, and that their direct or indirect impact will be to increase the consumption and utilization of the products concerned; whereas plans must be submitted by trade bodies or groups with some technical experience or by representatives of the economic sectors concerned; whereas, save as otherwise provided by the Commission, the performance or direct supervision of the work by the body or group which submitted the plan may be taken as evidence of the good falth of the parties concluding a contract with the Commission; whereas it should be stipulated that the various rules governing the fulfilment of the undertakings given are to be laid in a contract; 
Whereas certain general rules should be laid down for financing the aid to be charged to the EAGGF Guarantee Section in accordance with Title IIa of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72; whereas it should be made clear that 
Community aid may be paid out by the Member State only after, or at any rate not before, the national aid has been paid only after the proper checks have been carried out; 
Whereas the aid for implementing plans to improve quality and marketing arrangements should be paid annually on the basis of the work actually carried out in accordance with the approved plans: whereas the maximum amount of aid per hectare, as fixed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 790/89 (1), should be converted into the national currency concerned at the agricultural conversion rate applicable on the first day of each marketing year, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85; 
Whereas, for the purpose of implementing the various specific measures in question, the producers' organizations receiving the aid must be obliged to transmit detailed and precise information, at pre-set intervals, to the authority designated by the Member State so that the said authority can monitor the fulfilment of the undertakings given by the producers' organizations; 
Whereas the beneficiaries' obligation to provide information cannot in itself guarantee proper management of the measures concerned; whereas, therefore, it should be made clear what verification of documents and on-the-spot checks are to be made by the national authorities in connection with the various types of aid provided for in Title IIa of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72; 
Whereas the most serious failures to fulfil the obligations laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 or in this Regulation must be penalized in the appropriate manner; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
