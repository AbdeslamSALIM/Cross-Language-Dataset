Commission Regulation (EC) No 1059/2006 
of 12 July 2006 
opening an invitation to tender for the reduction in the duty on sorghum imported into Spain from third countries 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1] , and in particular Article 12(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Pursuant to the Community√¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s international obligations in the context of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations [2], the Community has undertaken to import a certain quantity of sorghum into Spain. 
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 of 26 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of tariff quotas for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain and imports of maize into Portugal [3], lays down the special additional detailed rules necessary for implementing the invitations to tender. 
(3) Taking into account the current market demand in Spain, an invitation to tender for the reduction in the duty on sorghum is appropriate. 
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 of 10 December 2002 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultrual products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP) [4] provides in particular for a 60 % reduction in the duty applicable to imports of 100000 tonnes of sorghum per calendar year, and a 50 % reduction over this quota. Cumulation of this benefit and the benefit resulting from the invitation to tender for the reduction in the import duty would disturb the Spanish cereals market. Such cumulation must therefore be ruled out. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
