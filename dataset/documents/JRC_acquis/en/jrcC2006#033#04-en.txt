Euro circulation coins have legal tender status throughout the euro area. The Commission publishes all new euro coin designs [1] with a view to informing anyone required to handle coins in the course of their work and the public at large. In accordance with the Council conclusions of 8 December 2003 [2], Member States and countries that have concluded a Monetary Agreement with the Community providing for the issuance of euro circulation coins are allowed to issue certain quantities of commemorative euro circulation coins on condition that not more than one new coin design is issued per country per year and that only the 2 EUR denomination is used. These coins have the technical features of normal euro circulation coins, but bear a commemorative design on the obverse national side.

Factual description of the design : The inner part of the coin shows a representation of the %quot%Holstentor%quot%, the landmark gate of the town of Lç«¯beck.
