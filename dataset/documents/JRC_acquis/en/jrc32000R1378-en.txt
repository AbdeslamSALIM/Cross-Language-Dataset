THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations(1), and in particular Article 1 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1486/95(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1409/1999(3), opened quotas for a specific period. In the framework of the World Trade Organisation, the Commission committed itself to increasing tariff quotas for certain products in the pigmeat sector. It is necessary to specify the new quantities covered by the import arrangements from 1 July 2000.

In order to facilitate trade of pigmeat and to harmonise the levels of securities for import licences within the meat sectors it is necessary to review the level of security. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,
