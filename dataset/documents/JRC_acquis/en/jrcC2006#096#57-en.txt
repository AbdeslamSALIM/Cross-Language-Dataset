Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicant took part in competition CJ/LA/25 aimed at constituting a reserve list of Spanish-language lawyer-linguists for grades LA7/LA6. 
After passing the competition, the applicant was informed that she had been appointed as a probationary official at grade A*7, step 2 in the Translation Directorate of the Court of Justice as from 16 May 2005. 
In her action the applicant challenges her classification at a lower grade pursuant to the entry into force of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 723/2004 of 22 March 2004 amending the Staff Regulations of officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities. [1] 
In support of her action, the applicant submits two pleas in law. The first consists of a plea of illegality against Article 12(3) and Article 13(2) of Annex XIII to the Staff Regulations. The second is based on the infringement of the principle of good administration, the duty to have regard for the welfare and interests of officials, the principle of transparency, the principle of good faith, the principle of equal treatment and the principle of non-discrimination.
