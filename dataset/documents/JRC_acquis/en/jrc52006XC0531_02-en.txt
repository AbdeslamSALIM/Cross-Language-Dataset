Commission communication in the framework of the implementation of Council Directive 88/378/EEC of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys 
(2006/C 127/03) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(Publication of titles and references of harmonised standards under the directive) 
ESO [1] | Reference and title of the harmonised standard (and reference document) | Reference of superseded standard | Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of superseded standard Note 1 | 
CEN | EN 71-2:2006 Safety of toys — Flammability | EN 71-2:2003 | 31.7.2006 | 
CEN | EN 71-5:1993 Safety of toys — Part 5: Chemical toys (sets) other than experimental sets | — | | 
EN 71-5:1993/A1:2006 | Note 3 | 31.7.2006 | 
Note 1 Generally the date of cessation of presumption of conformity will be the date of withdrawal ("dow"), set by the European Standardisation Organisation, but attention of users of these standards is drawn to the fact that in certain exceptional cases this can be otherwise. 
Note 3 In case of amendments, the referenced standard is EN CCCCC:YYYY, its previous amendments, if any, and the new, quoted amendment. The superseded standard (column 3) therefore consists of EN CCCCC:YYYY and its previous amendments, if any, but without the new quoted amendment. On the date stated, the superseded standard ceases to give presumption of conformity with the essential requirements of the directive. 
NOTE: 
- Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European Standardisation Organisations or from the national standardisation bodies of which the list is annexed to Directive 98/34/EC [2] of the European Parliament and of the Council as amended by Directive 98/48/EC [3]. 
- Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Union does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages. 
- This list replaces all the previous lists published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The Commission ensures the updating of this list.
