SECTION 5 Registration No:

STANDARD DOCUMENT FOR MONITORING RADIOACTIVE WASTE SHIPMENTS (DIRECTIVE 92/3/EURATOM) 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF THE WASTE NOTE 
This section must be filled in by the consignee, any necessary additions being made by the applicant. However, a consignee located outside the European Community may acknowledge receipt of the waste by means of a declaration separate from the standard document. 
Depending on whether the authorization is for one or several shipments, the procedure to be adopted is as follows. 
Authorization for a single shipment 
1. Shipment of type A or B 
Within 15 days of receiving the waste, the consignee must complete boxes 32, 33 and 35, and submit sections 4 and 5 to the competent authorities of the Member State of destination. 
The competent authorities of the Member State of destination then forward copies of sections 4 and 5 to the other competent authorities consulted (and, where appropriate, the original of these two sections to the competent authorities which issued the authorization). 
For shipments between Member States, the competent authorities of the Member State of origin must send a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt to the holder. 
2. Shipment of type C or D 
The applicant must ensure that the consignee located outside the European Community sends him section 4 and section 5 with boxes 32 to 35 duly completed immediately on receipt of the waste. Section 5 may be replaced by a declaration on the part of the consignee providing at least the information contained in boxes 34 and 35. 
Within 15 days after receipt of the waste, the applicant must forward section 4, section 5 (if the consignee did not use section 5, the applicant must complete it with the exception of box 34) and, where applicable, the consignee's declaration, to the competent authorities which issued the authorization. 
These authorities must then send copies of sections 4 and 5, and, where applicable, the consignee's declaration, to the other competent authorities consulted. 
Authorization for several shipments 
1. Shipment of type A or B 
The consignee completes boxes 32, 33 and 35 of section 5 after each shipment (having made several copies of a blank section 5 for this purpose) and submits this section direct to the competent authorities which issued the authorization. He attaches the section 4 relating to the same shipment. 
Section 5 page 2 
2. Shipment of type C or D 
The applicant must ensure that after each shipment the consignee located outside the European Communities completes boxes 32 to 35 on a copy of a blank Section 5 and returns it to him together with the appropriate section 4. 
The applicant must complete box 36 of section 5 and forward sections 4 and 5 to the authorities which issued the authorization. 
3. Shipments of all types 
When all the shipments covered by an authorization have been carried out, the final acknowledgement of receipt is completed and submitted as if the authorization were valid for a single shipment only (see above) except that: 
- it is stated in box 33 of section 5 that the shipment in question is the last shipment covered by the authorization; 
- any declaration made by a consignee located outside the European Communities must state that all the waste covered by the shipping authorization has indeed arrived; 
- to provide an overview, the sections 4 for each of the shipments covered by the authorization must be attached to the final acknowledgement of receipt.
