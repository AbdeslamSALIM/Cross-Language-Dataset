THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 82/471/EEC concerning certain products used in animal nutrition [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) An application for authorisation has been submitted for Candida guilliermondii, cultivated on substrates of vegetable origin, which belongs to the product group "1.2.1. yeasts cultivated on substrates of animal or vegetable origin" set out in the Annex to Directive 82/471/EEC. This feed is a microbial product based on the spent cells remaining after the industrial production of citric acid by fermentation. 
(2) The Scientific Panel on additives and products or substances used in animal feed of the European Food Safety Authority has delivered an opinion on the use of this product in feedingstuffs on 7 of June 2004, which concludes that the use of Candida guilliermondii cultivated on a substrate of vegetable origin (sugar cane molasses) does not present a risk to human health, animal health or the environment. 
(3) The assessment of the request for authorisation submitted in respect of Candida guilliermondii cultivated on substrates of vegetable origin shows that this product meets the requirements laid down in Article 6(2) of Directive 82/471/EEC, under the conditions set out in the Annex.
