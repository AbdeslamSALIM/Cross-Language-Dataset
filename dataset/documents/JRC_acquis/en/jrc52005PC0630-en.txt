Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending the Protocol setting out, for the period 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé e Príncipe 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Protocol annexed to the Fisheries Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe expired on 31 May 2005. The purpose of this proposal for a Council Regulation is to extend the Protocol by one year, until 31 May 2006. 
The two parties agreed at the beginning of 2005 to extend the Protocol, in particular in order to iron out certain difficulties relating to the implementation of the 2002-05 Protocol and to give the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe more time to prepare as well as possible for negotiations on a future partnership agreement, and to implement the action programme to support the necessary development of the fisheries sector. The new government, which took office in March 2004, waited until the last minute to analyse the option of extending the protocol, despite numerous reminders in March, April and May 2005. 
The parties have finally decided to extend the Protocol for a period of one year, from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. The extension, in the form of an exchange of letters, was initialled by the two parties on 3 June 2005, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. 
The Commission proposes, on this basis, that the Council adopt the Regulation on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending the Protocol. 
A proposal for a Council Decision on provisional application of the Agreement (pending its actual entry into force) is the subject of a separate procedure.

LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT 
1. TITLE OF THE PROPOSAL: 
Proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters extending the Protocol setting out, for the period 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe on fishing off the coast of São Tomé e Príncipe.

3.2 Duration of the action and of the financial impact: 
The protocol annexed to the fisheries agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe expired on 31 May 2005. The extension of the Protocol is concluded for one year. 
The protocol sets out the financial contribution, the types of fishing and the conditions governing the fishing activities of Community vessels operating in the fishing zones of São Tomé e Príncipe. 
It was proposed to extend the Agreement in February 2005, in particular in order to iron out certain difficulties relating to the implementation of the current protocol, to give the authorities time to prepare themselves as well as possible for negotiations on a future partnership agreement, and to implement the action programme to support the necessary development of the fisheries sector. The new government, which took office in March 2004, is in rather a precarious position. A vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies concerning the oil sector has caused the government to act with extreme caution. Despite numerous reminders during March, April and May 2005, the Minister for Fisheries has not yet signed the proposed extension. The two parties finally met in Sao Tomé on 3 June 2005 to analyse the state of implementation and the extension of the current protocol to the Fisheries Agreement. 
The parties decided to extend the protocol for one year, from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. The extension, in the form of an exchange of letters, was thus initialled by the two parties on 3 June 2005, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information: 
5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term 
The protocol annexed to the fisheries agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe expired on 31 May 2005. 
The main aim of extending the protocol, as proposed in February 2005, is to iron out certain difficulties relating to the implementation of the current protocol, to give the authorities time to prepare as well as possible for negotiations on a future partnership agreement, and to implement the action programme to support the necessary development of the fisheries sector. 
The new government, which took office in March 2004, is in rather a precarious position. A vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies concerning the oil sector has caused the government to act with extreme caution. Despite numerous reminders during March, April and May 2005, the Minister for Fisheries has not yet signed the proposed extension. The two parties finally met in Sao Tomé on 3 June 2005 to analyse the state of implementation and the extension of the current protocol to the Fisheries Agreement. 
The parties decided to extend the protocol for one year, from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. The extension, in the form of an exchange of letters, was thus initialled by the two parties on 3 June 2005, and sets out the technical and financial conditions governing the fishing activities of EC vessels in the waters of São Tomé and Príncipe for the period from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. 
The purpose of this extension is to allow Community shipowners to continue fishing in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of São Tomé and Príncipe pending the negotiations on the amendments to be made to the protocol. 
The main features of the extended protocol are unchanged: 
- Fishing opportunities: 36 freezer tuna seiners, two pole-and-line tuna boats and 25 surface longliners. 
The fishing opportunities fixed in the protocol will be allocated among the Member States as in the 2002-05 protocol, namely: 
- tuna seiners: France: 18, Spain: 18 
- pole-and-line tuna vessels: Portugal: 2 
- surface longliners: Spain: 20, Portugal: 5 
- Reference tonnage: the reference tonnage provided for under the current protocol, namely 8 500 tonnes of tuna caught during the extension period (1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006). 
- Financial Contribution: the amount provided for under the current protocol, namely €637 500 for the extension period (1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006). 
- Advances and fees payable by shipowners : 
- such advances and fees amount to €25 per tonne of tuna caught in the Sao Tomé é Principe fishing zone, as in all the agreements concluded by the Community in the region; 
- the advances are fixed at €3 750 per year per tuna seiner, €1 375 per year per surface longliner and €625 per year per pole-and-line tuna boat. 
In addition, €50 000 is to be provided to finance an evaluation study on deep-water crab. This study was scheduled for the first year of the 2002-05 Protocol, but could not be carried out at the time. 
The financial contribution is thus set at €687 500 for the extension year. 
5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
The Community began concluding fisheries agreements during the 1970s, following amendments to the Law of the Sea. At that time, the Member States decided to transfer their competence in that area to the Community (Council Resolution of 3 November 1976) and since then fisheries agreements have been the exclusive competence of the Community. 
Regarding the extension of this Protocol, if the Community does not act, then private agreements will spring up which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries, and Community vessels would change flags (mostly to flags of convenience), thereby reducing the size of the Community fleet. The Community has made international commitments regarding the sustainable management of resources and combating illegal fishing, which can be honoured only through Community fisheries agreements. 
The Community also hopes that, with this extension, São Tomé and Príncipe will be ready to start negotiations on a fisheries partnership agreement. 
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework 
The negotiation, conclusion and possible extension of fishing agreements with third countries meets the general objective of maintaining and safeguarding the traditional fishing activities of the Community fleet, including the distant-water fleet, and developing relations in a spirit of partnership with a view to strengthening the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources outside Community waters, taking account of environmental, social and economic concerns. 
The aim of this extension is the same as that of the current protocol with São Tomé e Príncipe, namely to preserve access for Community fishing vessels to São Tomé e Príncipe's EEZ in accordance with the types of fishing envisaged in the agreement: 
1) Tuna seiners: 36 vessels for tropical tuna fishing, 
2) Pole-and-line tuna boats: 2 vessels for tropical tuna fishing, 
3) Longliners: 25 vessels for fishing for tuna and related species; 
The financial contribution is thus set at €687 500 for the extension year. 
The following indicators will be used in the context of the ABM for the purposes of monitoring implementation of the agreement: 
( monitoring the utilisation rate of the fishing opportunities; 
( gathering and analysing data on catches and the commercial value of the agreement; 
( contribution to employment and value added in the Community; 
( contribution to stabilising the Community market; 
( contribution to the general objectives of reducing poverty in São Tomé e Príncipe, including the contribution to employment, development of infrastructure and support for the state budget; 
( number of technical meetings and meetings of the Joint Committee.

6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
6.1 Monitoring system 
The Commission (Fisheries DG, in collaboration with the Commission Delegation with regional competence in Libreville, Gabon) will ensure regular monitoring of implementation of this extension, particularly in terms of its use by operators and catch data. 
6.2 Assessment 
Given that the proposal is for extension of the protocol's validity for one year only, no specific ex-ante evaluation has been carried out. However, the protocol currently in force was thoroughly evaluated in August 2004 with the assistance of a consortium of independent consultants, with a view to the possible launch of negotiations for a new protocol. The commencement of negotiations has been delayed for a year in view of this extension. This will allow the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe more time to prepare. The 2004 study could be updated with data for 2005. 
6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation 
Here is some background information on the value of the current protocol (2002-05) drawn from the 2004 study: 
(Study of the "Sao Tomé e Principe" agreement: Ex-post evaluation of the current protocol to the fisheries agreement between the European Community and the Republic of São Tomé e Príncipe, and analysis of the impact of the future protocol on sustainability, including ex-ante evaluation” by Oceanci Developpement and Poseidon Aquatic Resource Management Ltd. Project Fish/2003/02, final report, August 2004.) 
The protocol is the seventh since entry into force of the Fisheries Agreement between the two parties in 1984. It is mainly a tuna agreement (63 vessels) with an experimental fishing opportunity targeting crab for three vessels of less than 250 GRT (for the period from 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2003 only). It is one of the tuna agreements concluded by the EC in one of the Atlantic zones richest in tuna. 
This bilateral fishing agreement enables the Community to maintain its distant-water fishing policy and gives private operators (the shipowners concerned) continued access to the São Tomé and Príncipe fishing zone and the possibility of continuing to fish for tuna in the Atlantic. Thus the existence of a Community fisheries agreement, which imposes a binding regulatory framework on both parties, guarantees the sound management of stocks, which is not always the case with private agreements. Lastly, the fisheries agreement creates jobs for fishermen from the EC and the third country. 
The total fishing opportunities included in the 2002-05 protocol correspond to 36 tuna seiners, two pole-and-line tuna boats (seven under the previous protocol) and 25 surface longliners (33 under the previous protocol). This represents fewer vessels than under the previous protocol. 
The average volume of use in terms of licences taken out has been very good for tuna seiners and good for surface longliners, but zero for pole-and-line vessels and the experimental-fishing segment targeting crab. 
The tuna section of this Protocol is an integral part of the network of agreements on tuna covering the Atlantic zone, which allows the Community fleet to follow straddling stocks of tuna. 
Use of the EC/São Tomé and Príncipe fisheries agreement (number of vessels) 
Vessel Type: | Fishing opportunities offered | Use in 2002/03 | Use in 2003/04 | Use in 2004/05[12] | Average use | 
Tuna seiners | 36 vessels | 72% | 78% | 67% | 72% | 
Pole-and-line tuna boats | 2 vessels | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 
Surface longliners | 25 vessels | 64% | 68% | 40% | 57% | 
Since tunas are highly migratory species, catches in a particular zone can vary considerably from one fishing year to another. The catches taken by the Community fleet in São Tomé and Príncipe waters may not, therefore, be known in advance. In general, catches (2 000-8 000 tonnes/year) were lower than the reference tonnage (8 500 tonnes). 
The Agreement is clearly advantageous in that the catch value far exceeds the cost of the protocol. The average commercial value of the tuna is between €800 and €1 000 per tonne. 
In addition to the direct commercial value of the catches for the vessels involved, the Agreement yields the following manifest benefits: 
- guaranteed jobs on board fishing vessels; 
- multiplier effect on employment: in ports, auction markets, processing factories, shipyards, service enterprises etc.; 
- location of these jobs in regions where there are no other employment possibilities; 
- contribution to Community's fish supply. 
It should also be remembered that the Council's guidelines on negotiation of fishery agreements with the ACP countries specify a need to take account of the interest to the Community in maintaining or establishing fishery relations with these countries. 
- Added value of Community involvement 
Regarding the extension of this Protocol, if the Community does not act, then private agreements will spring up which would not guarantee sustainable fisheries, and Community vessels would change flags (mostly to flags of convenience), thereby reducing the size of the Community fleet. The Community has made international commitments regarding the sustainable management of resources and combating illegal fishing, which can be honoured only through Community fisheries agreements. 
- Risks and alternative options: 
There is inevitably some risk in setting up a new fisheries protocol, for example: the amounts intended to finance the targeted actions and shipowners' fees might not be allocated as agreed (fraud), foreign fleets might ignore licences and other controls, there might be no investment and the local fishermen might be marginalised. 
In order to avoid these risks, it would be desirable to improve the monitoring of revenue and expenditure, improve the control activities of patrol vessels and aerial control, strengthen satellite monitoring (VMS), encourage foreign fleets to use local harbour facilities, finance measures for local fishermen, etc. 
6.2.2 Ex-ante estimate of the economic value of the agreement and the Community's financial contribution 
The Community's financial contribution granted under this extension is a single allocation established on the basis of one year's extension of the total appropriation for the 2002-05 protocol i.e. €637 500 for the tuna fishing opportunities plus €50 000 to finance the study on deep-water crab. 
6.2.3 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past) 
A detailed evaluation of the protocol expiring in 2005 has been carried out and was completed in August 2004. This study should help prepare the renegotiation of the agreement, which has been postponed by a year to allow the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe to use the funds for the targeted measures and write the implementation reports on the programme to support the sustainable management of fisheries resources under the targeted measures, which had been delayed. 
The targeted measures, which represent a substantial part of the financial contribution, were paid for in a lump sum only in July 2005, because the annual programming provided for in Article 4 of the Protocol was not carried out until the spring of 2005. It should be noted that the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe have undertaken to sending a detailed implementation report as provided for in the protocol. 
Difficulties in the annual programming of the targeted measures related to a weakness in the Ministry for Fisheries of São Tomé and Príncipe have led that Ministry to request that the Community's entire financial contribution under the extension, corresponding to the amount provided for in Article 2 of the current protocol (€637 500), be assigned as financial compensation. 
Indeed, the supporting measures provided for in the Protocol for the period 1 June 2002 to 31 May 2005, worth €880 000, were not paid for until 12 July 2005, because the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe had undertaken no programming. The extension provides for a single payment of €637 500, corresponding to €255 000 for targeted measures plus a financial contribution of €382 500 payable in January 2006. In view of the delay in the targeted measures for 2002-05, the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe has undertaken to make good the delay but, at the time of this extension, did not wish for the payment of €255 000 on the basis of programming of new targeted measures. Nevertheless, the Government has stated its intention to spend a corresponding amount in the sectors targeted by these measures. 
6.2.4 Terms and frequency of future evaluation 
A large part of the period covered by the current protocol had been the subject of an evaluation completed in August 2004 ahead of early negotiations which could not be held. The study could be updated to cover the period of the extension on the basis of indicators for measuring the results (catches, catch values) and consequences (number of jobs created and maintained, relationship between the cost of the Protocol and the value of the catches). 
Following on from this study, in order to ensure sustainable fishing in the region, an evaluation of the economic, social and environmental impact will be made each time a protocol is renewed in the future. The indicators listed in point 5.3 will be used to carry out an a ex-post evaluation. 
7. Anti-fraud measures 
The use to which the financial contribution paid by the Community under the Agreement is put is entirely at the discretion of the sovereign third country concerned. 
However, in this case, programming the part of the financial contribution used to support the fisheries policy of the country concerned, implementing the programme and providing the Commission with information on the results obtained, will remain the exclusive responsibility and competence of the third country. Nevertheless, the Commission undertakes to try and establish permanent political dialogue and cooperation with a view to improving the management of the protocol extension and strengthening the Community's contribution to the sustainable management of resources. 
In any case, any payment which the Commission makes under a fisheries agreement is subject to its standard rules and budgetary and financial procedures. This makes it possible, in particular, to fully identify the bank accounts of the third countries onto which the financial contribution is paid. 
In accordance with the principle of national sovereignty, however, the Commission cannot conduct or have conducted financial audits on the financial contributions paid to third countries.
