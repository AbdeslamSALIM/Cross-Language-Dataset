(Text with EEA relevance) 
By means of the following letter dated 2 February 2005, the Commission notified Germany of its decision to close the procedure initiated under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty: 
"By letter dated 15 January 2003, Germany notified the Commission of its intention to grant aid to Wagner. It provided additional information by letters dated 7 February and 14 February 2003. The Commission asked for additional information by letters dated 27 February, 6 June, 9 September and 10 December 2003, to which Germany replied by letters dated 26 March, 2 April, 28 July, 30 October and 22 December 2003 respectively. A meeting between representatives of the Commission and representatives of Germany took place on 20 October 2003. 
By decision of 18 February 2004, the Commission initiated the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the notified measure. The decision was communicated to Germany by letter dated 19 February. Germany took note of the decision by letter dated 24 March and added that the planned aid would be significantly higher than the notified amount. On the basis of this information, the Commission decided on 7 May to extend the Article 88(2) procedure. This decision was communicated to Germany by letter dated 11 May. Germany took note of the decision by letter dated 8 June. The Commission asked for additional information by letter dated 15 October. 
The Commission's decisions were published in the Official Journal of the European Union [1] on 7 April and 21 August 2004. The Commission did not receive any comments from interested parties. 
By letter dated 6 December 2004, Germany notified the Commission that the firm had decided not to press ahead with the investment project for which aid had been notified. By letter dated 6 January 2005, Germany confirmed that it was withdrawing its notification. 
The Commission notes that, under Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999, [2] the Member State concerned may withdraw a notification in due time before the Commission has taken a decision on the aid. In cases where the Commission has initiated the formal investigation procedure, it closes that procedure. 
Consequently, the Commission has decided to close the formal investigation procedure initiated under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the abovementioned aid, since Germany has withdrawn its notification."
