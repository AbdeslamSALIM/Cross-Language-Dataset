THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs [1], and in particular Articles 21(1) and 22(3), Article 23, Article 24(2) and Articles 26 and 27a thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC [2] and in particular Article 10 and Article 18 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC [3], and in particular Article 10(2) and the first subparagraph of Article 10(3)(a) thereof and the first indent of Chapter 2 of Annex II thereto, 
Having regard to Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products and repealing Directives 85/358/EEC and 86/469/EEC and Decisions 89/187/EEC and 91/664/EEC [4], and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 29(1), thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries [5], and in particular Article 22(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [6], in particular Article 8 and Article 9(2) and (4) thereof, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin [7], and in particular Article 9 thereof, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption [8], and in particular Article 11(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decisions 94/85/EC [9], 94/86/EC [10], 94/984/EC [11], 95/233/EC [12], 96/482/EC [13], 96/659/EC [14] 97/38/EC [15], 2000/609/EC [16], 2001/393/EC [17] and 2001/751/EC lay down Community rules on imports into and transit through the Community of poultry, hatching eggs, day-old chicks and meat of poultry, ratites and wild-game birds and eggs and egg products and specified pathogen-free eggs (the commodities concerned). Those Decisions generally only authorise the import and transit of the commodities concerned where they come from a third country or part thereof appearing on a list of approved third countries and where they comply with Community health conditions. 
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 of 29 October 1975 on the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks [18], Council Regulation (EEC) No 1907/90 of 26 June 1990 on certain marketing standards for eggs [19] and Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [20] set out Community health rules of a more general scope and apply to the import into and transit through the Community of the commodities concerned. 
(3) Existing Community rules governing imports into and transit through the Community of the commodities concerned should be amended to take account of new public-health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs [21], Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs [22]. 
(4) In addition, imports into the Community of hatching eggs, meat, minced meat and mechanically separated meat of poultry, ratites and wild game-birds, eggs and egg products are only authorised where they comply with residue control monitoring as provided for in Directive 96/23/EC. 
(5) In the interests of clarity and consistency of Community rules, it is appropriate that the definitions set out in Directive 90/539/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 be taken into account for the purposes of this Decision. 
(6) With a view to harmonising Community conditions for imports into the Community of the commodities concerned, as well as making them more transparent and simplifying the legislative procedure for amending such conditions, when required, those conditions should be set out in the relevant model veterinary certificate. 
(7) In order to protect the Community from disease by ensuring that consignments in transit through or stored in the Community comply with the animal health import conditions applicable to approved third countries for the animals or products concerned, a specific model veterinary certificate should be drawn up for use for the transit and storage of the commodities concerned. 
(8) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Codex Alimentarius have laid down guidelines regarding the principles of certification which veterinarians have to follow. Those principles state that the certifying veterinarian should certify only matters within his or her own knowledge at the time of signing the certificate or that have been separately attested by an official of another competent authority. 
(9) In addition, Council Directive 96/93/EC of 17 December 1996 on the certification of animals and animal products [23] lays down standards of certification which are necessary to ensure valid certification and to prevent fraud. It is, therefore, appropriate to ensure that the rules and principles applied by third country certifying officers provide guarantees that are equivalent to those laid down in that Directive and that the model veterinary certificates laid down in this Decision reflect only such facts as may be attested at the time the certificate is issued. 
(10) The United Nations has established guidelines for a common framework and layout for commercial documents. Under the aegis of several international bodies dealing with the streamlining of procedures in international trade, new principles and rules are to be followed for issuing certificates for international transactions. The OIE and the Codex Alimentarius have laid down guidelines on the use of electronic certification with regard to certification procedures. 
(11) For the information of the authorised veterinarian, importers and the competent authorities in the Member State where the veterinary certificates are presented, the notes for the exporting country on the compiling of the certificates should include further details relating to the term of validity, the date of issue and the scope of the certificate. For those reasons, each model veterinary certificate should also include explanations of certain definitions, supplementary guarantees approved by the Commission under specific conditions and, where relevant, the health requirements for holdings and establishments. 
(12) With a view to standardising the layout of the veterinary certificates to be issued by the official veterinarian of the exporting country and in order to facilitate the use of any electronic means of transferring certificates, the model veterinary certificates laid down in this Decision should be harmonised, as well as the notes for compiling such certificates in the exporting country. 
(13) In order to harmonise and streamline import procedures at Community borders, consignments presented for import and transit should be accompanied by the relevant veterinary certificates. 
(14) Specific conditions for transit via the Community of consignments to and from Russia should be provided for owing to the geographical situation of Kaliningrad. 
(15) Owing to the animal and public health situation with respect to Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever in Africa and Asia, certain special conditions should be laid down for imports of ratites for breeding and production and day-old chicks thereof coming from those regions. 
(16) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, Commission Decisions 94/85/EC, 94/86/EC, 94/984/EC, 95/233/EC, 96/482/EC, 96/659/EC97/38/EC, 2000/609/EC, 2001/393/EC and 2001/751/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision. 
(17) Commission Decision 93/342/EEC of 12 May 1993 laying down the criteria for classifying third countries with regard to avian influenza and Newcastle disease in relation to imports of live poultry and hatching eggs [24], Commission Decision 2000/585/EC of 7 September 2000 drawing up a list of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of rabbit meat and certain wild and farmed game meat, and laying down the animal and public health and the veterinary certification conditions for such imports [25] and Commission Decision 2003/812/EC of 17 November 2003 drawing up lists of third countries from which Member States are to authorise imports of certain products for human consumption subject to Council Directive 92/118/EEC [26] lay down certain conditions concerning a number of the commodities concerned. In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate that the relevant conditions be included in this Decision. Decisions 93/342/EEC, 2000/585/EC and 2003/812/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(18) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period to permit the Member States and the industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the applicable veterinary certification conditions laid down in this Decision. 
(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

ANNEX V 
PROTECTIVE MEASURES IN RELATION TO CRIMEAN-CONGO HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER 
PART 1 
For ratites 
The competent authority shall ensure that the ratites are isolated in rodent-proof, tick-free surroundings for at least 21 days prior to export. 
Before moving to the tick-free surroundings, the birds shall be treated to ensure that all ectoparasites on them are destroyed. After 14 days in tick-free surroundings, the ratites shall undergo the competitive ELISA test for antibodies to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. Every animal put into isolation must test negative to the test. On the animals' arrival in the Community, the treatment for ectoparasites and the serological test shall be repeated. 
PART 2 
For ratite meat 
The competent authority shall ensure that the ratites are isolated in rodent-proof, tick-free surroundings for at least 14 days prior to slaughter. 
Before moving to the tick-free surroundings, the birds shall either be examined to verify that they are tick-free or treated to ensure that all ticks on them are destroyed. The treatment used must be specified on the import certificate. Any treatment used shall not result in any detectable residues in the ratite meat. 
Each batch of ratites shall be examined for ticks prior to slaughter. If any are detected, the entire batch shall again be put into pre-slaughter isolation.
