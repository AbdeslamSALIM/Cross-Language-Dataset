(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition [1], and in particular Article 9(2) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. 
(2) The preparation Bacillus cereus var. toyoi (NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012), belonging to the group of %quot%micro-organisms%quot%, was authorised in accordance with Council Directive 70/524/EEC [2] without a time-limit as a feed additive for chickens for fattening and rabbits for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005 [3]. This additive was subsequently entered in the Community Register of Feed Additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. 
(3) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application for an amendment of the authorisation of that preparation was submitted to allow its use in feed containing the following coccidiostats: diclazuril (Clinacox 0,5 % and Clinacox 0,2 %), narasin-nicarbazina (Maxiban G160) and maduramicin ammonium (Cygro 1 %) for chickens for fattening. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation. 
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 5 November 2005 that the compatibility of the additive Bacillus var. toyoi (NCIMB 40112/CNCM I-1012) with diclazuril (Clinacox 0,5 % and Clinacox 0,2 %), narasin-nicarbazina (Maxiban G160) and maduramicin ammonium (Cygro 1 %) was established [4]. The opinion of the Authority also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. 
(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied. 
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
