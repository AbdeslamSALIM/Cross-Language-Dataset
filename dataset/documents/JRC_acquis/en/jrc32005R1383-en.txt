(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 [3] lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention. 
(3) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 20000 tonnes of barley held by the Polish intervention agency. 
(4) Special procedures must be laid down to ensure that the operations and their monitoring are properly effected.

Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
(5) To forestall reimportation, exports under this invitation to tender should be limited to certain third countries.

In the event of a dispute, the analysis results shall be forwarded electronically to the Commission.

1. The successful tenderer must accept the lot as established if the final result of the sample analyses indicates a quality: 
(a) higher than that specified in the notice of invitation to tender; 
(b) higher than the minimum characteristics laid down for intervention but below the quality described in the notice of invitation to tender, providing that the differences having regard to those criteria do not exceed the following limits: 
- one kilogram per hectolitre as regards specific weight, which must not, however, be less than 64 kg/hl,

The successful tenderer shall immediately inform the Commission thereof using the form in Annex I. 
If, following successive replacements, the successful tenderer has not received a replacement lot of the quality laid down within one month of the date of the request for a replacement, the successful tenderer shall be discharged of all obligations and the securities shall be released, provided the Commission and the intervention agency have been immediately informed using the form in Annex I. 
Article 9 
1. If the barley is removed before the results of the analyses provided for in Article 6 are known, all risks shall be borne by the successful tenderer from the time the lot is removed, without prejudice to any means of redress the tenderer might have against the storer.
