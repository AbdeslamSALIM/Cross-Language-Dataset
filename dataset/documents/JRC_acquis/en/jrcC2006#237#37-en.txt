Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicant took up her duties as a member of the auxiliary staff in the General Secretariat of the Council on 1 November 2003 and her contract ended on 31 March 2005. From 1 January 2005, the Council automatically affiliated her to the compulsory Belgian social security scheme for the last three months of her employment. Subsequently, the Council informed the applicant of her affiliation to the abovementioned scheme with retroactive effect, dated back to the day on which she took up her duties. However, according to the applicant, as a result of the lateness of her affiliation, she was unable to meet the conditions for receiving Belgian unemployment benefits, as laid down in the Belgian Royal Decree of 25 November 1991 on the regulation of unemployment [1]. She was therefore unable to prove that she had sufficient means to be granted a residence permit that would allow her to remain in Belgium for more than three months, in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2004/38/EC [2]. Furthermore, the lateness of the affiliation deprived her of the right that she would have enjoyed under Annex XII of the Treaty of Accession of Poland to the European Union of access to the Belgian labour market. 
In support of her application, the applicant pleads first of all infringement of Article 70 of the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities, which lays down the institution's obligation to affiliate auxiliary staff to a compulsory social security scheme and to take responsibility for the employer's contributions required under the legislation in force. 
Next, the applicant claims infringement of Articles 4 and 8 of the Belgian Royal Decree of 5 November 2002 establishing an immediate declaration of employment [3]. 
Finally, the applicant relies on infringement of the duty to have regard for the welfare of officials.
