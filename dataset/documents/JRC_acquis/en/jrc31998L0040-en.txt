THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Whereas, in view of the growing complexity of the task performed by tractors, thought should be given to the rear-view mirrors used to monitor implements not designed for on-road use; 
Whereas, in order to increase safety, the conditions under which rear-view mirrors are set by drivers should be set out in detail; whereas Directive 74/346/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly;
