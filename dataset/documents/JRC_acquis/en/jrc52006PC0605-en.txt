Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures 
(Codified version) 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. In the context of a people’s Europe, the Commission attaches great importance to simplifying and clarifying Community law so as to make it clearer and more accessible to the ordinary citizen, thus giving him new opportunities and the chance to make use of the specific rights it gives him. 
This aim cannot be achieved so long as numerous provisions that have been amended several times, often quite substantially, remain scattered, so that they must be sought partly in the original instrument and partly in later amending ones. Considerable research work, comparing many different instruments, is thus needed to identify the current rules. 
For this reason a codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if Community law is to be clear and transparent. 
2. On 1 April 1987 the Commission therefore decided [1] to instruct its staff that all legislative acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that the Community rules are clear and readily understandable. 
3. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this [2], stressing the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. 
Codification must be undertaken in full compliance with the normal Community legislative procedure. 
Given that no changes of substance may be made to the instruments affected by codification, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. 
4. The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 1976 on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures [3]. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it [4]; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. 
5. The codification proposal was drawn up on the basis of a preliminary consolidation, in all official languages, of Directive 76/308/EEC and the instruments amending it, carried out by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities, by means of a data-processing system. Where the Articles have been given new numbers, the correlation between the old and the new numbers is shown in a table contained in Annex II to the codified Directive.

Proposal for a 
2001/44/EC Art. 1 pt. 1 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 
on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures 
76/308/EEC (adapted) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 93 and 94 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy [5] , and in particular Article 42 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [6], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [7], 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 76/308/EEC of 15 March 1976 on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures [8] has been substantially amended several times [9]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified. 
76/308/EEC Recital 2 (adapted) 
(2) The fact that national provisions relating to recovery are applicable only within national territories is in itself an obstacle to the functioning of the internal market. This situation prevents Community rules from being fully and fairly applied, particularly in the area of the common agricultural policy, and facilitates fraudulent operations. 
2001/44/EC Recital 1 (adapted) 
(3) It is necessary to meet the threat to the financial interests of the Community and the Member States and to the internal market posed by the development of fraud. 
2001/44/EC Recital 2 (adapted) 
(4) Community and national financial interests, which are increasingly threatened by fraud, must therefore be protected so as to safeguard better the competitiveness and fiscal neutrality of the internal market. 
76/308/EEC Recital 3 
(5) It is therefore necessary to adopt common rules on mutual assistance for recovery. 
76/308/EEC Recital 4 (adapted) 
(6) These rules must apply to the recovery of claims resulting from the various measures which form part of the system of total or partial financing of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, to the recovery of agricultural levies and customs duties , valued added tax and harmonised excise duties (manufactured tobacco, alcohol and alcoholic beverages and mineral oils), as well as of taxes on income, on capital and on insurance premiums . They should also apply to the recovery of interest , administrative penalties and fines and costs incidental to such claims. 
76/308/EEC Recital 5 
(7) Mutual assistance must consist of the following: the requested authority must on the one hand supply the applicant authority with the information which the latter needs in order to recover claims arising in the Member State in which it is situated and notify the debtor of all instruments relating to such claims emanating from that Member State, and on the other hand it must recover, at the request of the applicant authority, the claims arising in the Member State in which the latter is situated. 
76/308/EEC Recital 6 
(8) These different forms of assistance must be afforded by the requested authority in compliance with the laws, regulations and administrative provisions governing such matters in the Member State in which it is situated. 
76/308/EEC Recital 7 
(9) It is necessary to lay down the conditions in accordance with which requests for assistance must be drawn up by the applicant authority and to give a limitative definition of the particular circumstances in which the requested authority may refuse assistance in any given case. 
2001/44/EC Recital 4 
(10) In order to permit more efficient and effective recovery of claims in respect of which a request for recovery has been made, the instrument permitting enforcement of the claim should, in principle, be treated as an instrument of the Member State in which the requested authority is situated. 
76/308/EEC Recital 8 
(11) When the requested authority is required to act on behalf of the applicant authority to recover a claim, it must be able, if the provisions in force in the Member State in which it is situated so permit and with the agreement of the applicant authority, to allow the debtor time to pay or authorise payment by instalment. Any interest charged on such payment facilities must also be remitted to the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated. 
76/308/EEC Recital 9 (adapted) 
(12) Upon a reasoned request from the applicant authority, the requested authority must also be able, in so far as the provisions in force in the Member State in which it is situated so permit, to take precautionary measures to guarantee the recovery of claims arising in the applicant Member State. Such claims should not necessarily benefit from the privileges accorded to sim4ilar claims arising in the Member State in which the requested authority is situated. 
76/308/EEC Recital 10 (adapted) 
(13) During the recovery procedure in the Member State in which the requested authority is situated the claim or the instrument authorising its enforcement issued in the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated may be contested by the person concerned. It should be laid down in such cases that the person concerned must bring the action contesting the claim before the competent body of the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated and that the requested authority must suspend any enforcement proceedings which it has begun until a decision is taken by the aforementioned body. 
76/308/EEC Recital 11 
(14) It should be laid down that documents and information communicated in the course of mutual assistance for recovery may not be used for other purposes. 
2001/44/EC Recital 5 
(15) The use of mutual assistance for recovery cannot, save in exceptional circumstances, be based on financial benefits or an interest in the results obtained, but Member States should be able to agree the reimbursement arrangements when recovery poses a specific problem. 
76/308/EEC Recital 12 
(16) This Directive should not curtail mutual assistance between particular Member States under bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements. 
(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [10]. 
(18) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex I, Part C, 
76/308/EEC

At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall, in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions applying to the recovery of similar claims arising in the Member State in which the requested authority is situated, recover claims which are the subject of an instrument permitting their enforcement. 
For this purpose any claim in respect of which a request for recovery has been made shall be treated as a claim of the Member State in which the requested authority is situated, except where Article 12 applies.

Within three months of the date of receipt of the request for recovery, Member States shall endeavour to complete such acceptance, recognition, supplementing or replacement, except in cases referred to in the fourth paragraph. These formalities may not be refused if the instrument permitting enforcement is properly drawn up. The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority of the grounds for exceeding the period of three months. 
If any of these formalities should give rise to contestation in connection with the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement issued by the applicant authority, Article 12 shall apply.

This action must be notified by the applicant authority to the requested authority. The party concerned may also notify the requested authority of the action. 
2. As soon as the requested authority has received the notification referred to in paragraph 1 either from the applicant authority or from the interested party, it shall suspend the enforcement procedure pending the decision of the body competent in the matter 1 , unless the applicant authority requests otherwise in accordance with the second subparagraph of this paragraph . Should the requested authority deem it necessary, and without prejudice to Article 13, that authority may take precautionary measures to guarantee recovery in so far as the laws or regulations in force in the Member State in which it is situated allow such action for similar claims. 
2001/44/EC Art. 1 pt. 7(b) (adapted)

76/308/EEC (adapted) 
3. Where it is the enforcement measures taken in the Member State in which the requested authority is situated that are being contested the action shall be brought before the competent body of that Member State in accordance with its laws and regulations. 
4. Where the competent body before which the action has been brought in accordance with paragraph 1 is a judicial or administrative tribunal, the decision of that tribunal, in so far as it is favourable to the applicant authority and permits recovery of the claim in the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated shall constitute the «instrument permitting enforcement» referred to in Articles 6, 7 and 8 and the recovery of the claim shall proceed on the basis of that decision. 
Article 13 
On a reasoned request by the applicant authority, the requested authority shall take precautionary measures to ensure recovery of a claim in so far as the laws or regulations in force in the Member State in which it is situated so permit. 
In order to give effect to the provisions of the first paragraph, Articles 6, 7(1), (3) and (4), 8, 11, 12 and 14 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 
Article 14 
2001/44/EC Art. 1 pt. 8 
The requested authority shall not be obliged: 
(a) to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 6 to 13 if recovery of the claim would, because of the situation of the debtor, create serious economic or social difficulties in the Member State in which that authority is situated, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in the Member State in which the requested authority is situated allow such action for similar national claims; 
(b) to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 4 to 13, if the initial request under Article 4, 5 or 6 applies to claims more than five years old, dating from the moment the instrument permitting the recovery is established in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative practices in force in the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated, to the date of the request. However, in cases where the claim or the instrument is contested, the time-limit begins from the moment at which the applicant State establishes that the claim or the instrument permitting recovery may no longer be contested. 
76/308/EEC 
1 2001/44/EC Art. 1 pt. 9 
The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance. Such reasoned refusal shall also be communicated to the Commission. 
Article 15 
1. Questions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed solely by the laws in force in the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated. 
2. Steps taken in the recovery of claims by the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance, which, if they had been carried out by the applicant authority, would have had the effect of suspending or interrupting the period of limitation according to the laws in force in the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated, shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter State, in so far as that effect is concerned. 
Article 16 
Documents and information sent to the requested authority pursuant to this Directive may only be communicated by the latter to:

4. The Member State in which the applicant authority is situated shall remain liable to the Member State in which the requested authority is situated for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument issued by the applicant authority are concerned.
