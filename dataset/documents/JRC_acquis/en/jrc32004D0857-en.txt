THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries [1], and in particular Articles 3(1) and 16 in conjunction with the first indent of Article 21a(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC [2], and in particular Article 10(2)(a) and (3)(a) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption [3], and in particular Article 8(1) and (4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 97/222/EC [4] establishes a list of third countries or parts of third countries from which the importation of meat products are authorised. 
(2) To ensure transparency and harmonisation of the codes for certain treatment regimes as laid down in the tables in Part II and III of the Annex to Decision 97/222/EC, it is necessary to amend and clarify some of the footnotes with reference to the origin and provenance of fresh meat.

(4) Therefore, Part I, II and IV of the Annex to Decision 97/222/EC should be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,

ANNEX III 
"PART IV 
Interpretation of codes used in tables in parts II and III 
Non-specific treatment regime: 
A = No minimum specified temperature or other treatment is established for animal health purposes for the meat product. However, to qualify as a "meat product", the meat must have undergone a treatment such that its cut surface shows that it no longer has the characteristics of fresh meat and the fresh meat used must also satisfy the animal health rules applicable to the export of fresh meat to the European Community. 
Specific treatment regimes — listed in descending order of severity: 
B = Treatment in a hermetically sealed container to an Fo value of three or more. 
C = A Minimum temperature of 80 °C which must be reached throughout the meat during the processing of the meat product. 
D = A - Aw value of not more than 0,93, 
- pH value of not more than 6,0. 
E = - Aw value of not more than 0,93, 
- pH value of not more than 6,0. 
F = A Heat treatment ensuring that a centre temperature of at least 65 °C is reached for a period of time as necessary to achieve a pasteurisation value (pv) equal to or above 40."
