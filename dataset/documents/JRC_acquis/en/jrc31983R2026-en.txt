COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2026/83 
of 18 July 1983 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN 
COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2), and in particular Article 16 (5) thereof, and the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations establishing a common organization of the market in agricultural products, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 (3) defines basic products as products covered by a market organization which are intended to be exported after processing; whereas basic products may be eligible for advance payment of export refunds; 
Whereas the goods covered by Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 764/82 (5), are not at present included in the definition of basic products; 
Whereas such goods should be included in that definition in order to ensure that they are treated in the same way as products covered by the market organization; 
Whereas Article 4 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 provides that the rate of yield applicable for processing shall be that applicable in respect of inward processing; whereas refunds are paid on notional quantities of products used in the manufacture of goods listed in Annex C to Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80; whereas these notional quantities should be used as the rate of yield in respect of those goods,
