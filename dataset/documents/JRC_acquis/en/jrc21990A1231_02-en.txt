AGREEMENT between the European Economic Community and the Principality of Andorra 
THE PRINCIPALITY OF ANDORRA 
and 
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, 
DESIROUS of introducing, in respect of their trade relations, arrangements to take the place of national arrangements currently in force and respecting the specific situation of the Principality of Andorra, 
CONSIDERING THAT, owing to geographical, historical and social and economic factors, Andorra's exceptional situation justifies special arrangements, particularly as regards exemption from import duties, turnover tax and excise duties collected on goods imported by travellers from Andorra into the Community, 
HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
Trade between the European Economic Community, on the one hand, and the Principality of Andorra, on the other, shall be governed by the provisions set out below.

(b) goods which come from third countries and are in free circulation in the Community or in the Principality of Andorra. 
2. Products coming from third countries shall be considered to be in free circulation in the Community or in the Principality of Andorra if the import formalities have been complied with and any customs duties or charges having equivalent effect which are payable have been levied, and there has been no total or partial drawback of such duties or charges in respect of the said products. 
Article 4 
The provisions of this Title shall also apply to goods obtained in the Community or in the Principality of Andorra, in the manufacture of which were used products coming from third countries and not in free circulation either in the Community or in the Principality of Andorra. These provisions shall, however, apply to those goods only if the exporting Contracting Party levies the customs duties laid down in the Community for third country products used in their manufacture. 
Article 5 
The Contracting Parties shall refrain from introducing between themselves any new customs duties on imports or exports or charges having equivalent effect, and from increasing those already applied in their trade with each other on 1 January 1989. 
Article 6 
1. Customs duties on imports and charges having equivalent effect in force between the Community and the Principality of Andorra shall be abolished in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3.

(b) From 1 January 1991 the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall apply the same customs 
duties in respect of the Principality of Andorra as they apply in respect of the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985. 
(c) In the case of processed agricultural products covered by Chapters 25 to 97 of the Harmonized System and referred to in Regulation (EEC) NÂ° 3033/80, subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall apply to customs duties constituting the fixed component of the charge on imports of those products into the Community from the Principality of Andorra, while the variable component provided for in the Regulation shall continue to apply. 
(d) By way of derogation from subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c), imports covered by the provisions relating to tax relief for travellers referred to in Article 13 shall be exempt from customs duties from 1 January 1991.

(c) any other arrangements necessary for the proper implementation of this Article. 
Article 9 
Quantitative restrictions on imports and exports and all measures having equivalent effect between the Community and the Principality of Andorra shall be prohibited from 1 January 1991. 
Article 10 
1. Should either Contracting Party consider that disparities arising from the other Party's application, in respect of imports from third countries, of customs duties, quantitative restrictions or any measures having equivalent effect, or of any other measure of commercial policy, threaten to deflect trade or to cause economic difficulties 
in its territory, it may bring the matter before the 
Joint Committee, which shall, if necessary, recommend appropriate methods for avoiding any harm liable to result therefrom.

(b) live animals born and raised in the Principality of Andorra;

(d) products from hunting or fishing in the Principality of Andorra; 
(e) products obtained in the Principality of Andorra by working or processing products referred to in points (a) to (d), even if other products have been used in their manufacture, provided that the products which were not obtained in the Principality of Andorra play only a subsidiary part in manufacture. 
TITLE II ARRANGEMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION 
Article 2 
1. Originating products within the meaning of this Appendix shall when imported into the Community be covered by the Agreement on presentation of: 
(a) an EUR. 1 movement certificate, hereinafter referred to as an 'EUR. 1 certificate`. A specimen of the EUR. 1 certificate is given in Annex 2 to this Appendix; 
(b) an invoice bearing the exporter's declaration as given in Annex 3 to this Appendix, made out by any exporter for any consignment of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed ECU 2 820. 
2. The following originating products within the meaning of this Appendix shall when imported into the Community be covered by the Agreement without it being necessary to present either of the documents referred to in paragraph 1: 
(a) goods sent as small packages from private persons to private persons, whose total value does not exceed ECU 200; 
(b) goods forming part of travellers' personal luggage whose value does not exceed ECU 565. 
These provisions shall apply only provided that such goods are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the conditions required for the application of the Agreement, and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration. 
Imports which are occasional and consist solely of goods for the personal use of the recipients or travellers shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the goods that no commercial purpose is in view. 
3. Up to and including 30 April 1991 the ecu to be used in terms of any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the ecu as at 3 October 1988. For each successive period of two years thereafter it shall be the equivalent in that national currency of the ecu as at the first working day in October in the year immediately preceding the two-year period. 
4. Amounts in the national currency of the exporting State equivalent to the amounts expressed in ecus shall be fixed by the exporting State and communicated to the other parties. When these amounts are greater than the corresponding amounts fixed by the importing State, the importing State shall accept them if the goods are invoiced in the currency of the exporting State. 
If the goods are invoiced in the currency of another Member State of the Community, the importing State shall recognize the amount notified by the State concerned. 
Article 3 
1. An EUR. 1 certificate shall be issued by the Andorran customs authorities when the goods to which it relates are exported. It shall be made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured. 
2. The EUR. 1 certificate shall be issued by the Andorran customs authorities if the goods to be exported can be considered as products originating in the Principality 
of Andorra within the meaning of Article 1 of this Appendix. 
3. An EUR. 1 certificate may be issued only where it can serve as the documentary evidence required for the purpose of implementing the preferential arrangements provided for by the Agreement. 
The date of issue of the EUR. 1 certificate must be indicated in the part of the certificate reserved for the customs authorities. 
4. In exceptional circumstances an EUR. 1 certificate may also be issued after exportation of the goods to which it relates if it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary ommissions or special circumstances. 
Certificates issued retrospectively must be endorsed with one of the following phrases: 
'EXPEDIDO A POSTERIORI`, 'UDSTEDT EETERFÃLGENDE`, 'NACHTRÃGLICH AUSGESTELLT`, 'ÃÃÃÃÃÃÃ ÃÃ ÃÃÃ ÃÃÃÃÃÃÃ`, 'ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY`, 'DELIVRE A POSTERIORI`, 'RILASCIATO A POSTERIORI`, 'AFGEGEVEN A POSTERIORI`, 'EMITIDO A POSTERIORI`, 'EMES A POSTERIORI`. 
5. In the event of the theft, loss or destruction of an EUR. 1 certificate, the exporter may apply to the Andorran customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with one of the following: 
'DUPLICADO`, 'DUPLIKAT`, 'DUPLIKAT`, 'ÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃÃ`, 'DUPLICATE`, 'DUPLICATO`, 'DUPLICAAT`, 'SEGUNDA VIA`, 'DUPLICAT`. 
The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original EUR. 1 certificate, shall take effect as from that date. 
6. The endorsements referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5 shall be entered in the Remarks box on the EUR. 1 certificate. 
7. For the purpose of verifying whether the conditions stated in paragraph 2 have been met, the Andorran customs authorities shall have the right to call for any documentary evidence or to carry out any check which they consider appropriate. 
Article 4 
1. An EUR. 1 certificate shall be issued only on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorized representative, on the form of which a specimen is given in Annex 2 to this Appendix; it shall be completed in accordance with this Appendix. 
2. It shall be the responsibility of the Andorran customs authorities to ensure that the form referred to in paragraph 1 is duly completed. In particular, the Andorran customs authorities shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the goods has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions. To this end, the description of the goods must be given without leaving any blank lines. Where the space is not completely filled a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through. 
3. Since the EUR. 1 certificate constitutes the documentary evidence for the application of the preferential tariff provided for by the Agreement, it shall be the responsibility of the Andorran customs authorities to take any steps necessary to verify the origin of the goods and to check the other statements on the EUR. 1 certificate. 
4. When a certificate is issued in accordance with Article 3 (4) of this Appendix, after the goods to which it relates have actually been exported, the exporter must in the application referred to in paragraph 1: 
- indicate the place and date of consignment of the goods to which the certificate relates, 
- certify that no EUR. 1 certificate was issued at the time of exportation of the goods in question, and state the reasons.

2. Each certificate shall measure 210 Ã 297 mm. A tolerance of up to plus 8 mm or minus 5 mm in the length may be allowed.

It shall have a printed green guilloche pattern background making any falsification by mechanical or chemical means apparent to the eye. 
3. The Principality of Andorra may reserve the right to print the certificates itself or may have them printed by approved printers. In the latter case, each certificate must include a reference to such approval. Each certificate must bear the name and address of the printer or a mark by which the printer can be identified. It shall also bear a serial number, either printed or not, by which it can be identified. 
Article 6 
1. An EUR. 1 certificate must be submitted, within four months of the date of issue, by the Andorran customs authorities to the customs authorities of the importing State where the goods are entered in accordance with the procedures laid down by that State. 
2. An EUR. 1 certificate which is submitted to the customs authorities of the importing State after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit the certificate by the final date set is due to reasons of force majeure or exceptional circumstances. 
In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing State may accept the certificates where the goods have been submitted to them before the said final date. 
3. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the EUR. 1 certificate and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the goods shall not ipso facto render the certificate null and void if it is duly established that the certificate does correspond to the goods submitted.

2. Exporters must keep for not less than two years the supporting documents referred to in paragraph 1. 
3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply mutatis mutandis in the case of the use of the declaration referred to in Article 2 (1) (b). 
Article 9 
1. Goods sent from the Principality of Andorra for exhibition in another country and sold after the exhibition for importation into the Community shall benefit on importation from the provisions of the Agreement on condition that the goods meet the requirements of this Appendix entitling them to be recognized as originating in the Principality of Andorra and provided that it is shown to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that: 
(a) an exporter has consigned the goods from the Principality of Andorra to the country in which the exhibition is held and has exhibited them there; 
(b) the goods have been sold or otherwise disposed of by that exporter to a consignee in the Community;

The customs authorities of the importing State shall forward, in support of the request for subsequent verification, 
any documents and information that have been obtained suggesting that the particulars given on the EUR. 1 certificate or the invoice are inaccurate. 
If the customs authorities of the importing State decide to suspend the application of Article 11 pending the results 
of the verification, they shall offer to release the goods to 
the importer subject to any precautionary measures judged necessary. 
3. The customs authorities of the importing State shall be informed of the results of the verification as soon as possible. The results must be such as to make it possible to determine whether the documents which are referred to in paragraph 2, and which have been returned, apply to the goods actually exported and whether these goods can in fact qualify for the application of the preferential arrangements. 
When such disputes cannot be settled between the customs authorities of the importing State and the Andorran customs 
authorities, or when they raise a problem of interpretation of this Appendix, they shall be submitted to the Customs Committee. 
For the purpose of subsequent verification of EUR. 1 certificates, the export documents or copies of EUR. 1 certificates provided in their place must be retained for at least two years by the Andorran customs authorities.

Head of Division 
Head of the Delegation of the European Economic Community for the negotiations with the Principality of Andorra 
Sir, 
Following our negotiating meeting on 13 and 14 December, the Andorran delegation for the negotiations with the European Economic Community stated that the import duties collected on entry into free circulation operations at all the Community customs offices for goods being sent to the Principality of Andorra were collected on behalf of the Principality of Andorra and should be paid back to the Principality of Andorra. It would like the Joint Committee to examine, at its first meeting, ways and means of fully applying this principle. 
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration.
