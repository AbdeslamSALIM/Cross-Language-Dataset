INTRODUCTION 
1. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 of 18 July 1994 [1]. The Agency's task is to collect and disseminate information on national and Community priorities in the field of safety and health at work, to support national and Community organisations involved in the formulation and implementation of policy and to provide information on preventive measures. Table 1 summarises the Agency's competences and activities based on information provided by the Agency. 
2. For information, the annual accounts drawn up by the Agency for the financial year 2004 are summarised in Tables 2, 3 and 4. 
THE COURT'S OPINION 
3. The Court's opinion is addressed to the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with Article 185(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 [2]; it was drawn up following an examination of the Agency's accounts, as required by Article 248 of the Treaty establishing the European Community. 
4. The Agency's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 [3] were drawn up by its Executive Director, pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2062/94, and sent to the Court, which is required to give its opinion on their reliability and on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. 
5. The Court conducted an audit in accordance with its policies and standards, which are based on international auditing standards that have been adapted to the Community context. The audit was planned and performed to obtain reasonable assurance that the accounts are reliable and the underlying transactions are legal and regular. 
6. The Court has obtained a reasonable basis to support the following opinion. 
Reliability of the accounts 
The Agency's accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 are, in all material respects, reliable. 
Legality and regularity of the underlying transactions 
The transactions underlying the Agency's annual accounts, taken as a whole, are legal and regular. 
The observations which follow do not call the Court's opinion into question. 
OBSERVATIONS 
7. The Agency has not yet put in place detailed rules for the implementation of its new financial regulation or provided for internal control procedures based on risk analysis [4]. 
8. Four framework contracts signed more than four years ago were used in 2004 for contracts amounting in total to 208000 euro. Article 117 of the detailed rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation [5] applicable to the general budget limits the duration of such contracts to four years. 
9. The revenue and expenditure account for the financial year 2003 shows, before economic adjustments, a loss of 1987000 euro connected with the implementation of the Agency's budget. This balance ought to have been included in an amending budget for the financial year 2004 [6]. 
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 5 October 2005.
