THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer [1], and in particular the third sentence of the fifteenth indent of Article 2 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Taking account of new information and technical developments reported by the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel in its progress report dated April 2002 [2] on controlled substances used as chemical processing agents, Annex VI of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should be modified as a result of Decision X/14 [3] and Decision XV/6 [4] adopted at the 10th (1998) and 15th Meetings (2003) of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol, respectively. 
(2) More specifically, Decision XV/6 adds the processing agent carbon tetrachloride for producing cyclodime (a solvent); and deletes the use of CFC 113 as a process agent in the manufacture of vinorelbine (a pharmaceutical product) and the use of carbon tetrachloride as a process agent in the production of tralomethrine (an insecticide). 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should be amended accordingly. 
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000.

"ANNEX VI 
Processes in which controlled substances are used as processing agents as referred to in the fifteenth indent of Article 2 
(a) use of carbon tetrachloride for the elimination of nitrogen trichloride in the production of chlorine and caustic soda; 
(b) use of carbon tetrachloride in the recovery of chlorine in tail gas from production of chlorine;
