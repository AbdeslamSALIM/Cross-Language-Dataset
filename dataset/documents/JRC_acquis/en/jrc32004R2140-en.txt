ANNEX 
Administrative Arrangement on licences between the European Commission, the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland. 
Conditions for the exercise of fishing activities by Community vessels in the Greenland fishing zone 
A LICENCE APPLICATION AND ISSUING FORMALITIES 
1. The shipowners shall present to the European Commission via the national authorities by 1 March or thirty days before the beginning of the fishing trip an application for each vessel wishing to fish under the Agreement. Applications shall be made on the forms provided for that purpose by Greenland, specimens of which are attached (Appendix 1). Each licence application shall be accompanied by proof of payment of the fee for the licence′s term of validity. The fees shall include all national and local charges related to access to fishing activities. The Greenland Fisheries Authority will charge an administration fee of 1 % of the licence fee. 
The European Commission shall present to the Greenland Fisheries Authority an application, made by the shipowner, for each vessel wishing to fish under the Agreement. 
2. The Greenland Fisheries Authority shall communicate, before the entry into force of the Administrative Arrangement, all information concerning the bank accounts to be used for the payment of the fee. 
3. Licences shall be issued for specific vessels and shall not be transferable, subject to the provisions of paragraph 4. Licences shall indicate the maximum quantity authorised to catch and retain on board. An amendment of any maximum quantity indicated in the licence shall be subject to a new licence request. In the case where a vessel exceeds any maximum quantity indicated in its licence, it shall pay a fee for the quantity in excess to the maximum quantity indicated in its licence. No new licence is issued to that vessel as long as the fees corresponding to the exceeded quantity are not paid. This fee is calculated in accordance with Part B 3. 
4. However, in the case of force majeure and at the request of the Commission, a vessel′s licence may be replaced by a new licence for another vessel with characteristics similar to those of the first vessel. The new licence shall indicate: 
- the date of issue, 
- the fact that it invalidates and replaces the licence of the previous vessel. 
5. In case of "swapping" of maximum quantities, in whole or in part, indicated in the licences, new licences shall be issued and the former licence withdrawn. In that case no licence fee is required. 
6. Licences shall be transmitted by the Greenland Fisheries Authority to the Commission within 15 working days of receipt of the application. 
7. The original licence or a copy of it must be held on board at all times and be presented at any time on request of the competent Greenland authorities. 
B VALIDITY OF LICENCES AND PAYMENT 
1. Licences shall be valid from the date of issue to the end of the calendar year in which the licence has been issued. They shall be issued within 15 working days of receipt of the application following payment of the required licence fees per year for each vessel. 
As far as the capelin fishery is concerned, licences shall be issued from 20 June to 31 December and 1 January to 30 April. 
2. The licence fees shall be based on the following: 
- 2005: 2 % of the price per tonne of the species, 
- 2006: 3 % of the price per tonne of the species 
3. The licence fees for 2005 are based on Annex VI of the Protocol and are as follows: 
Species | EUR per tonne | 
Redfish | 28 | 
Greenland Halibut | 51 | 
Shrimp | 42 | 
Atlantic Halibut | 56 | 
Capelin | 2 | 
Roundnose Grenadier | 12 | 
Snowcrab | 81 | 
The total licence fee (maximum quantity authorised to be fished multiplied with price per tonne) will be charged with a Greenlandic administration fee of one percent of the licence fee. 
When the maximum authorised quantity is not fished, the fee corresponding to this maximum authorised quantity is not reimbursed to the shipowner. 
4. The licence fees for 2006 will be fixed in November 2005 by an Annex to this Administrative Arrangement based on Annex VI of the Protocol. 
5. The Greenland Fisheries Authority will draw up a statement of fees in respect of the previous calendar year on the basis of licences issued to Community vessels and other information in the possession of the Greenland Fisheries Authority. 
The statement will be sent to the Commission before 5 January of the following year. 
C MODALITIES FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 11 OF THE PROTOCOL 
1. Referring to Article 11(1) of the Protocol, the financial compensation shall be payable annually at the beginning of each fishing year. 
Referring to Article 11(5) of the Protocol, the financial compensation is, with the revision, composed of two segments: the EC financial compensation and the shipowners licence fees. 
The amounts expected to be obtained by Greenland through licence fees paid by shipowners will be deducted from the EC financial compensation. 
2. Following the end of the fishing year, the amount paid by the shipowners is examined and the balance between the result of full utilisation and payment of licence fees is transferred to the Greenland Authorities as soon as possible, in addition to the next year’s EC financial compensation. 
D DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE 
This administrative arrangement shall enter into force on 1 January 2005.
