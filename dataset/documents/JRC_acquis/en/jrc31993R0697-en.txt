Council Regulation (EEC) No 697/93 of 17 March 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 697/93 of 17 March 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 (4) identified most of the fish species by their taxonomic names; 
Whereas some of the fish species commonly known as trout internationally have been given new taxonomic names when these species were moved from the genus Salmo to the genus Oncorhynchus; whereas this change in taxonomic names does not lead to a change of the tariff classification of these species nor of the structure of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas it seems sufficient to refer to the new taxonomic names by means of a footnote; whereas Annex VII to the said Regulation should be amended as a result; 
Whereas the tariff nomenclature resulting from the application of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 is included in the Common Customs Tariff; whereas consequently an amendment should be made to the combined nomenclature in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (5), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annex VII to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 shall be replaced by the Annex hereto. 
Article 2 
Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 shall be replaced by the Annex hereto, which concerns the CN codes that appear therein. 
Article 3 
This Regulation shall enter into force six weeks after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 17 March 1993. 
For the Council 
The President
