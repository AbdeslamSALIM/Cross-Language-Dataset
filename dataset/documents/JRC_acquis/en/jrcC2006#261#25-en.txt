Pleas in law and main arguments 
This appeal is based on the following pleas in law: 
The Court of First Instance erred in law: it infringed the EC Treaty, in particular Article 19 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community on the Statute of the Court of Justice (which, in accordance with Article 311 EC, forms an integral part thereof) which lays down the criteria governing the legal representation of the parties before the Community courts. 
It infringed essential procedural requirements by failing to grant the applicant a period in which to put the application in order, in breach of Article 44(6) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance, misapplying Article 111 thereof to the present case and failing to hear the applicant before declaring the action inadmissible, in breach of the principle of the right to be heard which applies in all proceedings. 
It infringed the principle of non-discrimination by denying the legal representative (letrado) of the Generalidad Valenciana a right which has been undisputed in previous cases in respect of representatives who have appeared before the Community courts in that same capacity.
