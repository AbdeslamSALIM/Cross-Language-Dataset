(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2003/31/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups. 
(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group. 
(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/427/EC of 28 May 1999 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to detergents for dishwashers(2), in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision as extended by Decision 2002/173/EC(3) and the definition of the product group should be modified. 
(5) A new Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of five years. 
(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than 18 months, both the new criteria and the criteria established by Decision 1999/427/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision, to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,

ANNEX 
FRAMEWORK 
The aims of the criteria 
These criteria aim in particular at promoting: 
- reduction of water pollution both by reducing the quantity of detergent used and by limiting the quantity of harmful ingredients, 
- reduction of energy use by promoting low temperature detergents, 
- the minimisation of waste by reducing the amount of primary packaging. 
Additionally, the criteria enhance the consumers' environmental awareness. The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of detergents for dishwashers that have a low environmental impact. 
Assessment and verification requirements 
The specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion. 
Where the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses, test reports, or other evidence to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate. 
Where possible, the testing should be performed by laboratories that meet the general requirements of EN ISO 17025 or equivalent. 
Where appropriate, test methods other than those indicated for each criterion may be used if the competent body assessing the application accepts their equivalence. 
Where appropriate, competent bodies may require supporting documentation and may carry out independent verifications. 
Where appropriate, the applicant may use subsequent revisions of the Detergent Ingredient Database as they become available. 
The competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (note: it is not required to implement such management schemes.). 
Functional unit and reference dosage 
The functional unit, to which inputs and outputs should be related, shall be the quantity of product required to wash 12 place settings with a standard soil (as defined by DIN or ISO standards). The dosage recommended by the manufacturer to consumers for normally soiled dishes and 12 place settings is taken as a reference dosage under standard conditions, as laid down in the IKW washing performance test referred to in criterion 6. 
CRITERIA 
1. Environmental scoring matrix 
The following five parameters are included in an environmental matrix and are aggregated and assessed as a whole, as presented below:

O= no, criterion does not apply

Appendix I.B 
The following approach applies, as appropriate in the case of ingredients that are not listed on the DID-list 
Aquatic toxicity 
The lowest validated long-term effect (LTE) data on fish, daphnia magna or algae should be considered for the calculation of the critical dilution volume criterion (toxicity). 
In cases where data on homologues and/or QSARs (quantitative structure activity relationships) are used, a correction could be considered for the finally selected LTE data. 
In the absence of LTE data the following procedure has to be applied in order to estimate the LTE data by using the specified uncertainty factor (UF) on the data of the most sensitive species: 
Non surfactants 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Deviation from this rule may be admitted if evidence can be provided that lower factors or data can be scientifically justified. NOEC is the No Observed Effect Concentration (in a chronic test). 
Surfactants 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
In the last case referred to above, an uncertainty factor of 20 may be used instead of 50 only if 1-2 L(E)C50 (LC 50 in case of fish toxicity, EC50 in case of daphnia or algal toxicity) data are available and if it can be concluded from the information for other compounds that the most sensitive species have been tested. Such a rule can be applied only within a group of homologues. It should be emphasised that the LTEs (long-term effects) used must be consistent within a group of homologues with respect to the influence of e.g. length of alkyl chain for LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulphonate) or number of EOs (ethoxy groups) for alcohol-ethoxylate if such QSARs can be established. 
Any deviation from the above-described scheme has to be well reasoned for the specific chemical. 
Loading factors 
Loading factors shall be established according to Commission Directive 93/67/EEC of 20 July 1993 laying down the principles for assessment of risk to man and the environment of substances(1) notified in accordance with Council Directive 67/548/EEC and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93(2).

Appendix I.C 
Documentation of anaerobic biodegradability 
The following approach may be used to provide the necessary documentation of anaerobic degradability in the case of ingredients that are not listed in the DID-list: 
1. Apply reasonable extrapolation 
Use test results obtained with one raw material to extrapolate the ultimate anaerobic degradability of structurally related surfactants. If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant (or a group of homologues) according to the DID-list, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (e.g., C12-15 A 1-3 EO sulphate (DID No 8) is anaerobically biodegradable, and a similar anaerobic biodegradability may also be assumed for C12-15 A 6 EO sulphate). If anaerobic biodegradability has been confirmed for a surfactant by use of an appropriate test method, it can be assumed that a similar type of surfactant is also anaerobically biodegradable (e.g., literature data confirming the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants belonging to the group alkyl ester ammonium salts may be used as documentation for a similar anaerobic biodegradability of other quaternary ammonium salts containing ester-linkages in the alkyl chain(s)). 
2. Perform screening test for anaerobic degradability 
If new testing is necessary, perform a screening test by use of ISO 11734, ECETOC No 28 (June 1988) or an equivalent method. 
3. Perform low-dosage degradability test 
If new testing is necessary, and in the case of experimental problems in the screening test (e.g. inhibition due to toxicity of test substance), repeat testing by using a low dosage of surfactant and monitor degradation by 14C measurements or chemical analyses. Testing at low dosages may be performed by use of OECD 308 (August 2000) or an equivalent method.
