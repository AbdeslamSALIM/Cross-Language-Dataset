THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue [1], and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1), Article 8(2)(d) and (3), Article 9(1)(c) and the third paragraph of Article 19 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 2000/75/EC lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the Community, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on animals leaving those zones. 
(2) Commission Decision 2005/393/EC of 23 May 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones [2] provides for the demarcation of the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue. 
(3) By Decision 2006/591/EC, the Commission has amended Decision 2005/393/EC as regards the demarcation of restricted zones established following the notification of outbreaks of bluetongue by the competent authorities of the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium. 
(4) On 31 August and 5 September 2006 respectively, France and Germany informed the Commission of new confirmed cases of bluetongue. In view of these new findings, Decision 2005/393/EC should be amended in order to amend the restricted zone including the affected area. 
(5) Taking into account the measures taken by the affected Member States to avoid the spread of the disease, movements of susceptible animals into the surveillance zone should be allowed under the supervision of the competent authorities concerned. 
(6) On the request of the competent authority of the Netherlands, small amendments to the demarcation of the restricted zone which relates to the Netherlands are necessary. 
(7) To prevent the further spread of the disease, this Decision should apply as a matter of urgency.
