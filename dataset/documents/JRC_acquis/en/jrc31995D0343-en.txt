THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and in particular Article 23 (2) (b) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Decision 95/340/EC (2) establishes a provisional list of third countries from which Member States authorize imports of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products; 
Whereas the conditions applicable to the importation from third countries of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products intended for human consumption must be at least equivalent to those laid down in Chapter II of Directive 92/46/EEC for Community production; 
Whereas Commission Decision 95/342/EC (3) specifies the types of treatment which are to be applied to milk and milk-based products for human consumption from third countries or parts of third countries in which there is a threat of foot-and-mouth disease; 
Whereas the specimen certificate referred to in Article 23 of Directive 92/46/EEC must contain a description of the milk or milk-based product covered by the certificate, relevant references to Chapter II of Directive 92/46/EEC, a choice of language or languages in which the certificate is drawn up and a choice of rank or title of the signatory; 
Whereas provision should be made first for a specimen certificate for raw milk intended to be accepted at a collection centre, standardization centre, treatment establishment or processing establishment, for a specimen certificate for heat-treated milk, milk-based products made from heat-treated milk or heat-treated milk-based products intended for human consumption from third countries or parts of third countries in which there is no threat of foot-and-mouth disease, for a specimen certificate for heat-treated milk, milk-based products made from heat-treated milk or heat-treated milk-based products intended for human consumption from third countries or parts of third countries in which there is a threat of foot-and-mouth disease, and for a specimen certificate for raw milk products for human consumption; whereas, in view of the different nature of these products, provision should be made for different specimen health certificates;
