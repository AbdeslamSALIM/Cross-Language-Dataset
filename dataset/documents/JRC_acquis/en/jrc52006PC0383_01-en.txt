COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001 on the development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL DECISION 
amending Decision 2001/886/JHA on the development of the second generation Schengen information System (SIS II) 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal The Council entrusted the Commission with the development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) by Regulation EC No 2424/2001 and Decision 2001/886/JHA. The objective of these proposals is to amend the aforementioned Regulation and Decision in order to extend the deadline for the development of the SIS II until 31 December 2007 and allow for the allocation of the necessary budget. In addition, it establishes the location of the system during its development in France and Austria. | 
120 | General context The Schengen Information System (SIS), set up pursuant to the provisions of Title IV of the Convention of 1990 implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders constitutes an essential tool for the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the European Union. The current SIS has not been constructed so as to service the increased number of Member States of the European Union after its enlargement and to other countries that will be connected to SIS II. In addition, in order to benefit from the latest developments in the field of information technology and to allow for the introduction of new functions, it was decided in 2001 to develop a new second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). Several factors explain the need to extend by one year the initial mandate given by the Council to the Commission, such as, a temporary suspension of works following an injunction ordered by the Court of First Instance (T-447/04), which was subsequently removed, on the public procurement procedure for the development of SIS II; the S-Testa communications infrastructure funded under the IDABC programme, which will not be operational as planned during the initial testing phase; the lack of preparedness and uncertainty regarding the sites for the development, and the complexity of the project itself also had a negative impact on the planning. The choice of the sites for the development of the system in France and Austria follows the Council Conclusions from 29 April 2004 when the Council agreed on: "1. The central part of SIS II shall be located in Strasbourg and the operational management and responsibility for liaison with the Commission for this site shall be the responsibility of France. 2. The Business Continuity Site shall be located in Salzburg subject to certain arrangements that will be necessary before the site becomes operational. In that event, operational management and responsibility for liaison with the Commission for this site shall be the responsibility of Austria." | 
130 | Existing provisions in the area of the proposal - Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement (Articles 92-119) - Council Regulation (EC) No 871/2004 of 29 April 2004 concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, including in the fight against terrorism - Council Decision 2005/211/JHA of 24 February 2005 concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, including in the fight against terrorism - Regulation (EC) No 1160/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders, as regards access to the Schengen Information System by the services in the Member States responsible for issuing registration certificates for vehicles The Convention and the three legal acts cited above constitute the current legal framework of the SIS which will be replaced by the future SIS II. The Commission has submitted proposals for a Regulation and a Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS II, documents COM (2005) 230 and 236 and one other proposal for a Regulation regarding access to the SIS II by services in the Member States responsible for issuing vehicle registration certificates, document COM (2005) 237. | 
141 | Consistency with the other policies and objectives of the Union Not applicable. | 
CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | 
Consultation of interested parties | 
211 | Consultation methods, main sectors targeted and general profile of respondents Member States' experts are closely involved in the development of the SIS II, in particular in the framework of the SIS II Committee. | 
212 | Summary of responses and how they have been taken into account Not applicable | 
Collection and use of expertise | 
229 | There was no need for external expertise. | 
230 | Impact assessment No Impact Assessment is required for this proposal which is not in the 2006 Work Programme of the Commission. | 
LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 
305 | Summary of the proposed action The objective of the proposals is to amend Regulation (EC) 2424/2001 and Decision 2001/886/JHA in order to extend the deadline for the development of the SIS II until 31 December 2007 and to designate the sites for the installation and final development of SIS II. This includes the obligation for the competent Member States to provide the infrastructure and means for hosting the system and which may receive a Community grant for that purpose | 
310 | Legal basis The regulation has its legal basis in Article 66 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community. The reference to the Treaty is the same as the one of the act to be amended. The decision has its legal basis in Art. 30 (1) (a), Article 31 (1) (a) and (b) and Article 34 (2) (c) of the Treaty on European Union. The reference to the Treaty is the same as the one of the act to be amended. | 
320 | Subsidiarity principle | 
321 | The objective of the proposed action, namely the establishment of a common information system regarding certain categories of persons and objects through a computerised information system, cannot be achieved by the Member States individually. | 
324 | The SIS II is necessary for the implementation of common policies of the European Union. It is notably a pre-condition to guarantee an area without internal border checks. | 
327 | The Community task is limited to the development of the central part of the SIS II and its communications infrastructure. Member States are responsible for developing their national systems that shall guarantee access by the end-users to the services provided by SIS II. | 
The proposals, therefore, comply with the subsidiarity principle. | 
Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason. | 
331 | Member States have full discretion as regards the administrative and financial arrangements for implementing their national systems. The national preparations must, however, fit with the overall planning for the development of the SIS II. The Commission is providing the technical specifications for the national interfaces that will allow smooth connection and flawless data exchange between the national systems and the SIS II. | 
332 | The Regulation (EC) 2424/2001 and the Decision 2001/886/JHA, both to be amended, lay down a regulatory procedure for the SIS II implementing measures that have serious financial implications for the budgets of the Member States and which remains applicable. | 
Choice of instruments | 
341 | Proposed instruments: a regulation and a decision. | 
342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason. The objective of the proposed Regulation is to amend another Regulation while the objective of the proposed Decision is to amend another Decision, therefore, following the principle of "formal parallelism" the amending act must take the same form as the act to be amended. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 
401 | The extension of the mandate and the completion of the SIS II development in 2007 will require some additional financial resources that are already foreseen in the PDB (Preliminary Draft Budget) 2007. The additional costs will be linked to the network, resizing of the central system and support at the sites where the system will be developed. |

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES 
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term 
The objective of the proposal is the amendment of the aforementioned regulation and decision in order to : 
2. Extend the deadline for the development of the SIS II until 31 December 2007 and to allow for the allocation of the budget required for the completion of the SIS II development including the provision of the communications infrastructure 
3. Designate the sites for the central unit (Strasbourg, France) and backup central unit (Sankt Johann in Pongau, Austria) including the obligation for the competent Member States to provide the infrastructure and means and which may receive a Community grant for that purpose. 
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy 
The proposal concerns a continuation of the development of SIS II by the Commission, which is ongoing since 2002. 
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework 
The overall objective is to complete the project for the SIS II development in the designated sites in 2007, some of the actions foreseen for 2006 will continue therefore in 2007. Furthermore, several new actions are foreseen in order to minimise the impact of the delays due to the different factors such as the Court cases or the complexity of the project. This concerns in particular increased network costs, additional resources and delegation of preparatory work to Member States. Lastly, the computer hardware capacity could be increased, to take into account the results of studies during the start of development The following actions are foreseen for 2007: 
Action 1: Network 
Following the results of the requirement analysis during the design phase, the capacity of the network has to be increased to cope with the response times for SIS II queries. A network with higher bandwidth will imply additional financial resources. 
Due to the non-availability of the s-Testa network on time, alternative interim solutions for testing the SIS II have had to be set up. This will imply additional costs to migrate from the interim network to the final network. 
Action 2: Specialised technical expertise and Additional studies 
In order to reach the required level of IT expertise additional resources are needed. Due to the limited internal resources, high quality external assistance will be used for follow up, audit and evaluation. Furthermore, additional studies and external expertise is necessary, in particular for security and network issues. 
Action 3: Support and continuous site preparation during development phase 
The preparations at the French and Austrian sites have started during the development phase and require significant resources. Some of the tasks regarding the preparation will not be directly performed by Commission staff, but will be entrusted to the Member States where the systems are hosted during the development phase. Additional budget is needed to cover the estimated needs in these fields. 
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative) 
X Centralised Management 
X directly by the Commission 
( indirectly by delegation to: 
( executive Agencies 
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation 
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission 
( Shared or decentralised management 
( with Member States 
( with Third countries 
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify) 
Relevant comments: 
Part of the budget for 2007 may be attributed to Member States or national public-sector bodies, either by sub-delegation or as subvention, in order to finance the preparation of the sites hosting the systems or the communication infrastructure. 
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
