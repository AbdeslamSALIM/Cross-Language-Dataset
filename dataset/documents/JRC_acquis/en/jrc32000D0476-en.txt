Commission Decision 
of 17 July 2000 
authorising Member States to permit temporarily the marketing of seed of certain species not satisfying the requirements of Council Directive 66/401/EEC 
(notified under document number C(2000) 1782) 
(2000/476/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed(1), as last amended by Directive 98/96/EC(2), and in particular Article 17 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) In Sweden the quantity of available seed of spring varieties of field pea (Pisum sativum) suitable to the national climatic conditions and which satisfies the requirements of the said Directive in relation to the germination capacity is insufficient and is therefore not adequate to meet this country's needs. 
(2) It is not possible to cover this demand satisfactorily with seed from other Member States, or from third countries, satisfying all the requirements laid down in the Directive. 
(3) Sweden should therefore be authorised to permit for a period expiring on 30 June 2000, the marketing of seed of the field pea variety %quot%Carneval%quot% subject to less stringent requirements. 
(4) Moreover, other Member States which are able to supply Sweden with seed of the abovementioned variety should be authorised to permit the marketing of such seed. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:

(a) the germination capacity is at least 72 %, 
(b) the official label shall state the germination ascertained in the report on official seed testing
