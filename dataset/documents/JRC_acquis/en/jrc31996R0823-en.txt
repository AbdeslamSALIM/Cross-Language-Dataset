Commission Regulation (EC) No 823/96 of 3 May 1996 amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/95 laying down special detailed rules of application for export refunds on milk and milk products, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1953/82 and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 
COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 823/96 of 3 May 1996 amending Regulation (EC) No 1466/95 laying down special detailed rules of application for export refunds on milk and milk products, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1953/82 and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2931/95 (2), and in particular Articles 13 (3) and 17 (14) thereof, 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1466/95 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 592/96 (4), lays down special detailed rules of application for export refunds on milk and milk products; 
Whereas experience gained shows it is necessary to clarify the arrangements introduced by Article 1a and the provisions on tolerance set out in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1466/95; 
Whereas, in the framework of the consultations with Switzerland on the implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round, it was agreed to apply a set of measures providing in particular for a reduction in the customs duties on certain Community cheeses imported into Switzerland; whereas the Community origin of such products should be guaranteed; whereas, to that end, export licences should be compulsory for all cheese exported under the arrangements, including cheese on which export refunds are not payable; whereas licences should be issued subject to presentation by the exporter of a declaration certifying the Community origin of the product; whereas this system replaces that provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1953/82 of 6 July 1982 laying down special conditions for the export of certain cheeses to certain third countries (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3337/94 (6), which may accordingly be repealed; 
Whereas footnote 6 in Sector 9 of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 310/96 (8), fixes the minimum value of certain cheeses qualifying under the export refund arrangements; whereas, for the sake of consistency and clarity, those provisions should be incorporated into Regulation (EC) No 1466/95; whereas, given the trend in market prices and in order for the refund arrangements to achieve their full economic impact, that minimum value should be increased and it should apply to all cheeses; 
Whereas the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
