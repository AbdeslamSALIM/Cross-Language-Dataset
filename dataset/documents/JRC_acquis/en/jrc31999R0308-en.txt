COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 308/1999 of 8 February 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 850/98 (4) exhibits a number of omissions, textual errors and editorial inadequacies;

Whereas the method by which the size of a spinous spider crab must be determined is considered to be impractical and has therefore to be revised; 
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 850/98 should therefore be amended,
