of 22 July 2003 
amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2), 
After consulting the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), 
Whereas: 
(1) The war launched in March 2003 against Iraq and the political developments that followed, as well as the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), have seriously affected the air transport operations of air carriers and have triggered a significant reduction in demand in the beginning of the summer 2003 scheduling season. 
(2) In order to make sure that the non-utilisation of slots allocated for the 2003 season does not cause air carriers to lose their entitlement to those slots, it is necessary to provide clearly and unambiguously that the 2003 and 2004 scheduling seasons are adversely affected by the war and the SARS outbreak. 
(3) Regulation (EEC) No 95/93(4) should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
