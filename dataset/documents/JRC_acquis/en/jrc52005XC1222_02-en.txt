Information concerning complaint No 2005/4347 
(2005/C 325/06) 
On 18 October 2005 the Commission addressed Italy a letter for formal notice concerning the abovementioned complaint, regarding the management of water in the Lago d'Idro area, with reference to a site of relevance under Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora. 
This infringement procedure does not relate to the violation of the provisions of Directive 92/43/EEC in the specific case, but to the violation of Article 10 EC Treaty due to the failure by Italy to cooperate with the Commission in providing the information requested by the Commission.
