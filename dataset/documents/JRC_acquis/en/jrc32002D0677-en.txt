(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for the possibility of financial participation by the Community in programmes for the eradication and control of animal diseases. Each year, Member States are to submit the programmes for which they wish to receive a financial contribution. 
(2) An evaluation system must be in place for the purposes of assessing progress made during implementation of eradication and control programmes. The evaluation system should include a reporting system to provide epidemiological data from the programmes. Harmonisation of such a reporting system is desirable.

(4) Criteria for the eradication and control programmes provided in Decision 90/424/EEC, Article 24, (2) have been established by Council Decision 90/638/EEC(3). 
(5) Decision 90/638/EEC, Annex 1, Point 13, provides that eradication programmes submitted by the Member States to the Commission for co-financing shall contain at least, where necessary, rules for adequate compensation to farmers for slaughtered animals as soon as possible. 
(6) It is appropriate to provide that in the absence of such rules compensation should be paid within 90 days. 
(7) This Decision replaces Commission Decision 2000/322/EC of 13 April 2000 laying down standard requirements for the reports submitted for programmes for the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases approved for co-financing by the Community(4), which should be repealed as from the date on which this Decision becomes applicable.
