THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 338/91 (2) applies until the end of the 1997 marketing year, pending the setting up of Community carcase classification standards; whereas sufficient progress has not been made to permit the replacement of the current Community standard quality by the standards in question; whereas the current standard quality should therefore be retained; 
Whereas, in view of the conclusions of the Commission report on the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 (3), the goal set itself by the Council of making the use of the Community scale compulsory for all Community slaughterhouses approved for intra-Community trade, if possible during the 1999 marketing year and in any event before 1 January 2000, should not for the moment be pursued; and the possibility should, however, be reserved of re-examining this goal on the basis of a report that the Commission shall submit before 31 July 2002; 
Whereas in order to facilitate price reporting, Member States should be authorized to subdivide category C in Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2137/92 into two subcategories,
