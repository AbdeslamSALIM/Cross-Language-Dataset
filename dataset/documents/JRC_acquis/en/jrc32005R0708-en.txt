Description— 
North Alentejo olive oil is a slightly thick, fruity, greenish-yellow oil that meets the minimum grade of 6,5 for extra virgin olive oil and 6,0 for virgin olive oil. 
In-depth studies conducted on the characteristics of this olive oil have shown that there is a need to revise some of its parameters, namely: Delta K, triglicerides LLL, OLLn, PLLn, OLL, PLL, POL, POO, OOO, PPO; fatty acids C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C17:1, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3; trans fatty acids, cholesterol, Campestanol and Delta 7 — Stigmasterol. 
The regional varieties Carrasquenha, Redondil and Azeiteira (or Azeitoneira) are added to the authorised varieties. 
- the same conditions obtain in these municipalities and freguesias with regard to soils and weather patterns, 
- the olive oil produced there has the same physical, chemical and organoleptic characteristics as that obtained in the current geographical area, 
- the inhabitants of these municipalities have inherited the same customs and authentic, unvarying know-how as those in the rest of the geographical area.

Name: "Azeites do Norte Alentejano" 
Description: 
The designation "Azeite do Norte Alentejano" is used to describe the oily liquid extracted mechanically from the fruit (once the vegetable water has been separated from the pomace, particles of skin, pulp and pits) of olives of the Galega, Carrasquenha, Redondil, Azeiteira or Azeitoneira, Blanqueta or Branquita and Cobrançosa varieties of the species Olea europea sativa grown in olive groves located in the abovementioned geographical area, processing and market preparation being carried out in the same area. 
North Alentejo olives are slightly thick, fruity and greenish-yellow olives that meet the minimum grade of 6,5 for extra virgin olive oil and 6,0 for olive oil. 
Geographical area: Limited to the municipalities of Alandroal, Borba, Estremoz, the freguesias of Na Sra de Machede, S. Mansos, S. Vicente do Pigeiro, S. Miguel de Machede and S. Bento do Mato in the municipality of Évora, the freguesias of Luz and Mourão in the municipality of Mourão, the municipalities of Redondo, Reguengos de Monsaraz and Vila Viçosa in the district of Évora, the municipalities of Alter do Chão, Arronches, Avis, Campo Maior, Castelo de Vide, Crato, Elvas, Fronteira, Marvão, Monforte, Nisa, Portalegre and Sousel in the district of Portalegre. 
Proof of origin: 
Origin sanctioned by custom in the light in particular of the regional culinary tradition and the know-how existing since time immemorial. 
To produce the olive oil, the processors can only use olives from registered producers and of authorised varieties. 
A descriptive register of each operator approved by the PDO management consortium is kept updated with information on the origin of the olives used, the actual conditions of production/take-over and the technological conditions applying. 
This daily register must show the names of the olive suppliers, the quantities received from each producer and the quantity of olive oil produced. 
The varieties must be recorded by the olive growers or their representatives (cooperatives). 
The producers must have and keep updated a register in which the quantities of olives to be used for producing olive oil bearing the PDO Norte Alentejano are recorded. 
Mandatory variety | Galega | Minimum 65 % | 
Varieties tolerated | Azeiteira; Blanqueta; Carrasquenha; Redondil | Maximum 5 % | 
Cobrançosa | Maximum 10 % | 
Mandatory variety | Galega | Minimum 50 % | 
Varieties tolerated | Azeiteira; Carrasquenha; Redondil; Cobrançosa | Maximum 10 % | 
Blanqueta | Maximum 5 % | 
Method of production: 
The Picual variety may not be used under any circumstances; however, other traditional varieties may be used up to a maximum of 5 % on condition that they are authorised by the PDO management consortium. 
The fruit must be gathered when it reaches the ideal ripening stage; olives collected from the ground may not be used to produce oil bearing the designation of origin; they must be transported in stackable boxes with provision for aeration. 
The varieties must be recorded by the olive growers or their representatives; for the purposes of producing olive oil bearing the PDO, presses may only accept olives from registered producers, of authorised varieties and of impeccable health and hygiene. 
The temperature of the paste in the press or decanter and the water/oil mix in the centrifuge may never exceed 35 °C. 
As olive oil is a miscible product, in order to prevent any impairment of traceability at the time of inspection, market preparation may be carried out solely by properly approved operators in the area of origin in order to guarantee the quality and authenticity of the product and to prevent consumers from being misled. The oil must be put up for market in recipients made from impermeable, inert, innocuous materials that meet all health and hygiene standards. 
Link: The special characteristics of the olive oil can be put down to the soil and climatic conditions in the region.
