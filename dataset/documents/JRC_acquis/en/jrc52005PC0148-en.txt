Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 27/2005, as concerns fishing opportunities in Greenland, Faroese and Icelandic waters and fishing for cod in the North Sea, and amending Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004, as concerns fishing opportunities for deep-sea sharks and roundnose grenadier 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 fixes the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of stocks applicable in Community waters and for Community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required for 2005. 
1. On 14 February 2005 the Greenland authorities informed the Commission that the Community in 2005 has access to fish 1000 tonnes of snow crab in Greenland waters. The necessary measures should be taken to implement the new fishing possibilities in Community legislation. 
2. On 15 February 2005 the annual fisheries consultations on mutual fishing opportunities for 2005 were concluded between the Community and Iceland. The necessary measures should be taken to implement the results of the consultations in Community legislation 
3. The derogation from days present within the area and absent from port in Table I of Annex IVa to Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 for vessels using 120mm square mesh windows was only ever intended for the Kattegat and Skagerrak. Due to the refinement of the gear categorisations the reduction in days available in the Kattegat and Skagerrak has been from 22 days in 2004 to 12 days with a square mesh window or 9 days without, which represents a very significant decrease in fishing effort. In the North Sea 12 days would however represent an increase in effort from the 10 days available in 2004 that cannot be justified by the introduction of the square mesh window and would be contrary to the Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks[1]. The fishing days available to vessels fishing in the North Sea with a towed gear using 120 mm square mesh windows should therefore be reduced to 9 days. 
4. Annex IVc contains a technical error that means if a vessel is fishing under Annex IVc it may not be able to subsequently use any days under Annex IVa even if it has days left in both areas. The error needs to be corrected. 
Council Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 fixes the fishing opportunities for Community vessels for certain deep-sea species in 2005-2006. 
1. The black scabbard fisheries around the Azores take a by-catches of deep-sea sharks. To avoid unnecessary discarding it is therefore appropriate to provide for the by-catch quota for these species. It is estimated that the total black scabbard catch in the waters of the Azores will amount to 700 tonnes generating catches of deep-sea sharks of approximately 120 tonnes. No direct fisheries for deep-sea sharks will be allowed. 
2. The fishing opportunities for roundnose grenadier in ICES division Vb and sub-areas VI and VII was wrongly allocated to Member States and should be corrected. 
The Council is requested to adopt this proposal as soon as possible in order to allow fishermen to plan their activities for this fishing season. 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
amending Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 , as concerns fishing opportunities in Greenland, Faroese and Icelandic waters and fishing for cod in the North Sea, and amending Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004, as concerns fishing opportunities for deep- sea sharks and roundnose grenadier 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy[2], and in particular Article 20 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks[3], and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[4], 
Whereas: 
1. Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005[5] fixes for 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required. 
2. In accordance with the procedure provided for in the Agreement on fisheries and the marine environment between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland [6], the Community has held consultations on fishing rights for 2005 with Iceland. The outcome of the consultations has to be implemented in Regulation (EC) No 27/2005. 
3. The Greenland authorities have notified the Commission that the Community has access to 1 000 tonnes of snow crab in Greenland waters. 
4. It is not in conformity with Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 423/2004 of 26 February 2004 establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks [7] to allocate more days of fishing per calendar month in the North Sea when fishing with towed gears with 120 mm square mesh windows. The North Sea should therefore be deleted from the list of areas to which that allocation of supplemental days is applicable. 
5. The fishing opportunities for deep-sea sharks in ICES sub-area X (Community waters and international waters) should be increased to 120 tonnes thereby allowing deep-sea sharks that are taken as unavoidable by-catches in other fisheries to be landed. 
6. The rules on the interactions of fishing between areas defined in Annex IVa and Annex IVc to Council Regulation (EC) No 27/2005 should not prevent a vessel from using the maximum number of days avaliable in Annex IVa. Those rules should therefore be amended. 
7. Council Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 of 22 December 2004 fixes for 2005 and 2006 the fishing opportunities for Community fishing vessels for certain deep-sea stocks[8] 
8. The fishing opportunities for roundnose grenadier in ICES division Vb, sub-areas VI and VII (Community waters and international waters) were inappropriately calculated in Regulation (EC) No 2270/2004 and should be corrected. 
9. Regulations (EC) No 27/2005 and (EC) No 2270/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,
