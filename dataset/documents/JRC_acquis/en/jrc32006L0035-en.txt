Commission Directive 2006/35/EC 
of 24 March 2006 
amending Annexes I to IV to Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community [1], and in particular point (c) of the second paragraph of Article 14 thereof, 
After consulting the Member States concerned, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 2000/29/EC provides for certain measures against the introduction into the Member States from other Member States or third countries of organisms which are harmful to plants or plant products. It also provides for certain zones to be recognised as protected zones. 
(2) From information supplied by Portugal, it appears that Bemisia tabaci Genn. (European populations) is now established in the Alentejo region and in some communes of the Ribatejo e Oeste region. These parts of the Portuguese territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism. 
(3) From information supplied by Slovenia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in the Gorenjska and Maribor regions. These regions should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. 
(4) From information supplied by Slovakia, it appears that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in certain communes of the Dunajská Streda, Levice, Topoľčany, Poltár, Rožňava and Trebišov Counties. These communes should no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. 
(5) Italy has submitted information showing that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in some parts of its territory. Those parts of the Italian territory should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. 
(6) Lithuania has submitted information showing that Beet necrotic yellow vein virus is now established in its territory. Lithuania should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of Beet necrotic yellow vein virus. 
(7) The relevant Annexes to Directive 2000/29/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,
