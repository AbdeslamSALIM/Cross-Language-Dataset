THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91 of 16 December 1991 introducing specific measures in respect of certain agricultural products for the benefit of the French overseas departments (1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3714/92 (2), and in particular Article 2 (6) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Azores and Madeira relating to certain agricultural products (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3714/92, and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Canary Islands with regard to certain agricultural products (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3714/92, and in particular Article 3 (4) thereof, 
Whereas the quantities of products benefiting from the specific supply arrangements must be determined within the framework of periodic forecast supply balances which may be adjusted on the basis of the essential requirements of the markets and taking account of local production and traditional trade flows; whereas to ensure coverage of requirements in terms of quantity, price and quality and to ensure that the proportion of products supplied from the Community is preserved, the aid to be granted for products originating in the rest of the Community must be determined on terms equivalent, for the end user, to the advantage resulting from exemption from import duties on imports of products from third countries; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 388/92 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1497/93 (6), establishes, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91, the forecast supply balance for cereal products for the French overseas departments; whereas this balance allows for interchange of the quantities determined for some of the products concerned and, if necessary, for an increase during the year in the overall quantity determined; whereas, in the light of experience and in order to meet the needs of the French overseas departments, it is necessary to adjust the forecast supply balance; whereas the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 388/92 should therefore be amended; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1727/92 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1497/93, establishes, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92, the forecast supply balance for cereal products for the Azores and Madeira for 1992/93; whereas the forecast supply balance for the 1993/94 marketing year should accordingly be established; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1728/92 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1497/93, establishes, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92, the forecast supply balance for cereal products for the Canary Islands for 1992/93; whereas the forecast supply balance for the 1993/94 marketing year should accordingly be established; 
Whereas the time limit for the submission of applications for aid certificates and the amount of the security to be lodged laid down in Article 4 (1) of Regulations (EEC) No 388/92 and (EEC) No 1727/92 respectively are fixed as the first five working days of each month in the case of the time limit and ECU 25/tonne in the case of the amount of the security; whereas the time limit and security are fixed as the first 10 working days and ECU 25/tonne respectively by the same Article of Regulation (EEC) No 1738/92; whereas in order to take account of trade practices specific to certain processed products in the cereals sector provision should be made on the one hand for the option of submitting applications on any day of the month and, on the other hand, for reducing the amount of the security; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,
