(2) The data concerning, firstly, the quantities of bananas marketed in the Community in 2004, and in particular the actual imports, especially during the first quarter, and secondly, the supply and consumption prospects on the Community market during the same first quarter for 2005, result in indicative quantities being fixed for tariff quotas A and B and C so as to ensure adequate supplies for the whole of the Community, and the continuation of trade flows between the production and marketing sectors.

(4) In view of the fact that this Regulation must apply before the start of the period for the submission of licence applications for the first quarter of 2005, provision should be made for this Regulation to enter into force immediately. 
(5) This Regulation must apply to operators established in the Community as constituted on 30 April 2004 since Commission Regulation (EC) No 1892/2004 [3] adopted transitional measures for imports of bananas into the Community by reason of the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.
