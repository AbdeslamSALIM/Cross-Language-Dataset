Unless otherwise specified in the method of analysing, all of the reagents must be analysis-pure (a. p.). Where trace elements are to be analysed the purity of the reagents must be checked by means of a blank test. Depending upon the result obtained, it might be necessary to conduct a further purification. 
2. Water 
The dissolution, dilution, rinsing or washing operations mentioned in the methods of analysis without stating precisely what the nature of the solvent or diluent is, imply the use of water. Normally, the water will have to be demineralized or distilled. In these specific instances, as mentioned in the method of analysis, that water will have to be subjected to specific purification processes. 
3. Laboratory equipment 
In view of the equipment normally used in inspection laboratories, the apparatus described in the methods of analysis is restricted to special instruments and apparatus or to such demanded by any specific requirements. This equipment must be perfectly clean, above all where small quantities are to be determined. The laboratory will have to ensure the accuracy of any graduated glassware used by referring to the standards.

PROCEDURE 
7.1 
Test sample 
Weigh out five to ten grams of the sample to an accuracy of one milligram and place in the thimble of the Soxhlet apparatus (5.2). 
7.2 
Extraction of the sulphur 
Wash thoroughly the contents with hot water to remove all soluble compounds. Dry in the oven at 90 gC (5.4) for at least one hour. Place the filter in the Soxhlet apparatus (5.2). 
Place a few glass beads in the flask of the apparatus (5.1) and weigh (P0), than add 50 millilitres of carbon disulphide (4.1). 
Connect the apparatus and leave the elemental sulphur to be extracted for six hours. Switch off the heat and, after cooling, disconnect the flask. Connect the flask to the rotary evaporator (5.3) and evaporate until the contents of the flask have solidified in a spongy mass. 
Dry the flask in the oven at 90 gC (5.4) (generally one hour is necessary) until a constant weight is obtained (P1). 
7.3 
Determination of the purity of the elemental sulphur 
Certain substances may have been extracted by the carbon disulphide at the same time as the elemental sulphur. The purity of the elemental sulphur is determined as follows: 
homogenize the contents of the flask as thoroughly as possible, and remove two to three grams, weighed to an accuracy of one milligram (n). Place in the Petri dish (5.5). Weigh dish and contents together (P2). Place on the hot plate (5.6) set at a temperature not exeeding 220 gC so as not to cause combustion of the sulphur. Continue sublimation for three or four hours until a constant weight is obtained (P3). 
NB: For some fertilizers, it may not be necessary to determine how pure the sulphur is. In this case, omit step 7.2.

4.1 
Standard 0,05 molar solution of magnesium: 
4.1.1 
Dissolve 1,232 grams of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4 7H2O) in the 0,5 M hydrochloric acid solution (4.11) and make up to 100 millilitres with the same acid. 
or: 
4.1.2 
Weigh out 2,016 grams of magnesium oxide, previously calcined to remove all traces of carbonation. Place it in a beaker with 100 millilitres of water. 
Stir in approximately 120 millilitres of approximately 1 M hydrochloric acid (4.12). 
After dissolution, transfer quantitatively into a graduated 1 000 millilitre flask. Make up to volume and mix. 
One millilitre of these solutions should contain 1,216 milligrams of Mg (= 2,016 milligrams of MgO). 
The laboratory is responsible for testing the strength of this standard solution. 
4.2 
0,05 molar solution of EDTA 
Weigh out 18,61 grams of the dihydrated disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic 
(C10H14N2Na2O82H2O), place it in a 1 000 millilitre beaker and dissolve in 600 to 800 millilitres 
of water. Transfer the solution quantitatively into a graduated 1 000 millilitre flask. Make up the volume and mix. Check this solution with the standard solution (4.1) by taking a sample of 20 millilitres of the latter and by titration according to the analytical procedure described at (7.2). 
One millilitre of the EDTA solution should correspond to 1,216 milligrams of Mg (= 2,016 milligrams of MgO) and to 2,004 milligrams of Ca (= 2,804 milligrams CaO) (see remarks 10.1 and 10.6). 
4.3 
0,05 molar standard solution of calcium 
Weigh out 5,004 grams of dry calcium carbonate. Place it in a beaker with 100 millilitres of water. Progressively stir in 120 millilitres of approximately 1 M hydrochloric acid (4.12). 
Bring to the boil in order to drive off the carbon dioxide, cool, transfer quantitatively into a graduated one-litre flask, make up the volume with water and mix. Check this solution against the EDTA solution (4.2) following analytical procedure (7.3). One millilitre of this solution should contain 2,004 milligrams of Ca (= 2,804 milligrams of CaO) and should correspond to one millilitre of the 0,05 molar EDTA solution (4.2). 
4.4 
Calcein indicator 
Carefully mix in a mortar one gram of calcein with 100 grams of sodium chloride. Use 10 milligrams of this mixture. The indicator changes from green to orange. Titration must be carried out until an orange is obtained which is free from green tinges. 
4.5 
Calcon carbonic acid indicator. 
Dissolve 400 milligrams of calcon carbonic acid in 100 millilitres of methanol. This solution may only be kept for approximately four weeks. Use three drops of this solution. The indicator changes from red to blue. Titration must be carried out until a blue is obtained which is free from red tinges. 
4.6 
Eriochrome black-T indicator 
Dissolve 300 milligrams of Eriochrome black-T in a mixture of 25 millilitres of propanol-1 and 15 millilitres of triethanolamine. This solution may only be kept for approximately four weeks. Use three drops of this solution. This indicator turns from red to blue and titration must be carried out until a blue is obtained which is free from red tinges. It changes colour only when magnesium is present. If necessary add one millilitre of the standard solution (4.1). 
When both calcium and magnesium are present the EDTA first forms a complex with the calcium and then with the magnesium. In that case two elements are determined concurrently.

CONTROL TEST 
Carry out a determination on aliquot parts of solutions (4.1 and 4.3) such that the Ca/Mg ratio is approximately equal to that of the solution to be analysed. To this end take (a) of standard solution (4.3) and (b-a) of standard solution (4.1). (a) and (b) are the numbers of millilitre EDTA solution used in the two titrations performed on the solution to be analysed. This procedure is correct only if the solutions of EDTA, calcium and magnesium are exactly equivalent. If this is not the case, it is necesary to make corrections.

Neutralize the surplus acid with the 5 M sodium hydroxide solution (4.13) using the pH meter. Dilute with water to about 100 millilitres. Add 10 millilitres of the KOH/KCN solution (4.8) and the indicator (4.4) or (4.5). Stirring gently with the stirrer (5.1) titrate with the EDTA solution (4.2) (see 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4).

M 
=

10. 
REMARKS 
10.1. 
The stoichiometric EDTA-metal ratio in the complexometric analyses is always 1:1 whatever the valency of the metal and in spite of the fact that EDTA is quadrivalent. The EDTA titration solution and the standard solutions will therefore be molar and not normal. 
10.2. 
Complexometric indicators are often sensitive to air. The solution may lose colour during titration. In this case, one or two drops of indicator must be added. This is true particulary in the case of eriochrome black and calcon carbonic acid. 
10.3. 
The metal-indicator complexes are often relatively stable and it may take some time for the colour to change. The last drops of EDTA must therefore be added slowly and a drop of 0,05 molar solution of magnesium (4.1) or calcium (4.3) added to ensure that the colour change has not already taken place. This is particularly true in the case of the eriochrome-magnesium complex. 
10.4 
The turning of the indicator must be observed not vertically, but horizontally across the solution and the beaker must be placed against a white background in a well-lit position. The turning of the indicator may also be observed easily by placing the beaker on frosted glass lit moderately from below (25 watt lamp). 
10.5. 
This analysis requires a certain amount of experience. The task will involve, inter alia, observing the colour changes of standard solutions 4.1 and 4.3. It is recommended that the determinations be carried out by the same laboratory chemist. 
10.6. 
If an EDTA solution of guaranteed strength is used (Titrisol, Normex, for example) this may simplify the control of the equivalence of standard solutions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3. 
10.7. 
The solutions containing potassium cyanide must not be poured down the sink until the cyanide has been converted into a harmless compound, for example, by oxidization with sodium hypochlorite following alkalinzation.

PROCEDURE 
6.1. 
Sampling of the solution 
Pipette an aliquot part of one of the extraction solutions indicated at 2 containing between 20 and 100 milligrams of S or 50 and 250 milligrams of SO3. 
Place this aliquot in a beaker of suitable capacity. Add 20 millilitres of dilute hydrochloric acid (4.1). Make up to about 300 millilitres with water.

Preparation of the precipitate 
Bring the solution to the boil. Add, drop by drop, about 20 millilitres of the barium chloride solution (4.2) while stirring the solution vigorously. Boil for a few minutes. 
Place the beaker, covered with a watch glass, in a boiling hot water bath (5.2) for an hour. Then leave standing hot (± 60 °C) until the supernatant liquor is clear. Decant the clear solution through a slow filtration ash-free filter. Wash the precipitate several times with hot water. Continue to wash the precipitate on the filter until the filtrate is chloride free. This can be checked by using silver nitrate solution (4.3). 
6.3. 
Incineration and weighing of the precipitate 
Place the filter paper and precipitate in a porcelain cruible (5.1) previously weighed to the nearest 0,1 milligrams. Dry in the oven (5.3) and ash at approximately 800 °C for half an hour (5.4). Allow to cool in a desiccator and weigh to within 0,1 milligrams.

DETERMINATION 
Prepare the spectrophotometer (5.1) for the measurements at 589,3 nm. Calibrate the instrument by measuring the response of the calibration solutions (6.2). Then adjust the sensitivity of the instrument to use its entire scale when the most concentrated calibration solution is used. Then measure the response of the sample solution to be analysed (7). Repeat this operation three times. 
9. 
CALCULATION OF RESULTS 
Draw a calibration curve by plotting the average response for each calibration solution along the ordinate and the corresponding concentrations, expressed in mg per millilitre on the abscissa. Determine from this the sodium concentration of the test solution. Calculate the quantity of sodium from the standard solutions taking account of the levels of dilution. Express the results as a percentage of the sample.
