THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff [1], and in particular Article 9(1)(a) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The classification of a video conferencing system consisting of various components including two installation diskettes in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2184/97 of 3 November 1997 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature [2] has led to classifications under CN code 85175090 for the video conferencing system and 85249110 for the two installation diskettes. Since Note 6 to Chapter 85 of the Combined Nomenclature was amended with effect from 1 January 2002 and in view of the fact that the HS Committee agreed in October 2004 on the interpretation of this Note, Regulation (EC) No 2184/97 is to be considered as incorrect. 
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2184/97 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(3) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
