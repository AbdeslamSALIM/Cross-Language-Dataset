Calculation of the uniform call rate for VAT own resources (Article 2(4) of Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom): 
Uniform rate (%) = Maximum call rate – frozen rate | 
A. The maximum call rate is set at 0,50 % for 2005. | 
B. Determination of the rate frozen by the correction of budgetary imbalances granted to the United Kingdom (Article 2(4)(b) of Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom): | 
(1) calculation of the theoretical share of the countries with a restricted financial burden: | 
In accordance with Article 5(1) of Decision 2000/597/EC, Euratom, the financial contribution of Germany (DE), the Netherlands (NL), Austria (AT) and Sweden (SE) is restricted to a quarter of their normal contribution. | 
Formula for a country with a restricted financial burden, for example Germany: | 
Germany's theoretical VAT contribution = [Germany's capped VAT base / (EU capped VAT base – UK capped VAT base)] × 1/4 × United Kingdom correction | 
Example: Germany | 
Germany’s theoretical VAT contribution = 9683287000/(48713466000 – 9378285500) × 1/4 × 5115150953 = 314803912 | 
(2) calculation of the frozen rate: | 
Frozen rate = [UK correction – theoretical VAT contributions (D + NL + A + S)]/[EU capped VAT base – capped VAT bases (UK+ D + NL + A + S)] | 
Frozen rate = [5115150953 – (314803912 + 73329289 + 35991362 + 40197704)]/[48713466000 – (9378285500 + 9683287000 + 2255590000 + 1107085000 + 1236471000)] | 
Frozen rate = 0,18564146250792 % | 
Uniform rate | 
0,5 % – 0,18564146250792 % = 0,31435853749208 % |

Remarks 
Former Item XX 01 01 01 (in part) 
With the exception of staff serving in third countries, this appropriation is intended to cover, in respect of officials and temporary staff holding posts on the establishment plan: 
- salaries, allowances and other payments related to salaries, 
- accident and sickness insurance and other social security charges, 
- unemployment insurance for temporary staff and payments to be made by the Commission to temporary staff to constitute or maintain pension rights for them in their country of origin, 
- miscellaneous allowances and grants, 
- in respect of officials and temporary staff, allowances for shift work or standby duty at the official's place of work or at home, 
- compensatory allowances granted to officials of the European Coal and Steel Community who suffered a reduction in their net salary, 
- allowances in the event of dismissal of a probationary official for obvious inadequacy, 
- allowances in the event of cancellation by the institution of the contract of a temporary staff member, 
- reimbursement of expenditure on security measures at the homes of officials working in offices and delegations in the Community, 
- flat-rate allowances and payments at hourly rates for overtime worked by officials and auxiliary staff in categories C and D which cannot be compensated for, under the arrangements laid down, by free time, 
- the cost of weightings applied to the remuneration of officials and temporary staff and the cost of weightings applied to the part of emoluments transferred to a country other than the country of employment, 
- travel expenses due to officials and temporary staff (including their families) on taking up duty, leaving the institution or transfer to another place of employment, 
- installation and resettlement allowances due to officials and temporary staff obliged to change their place of residence on taking up duty, on transfer to a new place of employment and on finally leaving the institution and resettling elsewhere, 
- removal expenses due to officials and temporary staff obliged to change their place of residence on taking up duty, on transfer to a new place of employment and on finally leaving the institution and resettling elsewhere, 
- daily subsistence allowance for officials and temporary staff who furnish evidence that they must change their place of residence on taking up duty or transferring to a new place of employment, 
- transitional costs for officials assigned to posts in the new Member States prior to accession who are requested to remain in service in these Member States following the accession date, and who will be entitled, exceptionally, to the same financial and material conditions applied by the Commission before accession, in accordance with Annex X to the Staff Regulations and the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities laid down by Regulation (EEC, Euratom, ECSC) No 259/68, 
- the cost of any adjustments to remuneration approved by the Council during the financial year. 
The request for 700 new posts for 2005 is part of the overall increase of 3900 posts over a transitional period from 2003 to 2008 in line with a Commission estimate made in 2002. That estimate also covers enlargement-related needs. 
Over the last few years, the European Parliament has endorsed in principle the Commission's requests, subject to improved implementation and better management, full implementation of the reform of the Commission, compliance with the European Parliament's priorities and improved interinstitutional dialogue. 
At the start of the sixth parliamentary term and the term of office of the Commission appointed in 2004, the European Parliament, as the legislative and budgetary authority, and the new Commission have an opportunity to renew and improve their interinstitutional relationship. To make that possible, Parliament has decided to make provision for all the posts requested. 
The appropriations corresponding to 50 posts will be placed in the reserve. 
The appropriations will be released from the reserve once the new Commission has committed itself clearly to submitting, at the latest by 31 March 2005, a proposal for a limited revision of the Financial Regulation and its implementing rules in order to remove all obstacles to decision-taking and smooth budget execution. 
The amount of assigned revenue in accordance with Article 18(1)(e) to (j) of the Financial Regulation is estimated at EUR 31303000.

TITLE 01 
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL AFFAIRS 
Overall objectives 
Action in this policy area aims to ensure the smooth functioning of economic and monetary union (EMU) both inside and outside the European Union and to provide the Commission and the other Community institutions with high-quality advice on economic and financial questions. This entails monitoring economic developments in the European Union and in third countries, cooperating with international organisations and following international financial issues. 
The main objective for 2005 is to strengthen economic governance of EMU in order to ensure that Member States put in place and maintain efficient budgetary policies that will promote growth. Integration of the new Member States in EMU will continue in 2005, in the expectation that some of them will participate in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) and, subsequently, in the euro zone. Application of the stability and growth pact will also be strengthened by enhancing the coordination of economic and budgetary policies, better incorporating the issue of stability of the financial system into economic analysis and supporting the economic development of the Union’s neighbours through economic dialogue, timely economic advice and whenever appropriate, macrofinancial assistance. 
Operational activities include, notably, borrowing and lending under the Treaties, financial engineering programmes, treasury management and management of the Guarantee Fund, as well as implementation of macroeconomic aid to third countries.

TITLE 03 
COMPETITION 
Overall objectives 
The objective of the Commission in this area is to enforce the competition rules of the Community Treaties in order to ensure that competition in the European Union market is not distorted, thereby contributing to the welfare of consumers and the competitiveness of the European economy. 
Competition policy aims at protecting consumer welfare and at ensuring a level playing field for companies competing in the market, in particular by combating obstacles to parallel trade which distort the functioning of the internal market. Undistorted competition is also a key dimension of the enlargement process and a factor in Europe’s global competitiveness. The common currency calls for an even greater role for competition policy in order to further dynamically integrate markets. Hence, competition policy, including merger control, cartel enforcement, enforcement of the antitrust rules, market liberalisation, State aid control and international cooperation between competition authorities is one of the Commission’s key tasks under the Treaty.

TITLE 05 
AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
Overall objectives 
The objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP) derive directly from the Treaty and are, in particular, to stabilise markets, ensure a fair standard of living in the farming community and guarantee security of supplies. 
The CAP has been reformed a number of times since it was first introduced, most recently with the agreement signed in June 2003 in Luxembourg. The key aim of that reform, as part of Agenda 2000, was to shift the slant of the farm economy towards the market in order to make the agricultural sector more competitive. Reflecting the multipurpose application of agricultural activity, the CAP must also be fully compatible with sustainable development, in particular by promoting environmentally friendly production methods and the effective use of resources. Rural development, the second pillar of the CAP, aims at enhancing the competitiveness of rural areas and preserving the environment and rural heritage in order to secure the future of rural areas and promote job maintenance and creation. 
In 2005, the priorities for 2004 will be pursued, in particular as regards the implementation of the reforms adopted in 2003 and 2004, the operational application of the acquis in the new member countries and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations. These priorities are in addition to the regular activities of CAP.

Remarks 
These remarks apply to all the budget headings in this title (with the exception of Chapters 08 13 and 08 14). 
These appropriations will be used in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2321/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 concerning the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in, and for the dissemination of research results for, the implementation of the European Community sixth framework programme (2002 to 2006) (OJ L 355, 30.12.2002, p. 23) and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 2322/2002 of 5 November 2002 concerning the rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities in the implementation of the sixth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (2002 to 2006) (OJ L 355, 30.12.2002, p. 35). 
For all appropriations under this title the same definition of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as is used for the horizontal SME-specific programmes within the same framework programme will be applicable. That definition reads as follows: 'An eligible SME is a legal entity that complies with the SME definition set out in Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC and is not a research centre, research institute, contract research organisation or consultancy firm'. All research activities conducted pursuant to the sixth framework programme will be carried out in compliance with fundamental ethical principles (in accordance with Article 3 of Decision No 1513/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 232, 29.8.2002, p. 1)), including animal welfare requirements. This will include, in particular, the principles laid down in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Particular account will be taken of the need to step up efforts to enhance the participation and role of women in science and research. 
Also entered against these articles and items are the costs of high-level scientific and technological meetings, conferences, workshops and seminars of European interest organised by the Commission, the funding of high-level scientific and technological analyses and evaluations carried out on behalf of the Community to investigate new areas of research suitable for Community action, inter alia, in the context of the European Research Area, and measures to monitor and disseminate the results of the programmes, including measures under previous framework programmes. 
These appropriations also cover administrative expenditure, including expenditure on staff, whether covered by the Staff Regulations or not, information, publications, administrative and technical operation, and certain other expenditure items relating to internal infrastructure linked with the achievement of the objective of the measure of which they form an integral part, including the action and initiatives necessary for preparation and monitoring of the Community's RTD strategy. 
The participation of third countries or organisations from third countries in European cooperation in the field of scientific and technical research is possible in the case of some of these projects (particularly COST). Any financial contribution will be entered in Articles 6 0 1, 6 0 2 and 6 0 5 of the statement of revenue and may lead to additional appropriations being made available in accordance with Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1). 
Any revenue from third parties sharing the cost of projects with the Community (firms in European Free Trade Association Member States, industrial consortia, etc.) entered in Article 6 0 4 of the statement of revenue may give rise to additional appropriations being made available in accordance with Article 18 of the Financial Regulation. 
Any revenue from the contribution from candidate countries for participation in Community programmes, entered in Item 6 0 3 1 of the statement of revenue, may lead to additional appropriations being made available in accordance with Article 18(1)(d) of the Financial Regulation. 
Additional appropriations will be made available under Article 08 12 03.

TITLE 11 
FISHERIES 
Overall objectives 
This policy area includes all the activities covered by the common fisheries policy (CFP) which comes under the exclusive competence of the Community. It concerns all fisheries activities as well as the processing and marketing of these products. 
It also ensures that the relevant provisions of Community law are rightly applied in the fisheries sector. 
The policy area covers five operational activities: specific measures in support of the CFP (including conservation of fisheries resources, control and dialogue with fisheries sector), relations and agreements with third countries and international organisations, common organisation of the fisheries market, fisheries research and structural measures for fisheries through the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG). 
Sixty percent of appropriations is devoted to the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG). However, the FIFG operations are mainly implemented by the Member States as a part of decentralised management.

TITLE 20 
TRADE 
Overall objectives 
This domain aims to contribute, in the general interest, to the harmonious development of world trade, the gradual removal of restrictions to international trade and the reduction of customs barriers. 
An important pillar of the European Union’s economic relations with the rest of the world, it aims to promote the economic and political interests of the European Union. It covers all the main aspects of trade in goods and services (tariff and non-tariff barriers, trade protection measures, in particular in cases of dumping and subsidies, export credits) and the important issues of intellectual property, investment and competition. 
This policy area comprises two operational activities: trade policy and anti-dumping strategy.

TITLE 21 
DEVELOPMENT AND RELATIONS WITH AFRICAN, CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC (ACP) STATES 
Overall objectives 
The policy area covers a wide range of activities from political relations and policy formulation to programming and implementing cooperation programmes. It includes both budgetary appropriations under Heading 4 of the financial perspective and funds under the various European Development Funds (EDF) for the African, Caribbean and Pacific States as well as the overseas countries and territories. 
The amount of the EDF varies from year to year due to the five-year implementation cycle, and corresponds to approximately EUR 3,275 billion in commitment appropriations in 2004 compared to an overall total of about EUR 5 billion under Heading 4, of which about EUR 1 billion falls technically under this policy area. 
This implies that significant human resources, which are employed to implement the EDF and the complex operations under the Cotonou Agreement, are to be taken into account in the overall human resources requirements in this policy area.

TITLE 22 
ENLARGEMENT 
Overall objectives 
This policy area governs the actions, measures and initiatives necessary to ensure that the candidate countries stay on course to achieve the targets set with and for them by the European Council. 
This will involve: 
- implementing the accession road maps drawn up for Bulgaria and Romania and achieving the specific landmark targets set out in them for the short and medium term with a view to meeting the accession date of 2007, 
- managing the increased financial support granted to Bulgaria and Romania under the Phare programme aimed at helping them meet the structural, institutional, administrative and judicial requirements of EU membership, 
- monitoring closely Turkey’s progress in meeting the Copenhagen political criteria and the reform process in general, and implementing future decisions taken by the Council concerning the next stages of the accession process, 
- implementing the increase in pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey agreed by the Copenhagen European Council of December 2002, 
- monitoring and, if necessary, implementing Council decisions on the new applications from the Balkan countries. 
As far as the 10 new Member States are concerned, the Commission will still have major tasks and initiatives to manage for a number of years after accession, in particular the transition facility for institution-building in the new Member States.

Remarks 
After enlargement, the Commission will remain responsible for ensuring that all legal and financial requirements are met, in particular with regard to sound and efficient financial management. In line with the Accession Treaty, all implementing agencies in the candidate countries will operate under the extended decentralised implementation system (EDIS) as soon as feasible and, normally, upon accession. To accompany this transition, the current administrative and personnel structures of delegations will be maintained for up to 15 months after accession. 
This appropriation is intended to cover the administrative costs of the phasing-out of the pre-accession assistance programmes in the candidate countries which acceded to the Union in 2004, namely: 
- expenditure on temporary support staff in delegations (detached national experts, individual experts, local staff and local technical assistance staff) for the purposes of the devolved programme management in the Commission’s delegations in non-member countries as well as the additional logistical and infrastructure costs, such as costs of training, meetings, missions, IT and telecommunications and of renting directly caused by the presence in the delegation of the temporary staff remunerated from the appropriations of this item, 
- expenditure on short-term technical assistance, linked to the achievement of the objective of the programme (or measures coming under this article, plus any other expenditure on technical and administrative assistance not involving public authority tasks outsourced by the Commission under ad hoc service contracts), 
- expenditure on temporary support staff at headquarters (detached national experts, auxiliaries, staff from employment agencies and temporary staff) working on tasks directly related to the completion of the pre-accession programmes. Expenditure on such staff is limited to EUR 850000. This estimate is based on an annual unit cost per man-year, of which 97 % is accounted for by remuneration for the staff concerned and 3 % by the cost of training, meetings, missions, IT and telecommunications relating to those staff members.

TITLE 23 
HUMANITARIAN AID 
Overall objectives 
The aim of this policy area is to provide relief to the victims of humanitarian disasters worldwide, and in doing so: 
- grant assistance strictly in accordance with identified humanitarian needs, 
- focus more directly on "forgotten" crises not covered by other donors, 
- ensure a more balanced per-beneficiary allocation of funds that takes into account the different levels of complexity of operations, the objective needs that result from the geographic location, and the nature of specific crises, 
- give specific attention to unstable post-crisis situations where other (national) donors may be reluctant to become involved, 
- strive for maximum complementarity and coherence with other key players’ priorities, 
- ensure that horizontal issues (gender, human rights and disability) will be systematically mainstreamed into operations.
