RECOMMENDATION OF THE CUSTOMS COOPERATION COUNCIL 
of 16 June 1982 
concerning the production of goods declarations by means of computer or other automatic printers 
THE CUSTOMS COOPERATION COUNCIL, 
Desirous of facilitating the accomplishment of formalities in international trade by enabling declarants to make the greatest possible use of modern methods for the production of international trade documents, 
Considering that automatic data processing techniques make it possible for declarants to produce Goods declarations, by means of computer or other automatic printers on pre-printed forms or on plain paper, which substantially conform to the official model specified by the Customs or other competent authorities, 
Recommends that States, whether or not Members of the Council, and Customs or Economic unions should authorize declarants, under conditions to be laid down by the Customs or other competent authorities, to produce their Goods declarations by means of computer or other automatic printers, on pre-printed forms or on plain paper. Such authorization may be made subject, in particular, to the condition that declarations produced in this manner substantially conform to the official model specified by the Customs or other competent authorities, 
Requests States, whether or not Members of the Council, and Customs or Economic unions which accept this recommendation to notify the Secretary-General of their acceptance, of the date from which they will apply the recommendation, and of the conditions of its application. The Secretary-General will transmit this information to the Customs administrations of all Members. He will also transmit it to any Customs administrations of non-members or any Customs or Economic unions which have accepted this recommendation.
