Commission Regulation (EC) No 1090/2006 
of 14 July 2006 
opening crisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for certain wines in Greece 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [1], and in particular Article 33(1)(f) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the possibility of a crisis distillation measure in the event of exceptional market disturbance due to major surpluses. Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production, and may apply to quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) at the request of the Member State concerned. 
(2) The Greek Government has requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wines produced in Greece and for quality wines psr. 
(3) Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the market in table wines and quality wines psr in Greece, which are reflected in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks towards the end of the current marketing year. In order to reverse this negative trend, and so remedy the difficult market situation, stocks of Greek wine should be reduced to a level that can be regarded as normal in terms of covering market requirements. 
(4) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are satisfied, a crisis distillation measure should be opened for a maximum of 370000 hectolitres of table wine and 130000 hectolitres of quality wines psr. 
(5) The crisis distillation opened by this Regulation must comply with the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms [2] as regards the distillation measure provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. Other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 must also apply, in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of advances. 
(6) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with while allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure. 
(7) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol only, for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol, which is supplied largely by the distillation provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. 
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,
