Resolution of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 24 May 2005 meeting within the Council on the evaluation of activities conducted in the framework of European cooperation in the youth field 
(2005/C 141/01) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION AND THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE MEMBER STATES MEETING WITHIN THE COUNCIL, 
Whereas: 
1. The European Commission's White Paper entitled "A new impetus for European youth" [1], presented on 21 November 2001, sets out a new framework for European cooperation on youth affairs. 
2. The Council, in its conclusions of 14 February 2002 [2], recognised the White Paper as the starting point for developing a European framework for cooperation on youth affairs. 
3. In its Resolution of 27 June 2002 [3] the Council 
(a) adopted the open method of coordination as the new framework for cooperation on youth policy and approved four thematic priorities: participation, information, voluntary activities and greater understanding and knowledge of youth; 
(b) invited the Commission, no later than the end of the first implementation exercise for the four thematic priorities, to prepare an evaluation report in association with the Member States on the framework for cooperation, covering in particular an evaluation of the open method of coordination and, as appropriate, suggestions for its modification, and to submit that report to the Council for consideration. 
4. In its resolution of 25 November 2003 [4], the Council recalled that implementation must be flexible, incremental and appropriate for the youth field, and must respect the powers of the Member States and the principle of subsidiarity. 
5. On 15 November 2004 the Commission submitted to the Council a communication on the evaluation of activities conducted in the framework of European cooperation in the youth field [5]. 
6. On 21 February 2005, the Council adopted a contribution to the Spring European Council on the basis of a commission Communication ("Working together for growth jobs — A new start for the Lisbon strategy") on the Mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy which states that "we still need a vision for society which can integrate both the ageing and the young". 
7. The Spring European Council on 22 and 23 March 2005 adopted a European Pact for youth as one of the instruments for fulfilling the Lisbon objectives. 
EMPHASISE THAT trends among young people are changing constantly, hence the need for regular adjustments to youth policy priorities. 
- the consultation and closer involvement of young people and their organisations at all levels of political debate, 
- the development of regular and structured dialogue between young people and their organisations, administrations and policymakers, 
- the direct involvement of young people and their organisations in the discussions on the European Constitution, 
- a higher profile for measures targeting young people, 
- exchanges of examples of good practice, 
- the launch of the European Youth Portal. 
- priorities for European cooperation with regard to youth policy, 
- the effectiveness of the open method of coordination as it affects young people, 
- a reassessment of the balance between the flexibility and effectiveness of the open method of coordination in the youth field, 
- the need for young people and their organisations to be consulted constantly and in a structured way, at both national and European level, 
- the need for a better understanding of the situation of young people in order to take into account the youth dimension in other policies and to influence such policies. 
- the need for all actors (policymakers, youth organisations) at all levels (local, national and European) to be mobilised in order to have a real impact. 
- to further develop the procedures for implementing the open method of coordination once the common objectives for a given priority have been agreed; this could involve: 
- taking stock of the national situation in respect of these objectives, using a set of methods determined by each Member State, 
- setting out priority lines of action, 
- assessing the progress achieved since the initial review, 
- consulting young people in an appropriate fashion at the various stages of the process, 
to ensure consistency between the open method of coordination and the European Pact for Youth.
