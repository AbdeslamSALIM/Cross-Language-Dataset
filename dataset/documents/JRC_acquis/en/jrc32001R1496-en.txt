of 20 July 2001 
amending Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 and derogating from Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 47(8) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001(2) introduces a number of derogations to Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000(3), in order to deal with the exceptional market situation resulting from the recent events linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The subsequent epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has made certain further amendments necessary. 
(2) It is convenient to introduce the possibility of buying-in carcasses weighing more than the maximum weight while restricting in that case the buying-in price to that of the maximum authorised weight. With regard to the purchase of forequarters, this restriction should be applied by limiting their buying-in price to 40 % of the maximum payable weight for carcasses. 
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001 should therefore be amended. 
(4) In view of the development of events this Regulation must enter into force immediately. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
