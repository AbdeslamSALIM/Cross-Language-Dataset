# A multilingual, multi-style and multi-granularity dataset for cross-language textual similarity detection

* In the Aligned_Documents_Sub_Corpus/ directory, you can find the dataset of parallel and comparable files aligned at document-level (one file represents one document).<br/>
* In the Aligned_Sentences_Sub_Corpus/ directory, you can find the dataset of parallel and comparable files aligned at sentence-level (a line of a file represents one sentence).<br/>
* In the Aligned_Chunks_Sub_Corpus/ directory, you can find the dataset of parallel and comparable files aligned at chunk-level (a line of a file represents one noun chunk).<br/>
* In the tools/ directory, you can find all the useful files to re-create the dataset.
