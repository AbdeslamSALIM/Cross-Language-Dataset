Others also add information to the synsets. Thus, [8] add lexical signatures resulting from tagged corpora or Web. On the other hand, others rather seek to increase the number of arc existing. [9], for example, combines different metrics to create links between synsets from their definitions and from a thesaurus. [10] use a coocurrences network to extract typical relations like those presented in the previous section.
