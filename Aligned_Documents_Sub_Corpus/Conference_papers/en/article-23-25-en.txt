Reconciliation Engine Inferred relations are presented to the validator to decide of their status: true, true but irrelevant or false. In case of invalidation, the reconciliator tries to diagnose the reasons: error as one of the premises (previously existing relations is false), exception or confusion due to polysemy (the inference has been made on a polysemous central term) and initiates a dialog with the user.
