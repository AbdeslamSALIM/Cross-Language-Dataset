Annotea is a collaborative Customer Server system for document annotation. The annotations are stored on a specialized server. They are divided in such a way that anyone, who has an access to the annotation server will be able to consult all annotations related to a given document and to add his/her own annotations. These annotations can be typographical comments, corrections, assumptions or estimates. This system was developed using the W3C standards. Nevertheless, the only possible form of annotation is the text; it cannot annotate by images or icons.
