Most of these networks and specifically the most famous,Word- Net [6], miss syntagmatic information and, in particular, information concerning the domain usage of terms or at least thematicaly related terms. There is thus no direct relation between terms like ,teacher--,student- or ,boat--,port-. This phenomenon is called the ”tennis problem” [[6], p. 10] because it has been noticed that it was necessary to seek ,ball-, ,racket- and, ,court- at various places of the hierarchy.
