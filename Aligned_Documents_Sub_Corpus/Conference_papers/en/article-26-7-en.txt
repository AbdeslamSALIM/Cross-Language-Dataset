We present here an application of configuration to the problem of parsing languages, a work that originates from [6]. To this end, and because we aim at parsing natural languages, we do not propose an ad hoc formulation of the problem, but propose a systematic translation of property grammars[3] in terms of a configuration model. As a means of assessing the validity of the proposed approach, we detail two working examples : one is the parsing of the archetypal context free grammar anbn, and the other is the parsing of a simple natural language subset. The anbn grammar is recursive, which despite its apparent simplicity addresses an inherent difficulty of natural language (noun phrases are recursive).
