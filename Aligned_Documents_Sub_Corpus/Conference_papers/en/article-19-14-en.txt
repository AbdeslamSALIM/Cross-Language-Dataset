5. building of senses: this step mainly consists in associating to the sense seeds identified by the previous step the remaining cooccurrents that are the most similar to them. The result is a set of clusters that each represents a sense of the target word. For associating a cooccurrent to a sense seed, the strength of the link between them must be higher than a given threshold. If a cooccurrent can be tied to several seeds, the one that is the most strongly linked to it is chosen. Moreover, the seeds that are considered as too close from each other for giving rise to separate senses can also be grouped during this step in accordance with the same criteria than the other cooccurrents.
