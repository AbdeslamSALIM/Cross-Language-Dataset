Test Corpus The test signals are 216 speaker turns extracted from the dialogue corpus collected during the NESPOLE project. Table 2 shows examples of these test speaker turns (they are initially in French; here we translate them into English for readers not familiar with French). We also show in the second column the hypothesis strings obtained as output of the recognition module with our semantic language model. We see that some simple speaker turns were analyzed completely to IF. There are also some others more complex speaker turns which were partially or totally analyzed to IF.
