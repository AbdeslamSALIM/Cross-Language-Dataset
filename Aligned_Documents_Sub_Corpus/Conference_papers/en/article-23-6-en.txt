The building of a collaborative lexical network (or any similar resource in general) can be devised according to two strategies. First, as a contributive system like Wikipedia where people willingly add and complete entries (like for Wiktionary). Second, contributions can be made indirectly thanks to games (better known as GWAP [7]) and in this case players do not need to be aware that while playing they are helping building a lexical resource.
