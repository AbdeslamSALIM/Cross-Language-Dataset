The text corpora that have been used can be roughly organized by the degree of correspondence between two units of text: pairs of sentential paraphrases, obtained e.g. by multiple translation (mono- lingual parallel corpora); pairs of sentences with similar content, obtained e.g. by filtering high-similarity pairs from groups of related documents (monolingual comparable corpora); pairs of phrases sharing common translations in other languages (multilingual parallel corpora).
