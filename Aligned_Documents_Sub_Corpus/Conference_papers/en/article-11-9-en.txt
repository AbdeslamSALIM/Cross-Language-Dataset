Controlled Task europarl is a large corpus of bitexts drawn from the European Parliament between April 1996 and September 2003 [15]. It includes versions of the documents in 11 languages, but we focus in this study on the English-Spanish bitext. Our test corpus contains 487 English documents (therefore 487 Spanish ones), thus summing to 237,169 potential pairs of documents. Each document contains an average of about 2,800 sentences.
