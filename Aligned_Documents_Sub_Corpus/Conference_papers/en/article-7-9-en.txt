Clustering In this stage we gather the sentences referring to the same or similar events by the application of the algorithm 'Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)' [25, 26]. This algorithm initially assigns each object with a cluster, then collects, on several occasions, the clusters until one of the stop criteria is satisfied. Our contribution is to put forward a new measure of similarity between events. Given the importance of similarity measurements in clustering, we noted that there are several of such measurements between documents including: Salton's cosinus [27], Khi- Deux distance [28], Cosine in distributional space [29]. Other measurements, which are more interesting for us, are linked to the similarity between sentences, the latest of which is Naughtonâ€™s measurement [23].
