This paper introduces a clustering algorithm that is able to partition objects taking into account simultaneously their relational descriptions given by multiple dissimilarity matrices. These matrices could have been generated using different sets of variables and a fixed dissimilarity function, using a fixed set of variables and different dissimilarity functions or using different sets of variables and dissimilarity functions.
