Conclusion In this article, we presented the conceptual vectors built by emergence. We showed in what they can help to solve the tennis problem from their character complementary to the lexico-semantic networks one whose most famous example in current research is WordNet. Indeed, the recall of the networks is weak, they easily do not make it possible to represent the semantic fields contrary to the vectors while the latter are not sufficient to represent relations like hyperonymy or meronymy.
