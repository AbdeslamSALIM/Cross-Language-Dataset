TAG (Tree Adjoining Grammar) PUG has a clear kinship with TAG, which is the first formalism based on combination of structures to be studied at length. TAGs are generally presented as grammars combining (ordered) trees. In fact, as a tree grammar, TAG is not monotonic and cannot be simulated with PUG. As shown by Vijay-Shanker 1992, to obtain a monotonic formalism, TAG must be viewed as a grammar combining quasi-trees. Intuitively, a quasi-tree is a tree whose nodes has been split in two parts and have each one an upper part and a lower part, between which another quasi-tree can be inserted (this is the famous adjoining operation of TAG). Formally, a quasi-tree is a tree whose branches have two types: dependency relations and dominance relations (respectively noted by plain lines and dotted lines). Two nodes linked by a negative dominance relation are potentially the two parts of a same node; only the lower part can have dependents.
