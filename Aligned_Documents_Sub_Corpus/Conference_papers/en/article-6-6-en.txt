These dissimilarity matrices could have been generated using different sets of variables and a fixed dissimilarity function (the final partition gives a consensus between dif- ferent views (sets of variables) describing the objects), using a fixed set of variables and different dissimilarity functions (the final partition gives the consensus between different dissimilarity functions) or using different sets of variables and dissimilarity functions. Moreover, the influence of the different dissimilarity matrices is not equally important in the definition of the clusters in the final consensus partition. Thus, in order to obtain a meaningful parti- tion from all dissimilarity matrices, it is necessary to learn cluster-dependent relevance weights for each dissimilarity matrix.
