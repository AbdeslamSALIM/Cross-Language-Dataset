Migration Network We now investigate the hierarchical structure which can be found in a migration network. The graph models migration flows in USA (see [4] for details on this dataset). The 1650 vertices represent American counties. For each couple of counties we know the number of person who moved from one to the other between 1995 and 2000. There is a total of 6500 positive relations in this network which are represented as weighted directed edges.
