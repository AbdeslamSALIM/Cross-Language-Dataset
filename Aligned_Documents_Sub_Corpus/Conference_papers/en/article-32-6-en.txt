As an example of conjunctive preference, consider “Could I have a breakfast and a vegetarian meal?” where the agent expresses two preferences that he wants to satisfy and he prefers to have one of them if he cannot have both. The semantics of a disjunctive preference is a free choice one. For example in “Mondays or Tuesdays are fine for me”, the agent states that either Monday or Tuesday is an acceptable outcome and he is indifferent between the choice of the outcomes.
