The Proposed Approach of Event Annotation We note that the above-mentioned approaches for the temporal information annotation are mainly linguistic. As well, they are based on the temporal indices. Moreover, we are interested in the annotation and exploitation of events using machine learning techniques. Our approach is not restricted to the events detection, but it also allows gathering the similar events in order to facilitate an ulterior treatment: indexing, storage in a database, summarization, categorization, information retrieval, etc.
