Table 4 illustrates several possible sessions with the parser. In this table, the system states are described as triples )words, syntax, semantic* ("?" denotes an unknown object, and "+" an unknown word), and the system behaviour is denoted using input state ,- output state rules. The first two lines correspond to pure analysis use cases. In the second line, the sentence does not belong to the language. The other two lines in table 4 illustrate generative or hybrid uses of the the program.
