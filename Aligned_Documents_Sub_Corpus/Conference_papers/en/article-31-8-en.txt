Presentation of the study corpus Our corpus of Arabic texts has been created from the web, by selecting newspaper articles1. These articles are of HTML type with a UTF-8 coding. They were downloaded without restriction to their contents and their volume: we think that the more the corpus is varied, the more it is representative (it contains an important number of linguistic markers).
