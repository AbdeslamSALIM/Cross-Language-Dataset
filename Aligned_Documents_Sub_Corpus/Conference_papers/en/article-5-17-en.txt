The results are given in Figure 2. The x-axis corresponds to the value µ1 +µ2 which is the proportion of edges outside micro-communities. For four different values of µ1, we compare the different clusterings for µ2 2 [µ1,1- µ1]. The y-axis corresponds to the normalized mutual information between the compared clusterings. We compare the real micro-communities to the clustering given by N2(T) and F(T) (orange and red curves respectively) and the real macro-communities to the clustering given by N1(T) (blue curves).
