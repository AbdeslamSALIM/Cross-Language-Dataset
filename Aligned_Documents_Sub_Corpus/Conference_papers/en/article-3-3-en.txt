The proximity measures are characterized by a set of mathematical properties. The main objects, that we seek to explain in this paper, are how we can assess and which measure we can use to prove: are two specifics proximity measures equivalent or not? What is the meaning of equivalence between two proximity measures? In which situation can we consider that two proximity measures are equivalent? If two measures are equivalent, does it means that they are substitutable between each other? Does the choice of a specific proximity measure between individuals immersed in a multidimensional space, like Rp, influence or not the result of clustering or k-nearest neighbors?
