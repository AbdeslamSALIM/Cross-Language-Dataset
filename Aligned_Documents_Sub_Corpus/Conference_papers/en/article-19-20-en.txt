Experiments We applied our algorithm for discovering word senses to the two networks of lexical cooccurrences we have described in Section 3 (LM: French; LAT: English) with the parameters given in Section 4. For each network, we tested the use of first order cooccurrences (LM-1 and LAT-1) and second order ones (LM-2 and LAT-2). For English, the use of second order cooccurrences was tested only for the subpart of the words of the network that was selected for the evaluation of Section 6 (LAT-2.no). Table 1 gives some statistics about the results of the discovered senses for the different cases.
