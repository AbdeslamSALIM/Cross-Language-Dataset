As for the first measure, a null value is taken when there is no relation between two words in the cooccurrence network. The similarity matrix is then built by applying the cosine measure between each couple of vectors, i.e. each couple of cooccurrents. With this second measure, two cooccurrents can be found strongly linked even though they are not directly linked in the cooccurrence network: they just have to share a significant number of words with which they are linked in the cooccurrence network.
