We observe that the performance of the engine trained on the bitexts identified by our cosine [ edit classifiers is better than the performance of the engine trained on the dictionary bitext. This is a very satisfactory result since no manual intervention was required, neither any special bilingual resource. Another encouraging result is that the precision of all our classifiers is very high (99% or greater).
