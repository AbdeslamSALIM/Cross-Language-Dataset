To overcome this difficulty, we also tested a measure that relies not only on first order cooccurrences but also on second order cooccurrences, which are known to be “less sparse and more robust” than first order ones (Schütze, 1998). This measure is based on the following principle: a vector whose size is equal to the number of cooccurrents of the considered word is associated to each of its cooccurrents. This vector contains the cohesion values between this cooccurrent and the other ones.
