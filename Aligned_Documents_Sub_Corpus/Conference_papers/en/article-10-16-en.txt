Many perspectives are foreseen for this work. From a technical point of view, future work is planned to improve the voting process between the inferred transducer. Secondly, considering the terms as sequences of morphs instead of sequences of letters (e.g. broncho©pleuro©pneumo©nia) could yield better results. Morphological analysis systems for French biomedical terms exist (Namer & Zweigenbaum, 2004) and could be used with ostia. Another possible extension concerns translation of complex terms (with several words).
