WordNet 2.0 contains 152059 terms what constitutes a relatively broad cover of the English language. In first versions of Wordnet, the lexical relations connect only items in the same part of speech. There is thus one hierarchy for nouns, one for adjectives, one for verbs and finally one for the adverbs.
