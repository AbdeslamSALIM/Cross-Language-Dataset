As for the discursive features, we note that, for Verbmobil, the rhetorical relation between the current EDU and the previous one yields a more important improvement than other discourse information. This could be due to the nature of the corpus, where task context (as expressed in previous dialogue turns) is important. For Booking, the current EDU or the preceding one being a question yields the most salient performance improvement. This could also be due to the nature of the corpus, which mainly contains questionanswer pairs at a dialogue level.
