The train-test experiments consist in dividing a data set in two (almost) equal class-stratified parts. One part is for training and mining frequent-confident (or emerging) rules, the other part is for evaluating the evolution of confidence and growth rate values on the test set. Since we do not provide an extractor of MODL rules in this preliminary work, we compute the value of our MODL criterion for the extracted confident (or emerging) rules on the training and test set for comparison.
