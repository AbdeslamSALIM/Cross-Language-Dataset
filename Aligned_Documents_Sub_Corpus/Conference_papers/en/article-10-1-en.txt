Then, these transducers, making the most of high translation regularities in the biomedical domain, can be used to translate new French terms into English or vice versa. Evaluations reported show that our technique achieves good successful translation rates (between 52 and 67%). When examining at the most frequent errors made, some inherent limits of our approach are identified, and several avenues are proposed in order to bypass them. Finally, some perspectives are put forward to extend this work.
