Concluding Remarks This paper introduced a clustering algorithm that is able to partition ob- jects taking into account simultaneously their relational descriptions given by multiple dissimilaritity matrices. These matrices could have been generated using different sets of variables and dissimilarity functions. This algorithm provides a partition and a prototype for each cluster as well as a relevance weight for each dissimilarity matrix by optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fit between clusters and their representatives. These relevance weights change at each algorithm iteration and are different from one cluster to another.
