Itâ€™s easy to demonstrate that each preview step decreases the criterion J. The dynamic hard clustering algorithm with relevance weight for each dissimilarity matrix sets an initial partition and alternates three steps until convergence, when the criterion J(P,, g) reaches a stationary value repre- senting a local minimum. This algorithm is summarized below.
