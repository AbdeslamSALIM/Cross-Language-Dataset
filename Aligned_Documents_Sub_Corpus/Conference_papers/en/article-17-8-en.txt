Concepts are defined from a thesaurus (in our prototype applied to French, we have chosen [Larousse, 1992] where 873 concepts are identified)/. To be consistent with the thesaurus hypothesis, we consider that this set constitutes a generator space for the words and their meanings. This space is probably not free (no proper vectorial base) and as such, any word would project its meaning on this space according to the following principle.
