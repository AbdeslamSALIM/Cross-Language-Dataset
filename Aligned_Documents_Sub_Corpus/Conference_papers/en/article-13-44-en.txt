Adjunct prepositions vs argument prepositions In deep parsing we have to distinguish between prepositions introducing a verb argument and prepositions introducing adjuncts. However, we have seen that this distinction often relies on semantics and that parsing should leave the two possibilities open. Precise information about argument prepositions and verb subcategorizations eliminates many of these ambiguities.
