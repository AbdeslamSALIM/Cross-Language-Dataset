The status of the class of prepositions is difficult to determine. A priori, prepositions may seem to be a closed class, with elements which can be enumerated. In practice, however, a comparison of the different available resources shows that it is not an easy task to exhaustively list prepositions. Besides, they represent more than 14% of French lemma tokens.
