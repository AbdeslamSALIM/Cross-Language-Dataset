For the third test, discursive features do not bring a consistent improvement over the baselines. This is perhaps caused by the inability of discourse information to compensate for the mismatch between training and test data: indeed, in principle there are more instances of local features (at the NP and EDU level) associated to positive examples, than of discursive features associated to positive examples; and when the classifier is trained on features extracted from a corpus genre and tested on another corpus genre, the weight of the discursive features might not suffice to compensate for the local features.
