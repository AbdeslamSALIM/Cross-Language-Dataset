Thus, the achievements in the field of automatic summary are generally set out again according to the approaches used. Mainly three approaches are distinguished: numerical, symbolic and hybrid. Our contribution is in the context of symbolic approach and we propose a system for the automatic summarization of Arabic texts which is based on a purely symbolic technique: RST technique (Mann, 1988). It is a question of detecting the semantic relations and the intentional relations which exist between the segments of a document. Indeed, the rhetorical analysis aims at establishing the relations as well as the relative importance of the sentences or propositions and the dependences on one another (Teufel, 1997).
