When Y is a class attribute we talk about classification rules. In this paper, we focus on such rules X ?c (concluding on a class attribute c). Classification rules seem to be favorable for classification tasks (if an object is described by attributes of X then it is probably of class c). Recent advances in rule mining have given rise to many rule-based classification algorithms (see, e.g., pioneering work [Liu et al., 1998] or [Bringmann et al., 2009] for a survey). Existing rule-based methods are known for their interpretable form and also to perform quite well in classification tasks. However, we may point out at least two weaknesses:
