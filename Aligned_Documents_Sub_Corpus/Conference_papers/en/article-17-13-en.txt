Conceptual Vectors Construction. The conceptual vector construction is based on definitions from difierent sources (dictionaries, synonym lists, manual indexations, etc). Definitions are parsed and the corresponding conceptual vector is computed. This analysis method shapes, from existing conceptual vectors and definitions, new vectors. It requires a bootstrap with a kernel composed of pre-computed vectors.
