 

He, however, remarkable fitness and skill to know and admire female beauty, and made months now,
almost without noticing it, and very unwillingly, when I was chatting with the clerk and the
pharmacist and other gentlemen on the benches that were near the fountain, were fixed with loving
eyes delight in Juanita, still used to come to fill their jar and be there chatting with other
girls as they took their turn.

Undoubtedly, Don Paco had begun to feel inclined to live Juanita, it was difficult to master, but
he spent considerable time without outward sign that the felt, longing
perhaps hide from himself for reasons he was given.

Founded in the very modesty that made him into a poor idea of ??his person, was that fifty-three
years, thirty-six more than Juanita, could no longer love to girl, who or scorn their affection
or interest only move to correspond. Thought after Juanita, although in apparent freedom, was heavily
guarded by his mother, and mother and daughter lived with some relief,
it was assumed that, if he had intentions sinful loaning them, but
in any case would give in facie Ecclesiae and bringing the priest
to go.

The idea of ??marriage to Don Paco terrified, and absolutely not because he hated being married
but because her daughter, Dona Ines, inspired him with an endearing affection, mingled with
terror, and because she was so compelling and brave, and would certainly be in a fury of the
underworld if his father give him stepmother, especially so mean position, and if seven grandchildren
she had given him, and I figured I could come yet she persisted in production approach, removing
the hope of inheriting the vineyard, olive grove and the house, and enjoy in his lifetime
not a little of what he was farm with his various arts.

Trembling Don Paco incurring the anger of her daughter, and although it mainly trembling anger, fear
did not stop their evil consequences.

Well he knew that there was no place in a person, or several together, they could replace him
successful in different jobs, but the world was not barren or devoid
of statesmen rustic, which could be sought and brought in from off-site
so that it will replace.

And it also knew that her daughter was a point less than omnipotent, because he had subjugated
two powers, temporal and spiritual.

Father Anselm was a saint and a doctor, and all it said was for him could not help it, a legitimate
corollary of the Gospels and the Epistles.

The father Anselmo would be able to excommunicate whom she commanded. And with regard to the
secular, Dona Ines was most evident that he was subject to his whims and all his crush weight to
who she wanted.
Don Paco, in this mood, reasonably motivated, although we do not
deny that He was sweet, peaceful and somewhat weak of character, imagination
ahead in future cases and presupposes love with Juanita, declared
and accepted, I saw a crowd of evils angry heart out Dona Ines as
new Pandora's box
