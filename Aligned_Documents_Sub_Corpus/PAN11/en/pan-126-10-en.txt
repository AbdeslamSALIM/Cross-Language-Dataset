 She
saw him, poor boy, emaciated and sickly, spending two to three hours kneeling in church without ever
enjoy the pleasure of running outdoors as children of the destitute fishermen without having a
companion with whom to communicate their innocent thoughts. One day like another. The sky is
always gray. Sadly the sea roaring on the rocks. The wind flapping violence on the glass. And
the silent house, gloomy, dirty, occasionally echoing walks with slow, rhythmic, his father. Lancia
could be seen later in studying the second education, staying at the home of a cleric of the same
temperament and habits than his father. His teammates despised him because of his weakness, his
lack of ability, teachers were I looked askance by nature reserved and sad. And back to the grim
holiday and hateful palace, the austere regime, the eternal prayers. Despite their ardent desire
to pursue a career failed. His father considered unworthy of primogeniture House Montesinos to
write a motion or a road map: the lawyers were called curia, engineers to masons, teachers maestrillos.
The military liked, but his ideas Traditionalists prevented him from sending his son to serve a liberal
government. Unable to serve their king with arms of a noble life should be up early to hear mass,
add a look at your finances, talk a while with the butler, playing triplets with the priests, then
give them a walk, pray the rosary, confession often and constantly giving example the plebeians
of virtue and piety, without ever rubbing them. But despite the large showing respect for the
priests kissing and holding hands in public, Álvaro remembered a detail that had always attracted
much attention, when eating the servants served before the master and his son that the chaplain
of the house. Aristocratic pride even more vivid beat in the heart of his father that the religious
sentiment, but he knew so well in the ally them depths of his conscience, which had come to believe
that religiosity was a quality deprivation aristocrats, and that distinguished it better than
any other of the multitude negligible.

Peñascosa could be seen in making the life of idle gentleman, as a
child under ten years despotic authority of his father.

Her imaginative spirit, a dreamer, could not stand that inaction. He began to read novels that
gave him sneak a lady who had tobacconist Quadrant street. Rose after the library, where a clergyman,
brother of her grandfather, Wise went through in life, had made great copy books, and began to devour
them. Read Plato, Descartes, St. Thomas, Fenelon, etc.

It was wise. But as the light of science in spirit, also slipped doubt.

What caused such cruel tortures! In his life, sad, monotonous, only religion, thought God, the
promise of immortality, of another world more just and more beautiful sweeten little the bitterness
of the hour. And behold, suddenly wary of this sweet promise, doubted whether all the truths
of religion, even the existence of God. At first went suspicious, dark, fearing that his father
discovered his abominable in the eyes thoughts. Then, cruelly tortured and overwhelmed by them,
anxious to find remedy your wrong, a hand that sustained him before falling into the abyss
of perdition, had the courage a day of throwing at the feet of his father and confess. The old
aristocrat was terrified and to remedy the folly of their child (so called) found no alternative
but to advise Penance, fasts, mortifications of all kinds. For him, these doubts did not come rebellions
rather than meat, which had to fight with the humility and discipline.

Suddenly jumped the barrier of doubt and fell on the field in disbelief.

Since then, neither a moment's hesitation, more and more convinced every day that this world
was worthless, and that out of this world had to wait otherwise. Death of his father and confessed
with remorse not sorry. Treat anxiety and breathed the air of freedom. There was a time when Life seemed
less horrible, the world had for him a sweet smile. It was when the well filled pocket, he went
to Madrid. First science offered comfort and entertainment. Caught up with avidity the latest
ideas in philosophy, history, science natural alternated, discussed with the most eminent men of Spain. And
he had the satisfaction to observe that there in his solitude of rocks, meditating on the ancient
books had reached the same results as the modern philosophers. Then came love, a dream sweet
and heady, pungent and divine music that was suspended some time on misery of the land, which
reconciled him to life and woke up in their hearts the hope infinite the illusion of immortal
bliss. The fall of that world of light, happy, smiling, was Cruel indeed, one of the blackest
pages in recorded history of mankind, where there are so black! ...

- By the way - leaving said his ecstasy painful skeletal hand from the front - I've had enough
time to seriously those things that you believe.

I had a hard time pain, many sleepless nights, many tears separate from them. Let me return
you so many tears I laugh a little now.

- So - said the priest shaking badly repressed - that, forgetting
entirely beliefs you sucked, the holy religion of their parents, declaring
you an enemy of God ...

- Yes, sir, the enemy of God and men ...
That is, unfortunately I can not God so, does not exist.

If there is, judging by his work, God would be a good evil. Can not be of God, I am of the men not
to harm but to flee them as they flee from the ferocious beasts.

Since I was born I have been experiencing many pain. However, I never tried to get back at them
because I know they are evil because it has created Nature or Fate, they hurt as do the beasts,
for selfishness that rages within every living being. The world is organized to devour beings
to each other. What happens between fish passes among men, only that we do not open your mouth
and swallow us hit the victim, which, after all, is an advantage for her, but we're eating
small bites, ripping the flesh until it a skeleton ... Can not you see me for me? - Added with
a smile on his face fierce pointing .-- The I have eaten fish that get it. I have left nothing
but bones.

Fr Gil, more and more terrified, dared to ask:

- And you think that there is on earth no man righteous, no virtuous
woman?

- Yes there are, but they are exceptional products of nature,
rather, are aberrations a body set up to evil.

Good men suffer the consequences of any aberration; can not survive.

All animals are born with a defense to fight in combat life, some
have teeth, others have claws, some have horns, some have wings flee:
the good man is the only animal that has no means of defense.

Not being able to fight, is fatally destined to perish. It is the poor fly in the vast tangle
spider web shaped by the rogues that make up the vast majority of mankind. The only consolation that
the good man can have is that their tormentors are not happy. The Life is a big fraud for all,
for good and for ill. Within the universe conceals a cunning force, perverse, that drives us,
leading us towards an unknown end for us, which have nothing to do. To this end we need mysterious
and forces us to reproduce. We do not mind unhappy. The individual for her is nothing, the
species is everything. Work as the owner of a livestock kill before a good horse that no longer
works, forces him to leave an infant. Concerned only with perpetuity so you will not ever
missing instruments, deceives us with the lure of pleasure, ambition or pride. Yourself, who
does not work for any of these phones, is also an instrument of the species. To worry about
the fate of these poor orphans, seeking earnestly the means of living, you unconsciously obeys
the orders of the evil force. When not just the attraction of pleasure for the preservation
of life, appeals to the sense of compassion that has placed within us.

Fr Gil, who was listening so petrified string of blasphemies, he felt a thrill of horror upon hearing
that interpretation monstrous sense of charity. In this thrill followed by a lively irritation. It
took a great effort of will not to break into insults against blasphemy.

- It's all very well - said controlling himself and forced smile, - but you will excuse me ask
you a question.

In that dismal pessimism as you profess, the idea deplorable that you have formed the world
and men, in that brutal atheism (pardon the phrase!) which has to exhibit much pleasure, are you sure
that everything depends on cool and collected right? Do not be influenced by any individual sorrows,
events your life miserable?

Feline eyes flashed angry gentleman, he was wounded to the quick.

- Ah, the eternal ditty! - Impetuously exclaimed .-- When you can not attack a theory will scrutinize
the motives of that supports it.

What are you trying to prove with that?

Suppose that the world is a paradise, that all men except me, are happy, and my pessimism depends
on a whole of my misfortune. Will I say so in the evil that has touched me in luck? Are not I
entitled, wretched creature, to describe God (if any) perverse, may have made me as happy as
others made me unhappy? Anyone who suffers on earth can ask God like Job: When the existence
will asked for nothing? ... For the rest - said adopting a contemptuous tone, insulting - from
you have entered through that door I knew what was coming. I will not argue with you because
bore me. I am convinced that you believe religion is nothing more than a set hypothesis innocent
as those of all other religions invented by poverty and cowardly men, who can not resign himself
to dying good as other living beings, as irrefutably teaches us experience, that can not be convinced
that they are born for pain. And not think on a whim, but after having studied and pondered
the matter at length, after following step by step carefully the history of religions more important.
If I were to choose one among them would certainly be no Christianity which is one of the saddest and
most senseless. What happens to me Goethe: the cross grates on me nerves. Neither Thomas or St.
Augustine, and Fenelon, and Pascal have convinced me. Therefore, none of you convince me. You
have no respect for me that you pay his character and his works. Of their science and of all his
colleagues, bishops and archbishops me laugh out loud.

His eyes shone fiercely, looking down, but these eyes softened tremble suddenly saw the tears in her
P. Gil.

- Excuse me, sir, excuse - was quick to say, approaching him - if
I have offended.

I have a bad temper ... I get irritated easily ...

- Goodbye, sir, goodbye - said Fr Gil, shaking the hand that proffered Montesinos .-- A I'm not
offended ... It is God who ...

- So I'm happy, because it does not matter .-- ...-- replied smiling
bye.

You know you have a friend here and a house available.

Damn left the house in a state of indescribable confusion and sadness.

Refused go to Ms Eloisa, who was waiting impatiently. When I later saw her, manifestole failure
in short and clean words.

For a few days made efforts to remove from your thinking that unpleasant interview and even blasphemous
image. Overwhelmed, crushed by a reception so brutal, no idea who had no means of fighting that
devil full of anger and rage of impiety. But His words resounded day and night in his ears, chasing
him, hurt him as cruel lashes. Knew some arguments of the heretics, those who brought the books of
theology and that the author, with the authority of the Fathers, always victoriously refuted.
Knew the existence of the rationalists, but the news was weak and vague. I had never been expressed
in a way so cynical atheism. I did not think he was truly had convinced that God did not exist.

Dissipated,
however, after a while printing, could not help thinking that had unnerved soon. Too knew that the sheep
had not been good to deliver First, it would be a cautious man, scholar,
who was not to attract four common spaces.

So why suddenly folded? Why give up without a fight? Fr Gil pleaded with his usual sincere
modesty, he was not prepared for this fight. Under the ironic and cynical statements of primogeniture
guessed Montesinos Throughout the study area, a thoughtful and complete. To combat this system
and reasoning can be argued that the wickedness was necessary to know in advance, discuss and
weighted prior to the head, then, to appear in the mouth of the unbeliever, destroy, Dust them.
So do not be afraid to try again this coveted conversion.

But the more difficult it was, the more obstacles in the way, more alive was their desire to achieve.
In the lives of the saints had ever seen were taken for defeated in their struggle with sin. By huge,
impossible for the company out, over and over time rushing with increasing
ardor, relying solely on God's help.

Should make another both. If he lacked strength, God is the lend. Work tirelessly to achieve the
return of the prodigal son, to destroy this hotbed of wickedness that could infect the hearts
Peñascosa healthy, to remove that stumbling block.

It was decided in his mind that he would return back to the load. But this time would be better
disciplined, well known all arguments of the heretics and lead prepared replication. Communicated
with his teacher, rector of the seminary of the Lancia conversion
project and asked him to request the bishop for permission to read
forbidden books.

He soon send it the rector, but in the letter that accompanied it did not appear very enthusiastic
about the company his disciple. The ascetic priest enjoyed more perfect believers and good souls,
in attracting definitely were in the grip of sin.

The first thing I happened to read the P. Gil was a certain life of Jesus, very popular at the
time between the wicked and which he always spoke with contempt mingled with terror at the seminar.
He read with deep pain and sadness. Our Lord Jesus Christ was considered
by the heretic to write it as a man.

He lavished praise thousand laughable, I manifest exaggerated admiration, but it was to better
demonstrate their unique human condition and slide poison of impiety with more fruit. The book was
full of lies. "Christianity, said, is a historical phenomenon and as such must be studied historically.
"This was obviously absurd, because Christianity does the redemption of mankind by the Son of
God; is the revelation of divine truth. The author asked to examine the accounts of the Gospels
by the same principles that any other tradition is judged, not be imposed criticism beforehand
the results and let her preconceived hypothesis-free. This was another absurd, for how we must apply to
faith, the word of God, the same principles than facts and words of men? This was answered one
by one author's arguments rationalist, and undo.

Concerned with this discussion and willing to externalize the internal, as happens with everything
and pregnant filling our spirit, ventured to make another visit of the estate of Montesinos. This time
it was very good, most gracefully, as if you prick the conscience your last rudeness. They
talked about indifferent things.

Montesinos had the opportunity to express I had very good news for his character, who knew
the virtues that adorned them. The P. Gil blushed and responded to these compliments, smiling sadly,
that what I want at that time was very talented and a lot of science to convince the truth
of revelation. "Do what revelation? - Had asked the gentleman kindly smiling too .-- How Disclosure
of what? - Yes, which one? because there are several: Christians, Buddhists, Moslems, Jews,
all believe their religion revealed by God .-- I mean the only true, of revelation of Jesus
Christ .-- And on what grounds you to believe that this is true and others false? - In what
other things are full of monstrous, irrational - answered imperious cleric - in which only the religion of the
Crucified meets all expectations of our feelings and our reason you .-- Be careful, Mr. toilet! - cried
mayorazgo releasing a hearty laugh - you are doing the revealed truth depend the assertion
of reason, that you are proclaiming the supremacy of the Constitution, which is a proposition heretical
.-- How? How? - Stunned the priest asked. "But the conversation changed Montesinos sharply. He dared
not insist.

It took hard work swallow that pill. Was a portion of days without hardly think something else.
The idea that without realizing it could incur any error condemned by the Church deeply disturbed him.
