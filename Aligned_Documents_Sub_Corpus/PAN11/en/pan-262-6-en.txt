 Proposed
one of the two Ambassadors, the oldest in years, its embassy, ??which the Catalans and Aragonese
after making peace between King Charles of Naples, King of Sicily, Don Frederic, to whom They served,
determined not to seek rest at home, but increase with new facts military glory and fame gained
in past wars, they had enough forces for this in number and value, soldiers exercised by a long and
dangerous war, known Captains for their victories and nobility of blood in the name of all offered
him their assistance against Turks with folded taste and liking, and take their weapons in favor
of the house of Palaeologus, Unique Friends of Aragon, when their parts were too falls and expand
his empire destroying enemies along the name of Christian, who so boldly and proudly I wanted
to establish in the provinces usurped the Greek Empire.

Emperors were thrilled with the unexpected offer of the embassy and Catalan, to seem as important to
its interests, because they understood that those same, which I came to offer, were the ones
with so much horror and fear in all of Italy won and sustained the Kingdom of Sicily. Magnificent
words thanked the ease with which the whole nation offered serve, and the same are received. He wanted
talks then the conditions that had a soldier, and so the ambassadors asked the salary according
to their instructions for people war, and Roger to give him the title of Grand Duke, and wife
one of his granddaughters, because I wanted to secure more such items in their service. Andronico
without altering or moving thing they asked, the given, regardless of the quality and condition
of unequal Roger to her granddaughter, but all this inequality could match the reputation of the
people, who like General ruled, and being so oppressed the Greek arms of the Turks, and unsafe
the fidelity of their own.

Blind and lived in a village banished Bithynia Juan Lascar, legitimate successor of the Empire,
and but useless to occupy it, living it, was the possession of Andronico tyrannical, and it
causes justified to take up arms the present government malcontents, and so full of fear and suspicion,
he was obliged to have recourse to foreign nations for war and defense of his person. Service received
ten thousand Massegatas, whom the vulgar call Alans, barbaric people customs, Christian in
faith rather than in the works. Had her dwelling on the other side of Danube, and recognized
by the Lord to Scite Europe. Emperor his first EMBI Embassy offering to serve. Author Gregoras
Nicephore Greek of the time referred to as Andronico's considered much in so many words: Fuel
as pleasing to the Emperor as if from heaven. Greeks said that all suspects and we were enemies,
and thus continuously sought ties with friends and strangers, that I hope never to do it. Also received
his army Turcopoles many companies that left Azan Sultan, and were baptized. All Andronico wanted
them aid, and estimated as large, and thus that our offered him words can not be more expensive
than the estimate made it, being of people as advantageous to the others that served him,
and feared at the time. Andronico sent the two Ambassadors to Roger arranging the marriage, and
brought him the insignia of Grand Duke, which is the same between us General of the sea: great
dignity of the empire, but not the majors.

CHAPTER VI.

Points paid the Emperor to the people of war, and makes many honors
and favors to his captains.

Andronico said the pay according to the difference of the arms and occupation, four ounces of silver
each month to the men at arms, their horses Thin two, and so the pilots and people of mandoneros
an ounce, and provided that they reach the coast of a province of the Empire they were given
four pay, and when they wanted to return to their homes together, or split, you fought two
for the trip. Author George Pachymeres Greek, fragments illustrate much this relationship,
although big enemy of the Catalans, says that the Catalans' pay bending were higher than those
of the Turkish Greeks and Massagetas: that clearly shows The estimate was made of the Catalan and
Aragonese militia, as with so excessive differential the advantage over all who served in the
Empire. Of pay, entertainment and benefits offered to the nobility and captains do not indicate
the Historians thing with particularity, only the office and dignity of Grand Duke Roger, and
the Steward in Corbera de Alet. Where I suspect that his taste was limiting their pay and salary,
because seconds later we shall see, Generals will ask his money,
just pointing out the amount, but for this had to account to the accountants
and finance ministers of Andronico.

The ambassadors returned to Sicily, and found Roger in Licata where he awaited his return, and
know the proper office that wore then went to see the King, to give reason of the honorable Andronico
hospitality that made its embassies and how long walked to offer grants. Public√≥se the day, and
the captains gathered his people at Messina, where the army was ready, that in a few days
was in order to sail. It was the army of thirty-six candles, and between they had eighteen galleys,
four heavy ships, most armed with money King, and Roger, for the execution of the day spent the ranch
he bought in past wars, and took twenty thousand ducats of the Genoese in the name of the Emperor
Andronicus. It was much less the number of people in what is believed, for the two Berengueres
of Entenza, Rocafort and Roger could not join, or follow him, because his departure differed for next
year. Berenguer de Entenza expect new companies to enhance people of Catalonia forces, and spend
more reputation. Berenguer de Rocafort stopped at a Castle Calabria, deliver and reuse the King Charles
of Naples, to be entirely satisfied of what is owed him by reason of his salary. Roger, though
it lacks these two captains could you stop with just cause, being one of the most key parts of
his army, determined splitting, and embarked his men had postponed the day. King, over ships
and galleys that gave them for their journey, they control supply of provisions and supplies,
and money he could, a Prince that the rule only experienced the hardships
and dangers.

This was the prize that was given to the most invincible and victorious militia of that age, and
served for long twenty years to the Three Kings, Peter, James and Frederic, reaching its enemies
five naval victories, three on the ground, without other significant events, and without the
contestability heavy and large towns, and other defendants with commendable
pertinacity and incredible value.

Such was the moderation of those times, very different from what
we have today, because we see soldiers who have just seen the enemy,
when judged by the largest short mercedes.

CHAPTER VII.

Part of Sicily navy, and militia was the people and the Almugavares.

All people embarked in the port of Mecina, and before leaving the lighthouse, it was shown general,
and were found by Montaner, 1500 effective men out for the service navy, without officers, and
four thousand foot Almugavares. Nicephorus Gregoras, shortly Author true in some of these events,
says that Roger went to Greece one thousand men, but George Pachymeres matches and Montaner,
and claims that were eight thousand who have passed away. This, to I believe, is the true number,
for six thousand five hundred paid soldiers, it is true that reached
the number of eight thousand with the family servants and captains,
and Rich men.

And although these two authors do not agree, the faith of Nicephorus was always doubtful; Roger
because he alone being captain of a thousand men, I can not persuade him that Andronico Grand
Duke did, and he married his granddaughter, without preceding services. Not seem Ageno the
attempt, because all of our infantry was Almugavares say something of its origin.

The old mother of oblivion, and who have died and memories made clear distinguished between
others that left us confused, has been the source of the Almugavares, but as I have could determine,
was of those barbarous nations who destroyed the empire and name the Romans in Spain, and founded
his own, which long kept in splendor and glory of great majesty, until Saracens in less than two
years he was oppressed, and forced to the relics of this universal
fire, which among the most rugged of the mountains, seek defense,
where the beasts killed by his hand were given food and clothing.

But then his old value and effort, which treats gift and had buried with work and fatigue
was restored, and made them leave the jungles and forests, and turn their weapons against Moors
occupied earlier in killing beasts.

With the long custom to go wandering, never built houses or possessions founded campaign, and on
the borders of enemies had their room and the livelihoods of their people and families: spoils of
the Saracens, in which sacrificed the lives perpetually damage without other art or craft paid more
to serve in war, and when their Kings were missing they made, with heads and private leaders
ran the borders, where they came to call the former going to the incursions, go almugaveria. Children
and women brought with them, witnesses of his glory, or shame, as the Germans in all ages have used
it, fur clothing of beasts, sandals, and Antipas of the same. The network of iron weapons in the
head in helmet, sword, pike and a little less than what is used today in companies of musketeers,
but most had three or four Throwing darts.

Such was the haste and violence with that flashed in his hands, crossed armed men and horses,
something apparently Montaner Desclot doubtful if not reported, serious authors of our stories,
where its length is made, which can match concluded with the very Romans and Greeks.

Charles King of Naples, as some prisoners before him Almugavares, admiring the evils of the costume,
and weapons, apparently useless against the bodies of men and armored horses, said with some
contempt, that if they were those soldiers with the King de Aragon think warfare. Then said
one of them off whenever the mood to defend its reputation, Lord, you seem not so vile, and
estimates in as little our power, choose a gentleman of the most mentioned in your army with offensive
weapons and defensive desires, I would offer you with only my sword and dart to fight in the
field with him.

With Charles desire to punish the insolence of Almugavar postponed the challenge, and wanted to
attend and see battle. He left his horse a Frenchman armed with all parts, spear, sword and dart.
Just entered in the lurch when he killed the horse, and willing to do the same owner, King's
voice stopped him and gave him the victor and free.

Another Almugavar in this same war, to the tongue of water rushed twenty men of arms, killed
five before losing his life. Many other facts could refer, if not alien of our history, to try
another length. The question offered only the name, if it was the nation, or of militia in its
principles. I have for a certain thing that was the nation, and for sure more on this opinion,
I have to Pachymeres George Greek author whose fragments give much
light to this whole story, which he calls the descendants of the Avars
Almugavares, companions of Huns, and Goths, and although no author
find that counter to the contrary, many laws of the items are clearly
inferred that the name was name Almugavar militia, and does not contradict
this be true first, because between the two may have been.

At its beginning, as Pachymeres says, was to nation, but then do not exercise as Almugavares
other art or craft, they came to give names to all those who served in that militia as well as
many arts and sciences took the name of its inventors. But I doubt he would have added to the Almugavares,
militia so painful and dangerous, without being of his nation, because their natural inclination
to follow the profession of the parents; and no man can continue to choose military, from the earliest
age that deals with much risk of life, descomodidad, and ongoing work. Nicephore Gregoras says
that Almugavar is name given to all his infantry Latinos, so the Greeks call to all nations to
you west, but there is no reason to contradict with such manifest
falsehood, and more from an author so little noticed in our affairs
as Nicephore.

Navy came Mecina, and prosperous voyage arrived at port Malvacias Morea, where were well received
and helped with some soda on the orders of the Emperor. Before leaving arrived in his letters
he sent to Roger to hasten the voyage. Gladly left people with drink and in a few days the army
arrived in Constantinople, for the month of January indicion second, according Pachymeres with
universal joy of the city seeing the weapons I had to protect, and defend. Andronico, and Miguel emperors,
and all the Greek nobility, with great love and great appreciation samples were received and honored.
He then ordered Andronico land any people, and to stay within the
City in the neighborhood called for Blanquerna and the next day they
handed out four as he had arranged to pay.

CHAPTER VIII.

Roger was home. Fight Catalans and Genoese in Constantinople.

It seemed to the Emperor Andronicus was proper to their safety and credit, implying that the offers
made to our men had to meet a very timely manner, and then show that this deed, given first
by what seemed more difficult, Roger was the wedding of his niece Mary, with which everyone
was satisfied, judging for certain other grants such as lower and easier to enforce. Made
themselves weddings with the solemnity of real people, because the value of Roger could match
the nobility of women. Azan was Mary daughter of Prince of the Bulgarians, and Andronico's sister
Trene of fifteen years of age, extremely beautiful and understood. Among the greatest pleasure
and taste for wedding, there was an uproar and quarrel between Catalans and Genoese fought battle
that almost was bloody, born as often happens in a small case, and although Pachymeres says,
collection was about twenty thousand ducats paid to Roger in Sicily, and that doze Emperor offered
to pay them, but the more one occasion of the quarrel was, a Almugavar flowing through the city gave
rise to two Genoese, seeing him alone, much laughter mocks his suit, and figure, but the military
morale suffered badly Almugavar witticisms and nicknames in court, more daring language of
hands, I rushed to the sword and Trav's independence. Came from both sides supporters and friends, with
courage and prevented or altered as suspects, and that forces from both nations found to their
utter ruin and perdition. The Genoese took their flag or script, and rushed the barracks of
the Almugavares distributed in the neighborhood of Blanquerna. Our cavalry recognizing the danger
of their Almugavares, divided into troops, closed with people Genovesa mismanaged. With this
led to the Almugavares depart from their seats, and together to make satisfaction of those
who so unjustly mistreated.

Peleose of both furthermore, with obstinacy, until the Genoese captain lost his Final Rose is receded
with considerable loss and damage.

Andronico the windows of his palace to watch and looked like the fray when the Genoese were slightly
mistreated, and some dead, and words showed his affection bad mood against them, but when he saw
that with his customary rigor Almugavares were slaying As they were put forward, afraid that
all the Genoese in Constantinople that would not die day; dangerous thing for conservation,
because they depended on the prosperity of his empire. Ti√©nese Andronico would certainly throw
off the yoke of the Genoese if I could safely but it was hard to have to split them so that they
could press at once, and if the consent of Constantinople perished, was irritate the other forces
remained whole, and with prayers and promises and asked the captains who collected and removed theirs,
and George Pachymeres concerned, he sent to Stephen Marzal Andronico great Drungario and Admiral,
who was a quiet turmoil, and to pacify the parties, and who was killed and dismembered. Finally,
the presence and authority of Roger, and the other captains could
therefore they obeyed all, and with much danger they withdrew, because
they had brought their flags with the intention of undertaking pear,
and loot, along with his revenge greed.

It was this population of Genoese, divided by a narrow sea siege of the city of Constantinople
call of the ancient Horn of Byzantium, and now of the Turks and Greeks Galata. Retired and
sedate us, the Emperor ordered them in appreciation of your prompt obedience wage pay. The Genoese
were killed in the City about three thousand, and although They then took the worst, was the cause
of more damage in coming to ours, irritated because this was a rival and powerful nation, that
mattered to keep their friendship our weapons in the empire, for in these times was great and
feared their power around East, arbiters of peace and war. Colonies and Prisons had distinguished
in Greece Pontus, in Palestine, powerful armed, possessed great wealth acquired in its industry
and value, and absolutely owned the universal treatment in Europe with forces that kept equal to
those of the greatest kings, and republics. This came to be almost owners of the Empire Greek. At
this time when the Catalans came to Constantinople, and recognizing the forces who brought them
to the Genoese seemed dangerous vicinity of their weapons, and so always maintained between these
two nations implacable hatred and enmity that lasted many ages, until the value of the two went
missing, along with the Empire of the sea, and ceased emulation,
for whom often fought with varying fortune.

CHAPTER IX.

Navy passes to the Natoli, and made people in Cape Artacio.

With the danger of dependence between Catalans and Genoese, Andronico
said that could happen, within the City have different and various
armed nations, and offended, which with less chance than last time
came, doubtless, to break. Call our Captains and briefly explained
the shaft would have to see their weapons in Asia, protecting their
miserable and Christian peoples, oppressed by the Turks, and removed
the opportunity of new independence and disorders
