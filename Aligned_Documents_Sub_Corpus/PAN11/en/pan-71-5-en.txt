 Opium develops more particularly the nervous system activity life of relation,
while the sulfur stimulates the action of the blood circulatory system and venous.

The direct action of sulfur on this system is excitants, but in the Dyscrasic, the excitement is fixed
at some body whose testura is impaired, or at least more particularly affected, and fatigue that
develops in the body darkens from time to time by the excitement local tends to be generalized, resulting
in recrudescence, or fluxionarios febrile movements, neuralgias intermittently.

Sulphur corresponds by its elected and irritative action on the blood capillary system and venous,
the herpetic skin, mucous, lymph and parenchyma, and this indication is found even better: 1. º by
alternative action inside out, or the exterior to interior, ie the skin to the mucous membranes
and other organs and vice-versa, 2. º by their direct influence on bodies provided blood capillaries,
or what is, in all organs, excepting bone and fibrous tissue, on which, in effect, its action
is zero or very bit steep, 3. º cutaneous manifestations pose a severe and even diathesis chronic
herpetic analogous to their vesicles, their seeds, their itch, its rubicundeces and its various
eruptions always accompanied by symptoms of irritation blood.

All this gives the character of sulfur medication for excellence of herpetic diathesis and Herpes,
both in its various forms, such as its existence in potentia or latent, and transformations
more remote, so that rarely is the disease whose treatment sulfur does not provide its powerful
aid, and as a medicine that suits the symptoms of these diseases because antiherpes considered.

To
present the picture of the core symptoms of sulfur, it would need
to reproduce that characterize a host of chronic diseases are therefore
numerous and represent asthmatic conditions, tisiformes, flegmorrágicas,
hemotóicas, hemorrhagic mucosal nerve lymphatic, scrofulous, vein,
organ damage, skin diseases, cachexia, fevers; but all have the character
sobreescitacion irritable due to the arterial capillaries and veins,
with the majority, if not all, undergoes recrudescence fever, and
even when set in the venous or lymphatic system, no pain, redness,
local erethism least.

Scrofulous infarctions not correspond as well to this medication, if not present these characters
and even ulceration, in short, pure affections of bones, ligaments and soft tissues correspond
to his sphere of action, provided there erethism chronic inflammation, and when blood pressure
is stretched to the lymphatic capillaries or venous.

To avoid duplication, fill in the details relating to the physiological action sulfur therapeutic
effects.

§ III .-- therapeutic effects.

= A. = febrile illness .-- The curative effects of sulfur on febrile diseases analogous to their physiological
effects.

These conditions depend forever because of an organic lesion, of a herpetic Fluxion, or a
rash, and a deterioration of liquids or solids which occurs in the
course of a fever essential.

In all these cases the fever is rather insidious intense.

Hectic fever or subacute Ereta this genre is generally sender ever intermittent always irregular
in its early stages, the cold is distressing, the patient very sensitive to the impression of the
exterior air, heat and dry acre. Sweat usually occurs at the time that sleep produces lassitude,
irritability and calm fiber. This quiet and this sweat is however, generally partial and unevenly
distributed at least. Sweat is acidic and sour, pungent odor. It also happens that both the
chills and heat and sweat exist simultaneously but in different parts of body. Nocturnal exacerbations
are uncomfortable heat and alternatives cold, heat and partial sweats. The heat is accompanied
by rubicundeces, especially in provided the face and parts of many nerves, sympathetic or in relation
to essential organs. The palms and soles of the feet are, under this view, parties that the cold,
heat and sweat expresses himself with more intensity, there is evidence that a deep and large
lesion irritability.

Sulfur is involved in any subacute fever when the patient suffers or has had some phlogosis
subacute neuralgia, a congestion, if only hemorrhoids, a rash, provided that such accidents occur
frequently in one form or another, or changing site, according to the seasons and the evolution
of life activity in different organs, the major physiological periods of existence, such as
when to crusts serpiginous, the adenitis ... of children, happen
dartros, ophthalmia ... a elderly, and when even later, laryngitis,
the hemicráneas ... replace the gastritis, hemorrhoids, leucorrhoea
... liver to heart attacks and catarrh of the bladder ..... In short,
if, for all ages, but in different seasons, appear fluxions, boils,
epistaxis, neurosis, erysipelas ...

Any fever, even severe rash or
not, that the eruptive period of decline or is stationary with a dryness
erethism and annihilate the forces of sick calls the use of sulfur,
which for safety may be alternated with aconite.

Given also sulfur in the course of a fever to excite the reaction or revive an eruption languishing
and to prevent the body's insensitivity to the action of drugs most appropriate, which occurs especially
in certain mucous or catarrhal fever subacute and those in which the nervous system has suffered
a violent attack that keeps you immersed in fatigue, as in the nerve and some eruptive fevers,
in these cases, therefore, Sulphur is suitable to moderate the violence of the eruption, especially
smallpox, the suppuration period, in which case the available sulfur the body to the action
of mercury. It has also been used as a preservative of measles, and its symptoms may certainly
contrarian this medication.

= B = Diseases of the bronchi of the lungs and pleura .-- Sulphur
is indicated in disorders of the lung and bronchus by many of its
symptoms.

In the pneumonia course not very sharp, keeps an average sulfur between the bryony and phosphorus.
Corresponds also by its action, when hepatisation and serous exudation and even plastic have come
to its peak and begin to lose the character of sharpness. The indication of sulfur requires
erethism, a trace of irritation that does not require blood phosphorus and which is insufficient
to bryony. Sulfur is much more useful when its action is aimed at cell and tissue to the capillary
network of parenchymal organs and tissues of Este surface, and the more altered this action the
more plastic and Scythian processus to the capillaries within the meaning of transformation organic
tend to resorption of the exudation and to the desinfartacion tissues.

It is also very useful in pleurisy, which presents the chills at the time that the fever seems to
park, and when the body begins to react on products of inflammation. In general, all spills in the
pleura, the peritoneum and other serous membranes, and fluids, and
pseudo-membranous, calling for a moment the use the sulfur before
acuity has disappeared, usually at the same time or before the sulfur
lime.

= C = Conditions flegmásicas, venous congestion .-- The special action of sulfur in hair sebaceous
mucosa in a medication he is very useful and often indicated in subacute phlogosis mucous
membrane irritation or erethism, these are, according to we have noted, the subacute or chronic bronchitis
exacerbation, mucous phthisis, vesical catarrh ... It is less effective in inflammations of the
cellular tissue and organs parenchymal, when local irritability and hyperemia arterial blood are
agglomerated capillaries and contiguous and continuous, which is excepted in the physiological
state necessary for this that the inflammation extended engine life, while retaining, however, of acuity
and irritability.

Sulfur, in order, you agree to all febrile affection and character flegmásica ERETES already
have a slow, or does not lead to an eruption frankly, to a Fluxion, or because when the affection
comes the period of suppuration of exudation or secretion, finish by induration or by flow of
pus, serous or spills abundant mucus, while retaining always in these cases some local or general
blood irritation.

According to the data that we sit, one can easily deduce that the sulfur is indicated: 1. No irritant
in chronic diarrhea and profound weakness - which can be filled dual with doses more or less
weak, - and in the lientería, especially in constipation hemorrhoidal urethritis in military drop
old or serous flow and pain, the thuja is very useful after sulfur;

2. º in all mucus and mucus-purulent, whatever you want the site;

3. º In many hypersecretion or altered or abnormal secretions, the etiology is obscure and unknown
cause, in the sweat of the feet and armpits, the greasy coating hair, palms of the hands or the
skin of the beard, and even oily secretion throughout the body, or simply local or general sweating
with increased heat and stagnation;

4. º in the irritation of hemorrhoids, after nux vomica, and most of bleeding with ESRD, such as
hematuria, epistaxis ... and even the same menstruation excess or advance and also in the suppression
of it by sluggish anemic or scrofulous;

5. º The cephalic congestion, pulmonale, abdominal, liver ... When
hemorrhoids pars are the Mandans, in blood or irritable people.

= D = Cachexia .-- The herpetic diathesis plays in all directions on the sulfur and its or
changes in their secondary or tertiary periods, and when it is clear, visible, external, shaped damning
indicators or symptoms clearly.

These conditions are chronic, and his general condition deteriorated due to the perceived
dominance of the movement Eliminator on establishing the organs, which explanations include the
name of sulfur diathesis chlorotic, anemic, which is similar to sea
salt, in the scrofulous diathesis with all kind of conditions, such
as ophthalmia, mesenteric tabes, rickets, rashes, ulcers, diarrhea
and other mucus and pus, and all diathesis is observed in the following:
1.

No general wasting with ESRD and looseness with abundant mucous secretion mucus or pus, and sometimes
edema and serous effusions with dryness and Lampwork mucosal surfaces,
2.

No greater susceptibility to cold air and wind, and easy to getting a cold and rheumatic pains;
3. No rashes, red spots, glandular affections; 4. No appetite pronounced and insufficient
repair of the organic elements.

The sulfur is sufficient by itself to cure a condition that sometimes develop in these circumstances
with herpetic nature: for example, inflammation of the eye subirritativas whose parts all are
affected by deep and lasting action. But in ophthalmia, and in any affection of this kind, he frequently
alternates with aconite, chamomile, and administered before sulfur, calcium carbonate, silica
... but after insisting as appropriate in the medicine we try, and repeating the dose the more,
the longer the patient gave the first age.

Sulfur, in short, when used consistently and in doses appropriate to the age of the patient, temperament
and nature of the ailment that it is combat, produces cures in vain
be sought with many medications.

Not the most suitable drug sulfur to stimulate capillary system, improve nutrient movement and disposal
excite the constituent elements of the tissues and juices nutritious? Herein is the predominance
their influence on the heart and blood vessels, it can dispel stasis and venous and lymphatic inertia,
whenever the existence of serious organ damage is not contraindicated use and inspire well-founded fears
that extends and serious.

We have said, but the importance of the subject deserves to repeat
that changes in general very early in the course of drug treatment.

But back to our case, we indicate because the large number of chronic conditions, from cataracts
to decay to dutifully fill the exposition of which require the use of sulfur and its elective, as
the similarity of their effects with the ups. More removed only the enumeration of the most cardinal
and serve as type for the use of sulfur in others of the same gender.

= E. = nervous and neuralgic affections .-- neuro, neuralgia and paralysis own recognized by
sulfur causes herpetic dartrosa metastasis, an eruption aborted herpetic diathesis hereditary. Whenever
the background or existing symptoms lead the physician to make this
specific diagnosis, it is necessary to administer the sulfur more
drugs than particularly suitable: 1. º in chronic seizure disorders,
Pertussis in the Rebel, the hysteria and access epileptiform 2. º
in hypochondriasis, in various philosophical and religious mania in
the mental alienation, in consequence of false crisis of nerve fevers,
or of the excesses in the study, 3. º in chronic gout on all irregular,
with violent local erethism, redness and tension, or sluggish deep
sobreescitacion general or cerebral nerve 4. º rheumatic pains in
the head, teeth, members, in rheumatic diseases of the joints of the
viscera and membranes serous, 5. º in asthma and all asthmatic affection
6. º in neuro-asthenic and some cases of muscular atrophy, especially
in children.

Science now recognizes and clinic has long since have established the relations of all the affections
of this genre with rash and mucous herpes or secondary.

= F. = Skin conditions .-- If the rash is divided into three classes according chronic Part of
the integument that affect, or is the epidermis, the dermis and mucosal Malpighian body, sulfur
is indicated in all, it meets in its effects on the skin system of
all medications, and consist of softening, exfoliation or loss of
substance and the induration, granulation, hypertrophy, new formation.

Many drugs are not But his best auxiliaries, not only to prepare and tissue injuries to his action,
but also to complete or more specialized.

In the ordinary divisions of skin conditions, corresponds to sulfur forms vesicular and papular,
rashes, or scabies psoric, miliary or crusts in red spots, liver and furfuraceous, when these conditions
are unpleasant itching, heat after scratching. This itching burning, if only, more violent night
and in bed that day, also calls for sulfur.

Among the peculiarities of the effects of sulfur stand some that make it useful: in miliary and urticaria,
affecting completely to a member with itching and abrasions; in herpetic crusts on an inflammatory
base, itching and hot, or that open easily, in dry eruptions of the head and scalp, in the cradle cap
Creeping, epidermal abrasions on the palms of the hands in pityriasis alopecia; in furfuraceous
with herpes blisters on the nipple cracks after Arnica, whether or not erythematous halo, and
which also plays the graphite in the intertrigo, in inflamed chilblains in the redness of the
nose and other cutaneous blood stasis Itching and heat in the ulcers
with serous bloody pus, in the toes or cloth, obstruction of sebaceous
follicles in accumulating a material whose swelling caseiforme Acne
occurs graphite itself, in cases of scabies transformed with large
or long-standing pruritus, when the vesicles appear everywhere except
in the hands, which are stations and given functional regions, which
often ulcerate, crust over and are compounded by sanious boils; in
whitlow and other inflammations also erysipelatous that play often
and alternate with styes, irritation in the larynx, sore rheumatic.

Here, then, the drug that has been regarded as a panacea and a balm: nswers are indications,
that feeling we have reduced to as short extent. Aliéntanos the idea of ??having assisted the reader
to determine their elective and their properties and have put in a position to take advantage
of its pathogenesis and analysis of its effects clinical.

= Dose .=-- The observations we made on the dose and now have an explanation particular. In
general there are enough reasons to choose in preference satisfactory by small or large. It
is therefore logical and natural to have recourse to both doses weaker as the drug is most appropriate,
since the reaction tends to excite curative in the sense of morbid synergies. The stronger doses
should be reserved for Where indications are less precise, but rather
based on a set of phenomena Dyscrasic or rational, that as a synthetic
expression of the morbid state, does not exactly match special symptoms
to able to characterize the diagnosis of disease and medicine.

The action, therefore, sulfur, characterized in the phenomena erethism its field force, would
determine especially if organic lesion coexists internal increased irritability insidious, deadly
for the same, whether in these circumstances not be administered at doses weaker. There is
the same danger in the states diathesis without internal organic lesion, and only agreed to
fund the herpetic affection, whether intended to stimulate the blood system, dissipate the
inertia and awaken some manifestation herpetic.

The first three crushing and sulfur dye, made according to the precepts of the Hahnemannian pharmacopoeia
are sufficient dose for many conditions terns, such as dartros, ulcers, chronic erythematous
irritation, and in the same scabies, were administered 2 or 3 decigrammes the first to the third crushing,
three or four doses a day, or else from 2 to 20 drops of tincture of fractions in the same way.
Exterior applications, even scabies should not ever go to these amounts, and ointment to two
parts of the dye or the first shredding for fifteen butter and lotions with two parts the stain
for ten or fifteen of pure water. These lotions repeated three or four times day, are perhaps the best
way to treat scabies, giving the interior dose as those was just appointed, and continuing
treatment for a dozen days.

We are aware that You can delete a mangy eruption in less time, but the EXPERIENCE proves that these
deletions are not ordinarily true healing. It may, finally, sprinkle advantageously sordid ulcers,
varicose veins and certain skin lesions, exudates, with the second or third crushing.

The internal organic disease of the lungs, liver, ..., with hectic
fever, require dose but weak enough blood to the thirty-some attenuation,
and is not usually what better and have not been repeated many days
and even weeks at times, because the action Sulfur is also quite extended
in these cases to allow any other drug insert during the time of his
action.

The body sometimes dangerously excites the strong influence of dose, and injuries such as lung,
for example, may be aggravated insidiously, whereas weak calms irritability and fever, acting
favorably altered tissue. The mean dose of the sixth to the thirtieth attenuation are preferable
in cases where less irritability, and skin diseases, injuries terns, scrofula, etc..

Even insisting on this issue, we will say no more required medication adapt well their gender doses
of illness, his strength and temperament of the patient: all dosage scale degrees are required for sulfur,
and all have their chance. Dose should be used only miasmatic, if we express it, not to touch
the body and lead to frequent aggravations. Sulfur, in short, is more related to a large number
of diseases and medications and antidotes that have more numerous, being so he Many turn to
drugs. We conclude with abuse indicate that some water is made mercury sulfide as an antidote
in cases of syphilis treated by large doses of it it would be more rational to be limited to sufficient
doses, but no excesses and harmful.

Acidum sulphuris (sulfuric acid).

§ I. - History.

Sulfuric acid is a drug after having been used extensively in the past, as evidenced by the work
and Delens Merat [25] and the observations of Dipper, Sydenham, Haller, etc., is now relegated
to the mineral lemonade advocated against lead colic. Addition exterior use of it was done in
the treatment of atonic ulcers of the dartros; apart from its application in gargles and injections
in the thrush and mouth ulcers, certain angina, aphthous irritation of the vulva and vagina,
was prescribed in the form of elixir, Rabel water, etc., against a large number of acute and
chronic illnesses such as fevers inflammatory, intermittent rashes, malignant, putrid in different
periods and be given, In short, the nickname of antiseptic. He also used against pneumonia, phthisis,
the colliquative sweats, passive hemorrhages, scurvy, purpura hemorrhagic dropsy, delirium drunks
tremens, epilepsy, chorea, and other mucus diarrhea, rheumatism,
arthritis, syphilis, scrofula ... This was very likely to sulfuric
acid, and distrust observers more rigid or more illustrations contributed
a lot to the abandonment of a drug that should find many times ineffective.

The

counter-stimulated that they want the sulfuric acid is a hipostenizante vascular forget their
special symptoms, and admit that the disease manifested in the effective hipostenizante in
nature, from epilepsy to scurvy, without distinguishing stages of the disease. It's funny to
see that suddenly are obtained by the high dose, when there is tolerance medicinal sedative effects really
é hipostenizantes without the body pass, at least substantially, by the primary excitation
belongs to the almost universality of the drugs, these effects also fit, but by chance and specialties
of their action, to a number of diseases which are undoubtedly hiposténico character, ie own
sulfuric acid.
