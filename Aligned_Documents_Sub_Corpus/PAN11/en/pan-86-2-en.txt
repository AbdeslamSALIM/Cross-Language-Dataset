 Same thing will happen to the bulls. You can even argue
that the buffs are more invincible. The reasons adduced against them are infinitely less justified.

Sublime
spectacle, no doubt, is to see a handsome boy, with no defense or
floating shield red veil, wearing silk, dressed to party or dance
that fierce and terrible struggle, stand in front of angry and powerful
beast, calling himself and kill him early, falling on it with the
sharp steel.

If, unfortunately, regardless of the bullfighter who at that moment died, his death, if not moral,
will not some beautiful, and pity and terror who causes the beauty will be purified according
to the rules of tragedy, written by the great Greek philosopher.
