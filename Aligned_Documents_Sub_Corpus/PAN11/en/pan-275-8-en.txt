 

Doña Manuela fled the crash, which made her nervous, but before you get to Main stood still surprised
and fearful. In the gutter, people milled about shouting; Some laugh and other indecent exclaiming,
clucking as if it were a dog fight. Frightened at first by the violent waves of the crowd who came
to her, did not know whether to flee or to obey his curiosity, which kept her still. What was it ...?
Is it stuck? The crowd broke through, and fast, with a blind impulse, as spurred by the terror,
spent a dozen girls disheveled, shaggy, in sandals, with the dirty skirt almost loose and holding
in his hand, instinctively extended bring down barriers, a pair of cotton socks, three lemons,
a bunch of parsley, combs Horn, articles, in short, that can be bought with a few cents at
any juncture. That herd dirty, miserable and scared, with the pallor of hunger in meat and madness
of terror in his eyes, was the piracy market, the outcasts who were outside the law, those unable to
pay the City the license for the sale, and to distinguish the distance the blue coat and cap
golden sheriff's avisábanse with instinctive cries, as herds to sensed danger, and undertook
furious race, pushing pedestrians, sliding between his legs, falling to rise immediately,
leaving holes in the mass of humanity that obstructed the plaza. People laughed at this stampede
at a gallop, holding Sheriff's persecution. No one understood what it was for those unfortunate
loss of their miserable goods, the desperate father back to the hovel where the mother was waiting
ready to seize the couple's actual gain or administer a beating.

Doña Manuela also laughed a little, according to the view that the noisy chase away, and then
entered the market for gravel, looking for wild treats people ruminating
with delight at Christmas, forgotten during the rest of the year.

The coming stalls to the gates of the Principal; codeábanse buyers to the guard, and two officers
of the guard, with his hands in his coat and legs hit by the restless sword, walked through the
crowd looking for pretty faces.

He walked with difficulty, fearing to put the foot on the mats of straw round and high edges,
which amontonábanse, forming pyramid, glossy chestnut-colored chocolate
and hazelnuts, which gave off the pungent perfume of the forests.

Throwing nuts in their bags a cluck-cluck happy whenever the buyer's hand to appreciate the
stirring quality, and a little deeper, like a treasure hard to save, was in small bags the
aristocracy of gravel, sweetish acorns, attracting the eyes of gourmets.
