Candida, with that authority that he knew clothed at all times serious, sent clear one of the skylights
to take free possession of her girls Telleria, Lantigua and Bringas. Démontrer lady! He threatened
to put out a stranger if all people not obeyed.

Curious spectacle was the Hall of Columns as seen from the roof. The table of the twelve poor
did not look very good, but that of the twelve old was in front and not a detail lost. What
a shame the unhappy with their merino dresses, their new shawls and the head scarves! Verse among
much pomp, served by the Queen herself, including that the asked a sad day before farthing
in the door of a church! ... No lifting his eyes table rather than to look astonished those
who served them. Some shed tears of embarrassment rather than gratitude, for its position among
the mighty of the land and to the charity of label that favored more was to humiliate that
pamper. If all effort of imagination would not be sufficient to represent Christ in tails, there
is no reasoning which can convince us that this comedy palace has nothing to do with Gospel.

The
plates were taken at the door, hands raised, for the straight people waiter made in this pious
occasion.

Forming chain, ladies and gentle men were going to the very hands of the Kings, who presented
them to the poor air of kindness and courtesy, the only sympathetic note in that picture theatrical
farce. But the unhappy not eat, if they were eating had a great hurry to see. Probably his
clumsy hands could not remember how it carries food to the mouth. Rations placed on the table, a
servant was caught them and put in two baskets that had every poor behind from his seat. Shortly afterwards,
when real people and the greatness left the room, out those with her basket, and the chambers
of the pastries were waiting innkeepers Madrid or other unique merchants to buy everything for
a few dollars.

The duration of the food, the gracious spectators did not stop his
talk talkative.

Mary Egyptian, would have liked to be down, with great dress tail, passing trays. One of the
Lantigua would venture to argue that this was a comedy misrepresented, and again only was fixed
in the luxury of costumes and uniforms.

- Look, look my mom. Do you see her dress peach? It is next to Mr. Fish, talking with him.

- Yes ... now look at the ceiling ... Well know we're here. And D. Francisco also see, there
... along the steward of the week. Next to my mom ...

- What a beautiful marquise with mauve skirt and cloak!

... Ah, Dona Tula Dona Tula ... if you look up, if we look ... Here we are ...

- Each ceremony of this is costing my aunt many headaches and much trouble, because know the
recommendations it receives ... For twenty-four poor, there are three
hundred recommendations.

Every day letters and the Marchioness recaditos or countess. Daughter ...!, they seem to go to
give a big target.

- Tell me, girl - said with disgust Candida sovereign - that yesterday and today I have left
live. Tomasa, the camera girl, my neighbor, was in charge of washing the twelve elders such poor and
change their smelly rags for clothes that have been today. Poor women! It is the second water
that falls on your life and be the first if they had not baptized. Oh, girls! ... What scene
this morning! Believe, have spent a vat of cologne ... I wanted to help a little, because it seemed
to meet something that our Lord commands us Jesus Christ.

If not for me, not just scrubbing all morning ... Speaking truthfully, if I were poor and I
bring to this ceremony was to acknowledge not all, because frankly, passing the shock and discomfort
of being so washed, not offset by what they provide.

The funny chickens, whose tender age had much value the spiritual and imaginative, not understand
these practical reasons the experienced Dona Candida, and all were own, nice and appropriate
to double majesty of Religion and the Throne ...

Isabelita Bringas was a sickly child, weak, spirit, and watched it predispositions epilepsy. His
sleep was often disturbed by distressing nightmares, followed by vomiting and seizures, and sometimes
lacking this symptom, the bad early manifested a more alarming. He would like lela and took
too long to understand things, completely missing Infant liveliness. It could not be nagging,
and at school the teacher had orders not impose any punishment or require her application and
work. If during the day witnessed something to excite their sensitivity or had cases before
her pitiful, at night reproduced at all in his troubled sleep. This is compounded when excess
in food or by poor condition of this, the stomach's digestive work of the poor child was over
With few forces. That Thursday, Dona Tula splendidly fed her friends. The girl was docked Bringas
a bowl of milk, which he liked, but it dearly paid the poor, as did a quarter-hour that had
been lying when he was thrust fever and delirium, and began to look and feel with horrible
blunders all incidents, people and things of that day so busy that had so much fun. Repeated
games the terrace, saw the girls all, greatly disfigured, and Candida as a major black pastor
who guarded the flock again attended the ceremony of food poor, peering through a hole in the skylight,
and animated figures of the roof, removing out their paws to scare the curious ... Then he heard playing
real progress. Was that Queen ascended to the terrace? No, appeared through the door of the ladies
step mom, grabbed Pez's arm, and his dad giving him the Marquise de Telleria. What came dragging
pretty those queues that certainly had more than one league! ... And they, how well packaged
and what stiff! ... Came to rest and take refreshment at Dona Tula, to accompany more late
to the whole Court Lady and the visit of Tabernacles ... For all the gates Palacio top of
several liveries appeared much blue and red cloth, much gold braid and silver, tricorn infinite
... Raving again, he saw the shining city and glazed a thousand colorful. Surely it was a city
of dolls, but what a doll! ... By various sides white wigs out, and no door opened into the
recesses of the second floor without give way to a beautiful wax figure, tow or porcelain, and
all ran down the corridors shouting "it's time ...». Crossed on the stairs coming up with gallon
gallon down ... All the dolls were in a hurry. In this he forgot one thing, one another, a
buckle, a pen, a lanyard. Some called their women so that they achieve something, and all repeated,
"when ...!». After swirling down the main staircase. In the courtyard, the yeomen writhed with
coachmen and footmen, and was like a big pot that boiled human members of many colors, twisting
to the action of heat ... His mom and dad came back again ... Well, they were hermosotes! But
much nicer would your dad when hiciese Knight of the Holy Sepulchre. King was hard at it, and
had promised to give him a uniform with all the accessories of the sword, spurs and more. Guapín
What would his father with his white coat, all white! ... At this point, the poor she was
completely soaked his being on an idea of ??whiteness, at the same time an obstruction horrible embarrassed,
as if things reproducing his brain, dolls and palace were contained within his tiny stomach. With
agonizing convulsions threw it all out and contained the rave, and felt a relief ...! His mother
had jumped from the bed to go to help her. Isabelita clearly heard, and awakened, the loving
voice saying: "It's over, darling, that's nothing. "

The beauty of miracles had not yet reached the twilight in which
we featured in the sad story of his son for years 75 to 78, but moved
away and enough of the meridian of life.

The restoration procedure used with rare skill still not denounced themselves same as those plasters
marred by the poor condition of the building to which they apply. The time defending his wit,
his elegance, his refined taste in clothing gear and sympathy inspire those who knew not trying
to close.

All these qualities equally subjugated the spirit of Rosalía Bringas,
but what stood out including the most tyrannical was the exquisite
taste in fashion rags.

This gift for her friend was like the sun shining Bringas which could not face watching to face without
dazzling. Because in that estimate had the authority of the Marchioness in these treaties,
which did not dare have an opinion that was not a true reflection of the August proclaimed by
her. All doubts about a color or form of dress were cut with a word of Miracles. What is said
was already legal body for any question that occurs later, as not only authorizing legislation
but his teaching by example, dressing in a spotless, the de Bringas, which at this time in our
history was passionate greatly by the dresses, rose to Milagros in his soul a veritable altar. Garcia's
widow Grande Rosalie captivated with its prestigious historical figure. Respetábala this as the gods
of a dead religion, but Milagros had it in the predicament of living dogmas and the gods in power.
Nobody in the world, even Bringas, was on the ascendant Pipaón as large as Miracles. The woman,
authoritarian and somewhat rude to peers and lower became timid in the presence of his idol,
who was also his teacher.

Agustin Caballero freebies and assignment of all the finery she had bought for wedding, Rosalie awoke
the passion of the dress.

His former modesty that most had virtue of necessity, was subjected to a test that did not come
out victorious. In another time, the wisdom of Thiers was able to curb the appetite of luxury,
making us believe all that did not exist when the only positive in this was the inability to
satisfy them. It is the primary event in human history and the eternal case, the case where
order of fragility. While there was no evidence the fruit forbidden by God that household, all going
well. But the apple was bitten, but the devil take the form of snake here ruin or other animal,
and goodbye my modesty. After having released so many beautiful costumes, how resigned to return
to the old rags never change no longer fashionable? This could not be. He had been blessed Augustine,
generously and without hesitation, the corrupter his cousin, had been the serpent in good faith
that got him in the head the most dangerous vanities that can hollow out the brain of a woman.
The gifts were the fruit whose sweetness took his innocence, and because of them an angel
with a sword of satin that I threw her paradise on your Bringas had it so secure. Nothing, nothing
... hard to believe that what Dona Eva is so remote. Say what you will, had to spend yesterday,
as it is for chilly and throbbing that event. Appear to have brought the papers last night.

As
his wife disapproved Bringas several dresses and expenses in finery and ornaments, she affected
to despise the news, but bells were always covered by reforms rags combining and interpreting
more or less freely what brought the figurines.

When Milagros was going to spend time with her, if Bringas was in the office, chatting at
home, venting each in his way, the passion that dominated them both.

But if the holy man was in his hollow window, plunged into the microcosm
of the work hair, the ladies were kept in the Carrion, and there were
dispatched to their liking without witnesses.

Rosalie pulled the dresser drawers gently to make noise, drew skirts, bodies pending reform,
pieces of cloth cut or cut, strips of velvet and silk, and putting it all on a sofa, on chairs,
trunks or soil if necessary, starting a feverish advice on what should be done to achieve the best
and most striking effect in of distinction. These councils had no end, and if you take minutes
of them offer an encyclopedic record of this curious womanly passion in the world does more
damage that revolutions. The two spoke quietly so as not found out Bringas, and was its rapid whisper,
drowned, vehement, sometimes indicating indecision and surprise, sometimes enthusiasm of a happy
thought. French words seeking to qualify this conference is taking off the fabric of our language,
but even if it stuck with pins, I have to hold for the exotic language rags castiza not lose
its brilliance.

Looking .--=( ROSALIA a fashion plate.) = To tell the truth, I do not understand this. I do

MIRACLES .--=( helping to keep all hastily.) = Yes, I feel his little cough. Oh, friend, your

Rosalia were happy times for those passing through the Marquise discussing the form and manner
to fix his clothes. But the greatest joy it was to accompany her friend to stores though sorrows
not going to buy many good things he saw. Weather they would not feel it. Milagros was made to show everything
in the store, stirring, comparing; the sudden passing whim to cold disdain; haggling, and
concluded by acquiring different things cargábanle the amount in your account. Rosalia, if something
bought, after much thought and cruising around money, paid always tocateja. Their purchases
were generally not that patchwork, outdated or fabric pieces to make matches with the good
she was at home, and recast the old giving sheen and representation of novelty.

But one day he saw at the home of a mantle Sobrino Hermanos ... What piece, what apple of Eve! The
passion of the collector in the presence of a rare specimen, the enthusiasm of the hunter to
view of a brave and stout res give us no idea of ??this great fondness wipe in certain women.
Rosalia you were the eyes behind the superb garment, when the kind trade-dependent taught an
assortment of them, piling on the counter as if they were empty bags. Timidly asked the price
but were afraid to haggle.

The enormity terrified cost almost as much as it seduced splendid piece, in which the velvet
bright cloth and trimmings combined pilgrimage. At home he could not remove imagination, all
day and all night, the happy mantle, and thereby snatched his blood
burning desire, which feared an erysipelas ataquillo if not sated.

Again Milagros to stores the next day, with no intention of entering the Sobrino, where temptation
was great, but the Devil arranged for them to be, and here displayed
again on the counter white boxes, those glossy cardboard chests which
they are filed women's dreams.

The clerk took them out one by one, forming black stack. The preferred appeared with its elegant
shape and luxurious trimmings, in which black lightning bead, trembling in plush, confirmed
all that the poets have said mantle night. Rosalie had to feel cold in the chest, burning in
the temples, and their shoulders Nerves suggested so true to the
sense of touch and weight of the mat, he believed and carry on.

-
Buy it you ... by God! - Milagros said her friend in a manner so suggestive
that Sobrino dependent and it could not but support a concept as sensible.

Why what is to be deprived of an article that falls so well?

And when the shopkeepers moved away a bit in the direction of another group of parishioners,
the Marchioness catechesis followed her friend to this whisper

- Do not deprive you buy if you like ... and indeed is very cheap ... Just come you with me, that
does not need to pay now. I have here a lot of credit. No you will pass the bill until within
a few months, into the summer, and perhaps year-end.

The long term idea was hesitant to Rosalia, tilting all its spirit-side Purchase ... Actually,
1700 was not exorbitant real for her and easier it would gather,
if you will light selling some things that no longer wanted to be,
if in addition economized, sparing with patience and perseverance
the daily expenditure of the house. The worst thing was that Bringas
was not to authorize such a considerable expense which was not absolutely
necessary.

Other times she had made herself his polkas and shawls,
borrowing one for the model. Buying the tackle on the rise in Santa
Cruz, joining pieces, hiding patches, obtained satisfactory results
through hard work and little money. But how could compare the pobreterías
made for her with that brilliant model come from Paris? ... Bringas
not allow luxury that certainly had to look Asian, and that the thing
happened, it was necessary fool ... No, no, not determined
