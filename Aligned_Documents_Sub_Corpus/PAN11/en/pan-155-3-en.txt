 Our Moorish
philosophy, asceticism, or whatever you want to call it, gives himself this magnanimous indifference
so deplored by economists and politicians, and so applauded by another class of thinkers who
look at things from the top. Travel, yes, for pleasure, the elegant and dreamers, swimmers from
fans and lovers of nature, but precisely on that date, this lineage of Madrid and was returning
to the banks of the Manzanares, or, rather, to hydrants del Lozoya .-- In addition, that day
was Tuesday, and Tuesday barely dispatches a ticket in our railways, by that which you embark
on a Tuesday or or get married, because I have moved with me always to prefer to travel on Tuesdays,
it will a looser in the train or diligence. And if I can combine it is Tuesday and day 13,
the better!

That's the play we took it we decided that night by operation of law ..... I mean, we owned a reserved
eight seats, four people gave two seats each, with a corresponding corner of a head and head
.-- We sleep, then immediately the train started up (as we were in dire need the rest of our haste
the day, and also to whet your dream and providing rest, to account for the early mornings and
other hardships resulting to an artistic and poetic delivery ground chickpeas), and spent much
time sleeping.

* * *

At three o'clock in the morning we woke up hungry.

We were in Sanchidrián, to twenty-five leagues from Madrid, on the
other side of the Cordillera Guadarrama.

Well we had behaved! Five hours of sleep at a stretch!

For them, we just heard, at noon thing, one of those intervals of semi- which is the sleeper train
at every stop, the discordant cries that a poor woman (Which alone
would be awake at that hour in that rough saw) proclaimed throughout
the row of cars, "milk the Navas!", without any noise continue demonstration
that the unfortunate night owl dispatched something .....

That is,
we had passed through El Escorial, by the above Navas (God bless)
by Avila, and several other small towns and large, without us even
aware of it .-- Who Don told him Felipe II when the building what
was called the eighth wonder!

Who said there would come a time when there crossed people with closed eyes as lovers of art
and history as we do!

But what a lot if we had gone with equal indifference the formidable Sierra de Guadarrama (Which
is somewhat larger than the Monasterio del Escorial), going unconscious,
not only front of their tops, but in their very same womb, the cradle
of metals by the office of earthquakes in the regions of hell?

* * *

Sanchidrián said that we were, and the sting of hunger had roused us.

The same boy who knew the route by which station particularly we were (as nobody had bothered to vocearla),
we also participated, motu proprio, the thermometer the telegraph
marked at that moment six degrees below zero.

Hear us, and lower the window glass, all was a single thing! Fact which transform the car into
an inn, and dined quietly, profuse and pleasing, that for that announced we had on board the basket
of provisions, that nothing was missing in profile, then groceries to more than good law, containing
bottles of water and wine bottles, coffee himself Aden and machine
to do it, lighting candles that guiorno, and many other refinements
of sybaritic and comfort that not even conceived by the ancient Roman
emperors.

After dinner, we were unable to return to sleep .-- We, therefore,
happy conversation about an hour until, about five in the morning
(ie still with stars) we arrived at the station Medina del Campo.

Medina! Stop and catering!

Change of train passengers to Zamora and Salamanca! - Cried The youth
of the Station.

- Go to an inn and an untimely stop! - We exclaim
with a sigh.

And we went to collect our belongings.

III

EN MEDINA DEL CAMPO

Travelers who go to Salamanca in railroad, have to wait in the station Medina (for an hour!)
for the train that runs solely between these two We charge .-- illustrious cities, then, with
all of our furnishings, and cast ashore standing on the platform, adhering to the high and incomprehensible
designs of the companies, which have not seen fit save to travelers this time of detention.

As
it was still dark, as already stated, and did all the cold that we
were told in Sanchidrián we had to take refuge, like the rest of the
travelers (about thirty natural those nearby) in the tiny cafe descristalado
and afortunadísimo (vulgo Fonda) of Station, where we were obliged
to listen, to our regret, over another call, unedifying and nothing
funny ....., to which we get after shirk, speaking us and quietly
to the illustrious city whose doors vivaqueábamos so unpleasantly.

This is, therefore, that came out the day funestísimo August 21, 1520, in which Medina del Campo
was burned by the mayor and Captain Ronquillo Fonseca, in consequence of its inhabitants have
resisted to hand over the artillery to fight to Segovia, raised for the Communards, and we
remember also that beautiful letter, written with such why the Segovians to the Madinans, when
you read these sublime words worth ancient Muse of History: - "Our Lord is witness, that if
burned village development houses, they burnt the entrails to us, and we would like to lose any
more lives that many farms were lost. But take, gentlemen, of course, that Medina was lost because
Segovia, Segovia or will not report, or Segovia avenge the insult to the Medina ..... From
we say, and to the law of Christians swear, and this scripture promise that all us for each
one of us will venture Porno estates and lives, and what less is that all the residents of Medina
freely take advantage of the pine forests of Segovia, cutting, to make their homes, wood. Because
it can not be anything more than just that, because Medina occasion that was not destroyed
with artillery to Segovia, Segovia give their pines with to be repaired
to Medina .....»

"Medina (added Lafuente historian) had been until then the emporium of commerce, the great
market of the Kingdom, and the principal repository of foreign goods and domestic cloth, silk,
brocades, jewelry and tapestry: its annual fairs were famous in the
world: all perished on that day of desolation, of seven hundred to
nine hundred houses were consumed by the flames.

"

* * *

All of this had begun to dawn, seeing which, we moved the platform of the station, helarnos
preferring outdoor rosicleres seeing the dawn, the air to cast and to the increasing vulgarity
of the cafe.

The station platform was as quiet as solo .-- Our train had primitive continued his march towards
Irun, no sooner we got out of it, and then had another party direction to the great city of Zamora
.-- The only thing it would not even think of going out signals was the newly established Salamanca
train!

In contrast, the sun came .-- By the way that its first ray did not hurt our eyes directly, but came to
respect a loving kiss with arrogantísimo Gothic tower, which we had seen opposite the station, on the
ruins of an ancient fortress .-- It was the famous Tower Tribute of the renowned Castillo de
la Mota.

This castle, far from Medina few hundred steps, and now separated from it by the tyrannical rail, crown
a kind of plateau in these endless plains of Castile, may well play
the role of height when it chose to seat a citadel there .....-- Isabella
died.

That is, perhaps within this tower, gilded the rising sun, was (and is) the room painted by Rosales,
with unique expertise, in the table was called to his reputation .-- There was imprisoned for
twenty years, Hernando Pizarro, brother and fellow glories of the Conqueror of Peru .-- He
lived also jailed Cesare Borgia the abominable .....

But as if the train had been waiting to Salamanca we were welcome to stay Station at Medina to
say "go!", the bell and whistle, and the voices of employees took
us out in this contemplation of such venerable ruins and its great
historical memories, forced to run more quickly to the platform, which
we had imperceptibly away.

At that moment shone in our eyes, not reflected light, but the same
disk sun .....

It was six.

IV

A MEDINA DEL CAMPO DE SALAMANCA

We left.

The train turned to the West, no sooner stepped out of needles, and Colossus immediately Medina del
Campo, whose last houses adjoining the station.

The railway crosses the same streets of the town, on an embankment a few feet height, through which
we see, over fences and walls, within many pens filled with wood, dung and tools of work,
and covered with very recent frost where they went and the early morning sunbathing and chickens
clucking .....

The Madinans not been lifted yet. At least, the windows and doors of their houses were closed,
not expelling smoke stacks, and there was not a soul in the quiet streets.

Medina is very extensive, and compréndese well, to see that play important
role in the history of Spain.

At every step we discovered dilapidated houses, with every appearance
of uninhabited and large lots of others that have been sunk.

Countless church towers new or old (Ie four or five centuries ago,
or last century, judging from the shape of their bell and the color
of the walls) mantiénense still standing.

Stone abound blackened by time, and still have to count to be down
the centuries and the revolutions .....

Disaster caused by the incendiary
torch of Ronquillo and Fonseca, everywhere nótanse .-- The remains
horrible misfortune of Medina, as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum,
is dated determined.

This year dawned this day of rich and powerful, and at night was a heap of ruins!

But as we thought in this, the train had already left back to Medina del Campo, and ran happier
horizons .....

Let us do the same.

* * *

Medina is 77 km to Salamanca.

About the first to go, only I have to say that we crossed the great plain Castilla la Vieja, more productive,
but no less forlorn and dreary than Castilla New. As we saw eye reached miles and miles of green
fields without newly plows with great care, where the seeds were sown to the crop of 1878, but
or a tree or a house, or running water, even the slightest ripple
in the field !.....

However, almost black, endless plain, sheltered
by a blue sky and clean and flooded with light for a bright and glorious
sunshine, was not without charm and grandeur, to Because of its very
simplicity .-- The day was beautiful, a true Spanish day, and this
beautifies everything.

Moreover, since we were sighting in the solitude of those lands that some farmers quietly plowed
and we could not imagine where they came from or what hours had risen
to be there so early .-- Seen from the train, people seemed of the
Moon viewed from Earth, or inhabitants of the Earth viewed from the
Moon or more like a permanent fixture of that scene, such as human
figures that put the artists in landscapes.

Minutes later (that's like saying a few leagues beyond) we passed
a mound of mud, stone, plaster, tile and broom, topped by a tower
his cross and all ..... It was a people was Campillo: I mean, was
one of many Campillos as contained in the List of Spain.

Then we passed through El Carpio (ie by Carpio, as they also knew
more than one ).....

And to the seven twenty-eight we came Cantalapiedra,
famous today for its drinking water, not drank.

We had entered the province of Salamanca.

There is already beginning to curl the ground .-- Cantalapiedra occupies a sloping plateau, where
there also formerly a castle almost impregnable.

In the fifteenth century the Portuguese took possession of it and
defended a long time under its walls, the claims of the Beltraneja
.-- The inhabitants of the town then proceeded nevertheless the castle
that could over time give occasion to new struggles and problems,
if left standing, and no sooner completed that civil war, demolished
peacefully with its own Wash your hands .-- So that has not always
run as axiomatic as to whether vis pacem, for bellum.

And all I can say Cantalapiedra.

Posts run again, the sun, which was already warming up, began to pat
into the car, and ended up resting most loving .....

And we spend
asleep (as we saw after Indicator) for

New Carolina

Pedroso,

Gomecello,

And
Moriscos

names that have found no echo in our memories, but we had
not been asleep.

Instead, he wanted the Providence despertásemos to leave this last station, ie when A quarter
of an hour (mile and a half) to get to Salamanca .-- Otherwise, we
would suddenly found under the walls of the big city, something opposed
to all the rules of art to be moved.

* * *

The first thing we saw of Salamanca (long before I saw from afar) was his famous bull ....., salamanquinos
bulls, a thousand pounds of weight and formidable horns, planted near the track and watching
the train with more anger than fear.

- Ah, scoundrels! (I was about to tell you). Since time immemorial have been going to Madrid
to scare us with the force and those horns that God has given you !..... Now it's up to the
come to Madrid to Salamanca to frighten you! - Why do not you try to fight this locomotive?

The
bulls had to guess such a challenge, and news, of course, the tragic
end those heroes and martyrs of the same species that rammed into
the banks arrogantly Jarama to the first train from Madrid to Aranjuez
and Aranjuez to Madrid, we again back with great dignity, as if to
say:

- Our race fulfilled and that duty!

Their protest was written with blood! Step to the majesty fall!

And the truth is they were right.

In this appeared before our eyes Salamanca, emerging from the hollow in which it sits to the
right bank of the Tormes.

That was, yes, the very noble and very loyal midwife, with its broken
walls, with its hundred of towers and domes, that horizontal line
is drawn in the sky, with its large buildings of golden stone, reverberating
the sun, and preceded by green trees, which seemed to serve baseboard
or carpet!

Upright stone so rampant in the air, so much architecture, so grandiose,
so nobly, correspond in all respects to dictate laudatory "Girl .....»

Rome was therefore undoubtedly we were ahead of Salamanca.

V.

ENTRY INTO THE CITY STREET .-- ZAMORA

Railway Station Salamanca took one kilometer from the city, and since it it runs to a beautiful
avenue of trees, which serves as a public promenade.

Furthermore, when we went there, built in haste, to service the same station, a large and well conditioned
road, whose route passed dozing and general buses and many individual hotels.

Because this was where we were afraid to find any accommodation when in Madrid We planned the
trip!

- "Señorito, the Hotel H! .....--¡ Señorito at Hotel B! .....--¡ Señorito, at the Fonda X!
.....»-- us facteurs et commissionnaires shouted, neither more nor less than if we had just come
to Paris or London.

- Good for Salamanca! - Exclaim us .-- Noblesse oblige! - When they get big to commoners, things
should be done with this course!

But this very abundance of lodging a new difficulty arose, which was
that, as had not consulted anyone before leaving Madrid, or notice
to any friend of ours arrival at Salamanca, did not know what was
the best hotel we find, therefore, the situation the French (and French
influence far) called embarrass du choix.

It was something of a mistake in point of so much importance.

Wonder, then, to a guard civil (infallible authority, tile below),
and he advised us (in confidence) Hotel Trade.

- At the Hotel Trade!
- Told us then with confidence, penetrating the bus of that dedication.

And

we left.

As for the rest of the passengers ..... (Ah, cuckoo!), And were seen walking on foot for street
trees, from which it follows that the other coaches went to the city
vacuum .-- But What mattered, if the honor of Salamanca was saved?

Brand new saying goes: Do what you must, but what you should do.

* * *

Uploaded on rear bracket, and cap, head, and tucked into the waist of our cage, looked at us and
smiled the lad on the bus (lad also by age, as there would be under
fifteen), and seeing his face I picaresque, worthy of his countryman
Lazarus de Tormes, jubilantly díjeme :--«¡ Here our guide until we
get to the inn !.....»

And I went with him to speak, after donation, which I did, of a cigar.

This young man told us, among many other things less interesting, as the door, and no door,
where soon after we entered Salamanca, is still called the Puerta de Zamora, and the beautiful road
that begins here also bears the name of the city of Gonzalo Arias.

And we remembered, for our part, the clamor that arose in Madrid Schools
the year of 1855, when Salamanca (not all) had seen fit to bring down
such door, not realizing that had served as the Arc de Triomphe for
the entry of Emperor Charles V Tormes in the city of the year, also
of grace, of 1534 .....

The Calle de Zamora said that, as we saw
later, it is the best of Salamanca, called on all our attention, and
especially mine, on brown, and as austere .-- And old age was my last
and then very recent pleasure trip to the theater had been the province
Cadiz, and my eyes were made to see people very white, shiny, brand
new, new to say, well, green adorned balconies, patios flowers exposed
to the public and horizontal roofs of whitewashed style of Africa
was still dancing in my imagination those cities with laughter, no
smoke or artistic monuments, simple, funny and flirty and young, dressed
in calico summer, called Sanlúcar, the Ports, San Fernando and Cadiz.

Salamanca, on the contrary, I had in the Calle de Zamora, dressed in cloth and velvet Iron and suede,
as a kind of ricahembra warnings to assist the Council or to the battle, and more fond of the temple
to the ball .-- Many houses were stone, others were painted in a harsh, outdated, monumental.
The architecture and archeology, history and legend, completely bizarre gay village Cadiz, reappeared,
then, in my view with its venerable character. Great heraldic field over several doors, or
in the spacious canvases very strong walls, or in the black hardware and grills and feudal balconies.
These balconies were huge dust by canopy, finished off roofs in huge eaves, and below, the extent
and ended up in humble flown cross bars. Covers could be seen of the period of the Renaissance
might be called Spanish plateresco, others arc Roman with very great segments, style Trastamaras
weather, and some as imposing and avoid making, that, to avoid running the year 1877, I would have
sworn that living in such houses powerful inquisitors or one of those terrible mayorazgos that
used to be leaders of a dozen brothers, all soldiers, monks and nuns were in doubt .-- Castilla Old,
or, rather, in the ancient kingdom of Leon! Even the air was there, Gothic, Spanish rancid,
pure Christian, antisarraceno, finally - since they have to say the record straight!

And note that Salamanca is nothing gloomy or morose of grim, as we they had believed until then,
similar to other Castilian cities, but is, certainly knew it was, a gay population, lively,
bright, with beautiful sky, free and pure atmosphere, decent, finally, to house, as shelters,
which tend to be called at Valladolid and Burgos Castilla Andalusians.

This

brings us to the hotel, at the other end of that same street, choose rooms we proved excellent, and
since then we are officially notified or warned that lunch at the establishment at eleven o'clock,
we beat palms as a sign of joy, and then take the stairs down, to take advantage of the missing
peak hour for the canonical lunch, taking the first art walk through the city of Fonseca and
Maldonados.

VI

LA PLAZA MAYOR .-- THE GRASS Corrill

The first walk through the
entire historic city should be no guide and no written guide, only
how to form their own opinion of things and admire, or do not admire
them, regardless for suggestions and comments of others.
