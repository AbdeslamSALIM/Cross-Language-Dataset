 This
was to fulfill the wish of the father grandfather aborted.

- This
one to be a lawyer! - Said Dona Bernarda possessed the same zeal that
old for that title that was the finishing of the family.

And lest the corruption of the city wake up in the child's father the same interests, frequently
sent to the capital don Andrés and wrote letter after letter to friends Valencia and in particular
a canon of his confidence, not to lose sight of the boy.

But Rafael was judicious, a serious young model as her mother told the good canon. The highlights
and awards of the College of Alcira continued in Valencia, and also Ramon and his wife found out from
the newspapers of the successes achieved by his son in the "Youth school law, "an evening meeting
in a classroom at the university, where future lawyers were released to discussing issues about
as original as the "French revolution been good or bad "or" socialism,
compared to Christianity.

"

Some guys terrible, that they should go home before ten, otherwise face the outrage of parents, declared
themselves rabid socialists and frightened the janitors, cursing the proposed subject property
- as soon as I finish the race - get a notary or registration. But Rafael, provided it was properly
measured and of these, contained on the right of the learned assembly,
and all issues holding the healthy approach, thinking with St. Thomas
and other scholars noted that the canon in charge of its direction.

These successes were soon being propagated by the party's weekly,
in order to build the glory of the head and enemies not dismissed
as biased, always began: "According to read in the press of the capital
"...

- What a boy! - Dona Bernarda said the priests of the population
.-- What gab!

Already you see, is another Manterola.

And the devout lady, when Rafael for holidays or vacations coming home, ever higher, in manner
that it seemed to him the quintessence of the distinction and clothing under the last dandy, it was
said with an ugly mother satisfaction:

- It will be a real boy. All the rich girls of the city you wish. No more to choose from.

Dona Bernarda felt proud to watch his Rafael, tall, thin and strong hands, big eyes, aquiline nose,
a curly beard and a certain grace and lazy rolling her body made
her look like one of those young Arabs and rich white slippers alquicel
who are the indigenous aristocracy in the colonies of Africa.

Each time he returned home the student, he was greeted by his father
with the same stroke molt.

The drive had been replaced by banknotes, but the powerful claws rested on his head, acariciábale
increasingly slack, weighed less.

Rafael, for his absence, he felt better than others the state of his father. I was sick, very
sick.

Erect as always, serious, imposing, talking little, but thinner, sunk the fiery eyes, it was only
the solid skeleton, marcábanse at the neck, before looked like the
neck of a bull, tendons and arteries between the loose skin and flabby,
and arrogant mustache, increasingly white, fell in dismay as a torn
flag.

The student was surprised by the gesture of anger, fierce eyes blurred
by tears of despair in which it hosted the mother of her fears:

-
To die sooner ... For what it does!

... May the Lord protect us from taking him soon.

Rafael was silent, not wanting to delve into the conjugal drama unfolding next to him, hidden
and quiet.

That gloomy vivant of insatiable appetites, engaged in debauchery dark and mysterious crossed
the stormy whirlwind of their last wishes. Manhood, to feel the closeness of old age, before
filing expired, burned him with more force, and the mighty boss burned
at the last glimpse of their animal exuberance.

It was a sunset that caught fire his life.

Always grimly serious and ran the district like a satyr crazy, no guide to desire, their encounters
brutal abuses of authority, came as a painful echo the manor house, where his friend Don Andrés tried
in vain to console the wife.

- But this man! - Dona Bernarda angry roar .-- That man is going to lose, does not look that
compromises the future of your child.

It was a crazy appetite in his fury, rushed on the green fruit, without seasoning. Fell awestruck
and trembling before his senile burning on the foliage of the gardens, in the stores orange, or evening,
at the edge of a road, off-the virgins childhood almost bald, with oiled hair, smooth chest and lean
members, sad, a thin boy, under the dirty skirts of misery. At night he went out claiming party's
needs and saw him enter the suburbs looking for day laborers ways disrupted by motherhood, whose
husbands work sent in advance in their gardens. He bought dozens of women's shoes, pay in stores
handkerchiefs and petticoats the next day were held only on the outskirts of the city. The most
enthusiastic adherents, without losing the traditional respect, spoke
with a smile of his weaknesses, and pointed out a number of the slum
urchin MøreNot, strong and grim, like a reproduction of Quef.

At night, when Don Ramón, exhausted by the struggle with the insatiable
demon that scraped the bowels, snoring painfully with a whistling
rattle in his lungs and trail of slime in the sad mustache, Dona Bernarda,
incorporated in the bed, his skinny arms on his chest, he looked grim,
with eyes that seemed to stab him and prayed mentally:

- Lord!

My God! That this man will die soon! That runs so disgusted!

And Dona Bernarda's God must have heard her, because her husband walked quickly towards death,
but as a believer, without flinching or feel fear, driven by that
name that consumed, without worrying about losing their strength and
cough that sounded like thunder far, creeping dread of the caverns
of his chest.

- Take care of yourself, Ramon, - said the priest friends,
only people who dared to refer to disorders of his life .-- Will you
getting old and his age, to live as a young man, is called death.

The chief smiled, proud at the bottom of the men knew their deeds, and again to sink into his
rabid dropsy, feeling that every shot of pleasure burned with new desires.

Even patted his son on seeing him enter the court, escorted by Mr. Andrew with law degree.
He gave his gun, a real gem, admired throughout the district, and a magnificent horse. And if you
just wait to see fulfilled the desire of the old Brull, which he did not know make, a few
days later he released his last cough, sounded plaintively all bells of the city, came out with
a black border to the weekly span of the game, and all the district as people came in procession,
to see if the corpse of the mighty Don Ramon Brull, who could stop or accelerate the course
of justice on earth, rotting same The remains of other men.

III

When Dona Bernarda was single and absolute mistress of her house,
could not hide his satisfaction.

Now what would a woman could.

Had the advice and experience of Don Andres, more than ever attached to it and figure Rafael, the
young lawyer named holder of Brull.

The prestige of the family remained unchanged. Don Andrés, who with the death of his employer had
purchased the house a second parent authority is responsible for maintaining relationships with the authorities
in the capital Madrid and the big shots.

At home, they attended the same requests, were received as faithful supporters and made identical
favors without the influence faint in places that don Andrés called "the areas of administration public.
"

Election of deputies arrived, and as always, took Doña Bernarda triumphant
individual appointed him from Madrid.

Don Ramon had left the machine and mounted perfectly adjusted; just
had the oil to continue to march, and there was his widow, always
active, just noticed the slightest squeak in the gears.

The provincial government is talking about the district with the same security as in the past.

-
It's ours. Brull's son has the same force as his father.

The truth was that Rafael was not very interested party. Gazed as one of the farms family whose
lawful possession no one could compete, and merely to obey her mother: - "Go to Don Andres Riola.
Our friends will be glad to see you. " And started Trip to suffer the torment of an interminable
paella, which supporters grieved him with excited joy and rustic gifts offered between fingers
.-- "should you to stop the horse a few days rest. Rather than go for the evening stroll to
the casino. The fellow complain because you do not see. "

And leaving those rides that were their only pleasure, sank in a dense environment, full of screams
and smoke, where he had to answer the most learned of the party, filling the saucers of coffee Ash
wanted to know who spoke better, Castelar or Cánovas, and in case of war between France and
Germany which of the two nations would overcome, issues that caused disputes and friendship cooled.

The unique relationship established voluntarily with the game was
when he took the pen and manufactured weekly for an article on "The
Law and Morality," or "Freedom and Faith" remnants advantage and laborious
student, long runs of platitudes with fragments Metaphysics lessons
that nobody understood and so very excited the admiration of fellow,
which Don Andres said winking:

- What a feather!

Huh? Any discussion with him ... How profound! ...

When his mother forced him at night to visit the home of a wealthy, which suited be happy, I
read, not as in Valencia the books you lent the canon, but works I bought as directed by the
newspapers that he respected his mother volumes with holy reverence that inspired the paper sewn
and bound, only comparable to contempt felt by newspapers devoted
almost all of them to insult the holy things and promote the instincts
of roguery.

Those years of reading at random and without scruples and fears of students, killed silently
many of their strong beliefs that broke the mold from the mother's
friends had gotten into his thought made him dream of a great life,
which had no news that around him.

French novels he moved to Paris that obscured the little-known Madrid at the time of the doctorate,
the stories of love waking up in your body young and virtuous no
other missteps that the vulgar outpourings of student debauchery,
a fierce adventures and complicated passions in beating some of the
intense fire that had consumed her father.

He lived in the ideal world of his readings, rubbing with elegant women, perfumed, spiritual, of true
art in the refinement of their vices.

The sunburned orchard that his father went mad and brutal aphrodisiac causábanle the same disgust
as if they were women of another race, creatures of a lower caste. The Misses of the city, seemed
to him disguised as peasants, with the same instincts of selfishness and economy his parents,
knowing the price it was sold oranges, knowing the number of hanegadas
that each candidate had their baby, adjusting the love of wealth and
believe that honesty was to be ruthless with anyone who did not fit
their traditional life and mean.

For this deep boredom caused him his life monotonous and gray, separated
by wide moat that purely imaginative afterlife enveloped him like
a perfume exotic and exciting, emerging from the pages of books.

Someday he would be free, raise their wings, and this release was
to take place when elected, he deputy.

Wanted to come of age as Crown Prince craves time to be crowned king.

From childhood he had come to expect this event would divide his life into two, introducing new ways
to go directly to glory and wealth.

- When my child is deputy - the mother told her rare outbursts loving expansion - as he's so cute,
I played the girls and marry a millionaire.

And looking forward to this age, life went by Raphael, without alteration
some, a candidate there, sure of his destination, awaiting the passage
of time enter into life.

It was as noble children of other ages, which are graced in the crib the monarch with a title of colonel,
playing spin the waiting time to go to catch head of his regiment. He was born MP and it would,
now expected between racks.

His trip to Italy, the papal pilgrimage, was all that disturbed the monotony of their existence.
Guided by the canon, most churches visited museums theaters only saw two, taking advantage of
looseness that caused travel adventures in the austere character of his guide. Passed indifferent to
the artistic works of the famous temples and stopped to worship any absurd relic accredited
by miracles. But still he could see dimly as Rafael passing, a world different from her country,
was fatally dragged its existence. He felt the touch of the very life of pleasure and passion that
absorbed in books like heady wine; and even from afar, admired in Milan's golden adventurous
bohemia of the singers, in Rome, the splendor of an oligarchy and
artist in perpetual rivalry with Paris and London and in Florence,
the elegant English emigrated in search of sun, taking his canotiers
Straw, the golden tresses of misses and bird chatter in the gardens
where pondered the bleak poet and recounted his jolly tales Boccaccio
to ward off the fear of plague.

That trip, quick as a cinematic vision, leaving a confusing tangle
of Rafael names, buildings, paintings and cities, served to give their
thoughts more fully and lightness, to make the gap even further isolated
him in his ordinary life.

Longed for the extraordinary, the original, he waved his sense of adventure youth, and owner
of a district nearly heir of a feudal lordship, read with respect superstitious a jerk, the name of
a writer, a painter either, "people lost what is not falling dead
", he declared his mother, but he secretly envied, imagining a life
full of pleasures and adventures.

Much would have to be a bohemian like the ones found in the books of Murge, forming merry band, walking
the joy of life and the fierce love of art by the bourgeois world agitated by the fever of
money and class mania! Talent to write beautiful things verses with wings like birds, a little
room under the tiles back in the Latin Quarter, a Mimi poor but sentimental, loved talking
to him two kisses of higher things and not Orange price as those ladies who followed him with
tender eyes, and in return this would give the future council and all the gardens of his estate, although
imposed by Father mortgage and cheating, it still provided an income
for their dreams dishonorable bohemian!

The continuous contact with these fantasies made her life intolerable boss forced to intervene
in the affairs of his supporters, and at the risk of upsetting his mother, fleeing the casino,
looking for the loneliness of the field.

There was developing more fluent their imagination, populated by beings fantastic the way and
groves, often talking aloud with the heroines ideals about love, arranged according to the pattern
of the last novel read.

One afternoon in late summer, Rafael climbed the little mountain of San Salvador, immediate to
the city. He liked to watch from that height the vast estate of the family. All the people who
inhabited the rich plain - as don Andres said describing the greatness of party - the name
of Brull had a cattle iron.

Rafael, following the rocky road of rapid zigzags, recalled the mountains of Assisi had visited
with his friend the canon, a great admirer of the Saint of Umbria. It was a landscape ascetic.
The blue or red rocks poking their heads on the sides of the road, pine and cypress trees out
of their grooves, extending over the barren land, their roots twisting and as a huge black snakes
at intervals, white pillars with roof, and in the center, occupying
a hollow tiles with the sufferings of Jesus on the streets of Bitterness.

Cypress Green waved his pointed hat as if to scare the white butterflies buzzing on rosemary and
nettles, the pines stretched above her parasol, casting spots shadow
on the burning road, where, hardened earth by the sun, crunched under
feet.

On reaching the plaza Rafael chapel, rested from the climb, lying in the bank masonry which
formed a large half moon to the sanctuary.

There reigned the silence of the heights.

The sounds from below, all the buzz of life and work constant of the vast plain, came overwhelmed
and crushed by the wind, like a whisper of a distant swell. Among the tight row of cacti that
stretched behind the bench, fluttering insects, shining in the sun like gold buttons, filling
the silence with tinnitus.

Some chickens - the Hermit - pecked at one end of the square, roughly clucking and shaking
their feathers.

Rafael is plunged in the contemplation of the beautiful panorama. No wonder they called it paradise
their former owners, the Moors, whose grandparents came out of the magical gardens of Baghdad
and accustomed to the splendor of the Arabian Nights, was entranced at the sight yet land for
the first time in Valencia.

In the great valley, orange groves like a velvet wave, fences and fencing vegetation less dark,
crimson land cutting into geometric forms, the groups of palm trees waving their suppliers of
feathers, and leaves that jets would like to touch the sky falling then languid fainting; villas
blue and pink, among clumps of gardening; white farmhouses almost hidden behind the green of
a wood stud, the tall chimneys irrigation machines, yellow and singed the tip tapers, Alcira,
with packed houses on the island and overflowing on the opposite
bank, all of it a matte color Bone, riddled with windows, such as
smallpox gnawed by a black hole.

Further, Carcagente, the rival city wrapped in the belt of lush gardens, for the sea, mountains angles,
corners, with edges that look like the fantastic away castles imagined by Doré, and at the
opposite end of the West Bank towns high, floating emerald lakes in their gardens, the distant
mountains in a violet hue, and the sun starting to drop like a hedgehog gold, sliding between
the gauzes formed by constant evaporation of irrigation.

Rafael, sitting up, looked behind the chapel floor throughout the West Bank, the extension of
rice under the artificial flood, rich cities, Sueca and Cullera,
poking its white houses on those fecund lagoons recalling the landscapes
of India, beyond the Albufera the huge lake and a strip of tin boiling
under the sun, which a distant murmur Valencia dust, marking storey
on the hazy blue mountains, and in the background, serving Limit to
this apotheosis of light and color, the Mediterranean, the Gulf blue
and trembling, kept by Cape San Antonio and Sagunto and Almenara mountains
cutting the horizon their black humps like great whales.

Looking Rafael in a hollow towers of the ruined convent of La Murta, almost hidden among pine forests,
evoked the tragedy of the Reconquest, lamented the fate of those
warriors alquiceles white farmers whose still seemed to float among
the orange trees, the magic trees of the paradises of Asia.

It was an atavistic affection.

The Moorish heritage he had in his melancholy and dreamy, he was regrettable - contrary to their
religious beliefs - the plight of the creators of that Eden.

He imagined the small feudal kingdoms of walis; domains similar to that of his family, only instead
of being grounded in the influence and the process, holding spear of those riders who tilled
the land as well pranced in meetings and meetings with elegance unmatched
by any gentleman. Valencia saw the court with his poetic Ruzafa gardens,
where poets sang mournful verses to the decline of the Moor Valencia,
listened to the beautiful, hidden behind the tall roses
