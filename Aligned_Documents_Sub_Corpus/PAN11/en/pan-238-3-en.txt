 Clementina, between joyous laughter, embraced
him and covered his face with kisses, exclaiming:

- Little Boy, you're delicious!

# A bit of civil law. #

It was very hectic morning at the offices of Salabert. They made a payment of consideration. The
Duke had gone in person to the box to the cashier presence and help in the task of have tickets.
Despite his years handling money, never played pay an amount that will rise a little hands tremble.
Now I was nervous, attentive, crispadamente biting smoking and no
spitting.

Her mouth dried. On several occasions drew attention to the employee to believe that spent
two tickets instead of one, but was wrong at all.

The cashier was diestrísimo in his office. When finished, the Duke went to his office, where
he was awaiting M. Fayolle, the famous importer of foreign horses, provider all the aristocracy
of Madrid.

- Bonjour, monsieur - roughly the duke said slapping him on the back -. Does it come you to fit another
nag?

- Oh, Duke, the horses that I have sold are not nag, no. The animals mecores I've never had it
has taken you - he replied with a foreign accent, smiling a slavishly
M. Fayolle.

- Waste of Paris is what you bring me.

But do not think that I cheated.

I know it time, monsieur, I know for some time. Only I can not see that face and as cheerful
as frescota no surrender.

M. Fayolle smiled opening her mouth to his ears, revealing a big yellow teeth.

- The face is the spec of the soul, Duke.

Confiansa can have in me that I will not give anything not exceeding.

Do Pollio has gone wrong?

- Medianejo.

- Come on, you win joking! The other day I saw him on the street of Alcala hooked the phaeton.
Sake of world stopped to watch.

They talked for a while horses that Duke had bought.

This put blemishes at all. Fayolle enthusiastically defended the amateur and merchant. In a
moment of pause said taking out his watch:

- I will not bother you more .... Cuentesita came to collect the last.

The Duke's face darkened.

Between laughing and then said angrily:

- But, man, they are not happy but you never sacándole one money!

At the same time put his hand into his pocket and pulled out his wallet. M. Fayolle always smiled,
saying, I was sorry, because the Duke was a poor and did not like
asking anyone to take alms, etc., etc. A portion of little jokes that
the banker does not seem to listen, attentive to count tickets.

Had seven hundred pesetas and handed, while pressing ringing for an extended dependent on receipt.
Fayolle also attended and said:

- It is wrong, Duke. The pressures of the horse was four thousand. Here there more than three
thousand.

The Duke gave no signs of hearing. With drooping eyelids, puffing his cigar and walking a another
angle of the mouth, remained silent and kept the portfolio again after having tight with a rubber
band.

- There are five hundred pesetas, Duke - Fayolle repeated.

- How?

Are there missing five hundred pesetas? It can not be .... Let's see, tell you again.

The trader told.

- There are three thousand five hundred ....

- You see you! I was not wrong.

- Is that the horse costs four thousand: and we have acoustic.

Duke's face expressed surprise admirably.

- How four thousand? No man, no, the horse costs three thousand.

On that understanding I bought it.

- Sir Duke, you are wrong - Fayolle said getting serious -.

Remember you had remained in the four thousand.

- I remember perfectly. Which has a short memory you .... A watch (addressing the dependent who
came to extend the receipt), one of you come down to the garage and
ask Benigno on what has been adjusted Pollio.

At the same time, seizing the moment in which the employee looked Fayolle, winked expressive.

The driver replied dependent mouth of the horse had been set at three thousand five hundred
pesetas.

So the merchant was angry. I was quite sure that had remained in the four thousand. In that case
it was delivered. Otherwise never have let the horse out block. The Duke left him talk all
they wanted, running only a grunt of course, but without altered little or much. Only when told
to stay Fayolle again with the horse, said with sarcasm:

- Apparently, you found yourself which of the four thousand and want to undo the deal, right?

- Sir Duke, I swear to you by the most sacred thing there is nothing
that .... I'm only sure it is as I say.

The banker will then promptly undertook a loud fit of coughing. You put your eyes burning, crimson
cheeks.

Then he calmly wiped his mouth with a handkerchief and noses, folksy
accent and said:

- Men, do not be stingy.

You is not altered by these miserable pesetas.

But he did not let go. The vendor wanted to take the horse. Neither
could do it.

There a moment of silence.

Fayolle was about to throw everything rolling and shameless, but was repressed whereas nothing would
move, least bring the matter to court. Who would sue for five hundred pesetas and more with
a character like the Duke of Requena? Resigned, then, with flushed cheeks still be fired without
the Duke not to take him very politely to the door, giving loving
pats on the back.

When the hero resumed his seat at the table, under your weary eyelids shone a grin of triumph.
After a few minutes pulled the bell button again:

- Go and see if the duchess is alone in her room or have seen - told servant who came to the point.

While
carrying out the commission remained inactive, with the body thrown back and hands clasped in
an attitude reflective.

- The duchess is visiting with the father Ortega - the servant came to say.

Salabert made a gesture of impatience, and was again lost in his thoughts. Was determined to
hold a conference with his wife about interests. This had never spoken
anything money.

He did not ever believed in the case of giving account of his speculations
and business.

Ms Carmen does not understand anything if you give her.

It was believed absolute master of his fortune without that you pass by the imagination of the
rights she was his wife. But lately a friend opened his eyes.

Speaking of the disease that afflicted the duchess asked naturally,
if he awarded will.

This friend, who was a lawyer, was solved by half of the estate belonged
to Ms. Carmen.

Salabert was deeply worried. Seeing his wife he was afraid dejection. At his death, the relatives
will require half of what he had acquired would be put your nose
in their affairs, even in the most intimate .... A horror!

He consulted his lawyer. The easiest way to dispel those fears and
impotence leave relatives of his wife, was that this hiciese testament
to his favor.

The Duke found it naturalísimo.

In the conference which was to have with her, I propose more diplomatic as he could, so as
not to alarm you about your illness.

He waited, therefore, to review papers entertained until he thought
the time to send again raised whether the father had cleared Ortega.

But when would she entered to tell him that there were a few gentlemen,
including Calderon, who wanted to see him.

The banker frowned.

- Did you say he was home?

- As the Duke does not refuse ever in the morning ....

- F. ...! Damn you! - Murmured horrible expression of disgust. But loudly and then taking campechanotas
and abrupt ways that were peculiar, shouted:

- To pass, to pass
these gentlemen.

Calderon presented, and two other bankers Urreta no less important and well known in Madrid.
The expression of all of them was serious and even sullen. Salabert, without noticing it, began
handing out hugs and pats on the back, making a tremendous noise
with their voices and laughter.

- Good business!

Good deal now hijack four and require a million pesos each .... Oh! Oh! I have crept into the
office four bigger fish that have Madrid ... Four sharks! ... How is that rheumatism, Urreta?
I think you also need a good hull like me .... And you, Manuel, when
you think pop?

... You see your nephew runs a hurry.

The bankers were polite and quiet, trying to cut with a serious attitude that chanzonetas flow.
For no good reason.

About a year ago that had Salabert railroad sold the property to B *** S ***, already in operation
and all his material.

Although not determined in writing, including when convínose come out to auction the railway
from S *** V *** a, however it was linked to the other, physically and economically, Salabert
not submit bid specifications, leaving the business to them. Well, they had just know that
the Duke disregarded his word, he tried to swipe decares: there submitted a corresponding statement
in the auction. The first to speak was Calderón.

- Antonio, you seriously come to fight ....

- No way. "Quarrel with a man as harmless as I am?

...

- Remember very well that when purchasing your train has been agreed,
or rather say, we've vowed not show up at the auction line at V ***
S ***.

- I think I agree ... Admirably!

- Well today we saw with
surprise that a statement is yours ....

- What!

A statement? - Exclaimed in amazement, opening his large eyes bulging -. Who has had such
a hoax?

- No hoax: I myself have you seen his firm - said one of them, the Marquis de Arbiol.

- My signature? No way.

- Amigo Salabert, I tell you that I have seen the signature: "Antonio Salabert, Duke Requena
"- Arbiol replied firmly and very serious.

- No way! Can not be - repeated the Duke getting to walk around the office, dam apparently
violent agitation -. I have supplanted the firm.

The Marquis de Arbiol smiled contemptuously.

- He wore the stamp of his home.

- He wore the label? - Said stopping suddenly -. Then I have replaced the inside my house. Yes,
yes ... Here I have replaced the .... No rogue I know from what gone. I need a hundred eyes ....

And
more and more angry was to press the doorbell button.

- Now you'll see! Now if I see you have won or not .... A watch (addressing the dependent entered),
to be presented immediately Llera and all employees of the office .... Al instantly!

Arbiol glanced at his teammates and shrugged his shoulders with contempt. But the duke, he saw
perfectly the gesture, he would not take care of him, continued growling, snorting, uttering expletives
furiously violent and walking around the room. Until Llera was presented with a group of subjects
he cramped, badly dressed, vulgar physiognomy.

Salabert stood in front of them crossing his arms with energy:

- Let's see, Llera: it is necessary to find out who the rascal who has filed a Statement in my
name, supplanting my signature for railway tender to V *** S ***. Did you know anything about
this?

Llera, after he looked into her face, lowered his head without answering.

-
And you know something?

Huh? Do you know something?

Employees also looked at him intently. Llera then looked down and the Cabora the end without a word.

Salabert
walked his bulging eyes several times by them in theatrical expression of anger, and he exclaimed
at last going to the bankers:

- Did you see clear? No one answers. Between them lies the culprit or culprits! I suspect that
has to be more than one. You lose care, I will give them and I will teach them a lesson .... Yes,
a terrible warning! I will not rest until they send them to prison .... You retire (for employees),
and you can shake the criminals. Soon you will fall upon the weight of justice.

Criminals should be well hardened to judge by the utter indifference with which were those ominous
words spoken with an accent pathetic.

Everyone retired quietly at his apartment and resumed his task, as if the terrible sword of Nemesis
no segarles was coupled to the neck.

The bankers looked at smiling and angry. At last one of them, biting her lip for not laughing,
stretched out his hand with a gesture of contempt:

- Bye, Salabert,
hasta la vista.

The others did the same without saying another word
about it.

The Duke was not fazed.

To dismiss was attentive to the ladder, directing still looks angry
passing employees who received the same offense indifference.

Returning to his office and ignored them all.

Passed between them like an actor going through the racks state after a while on stage.

A few minutes later turned out down to the rooms of his wife. Found her alone, entertaining
read a book of devotions. Ms Carmen, who had always been very devout
in recent times had surrendered completely to religious practice.

The disease is separated each more of worldly ideas, delivering sad
and submissive to the priests.

Never Salabert as obstacle to this devotion, compassionate look at her with indifference, as an
innocent hobby.

But in recent times, some charities grown tired of the Duchess alarmed
a little and was forced to reprimand her paternally.

Used to find his wife submitted, away from all ambition, entirely alien to the success of his speculations,
treated as a girl, but as a faithful dog who occasionally runs his
hand over his head.

Never had hindered that unhappy lady, or their work or their vices. Although his beloved, his
erotic antics in the order were known around the world, Ms Carmen
or ignored or pretended to ignore them.

However, the last Duke's infidelity, the relationship Tell them the
Amparo brought trouble.

Dominant woman delighted in vejarla foul a thousand ways, something I had not done any of their
predecessors. On the tour, when he went with her husband in the car, the Amparo stood at his
side with the former florist brazenly cynical Duke smiles changed
over intelligence.

When the good lady complained gently of this procedure, Salabert
flatly refused, not just their looks and smiles, but every relationship
with that woman.

I did not know by sight. I had never spoken to her. In the theater Real as well. Amparo persisted
in watching all night to the Duke's box.

Then in the bulls, horse racing, sporting a scandalous luxury strongly
calling public attention.

Some well-meaning friends, never missing a lot pitying Ms Carmen learned of the massive expenses
that cost the Duke woman, all extravagance and caprice.

This series of pinpricks suffered in secret, without committing to
anyone but her confessor, had carved lady's health, reducing it to
a state of weakness so that by some miracle was sustained.

Salabert had more to do to repair in such suffering.

Thought that the title of Duchess, and so many accumulated wealth in the palace, Ms Carmen
had to be the happiest woman on earth.

- What does the old lady?

What it does - asking entered in halftone brutal half affectionate
While revealing the profound indifference to his wife inspired him.

Ms Carmen looked up smiling.

- Hello is that you?

Miracle, for here at this time.

- Before he had come to hear from you, if I had said that he was the father Ortega. How you
have slept? Good eh? You bet .... You're not as bad as you think. What That is to surround yourself
with priests as if you were to die?

- Priests are not needed more than when you die?

- Yes, the priests
are necessary to give respectability to the house - said lounged in
an armchair and coarsely spreading legs -.

Without a bit of black cloth, palaces freshly painted like this scream
too .... Only eventually become bothersome: never tire of asking.

They have so many swallows as whales .... I would buy good figurative wins, wax or cardboard,
and would the same effect ....

- Hush, hush, Antonio, do not begin to piffle. Any judge will hear you a heretic, and thank God you're
not.

- What a bargain to be a heretic! What brings value to be heretical and sudden changes ?...--
the subject asked: - How is the Sabbath you have done in the Cuatro Caminos?

He was referring to the nursing home, which was Ms Carmen's chief protector.

- It's going really well. Only the Marquise de Alcudia not want to
continue being treasurer.

Do not know who is to be appointed.

- Of course, that depopulate Saturdays.

- What then? - Innocently asked the lady.

- Because they all leave for Sevilla on broomsticks.

- Bah, bah! Do not make fun of the elderly poor - said laughing -. You and I are also two old
....

- True, true - the banker said smugly getting serious and sad -. We are a couple pitfalls that
one of these days we slipped to another neighborhood without feeling.

He had seen a timely input to the conversation I wanted, was quick
to seize it.

- No, you are strong and robust.

You can still give a lot of trouble in the world .... But I, dear, and I have one foot in the
stirrup.

- They both have, both. In the past sixty days there is no insurance ....

- If those thoughts you used to remember more of God and His holy service work, I am glad that
you had.

- Do you think that not enough work for him, and every year brings
me more than five thousand dollars on masses and novenas?

- Come,
Antonio, do not talk like that!

- My daughter, well think it is there,
but it is also wise to think what happens here .... Look, these days
I was just imagining that if one of us die, which survived him many
entanglements would ....

- Why?

- For the husband and wife are heirs
of each other, and, of course, if we were to die without a will, our
relatives would come to disturb that remain.

- It is easy to remedy.

With it is arranged.

- Precisely what I thought - Duke said panting a lot to show indifference
and poise, she did not feel -. He had thought that rather than test
each one by hand, we did a mutual will.

- What is that?

- A will
in which we mutually instituted heirs.

Ms Carmen looked down at the
book he had in his hand and was silent a moment. The Duke restless,
watched carefully under his drooping eyelids half, biting forward
to the cigar.

- No way - he said after Mrs. seriously.

- What can
not be? Why? - Replied eagerly joining in a little chair.

- Because
I think about leaving for what he has inherited, more or less, your
daughter. So it I have already promised. 

Salabert encounter did
not believe that obstacle. Judged thing done about the mutual will.
It was as shocked as disturbed. But instantly recovering himself,
took a continent serious and worthy to say

- Okay, Carmen. I do not
try to impose my will to yours. You own to leave your property to
whomever you like, even if these goods have been won by me at the
expense of many jobs. Over the years we've been together, issues of
interest have never produced no quarrel between us. I wish to continue
the same thing. The money compared with the affections of the heart,
has no value. The only thing I regret is that another person even
if he is a beloved daughter, I have hurt so much in your love, me
been banished from your heart ....

As he uttered these last words
his voice was altered slightly.

- No, Antonio, not - be quick to
say Ms Carmen -, or your daughter and no one can tear the love belongs
to you .... But consider that you are rich enough without my money,
and that she needs.

- No, do not try to disfigure .... The blow is
given, I feel it in the bottom of my heart - said Salabert in pathetically
touching his left side -. Thirty-five years of life marriage, thirty-five
years sharing sorrows and joys, fears and hopes, not been enough to
conquer the first place in your affection. Everything you say is useless
now. I thought our marriage, life of happiness and love that we have
so many years, was closed by an act which summarized the heir of that
together We won .... The affection of husbands never better demonstrated
than in the last will ....

Salabert's speech took on a tone of moral
uplift that seemed to worry for a moment his wife. However, finally
said softly and firmly at once:

- Although I have not been in my
heart, I want to Clementina like my daughter, the I have always regarded
as such. It seems an injustice to deprive a child of their share of
inheritance.

- But woman! - Eagerly exclaimed the duke - for whom
I want what I have but to my daughter? Let me his heir, and I will
pass it intact and even promise to increase ....

Ms Carmen paused
merely to make a negative head. The Duke up as if seized with a violent
emotion.

- Yes, yes, well I understand. You forgive me some slight
aberrations children of whim foolishness. Seize the opportunity presented
to you for revenge. Okay: meets your revenge, but he knows that I
have not really wanted any woman more than you. At the heart not sent,
Carmen, and if I want to boot heart, my heart would say: "No, you
can I boot it without breaking ...." It's sad, very sad to bring to
life this terrible disappointment .... If you were to die tomorrow
you what God does not consent, many disappointments, many I expect
penalties in addition to the loss of a beloved wife! Perhaps this
poor old man saw pointed out the house where he lived, that has made
her dream to die in the arms of his wife.

The duke's voice at times
altered, his eyes filled with tears. Still continued in this pathetically
for a while. Finally fell as faint in the chair, taking the handkerchief
eyes.

But Ms Carmen, though charitable and sensitive, gave no signs
of being shaken. Previously, steadily, he said:

- Well you know that
none of that is true. I can not avenge, nor would it be strong revenge
all I have to leave your daughter, which only is mine for the love
I have.

The Duke changed his tactics. He looked for a while his wife
with compassion. Finally he said smiling bitterly

- You want a lot
to Clementina, right? ... Well look, the best you can do to give a
great joy is burst the sooner. Osorio is with the poor in smoke. Now
I understand why creditors do not just swallow
