 For what purpose? How long? ...

Aragon finally dared to ask who was the person to whom he owed his freedom.

- Come on - with some little voice said Bozmediano irrelevant .-- Well you know what I want say.
Fu is not necessary to pronounce name.

It is natural to make you look the other way. As his self-flattering to be wanted by a person
of such merit .... Do not be ungrateful young, she does not deserve.

- I do not know what you mean - Lazarus said in the tone of an examinee disengaged that is slow
to repeat the question he does not know the answer.

Bozmediano talked more, but came to say that. A Lazarus seemed a wrong to infer Clara publishing
his affection, so honest and sensitive place confidence in the knowledge
of an outsider, yes, because Bozmediano was an intruder, who had gone
to give freedom without that no one asked.

- Well you know whom I
mean - Claudio said, slapping him on the shoulder with simplicity
and trust - but as you are so proud to be boyfriend of that girl,
it gives you that tone.

- Oh! no - said the nephew Coletilla ashamed
.-- The truth is I do not know who that person you say.

Bozmediano shook hands and made him young Aragonese many offers and protests friendship. The
other was so stunned, answered it wrong and discourteous.

- I know where you live - Claudio said retreating - we'll see.

And if not in Fontana, whither I frequently.

And broke.

When he was at some distance, Lazarus felt compelled to run to him
thank you with more respect, but he fought the pride and jealousy.

Let him go without saying anything.

Bozmediano was saying to one another with much satisfaction:

- Very vulgar, very vulgar ....

CHAPTER XXII

# The "ordeal" of Lazarus #.

Lazarus walked on with no fixed address. His sudden and mysterious departure from prison, Bozmediano
knowledge and confusion produced by his words, was prevented by be clear for some time its
difficult and rare situation. But when he was alone and walked a while, he began to realize that
I had nowhere to go or whom to contact, or with whom they live. The words spoken by the old man
let him not doubt about his character.

It was a realistic fan, a lover blind tyranny. With eyes blazing with anger and poisonous speech
and strong, had told him not to his house while it did not change ideas, what to do? It was impossible
to live with misanthropic and cruel man, moody and fierce as a Muslim fanatic. How counter the ideas
of each other!

What could I do? Pretend and being hypocritical? Appearing "a love of tyranny seemed criminal?
"No, that can not be "thought Lazarus. Furthermore, the current turmoil of the parties, pretend
like ideas was worse than profess. The old man could not admit at home. So what determination
should take? Where was I? Would you go back to Ateca? "And Clara?

To remember his unfortunate companion, the young man's thoughts took a different slant. The
idea of ??the sorrows of that unhappy, doomed to live with one so
disagreeable, began to torment.

Had to go there and see what was happening at home. But how, it was impossible visit his uncle?

Would
he or would not? The need was pressing him. He was alone, overwhelmed by exhaustion, hungry
and naked.

Twelve rooms was all her fortune, because the road had lost a doubloon, and travel expenses
consumed the other.

Meanwhile night was coming and had nowhere sleep. If you went to the house of his friends feared
he would not find them as benevolent as the previous night.

They were also poor, as poor as himself, and could not provide entertainment.

Had to go. It also occurred to him to take the path of his people and become there. Knew a carrier
in the hostel, which would take the credit. But what about Clara?

These were his thoughts when he passed by Fontana. Felt great clamor, he stood mechanically and
had intentions to enter. "No - said controlling himself - will not go." And at the same time
took a step toward the door.

However, fatal attraction drew him to that place, deep in his first and most beautiful illusions.

The
sounds could be heard rumbling in there in your brain as hell echoes
of singular fascination.

He stepped back, turned to move, were consulted, discussed and mentally,
and finally joining the curiosity his instinctive desire to enter,
did not hesitate more and entered.

They were in a very heated discussion. Everywhere there were voices, both in the region turbulent age
in the club.

Which was in the stands came to dominate the noise and could be heard, but soon the screams
drowned his voice again. Was the shameful who had suffered defeat the extremists to the authority
of Morillo, and some had been this issue to a personal level. Jealous of the decencies of society
and the good name of party, some speakers complained to the infamous,
disguised under the name of liberal going to corrupt this assembly,
to make shameful treatment in the name of the King, to buy exalted
eloquence and to promote riots that had no other object than to discredit
liberalism and giving weapons to the reaction.

- Lobos - he said
- disguised as lamb, who come here pretending a love of liberty they
do not have!

They offer gold to pay speakers in a speech that praised the courage
of the ignorant multitude!

- Yes, those infamous - said another speaker
- are preparing for the riots and those who throw stones Ministers'
houses.

The purpose of this association is to hold a permanent professorship of good ideas, direct the
vote, but the sponsor never debauchery, not the scandal, or anarchy.

- No - shouted one speaker, to whom all eyes fixed, and rose-filled
anger to protest against the above words .-- No: there are no traitors.

Those who practice such things not belong to the human race I do not
believe in them, if any, that is to say their names.

Know who they are, learn to know.

- To be told the names! - Repeated a hundred voices.

- You must -
said the first speaker - purify this noble assembly.

Thanks to the infamous the corrupt, run by the cut scores insulting us and our club. That the infamous
out of here!

- That is to say their names! - The crowd responded with a roar.

- No - said another - the sort of men do not exist.

- Yes there is - the first in exasperation exclaimed .-- frequent
this site who come to pay with the gold of King oratory mad frenzy
to town.

- Who!

Who!

- Who of us - he continued - do not know the call Coletilla? It is a realistic fan, an evil agent of
the big house. Do not you know? This man is a snake that glides among us to corrupt the young
speakers. I know that many have received money Instead of speeches
very hot.

The riots absurd that we see every day, what should be? Have no doubt: open your eyes, blind!
Gold are due to Fernando de Borbón, the gold insidious spread of
this man, for that Coletilla.

- Who are the venal?

Whether we realize it.

- Distrust of the perpetrators of riots.

- This is a friend of the
Government - he said pointing to an individual who was in the the
public.

- Friend of the Government? - Said he indignantly .-- Why?

Why I love freedom without license the petition without a fuss?

You love to cedéis anarchy and venality. I am writing to Aragonese, this site is distinguished
by its obscene language and love of the riots.

- How dare you to
say? - Núñez said rising like a fury and apostrophes to first speaker.

-
What leads you to insult my friends, my!

- Yes, sir - cried the other:
- beware of the Aragonese.

A mob stirred the Aragonese day of the procession of the portrait.

Some looked to Lazarus, mute and cold, witnessed the scene.

- And do not hesitate - he went on .-- He who spoke on that occasion
was a vile instrument King's agent.

- It is!

Here it is! - Said one, pointing to Lazarus to the attention of the
entire assembly.

- Yes, the nephew of Coletilla.

- Coletilla Nephew!

Coletilla Nephew! - Repeated many voices.

Frightful tumult echoed throughout the area.

Everyone looked up and Lazarus.

- He who spoke the other night, excited to revolt!

- Troublemaker
of the Plaza Mayor!

- Tagline's nephew!

These last words were the biggest roll of dishonor. Núñez rose to defend his friend; but failed:
her voice was not heard. Many who feared being charged, as were the barrage that fell on Lazarus,
he downloaded on his anger.

- How did you get for the cries of the day of the procession, prendita? - Said from the corner
the August Calleja.

- Away with him!

- Out with the traitors out!

- On the street, into the street!

Lazarus tried at the supreme moment of desperation to collect all his composure to speak, to defend
themselves, to scream, to say to everyone that he was innocent, he was a wretch, a poor devil,
the ultimate beings.

Not listening. He could not speak, nor to defend themselves or to despise: bowed under the unbearable
weight of so much and look so much anger. The crowd redoubled their anger at seeing the wonder
and the prostration of his victim, and after the words came movements: they sent out, pushed
him toward the door, threw him out. The circle it had increasingly narrowed, the unfortunate young
man saw a hundred hands over her body; he was caught, like a snake entwined itself about his
strong throwing knots and squeezing in its sturdy rings. The disturbance, heat, distress,
embarrassment, he stunned even point to lose the clarity of knowledge.

He felt no drag to see who dragging, throwing massive forces of his fists, struck his back, impelled
him out, felt the door open with a bang, felt his body received a strong shock, he felt brave
and free of those terrible arms, fell to the ground. The noise continued around him, composed
mainly of infernal laughter, but finally the noise went away little by little, the wretch began
to experience pain from the fall and the cold ground. Was on the street.

He remained on the floor a few minutes without being clear on his behalf made, and the sweat he covered
his face gave him an impression glacial.

Then acquired exact knowledge of their situation, and saw that he was on the floor, his back
against the wall, tilted forehead, hair fall and stirred. The hat rolled to his side, his
clothes were torn and felt excruciating pain in his left elbow, severely damaged in the fall.
Noise Fontana sounded like the distant swarm: the cries joined the
clapping, and voice sound hectic at times rose on that storm of enthusiasm.

Lazarus

saw around him to three urchins that looked on with derision, and one of them peering a timely
opportunity to remove his hat. Passers they began to be run, and some are tilted curiously to
see if the deceased had fallen or simply fainted. He got up, because that bothered impertinent
curiosity as much as the rumor Fontana to the left, and walked off, turning to the Puerta del Sol
chocks followed him, accompanied by some more, the watchmen ran him squarely in the light of
their lanterns, and bystanders stood watching him walk away, confident that it was dead or had fainted,
but simply drunk.

Increased Montera Street, and asked about the street Oh my God, because he had solved heading
home from his uncle. I no longer hesitated: his determination was fixed, and in that distressing
trance, house fan, whose door had to leave their beliefs, feelings, It seemed a haven of peace.

After
all, the past few days in Madrid had been continued martyrdom, and the idea the apostasy of realistic
home compelled him to do, not bothered much. Was mortally wounded in the imagination, that
is, flanked by its more powerful. It was no longer fiery young man who was believed destined
to great ends, it was a poor disinherited without force of spirit, without hope and without
ideas. I did not know what he thought, could not measure the immensity disorder that required
her relative, but was not resolved into the arms of the former he was able to comfort him.

Came
at last, after asking a lot, God help the street. Saw the number of house, looked at the windows
on the second floor and there was light in the rooms. Was undoubtedly Clara tired of waiting
there, suspicious of him again.

He entered the hall and went steps so agitated and trembling, that
he reached the door he stopped because he could barely breathing.

After a few seconds, he tried to recover, reached out, took the cord
the bell and pulled very gently, because he thought he was going to
embarrass his uncle and to Clara alarm if he played more than necessary
to record the presence inside of an outsider.

But the smoothness with which he threw his trembling hand was such
that the bell did not ring.

Wanted to do with more energy, and as I was so nervous he threw the
hood while thundered home.

Lazarus was frightened, thinking that Elijah was going to go into
a rage, claiming against so ruffled.

Spent a long time without being opened, but finally honored some
clarity through the little window, heard footsteps, a hand drew back
the table, opened, the hole and saw two eyes.

Were not those of Clara.

- Who? - Said the voice from within Pascuala.

Lazarus asked by his uncle.

- Yes but not here.

- Is he coming soon?

I'm his nephew.

Pascuala Lazarus opened the door and took a step inward surprised
not to hear the voice of Clara.

- There will not soon or late, because
it has moved - Alcarrian answered.

- How?

- As has been moved today.

I'm still here, because there are a few things and large closet, and I'm here to take care
pa, but tomorrow I'm leaving.

- And where will you move?

- Near here, on the streets of Bethlehem in a house they call Porreno ladies, which have yielded
the fourth second pa living alone.

- What about Clara? - Lazarus
asked anxiously.

- That makes eight days over there living with the
ladies.

The master put it there because emph her.

- So, to see, what do you say?

- Ah!

"But you is the nephew of the master?

- Yes.

- You Aragon. Tell me, do you know by chance in Cariñena to Ventura Palomino, brother of Jusepe
Palomino, who married Colasa Sanahuja?

- No - Lazarus said impatiently: - I'm not Carignan.

- And do you know if Anton's wife gave birth looms, my boyfriend's
brother Pascual, who I'm getting married next week, God help me?

-
I do not know, sister, do not know these people.

But tell me, why Ciara had gone to live with these ladies?

- Ah, - said laughing with great desire Alcarrian - I remember you
were her boyfriend.

The master sent there because he said he could not stand ... well
... I'll tell you ... the master is, a little ... He said it was a
girl like the day, which was very sardesca ... But she is very good,
and I do not know how the poor could not have sadness in this house.

-
What came to like here?

- In truth, sir ... the master has a genius
as well ... go.

We both stayed dead fear whenever we saw him enter. We never spoke, and at night, after bedtime,
felt giving him a kick.

- Why sent it to the house of these ladies?

- You see, I'm going to tell the truth because it is in the house. There was one that got melitarito
a day at home, she came to accompany the master, who was wounded
in the street.

After passing all day out there, and if I was in the street stopped
me wonder Dona pa Clarita.

Ay! One day I saw my Pascual talking to him, and almost ... my Pascual
has a evil genius, and when emph ... you did not know how to hit the
butcher cachetines over there ... Then, as is a well ... very nice
weekend.

- Follow what was telling: after we know what makes Mr.
Pascual - Lazarus said impatiently by the digressions of the maid.

-
For the melitarito said, offering me money, I wanted to sneak in here.

-
What came?

...

- Wait for you and will continue to count.

No passing the corner, and I love you could see some times. Because the master, but it seems he
does not see anything, oserva everything.

- And she, what did?

- Wait a minute ... He told me he wanted to enter.

- And what he
said it?

- That was beautiful to be here locked up without seeing
the world, it was a pity that a and women living in an old company
so ugly and so ... He said: "I out of here."

- And she knew he said
that?

- Yes, he told him.

- Then there was here - Lazarus said anxiously.

-
Wait for you.

- And she, what did it?

- That was a nice person and
very good treatment, that was a good subject and a very accomplished
gentleman.

One day we got here.

Jesus, what a fright!

- And she, what did?

- He told him to leave.

- What is left?

- Ca: here was talking about
a thousand things.

- And she, what do you say?

- That was because
he was about to commit, for if it was true that she was interested,
to leave at the time, leading not to see you there.

- And he, what
did? - Asked Lazarus, who was beside himself with anxiety.

- A thousand
things, a thousand antics.

The truth is that the master came and saw him. He was very upset, we quarreled a lot.

- And to him, what did you say?

- Nothing. To us it was riñiendo all day.

Then he said it was Dona Clarita crazy, that I was cansao of her
flirtation ... things of old, because she, poor ... finally told him
he was going to send those three old house for the corrected and teaching
good living.

- But why call cause my uncle mad?

What have you done?

- Naa, but the master says that the ideas of the day ...

- What else
did he say? - Asked Lazarus, who never tired of terrible answers of
that fatal interrogation.

- To be applied to prayer and to a holy
life.

- And the military has not seen him more?

- These days I have
been roaming the streets of Bethlehem, and I ... I suppose ....--¿
to see?

What you figure it?

- I suppose ... The crook is melitarito ... bet it has slipped further.

-
Do not you know those three ladies? - Lazarus said, trying to hide
the bad impression the previous response had occurred.

- No: the
master said they are good, and that one is holy.

- Where do you live?

-
Drink On the street, no. 4.

His uncle lives in the same house. And you know.

"Tell me - asked Lazarus, after a pause, he doubted whether to leave
or prolong symposium that painful - say you, that soldier is a tall
young man with black whiskers?

...

- Yes, a little taller than you, has a very clear voice and walk with
grace, and laughs with grace.

- Do not you know his name?

- No,
sir, I was going to find, but as my Easter is so jealous, I was afraid.

Oh, man! When the emph ...

Lazarus was a quiet time contemplating the barbaric image of the woman, says of his misfortune.
Then he repeated the signs of the new house, and left.

And the determination to go there was unwavering, and would have died
before they quit.

Curiosity, jealousy, the need to find a solution to that series precipitated doubt, he drove
toward the new house. And the abjuration required? Almost no thought
already so.

No doubt he could ensure that the military, who spoke Pascuala was it had the same release. New
and painful mystery! Have been many days of life to know everything clearly, and at the same
time be horrified at the thought to know. The idea of ??disloyalty to Clara, his shame was too
great in his horror, and will not fit on the head. What puzzled him most was the uncanny speed,
impatience fatal that rushed over him so many disappointments, so much bitterness, which gave
no time to find encouragement and hope in his mind and heart.

He entered the house, and slowly climbed the stairs of the Eighteenth Century house. Could not without
a sense of respect for those three ladies, for still unknown him, he looked like three perfect models
of virtue. Touched, and opened one of them.

Decoration affected him a bit: the historical portraits of the hall looked at him with her
eyes all moth-eaten. Lazarus was afraid. Preceded by Paz, among those passed through the dim
shadows the hall was more mysterious, and entered the room.

CHAPTER XXIII

# The Inquisition.

#

When Coletilla after installed on the second floor, the ladies said the probability that his
nephew was to live with him, Salome was a little pensive, but Mary of the Paz said there was
no problem, provided the young, under the supervision and guidance
of his uncle, was to have the restraint and dignity that the house
imposed on its inhabitants.

Lazarus, preceded by Maria de la Paz, entered the room. The first thing that caught his eye
was to Clara, who was sitting next to the devout and sewed his head down, not daring to look to anyone.
She saw his confusion and his efforts to conceal it. Then he looked around and saw his uncle,
sat respectfully beside Salome, whose real were planted at the eastern end Maria de la Paz. Lazarus
he saw them all motionless as stick figures, all watching him, except
Clara, who insisted on bringing both eyes to work, it was difficult
to understand how not kept one eye with the needle.

Elias Lazarus looked in amazement. Peace with astonishment, Salome with amazement, all with astonishment
and he came to believe it was a ghost evoked, the fearful nephew
Coletilla spectrum.

Salome pointed to a chair with his finger when he had the rings,
and Peace said the registration most contemptuous voice and August:

-
Sit down, young gentleman.

When the young man said "thank you, ma'am," his voice sounded weak and painful, so much suffering
announcing and prostration, which Clara could not help looking up and feeling him with sudden
interest.

She found him pale and dejected, and knew what had happened in those unhappy days and took all
the effort that brave soul was able to keep from mourn as a fool in the presence of those three
ladies and furious rigid Coletilla.

- Since these ladies know what you did to get to Madrid - Elias said
his nephew with great severity.

Salome Peace and frowned so no one could doubt his indignation.

Lazarus said, because he was dead of shame, and at that time the
ladies will seemed the two most perfect personification of human justice.

-
Remember what I said when I came to see you to prison?

- Yes, sir,
I have not forgotten.

- I live here in the house of these ladies
who have offered to me and Clara to an asylum.

- Just for you, Don
Elias - Salome said.

- I know, just for me - said the old man .--
But I - Lazarus continued to address - if you I called while in the
other house, now I dare not give hospitality because ....

- Mr Don
Elias - Peace said, - of the above can you have at your leisure.

You know what we have agreed.

Just do it for you.

- I can not - Elijah continued, bowing deeply - I can not say to this boy to stay in this house.
His conduct was so outrageous, that I dare ....

- No need, however large, can not be corrected - Salome said, looking
sublime Lazarus protection unfortunate, whom those words seemed the
height of generosity.

- Effectively - Peace said in a tone of emphatic
indulgence .-- There are such huge mistakes, which its very enormity
need indulgence.

My opinion is that this gentleman should stay with you, Don Elias, because if not, what will
become of him?

Elijah said to understand.

- What will become of him if he still left without a guide? - Continued
the lady .-- As has past we can infer what will happen.
