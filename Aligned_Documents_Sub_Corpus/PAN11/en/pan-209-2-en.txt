CHAPTER
ONE

THE CURTAIN RISES BY THIS TIME WITHOUT METAPHOR

In Sarrió famous
village, bordering the Bay of Biscay, there was a few years ago a
theater not clean, not clear, not comfortable, but dutifully served
for solace during the long nights winter to their peaceful and industrious
inhabitants.

Was built, like almost everyone, horseshoe shape. It consisted of
two floors over the bass.

In the first boxes, so-called God knows why, as there were but few
banks stuffed ball and lining red flannel placed around the sill.

To sit in them was forced to push support, which was hinged at intervals,
and at the same time raise the seat.

Once inside he dropped back seat, turned the back into place and settle the person in the worst way you
can be human creature outside the rack.

In the second floor seethed, shouted, coceaba and snorted the whole
mob of people without a difference class, the same height as the sailor
who was fishing in the bay Murgas or pawn discharge, the reseller
Amalia Sena well as those bringing in "fresh air" to the capital.

To that place was called "the pot."

The seats were of the same abhorrent pelote that boxes and the lining
should also be of the same color, could not be known with certainty.

Behind of them had, in the old style, a patio for some artisans who,
by age, category of teachers or any other circumstance, repugnant
to the pan up and join to the raging mob.

From the ceiling hung a chandelier, curd-shaped glass pieces prismatic,
with oil lamps.

Later it was replaced by oil, but I did not manage to see such a
reform.

Under the stairs leading to the boxes was a closed niche blind they
called "Don Mateo's box."

This Don Mateo'll talk later.

Then let it be known that in such a tracery of theater represented the same dramas and comedies
that the Prince and the operas were sung at La Scala in Milan. "It seems incredible, eh? Nothing
more true. There he first heard the narrator of this story those famous verses:

If you hear tell the story of a castaway, Since the earth to the love you miss ...

Certainly that seemed excellent, and the theater a marvel of luxury and good taste. All in the
world depends on the imagination. Hopefully I had so much alive and as fresh as ever to entertain
you nicely several hours. It has also seen the Don Juan Tenorio. And their late wheat flour-smeared,
his commander filtering through a door tied with string, his hell in spirit of wine and her apotheosis
of paper lining trunks, was impressed so that he could not sleep that night.

In the room going, more or less, as in the most magnificent theaters of the Court. However,
it is generally attended by more than they show. We had not reached that higher level of refinement,
by which actions must be pleasant contrast to the place where they run, verbi-grace, chat in
the theater laughing in the churches, go serious and silent, and pathetic in the ride, as, fortunately,
in Madrid. I do not know if Sarrió have already climbed to the present time this step of civilization.

Neither
created missing some spirits so lucid that was ahead of his time
and sensed what was to be the theater in time.

Pablito Belinchón was one of them. Had always paid in the company of three or four friends, the
proscenium stage. From there spoke to other older gentlemen, subscribers in the box opposite:
they said jokes, made fun of the treble or bass, and threw candy and paper darts. Certainly
the public of the seats, still outside the refinements of civilization,
used to silence them savagely with a strong chicheo.

    The most important families were accustomed
    to enter in those boxes hypocritical after the curtain opened with
the same solemnity that if they entered a theater audience at the
Royal, and cash with a lot more noise.

Not can well imagine the horrid crack that gave him back to be pushed, and that drop seat with
the intention of attracting attention.

Say if the family currently makes her grand entrance in one of them and remains stand shedding
coats, while the spectators amused for a moment view of the scene and fix them, until they feel. They
are the lords of Belinchón.

The head of the family, Don Rosendo, is a tall, thin, bent at the spine, bald pate, small and
sunken eyes, large mouth, which was contracting with a smile Mephistopheles, showing two rows
of teeth long and equal, the most complete work of some established dentist in a few months ago
Sarrió. Spend short sideburns and mustache, and represents sixty years of age. Is known for
the first merchant of the town and one of the first importers of cod from the Cantabrian coast. For
many years monopolized entirely Wholesale sales of this article,
not only in the village, but throughout the province, and thanks a
result had gained a considerable fortune.

His wife, Dona Paula ... But why is just so long awake in the theater sound to your appearance? The
good lady, listen, is shaky and unclear, it fails to get rid of the coat, and his daughter
Cecilia is required to remove it and tell the ear: - Sit down, Mom! He sits, or rather, is dropped
on the bench and run a stray from the public gaze, while his cheeks Live crimson stain. In
vain attempts fanning herself with verve and calm. Nothing: the more efforts made by turbulent
blood away from the face, put the damn harder to hold that visible.

- Mom, what color you are! - Venturita tells his youngest daughter, struggling not to laugh.

The
mother looks at her expression of anxiety.

- Hush, Ventura, silent .-- says Cecilia.

Dona Paula, encouraged by these words, whispers

- This girl enjoys but in shame.

And he was about to relent and mourn.

Finally, the public got tired of tormenting her with his eyes, smiles and whispers, and set
of new attention on the scene. Dona Paula Grief was gradually ceasing, but were it remains overnight.

The cause of this incident was the velvet coat trimmed with fur that good lady had set. Whenever premiered
a piece of glossy appearance, was the same. And this for no other reason than because it was
not Mrs. Dona Paula birth. Came from the kind of cigar. Don Rosendo had had an affair with
her being almost a child, the Pablito whom was born. Still, Don Rosendo was five or six years without
marrying or wanting hear about marriage, but visiting her at home and assisting her with money.
Until finally won over by the love child of the mother, and, above all this, the warnings of his
friends, he decided to turn his hand to Paulina.

The population learned of the marriage until after any: that secrecy
was kept to carry out.

Since then the life of the cigarette can be divided into several
major periods.

The first that lasts a year, ranging from marriage to "mantilla veil."

During this time, Belinchón lady was no less or more in public.

On Sunday morning Mass would and shut himself home again.

When he decided to wear the mantle above and go to church eleven,
both in the church in the streets of traffic, peppered looks, and
discussed the incident for more than eight days.

The second period lasts three years, includes from "the mantilla veil" to "gloves." View of
this ornament in great hands and red of the former cigar was indescribable excitement in the female
element the neighborhood.

On the streets, in church, on visits, asking the ladies greeted: - Have ?...-- you seen Yeah, yeah,
I've seen .-- And I began skinning. Next comes the third period, that lasts four years and ending
"silk dress", which gave almost as much to grumble as gloves, and there was general outrage
Sarrió .-- Tell me, Dolores, what's left and to do? - Doña Dolores lowered his eyes with a gesture
of resignation. Finally, fourth, the longest of all because it lasts six years, over, oh scandalous!
'With hat. " No one can represent the thrill of wonder that invaded the town of Sarrió when
a certain show was presented late Dona Paula on the promenade with top hat. It was a real
riot. The village women crossed themselves as he passed and pronounced comments aloud to hear
that the person concerned.

- Women, look for your life to what Serena wears on the head lighter!

Because it should be noted that the mother of Dona Paula called it the Serena, and Grandma and
a great-grandmother as well.

Needless to add that since the cigarette rose to the rank of lady, even by accident and gave it
its proper name.

The next day, the ladies stumble Sarrió on the street, finding no words with which to express their
horror, were given for content with raising his eyes to heaven, waving arms convulsively, and
pass by muttering: "Hat!"

Before that bold stroke that has no partner, but with some heroes of old, Hannibal, Caesar, Genghis
Khan, the town was silent and depressed a few months. However, each Once the good of Dona Paula
appeared in public with the abominable hat on or any other article of his own high rank, was
always greeted with a murmur reproach. And the original case was that she did not protest publicly
or in secret, even in the sanctity of conscience, against the evil
of their people come home.

Juzgábalo natural and logical. He could not think think that would
be otherwise.

Its sociological ideas not yet advised him to rebel against the verdict of public opinion.
Believed in good faith to put on gloves or a fur coat or hat, I made
a act rejected by the divine and human laws.

The whispers, the mocking, were the necessary punishment for this infraction. Hence, their fears
and anxieties every time I went to stand in the theater or on the
promenade, and flush the rushing.

Why then, say, Dona Paula is dressed like this?

Not be very knowledgeable human heart that such a question. Dona Paula put on his hat and gloves
knowingly that would embarrass him as a guy opens the cupboard and knowingly sweet docks then
they have to flog. Those who have not been reared in a village, you never know how tasty treat
is the hat for an artisan.

Dona Paula was high, dry, awkward. When she had been a good girl, but the years, continuous
closure, which was not seasoned, and especially the struggle that had maintained with the public
to establish their hierarchy, had withered prematurely. Still beautiful black eyes kept enclosed
in a nice face and good features.

The first act came to an end. It was a fantastic melodrama, whose name I remember, where the company
had made all the scenic apparatus that was available.

Casserole I was amazed, and welcomed each change of decoration with loud applause. Pablito
Belinchón had happened in Madrid a month last year, laughed incontestable superiority one appliance
with smart winking in front of the stage. And to prove that the whole thing bored him, ended by
turning his back on stage and look to twins to the local beauties. Each time the skin beautiful
Russian glasses pointed one, the girl suffered a slight shudder,
changed position, her hand a tremulous little hair to fix it, smiled
at his mother or his sister for no reason is put serious again, and
fixed strongly and decisively their eyes on the scene.

But at the moment the fast rising shyly to those beady crystals that obfuscated. Finally concluded
by blushing. Pablito, satisfied, pointing to another beauty. The known as if they were her
sisters, tuteaba to most of them and many had been boyfriend: but the pen in the air was not
more mobile and changeable in the field he loves. All had to suffer
a painful disappointment.

Of late, tired of love to neighbors, had been dedicated to fascinate many outsiders came to Sarrió,
only to abandon, Of course, if they committed the folly of staying in the village over a month
or two.

There are good reasons why Pablito could have his good-natured heart all young Indians and
even the bizarre. He was a young man of twenty-four apuestísimo or twenty years, handsome face
and manly, graceful and elegant figure. Horseback riding and admirably led by a cabriolet or a
four-horse chariot, which no one could do Sarrio more than the drivers. When wearing the baggy
pants, the Pablito seemed skirts, if narrow, was a stork.
