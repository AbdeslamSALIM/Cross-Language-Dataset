what we call "the genius of a people", is the set of skills preferably raised by the ideals dominant.
Encouraged those who agree with them, discouraged the they differ, and extended in successive
generations this double process of selection and combined exclusion, leads to the uniformity
of the motives of conduct on established guidelines and the same way as in cattle, slaughtering
those who do not leave the favorite color is achieved even in this the whole herd, and will have
no application skills that have no chance in human groups, they are standardized on those that

Defined by their characteristics, Swift said that "English is a political animal and French
social animals ", and it was at that time the political powers were universally inputs in the military,
and only in England communal institutions and parliamentary life political opportunity had been preserved,
which raises the political skills, alongside religious opportunity, who had evacuated to the
Greco-Roman civilization, so so that mental energy, channeled into the two channels, only produced
leaders and saints, castles and monasteries, and ecclesiastical chivalric literature. And there
is no political life in France, there were no more likely to apply to the personal skills war devotion
and gallantry, so that they and we, in the fall of the old regime they lacked the skills for the

instead of them, the secular sciences and mechanical instruments, and hygiene and disregard of death,
which already had implemented schools laboratories, railways, steamers, postal and telegraph,
purchased armored built wise, gunpowder, guns and rifles to Europe, and Russia defeated the holy
water and land, with signs and everything.

Neither objective nor subjective improvement may have been unchanged from previous. And Indeed,
the fact that has contributed to the advancement of ancient societies is the same as determined
in the first modern progress: what John M. Robertson, Buckle completing the concept, called "intellectual
change."

The two centers of American civilization, caused by soil fertility in both tropical regions, with two harvests
per year, although they had met to draw some constructions permanent, in temples, of course, and
certain political and social development had not reached to contact, or spread mostly, until
the time of discovery, the lack of the horse, ox, elephant and camel, who contributed so much
in the old world to facilitate the movement of goods and ideas, and played invasions human intelligence

Finding himself away and isolated from all schools of ancient civilization, and until were brought
into contact with them by the Roman conquest, did not enter the path of progress indigenous populations
of Britain, and being in contact Hellenic tribes with the Egyptians and Phoenicians, and at

culture to implant and cultivate in the ground, under political institutions themselves, so
like the Teutonic, according to Freeman, as if from a common origin, in an exceptionally advantageous

world, adjacent to the full savagery in all bearings.

It has been said that "being the best among these is the surest way to get worse", and Indeed,

lift the persons, if any, and reduce your own. This is known as environmental influences, particularly
noticeable in the individual in the city that is hearty living in the countryside and the
peasant who urbanizing residing in the city, the school master, giving and not receiving instruction,
is brutish in the noble and fruitful work of "desasnar the people" because, as the lion tamer of beasts
who always sticks something of beasts, as the sweeper gets dirty cleaning the streets, to
transmit force know that they do not, usually run out until be "ignorant comme un maître d'école",
unless constantly replenished by the book magazines and newspapers, they play in our day the craft
of the old Vestal, unquenchable maintaining mental activity, which is the sacred fire of liberal
civilization.

Moral culture is also dependent on the exercise of generosity, love, sympathy, benevolence, fairness,
gentleness, consideration for the sufferings of others; that make the cultivation of cells or the
corresponding connections in the respective bodies, and the spread of the Gospel by the sword without
pity for the suffering of heretics, the Spanish also lost for the faithful, and thus was born the
famous cruelty who knew and learned the Netherlands, Italy and America on the occasion of
the conquest, colonization and emancipation. The treatment of the rough, and rude soldiers of old,
in life border and the war against the savages, visibly lowered the official culture, black is
the treatment of blacks who come from the worst cracks or depressions' moral Americans, and any profession,

abundance to those who degrade their own, with sixty millions of barbarians, incorporated into Roman
society as slaves, and, for now, reduced most of the freemen to the miserable condition of slaves
or clients of the rich, ruling the worst that they lowered their ability to govern, in very circumstances
in which an intellectual change of internal origin, began to change political orientation which
subordinated the individual to the "state service" for management theological than subordinated
to the "service of God" on the same or a greater lack of what we now call "human rights", more particularly
marked on the vast province of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, which has cost so much blood, tears,
backwardness and misery, and that this is where our constitution states "reserved for God and free

in all areas in which marvelous advances made the modern understanding of the border spent understanding
Old, not postmarked by the Abyssinians still, Maronites, Armenians, the vast majority Russians,
more than half of Spanish and three-quarters of South America, yet enclosed by the credulity into
the fold of faith, while outside, critical achieved and provide a
source of inexhaustible intellectual renewal, whose superiority comes,
precisely from the fact that Brunetière attributed his alleged bankruptcy:

But once past the effects of novelty, as we say today, exhausted and shaking subsided Intellectual
produced by the new doctrine, with the conversion of infidels to the new faith, where again become
entrenched, feeling, thinking and acting all the same way, impulse of the same passions and the
same hopes, all of the components equal spirit, although different in social status, such as different
copies same book in different binding, paperback, medium pasta, material, pasta or leather, with or
no gilt-edged, intellectual trade in their mutual relations, was
reduced to confirmation reciprocal common superstitions, which overheated
and kept in tension indurated fanaticism, reaching effect in our day
the Catholic priests to the missions the fraternities and sororities,
and the Protestants with their revivals.

In the background, was a repeat of the Koran, which the Jews were made on the Talmud and Christians

As he had said: "Seek first God's love and everything else will come yapa "Christian procedure

of the Roman Empire, blinding all sources of new thinking and springs of the old, refusing to
learn anything in the blind belief of knowing all confined to the intellectual isolation of his

appears in an intrinsic level of barbarity, not met in ancient times
and is starting to be a source of wonder for future generations, who
can no longer explain or understand the vicars of the Redeemer by
burning alive men and women more virtuous, from Bruno to Joan of Arc,
and pre-opening and wide the Porta Coelum those who enlisted in the
bands of outlaws devoted to torturing men, women and children, Christians
of different guilds mayorem Dey ad gloriam.
