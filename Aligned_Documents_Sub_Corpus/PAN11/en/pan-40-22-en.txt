 

Don Braulio himself prepared his case helped by his wife.

During the meal appeared happy and even more talkative than usual.

At a time when left alone Beatriz Don Braulio Inesita Don Braulio
told it that when he came back the place he would bring Paco to view
and hoped that they had to taste and had to marry to escape.

Paco had not come yet, even though I wanted, I wanted to let all arranged many things, and raise funds
to buy trinkets and charms that give his future.

In a word, Don Braulio did so well that it aroused in the minds of Dona Beatriz or his cute little
sister the slightest suspicion that his unexpected and sudden determination could be due to an
bitter spite, or by phone and purpose is nothing sinister or tragic.

Both sisters struggled to accompany Don Braulio to the station, but
Don Braulio opposed, arguing that it was an inconvenience they wanted
to be useless.

Thus, although just barely, those persuaded to stay and not go to
see him off.

When it came time to leave, Don Braulio he brought a buggy through
the intercom, who dropped the suitcase and placed it on him.

Do√±a Beatriz affectionately embraced and kissed her husband, and he
corresponded with no less affection.

- Take care of yourself, Braulio,
and returns as soon as possible - Beatriz said.

- Farewell, my dear.

I'll be back soon - said Don Braulio.

Then down the stairs, seeing off both sisters, to the door, at least
had accompanied him.

Soon there was shooting the car was Don Braulio.

Beatrice and Agnes
went back into the room and sat by the brazier, a front another.

-
What precipitation trip! - Beatriz said simply.

- Paco Is he sick?
- Said Ines -. Maybe because I'm sick call and Braulio not what we
meant.

- Do not believe it, Ines - replied Dona Beatriz -. Braulio
knows not hide anything
