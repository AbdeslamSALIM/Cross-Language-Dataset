 The old White
thought he could not take, you could hear the voices and the revelry of the last masks who withdrew,
and a distant orchestra, perhaps the club, played the last gallop. All those details increased
the cruel situation of the elderly afflicted, almost motionless, a prey a terrible fever. In
that state he crawled across the floor always probing the furniture: Finally, put his hand
on a sofa, occupying the space between the balcony and the door leading to her daughter's
room and an intimate joy rose, boosted Graciana to the starting gate was left ajar and entered
the room, crazy, turbulent, inattentive. But the room was full of smoke, there had burned something:
he remembered his dream, this sudden light had hurt her eyes and cry that seemed pervasive that
even hear and fell back in terrible despair. The smoke from the room began to suffocate and
a cold and indescribable terror closed her lips and stopped her movements instinctive fear not permitted
to move, preferring the doubt, immobility, before accelerating the awful outcome that night of abandonment
and insomnia. In such a situation she called shy, kindly, Gratian, but, as before, no one answered.

Prostrate
on the floor in a corner of the room, always surrounded by complete darkness, he heard that a carriage
had stopped under the balconies, and soon to be opened with great
care and closed the front door, then felt the grand staircase steps:
wanted to speed up call to those who came, but the words choked in
his throat and had to wait, heard the footsteps in the hall and a
few seconds later the sound of a key in lock the bedroom door that
was, the door opened and gave way to someone: the frou-frou Silk told
him that White was coming back.

Suddenly blazed a phosphorus and continuous act violent gas light lit up the room.

Then the box was presented to the view of those who were there, it was terrible at one end of
the stay, the home of the girl covered in soot, the curtains were on, the fire had invaded the
clothes, the unfortunate creature was dead burned Graciana by neglect, which bewildered by
the flight, had left the candle within walking distance of the crib.
