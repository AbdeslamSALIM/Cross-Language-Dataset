 But it increases in complaints of "abuse" and
regulatory proceedings begin, and is the law with its casuistic distinctions and subtleties, and lo
our man paying the broken glass and perhaps at the gates of the prison, as a highwayman. And
there are cases of it.

- Why?

- Well, sometimes, because "that's the law", which seems made to try
to protect criminals; and many others, because the push to that side
... those black clouds that also saw you last night in his dream.

-
I think not, and you forgive.

- Lucky you!

- But what reason is
there, brought to believe in these clouds, which do not favor our
friend the other being convicted?

- The reason for the "wrong again",
he also mentioned to us last night.

- It will be so, but do not understand.

-
Then follow the example pictured, and suppose that the offender is
a arbitrista victorious Note, a man of coarse grain and worse entails,
profiteers and shyster, but well rounded flow.

Assuming this, it can be assumed that this man is the leader of a
tight mesnaderos submissive squad, which falls in battle is now used
as a herd of sheep, or who has diabolical art to handle the cups and
illusions of this farce to its full taste, or if you have nothing
of it, knows to look for any way, they also know the value those skills
represent the right brand, and how to negotiate.

Well at least now paid these merits, is a carte blanche entering
the bag in its extensive jurisdiction includes the pirate or protected
even in the palaces of the Law This is the "bad back"

I alluded to our friend, for go for honesty, has no retinue that serve under the banner of modern
masters, those who run the black clouds that are their delegates
are omnipotent and sleeves, hoods, for their own benefit, of the laws
without force and plundered soil of the motherland.

I told you once, speaking of what we had to do and well educated
men will in the rural villages to get them what Don Celso and his
predecessors in his, that not everywhere the same result was achieved,
that the martyrs had even heroic work, and maybe you had the opportunity
to meet some of them.

As already did you hear about Mr. Tower Provedaño.

That remarkable man with all his knowledge, with all its virtues, with all its bells of noble lineage,
with all its sacrifices towards the general good and glory of the land where he was born and
the whole country, is a martyr the tireless work of Sisyphus.

I had not, neglected Madrid, judgment about the evils new and those black clouds despite having
dreamed about half of it the night before and a prophecy of what was of paint Neluco the next
day, but remembering vagueness and platitudes that on purpose such a delicate matter had read many
times mechanically in newspapers or heard without Talks focus on coffee, and uniting all the statement
made by Neluco and what, for a good time, continued to tell me yet, and, above all, the satisfaction
that I felt in enlarging more and more the idea I had formed of the knight of the tower, I accepted
good win all the medical opinions, and so we were entertaining the ascent of the mountain, first
part of our long journey. To let me even more pleasant, spoke Neluco some features of this singular
man, and among them the following, which he painted from head to toe.

On one occasion he came to his neighbors, he was no longer young, going to look a little by
cattle he had in the winter, far from Provedaño a half-day journey, a good walk in the high mountains,
facing east. The day was December. The sky was gray; pure shaved the cold north wind, and that
night fell a snowfall of two feet. Snowing since dawn and dusk freezing since spent more than
half a week, and he never got Provedaño the man who had gone into winter, and his whereabouts
were unknown. Mr. entire Event Tower, who had left home at the same time not be needed elsewhere;
Spears jumped into the yard, take the road of the village, flying,
rather than treading on the thick layer of snow that whitens lining
and, as the place and the entire valley as all the surrounding mountains,
arrives with his club hit the doors locked for fear to the glacial
weather; ábrense to order one by one; questions, explores, learns,
estremécese, unworthy, admonishes, reprimands, threats where the will
is not to your liking, and, finally, clubbed to straighten the most
crooked, to get what he is looking for: a half-dozen men who accompany
the winter should be blocked by snow, if not dead hunger or devoured
by wolves, his poor neighbors, who, back in the morning counting Next,
there was no other provisions of mouth led to a loaf of four pounds
is fine collection of them, urged the six recently settled around
him, and were incensed at anímanse out because they are good and charitable
to the bottom, begin to march up the hill seven, uphill, and walk,
walk, walk, when they transpose Palombera summits, feel chest pain,
as if the air that carried with it millions of aspiring sharp point,
and a fumble and a breakdown in the knees, as if they were slabs of
lead the "snowshoeing" dragging their feet; confórtanse a bit with
a drink of liquor they drink "to the Riola '; and walk, walk steadily,
sometimes come wrapped in swirls of snow sifted, crumbled and subtle,
which prevents them from even breathing and, fortunately, pass like
a cloud over of hovering and wander wandering on the mountain, the
same lord of the tower, complexion iron and that always walks ahead,
you will note missing his indomitable strength, that members is numbing,
which can not be altered one syllable to his lips made by coldness,
which are stiff, numb hands bruised, begins to fear something serious
and not by him, certainly, and jump, jump, rubs, hits, screams and
howls like a wild ... anything but shake and stop, or stop a moment
to rest a muscle or a fiber of body, and then singing and joking while
walking, to encourage and set an example to those who are their orders
and will remain in absolute silence, terrifying, those lonely heights
and unforgiving.

At last God wants Columbres the winter, they have strength enough to get there, arrive alive and
in what they are looking for. Man is there, but nearly died of hunger and cold and despair.
While some comfort him some drinks and words, others light a fire that becomes heat, which also lacked
all. Following in the spirit, the lord of the tower is fed carefully to the hungry and shivering,
which eats more you eat, how much you put in front of mouth. And no man, but dazed, silent and
sad. That also must cure sorrow, and sends them to tell those who know something entertaining
stories and romances. Nobody the six knows a word of these things, but the lord knows by heart
Provedaño tomes integers, and gratings loud and resonant half poem of the Cid. As if to shut
up. Man no joke, not even paying attention. We must do more, and orders that will sing to the use
of land, but no one is in the voice for it, and sings it to belt
out tunes from the valley native and even the preface of the Mass
of the day of 'Corpus', the most solemn and regorjeada the year.

In this test, because man sees the singer and show a delight to hear. Well, we have take the
rest: to dance around the world! ... And no one moves, he dances like a madman to high and low,
and then the Aragonese jota, and finally, a shoe boots the besotted an exclamation of surprise
and a laugh with joy, and the gentleman, and hastily and and panting, these words appear on the
pitch, a curse: "Ahab the son of a goat!"

All and "lovingly and company 'rest, warm up, talk, eat, just the day sleep, he wakes the next,
clear, calm and radiant sun, and become eight to Provedaño above the frozen snow, as if nothing
had happened. All this is narrated by Neluco thoroughly, I had to hear.

After the immediate harbor and gorges, and prayed at the shrine on the other side of the Hail
Vader usual, I could see the sunlight of the afternoon, the rest of the way to Tablanca, which
had always happened at night, which did not seem so deep not as dangerous as I had imagined
in darkness. We arrived at last, and after know at the door of my house, Chisco, who had new top,
the doctor despedímonos and I 'see you later "and he continued walking towards him.

There was no thinking and new excursions in the mountains: the last had been exhausted my strength
and filled the measure of my curiosity undemanding. The body and the soul called me rest for
a few days and then ... But then something new would have to divert my endless leisure? Would
you find interest in what already seen and enjoyed? And if so, Such luxuries do you allow the temporary
wintry, by some miracle of God, had not triggered even over Tablanca and its environs? For
one thing, the life he had made during those two weeks, most runs, the peaceful and sunny right
temperature, no longer fruits give me very worthy of esteem. With my incessant raids, if I managed to
get to land as soon and as fully as I waited for my uncle and he wanted me, at least killed
time of day and night was plenty to entertain issues a little get-together the cocinona and
conversations at the table of my uncle, ate with good appetite, and Women's condumios gray and
his daughter repolluda I tasted glory sentíame courageous and strong, and I slept like a groundhog
in the body stretched on the bed much neglected reading the newspapers he received from Madrid,
and writing to my friends and I would not letters soaked in melancholy tinge of the early
days, we were looking more bearable relentless vision of the rocks around me, and shortness
of horizons miserable I choked, in short, that if I had "done everything", conceived as the possibility
of it.

Say, if not, the example of the party: at first it was unbearable, and every commentator, new
to me, that appeared in it, I rather boorish and more bland than the previous; was no joke in his
"humor" expressed in language and conventional maimed or reason, therefore, to some laughter
shameful that even came to bother me, as if I offend; hastiábame the simplicity of the issues that
interest them, and could not help regret resobado acordábame of the Latin poet in exile in Pontus:
the barbarian seemed I could not understand that anyone was understood there. Trying to find
in my books and newspapers, in the solitude of my room, the remedy against such boredom the kitchen,
but the fear of my uncle to translate it as a sign of contempt for his rough commentators, I
contained. Seeing forced to feed the spirit of it all, I recently little to savor it without
disgust, and soon ended up failing to find it enjoyable something better. The same thing happened
to the condumios of Facia. I learned the value Castilian of local idioms that are fed and
wove the talks of the party, and the continuous friction and forced them gave me the knowledge
I needed material "Conversations." And the miracle was done, for known, common sense is that
there thing that interests us as the known; and as a corollary of this axiom, that, she is minimal, we
find it interesting as we know it.

Worth the example of a touched my friend's passion for making toothpicks, just because it
has mastered the art with rare ability.

This was that in the first week I got my spoon in the talks and insisted
upon in rustic those serious issues of scope that I was beginning
to penetrate, it would distinguish characters, tricks and zunas of
each, and I felt very flattered by praise from all my feats of hiking
and hunting.

My uncle was bathed in water pink with these things, because I took for signs of rapid acclimation,
and I was pleased to see how little effort on my part gave him one of the few pleasures that
he could vacuum and the poor old man. Then my visits to the town, the case reported by Chisco
Facia, the acquisition of medical and friendship with all of this was linked naturally gave
new impetus to this positive trend and gives me my greatest attachment to things and vicissitudes
those simple people.

He saw with pleasure every day increased the gathering and studying
the degustation and character of each new talk show for me with the
same interest as if were a newcomer to the salons of "the"

Medinaceli, and if, for example, told me my uncle to the ear when there was one in the kitchen
for the first time this season, "that has the grace of God to tell stories "touched sentíame
curiosity as if aristocratic party told me: "that you just get the speaker has broken down this
afternoon in Parliament the Government "or" the author of the drama Z H. " He was right Neluco when
I said that man has cultivated intelligence resources in himself needed to live at home everywhere,
provided that no exchange of pulley ropes and to strive to raise what is below, rather than down
what is above, to achieve desired level of ideas for a particular purpose.

Far from correcting the trial that I had formed of temperament tablanqueses to 'see go ', so to
speak, on the porch of the church or in the alleys of the town, I said I more and more into it when
I tried to close in the kitchen of my uncle and I could study them in full exercise of all its
physical and intellectual and only because there was where exposed and aired the most important
of his life, the warmth of bonfires the cocinona under the chairmanship of Don Celso, who
always hit the nail on the best and more convenient, the same with a wisecrack with a formal
opinion. They were, without exception of a single, parsimonious in the extreme and soft condition
and in their shootings joke, those who are fond, squandered the metaphors, colorful local Greek
for me at first, and very witty after I learned to translate to my
language.

We were looking theirs, meanwhile, more sweet and lilting rhythm the more he heard "sound."

The priest Don Sabas was attending very often and so dull as the first time, but to me I do
not it looked like after I had seen him as "eloquent" on the cliffs of the mountain consagrábale
why certain reverence, regardless of who owed him on his inauguration and its virtues, and I fancy
that not know it or disliked. As he had boasted over once in front of me, that with these bonds
had to tie him to the land of my forefathers, and forever, "for all eternity": thus, even in
Latin, had emphasized the boasting. Don Pedro Nolasco only two or three times had returned to the
gathering, and that "to be me was' because it was poorly managed and, to the years he had,
with the ruggedness of the Callejos in the dark of night, although he had a flashlight. Neluco
attended plus the kitchen to top that at the end of that season, and I think he did with the
charitable purpose of shortening the period of "acclimatization" because it showed I was very
diligent in taking the issues to me conversations, translating the metaphors and helping my uncle
in his relentless grind to stoke fires of prodding the attendees gathering more assets.

There I met Toper, the father of Tanasi, and pepazo, the groom preferred by Chisco Molehill
for his daughter, saying the TARUMBA, also off the pace, often by cocinona. The Toper was a
middle-aged man, cuadradote back and something red matted hair, little talkative and very
skillful in the work that led to the gathering (it was rare that
he would talk show without it), "paint" covers the tip of his knife.

Dispatched three or four pairs each night, so it was good preparation to replace them at my
uncle, as he had others' cebillas "of" whetstone holders "and even" Banilla "(strips of hazel) to make
'Macon' (large basket), because it seemed, for that and other signals, the home of all ...
even for establishing his office, four times each year, the itinerant collector of taxes.
