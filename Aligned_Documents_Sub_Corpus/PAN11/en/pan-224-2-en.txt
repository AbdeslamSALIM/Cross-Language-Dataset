 D. Fruela, from Ovideo, has been accused
of high treason and should be sentenced to death. His accuser was D. Raymond, of Butler Palace.
Three of D. Raimundo's family were ready to support attacks against defenders of D. Fruela, who had
appealed to divine law. However, D Raymond was so powerful, feared, and arrogant, and D.Fruela
was so hated, that nobody came to his defense. The deadline was only three days away.
