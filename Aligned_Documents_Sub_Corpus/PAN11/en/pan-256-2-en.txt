 I'll be good. Go back home and live with me but
bring me your tyrant. Only I beg you to let me choose my own and do not you insist that I
go to what the general yesterday I proposed. I confess, there is a so narcissistic, that although
that is now driving me very badly, and therefore should I hate him, is madly in love with me, and
I can not help. Imagine you, how I have to be able to marry that the general's nephew, still
madly in love with someone else
