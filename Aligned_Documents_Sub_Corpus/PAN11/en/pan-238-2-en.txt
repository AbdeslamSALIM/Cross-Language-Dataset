 Osorio had
the bad idea to bring the two girls at school had Chamartin, a ten and over eleven years,
to spend some time with them. The poor things had to leave earlier than he had promised his father,
because Clementine was so busy just could set them attention. This outraged both Osorio, a day
without saying goodbye his mother, got into the car and took himself to school. Of course that night,
when Clementina back, on this occasion there was a violent scene between the spouses. Raimundo
occupations also had with her lover. But he was childish to enjoy perspective of dance, which planned
to attend dressed as a page of the Catholic Kings. Was an idea that provided Clementina. The
model was taken from a famous painting that had in the Senate. She was in love with the portrait
of Ms Margaret of Austria, wife of Philip III, made by Pantoja. It ordered a black velvet
dress just too tight at the waist, with pink interior skirt embroidered with silver. This costume
was very appropriate to enhance the grace of his figure and the majestic beauty of her face.

The Duke also worked for the least delicate of the preparation, erection
of stage to the orchestra, which was placed against the wall dividing

twisting, nauseating.

- F. ... slowly! ... Slowly you, fool, that of long noses! ... Careful with that lamp .... You
down a little. Pepe ... F. ..., do not be ass down more! ... Eh! Eh! top now ....

Upon arrival at the opening of a door, the teacher, seeing that it
was easy to hurt, I cried

- Watch your hands!

- Beware of relief,
F. ...!-- rushed screaming Duke -.

The last thing I care to me are your hands, Babieca!

One of the workers looked up and thrust a indefinable look of hatred
and contempt.

When the furniture was in place, the Duke had the horses and headed to their rooms to remove dust.
