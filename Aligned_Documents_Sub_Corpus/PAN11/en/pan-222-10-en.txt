 The bird, quickly
jumping on the latter, snatched from the hands cord, and went out again flying out of that room.

Everything
was so instantaneous that Princess barely had time to see the bird,
but its audacity and her beauty caused the strangest impression.

A few days later, the Princess, to divert his melancholy, he wove a dance with their daughters, in
the presence of the Princes. They were all in the gardens and watched spellbound. Suddenly Princess
felt that he unleashed a league, and suspending the dance, went on the sly to a nearby grove to
tie it again. SA had already discovered the shapely leg was stretched and white silk stockings,
and was preparing to hold the league in his hand when he heard a noise of wings, and saw the
bird come to her green, snatched the league in the ebony beak and disappeared to the point.
The Princess gave a cry and fell faint.

Came the suitors and her father. She regained consciousness, and the first thing he said was
:--«¡ That green bird looking at me ... I bring you alive ... not kill you ... I want to own
green bird alive! "

But in vain he sought the Princes. In vain, though instructed by the Princess of not thought to
kill the green bird, were released against the falcon, sacrum, bigwigs and even eagles, tamed and
trained in falconry.

The green bird did not appear dead or alive.

The unfulfilled desire of possessing the Princess and tormented increased his bad mood. That could
not sleep at night. The best thing you thought of the Prince was not worth at all.

Just came on the day, rose from the bed, and lifting light clothes, without corset and crinoline,
most beautiful and interesting in that negligee, pale and haggard, he went with her maid,
favorite leafy forest as it was back to the palace, where stood the tomb of his mother. There
he began to mourn and lament his fate .-- What I serve said, all
my riches, if contempt all the princes of the world, if not love;
what my kingdom, if not I have you, mother, and do all my beauties
and gems, if not I have a beautiful green bird?

With this, as to console something, unlink the cord of her dress and pulled out the chest a
rich locket, where he kept a lock of his mother, who got to kiss. But hardly started to kiss,
when he went faster than ever green bird, with its ebony beak touched the Princess lips, and snatched
the locket, which had lain for so many years against his heart, and
so hidden and instead had been desired.

The robber then disappeared, flew out and got lost in the clouds.

This time the Princess did not faint, but rather stood very red and said to the maid: - Look
at me look me in the lips, the insolent bird has injured me, because I burn.

The maiden looked at them and did not notice any bite, but surely the bird had some poison in
them, because the traitor did not reappear on, and Princess was worse
for degrees, falling sick very dangerous.

A singular fever ate, and talked casino but to say: - Do not kill him ... I bring you alive ...
I I own you.

The physicians agree that the only medicine to cure the princess, was to bring green bird alive.
But where to find him? It was useless to seek the most skilled hunters. Useless were offered
huge sums who would bring.

The Fortunate King convened a major conference of scholars to find out, on pain of incurring
in their righteous indignation, who and where he lived the green bird, whose memory haunted her daughter.

Forty
days and forty nights meeting were as wise, without ceasing to meditate and discourse but to
get some sleep and eat.

Spoke very learned and eloquent speeches, but nothing found out .-- Sir, said after all the King,
bowing humbly to feet and injuring the powder with the respectable fronts, we're two fools,
do we hang; our science is a lie not know who is the green bird, and only we dare to perhaps
be suspected if the phoenix of Arabia.
- Arise, said the king with remarkable generosity, I forgive you
and thank you for the indication about the phoenix. Will promptly
seven of you with rich presents for the queen of Sheba, and all the
resources that I can have live birds to hunt. The Phoenix must have
a nest in the country knows, and then you bring it to me, if you do
not want my royal anger you punish but to prevent it tratéis escondiéndoos
