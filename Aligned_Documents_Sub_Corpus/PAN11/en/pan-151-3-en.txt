 It was like lightning. However, Ramiro
instantly recognized the eyes of Casilda, and instead of stopping, the layer terciose straightened
up hastily to the other side.

After missing more than half an hour in the direction of the southeast, without departing from
the river, he saw poke a cross between the ridges. It was the cross in a chapel built on the edge
of the abyss.

He approached, and despite deep trouble, let them fall by the surprise box absorbed a moment informing
it useful sense of his soul.

Opposite him, on the opposite side, extending from Toledo to the west rising, staggering on
the high gray rock roofs, their pale walls, numerous towers. Smooth and rapid escarpment from
the city fell to the bottom of the narrow, old apparently covered crumbly ash, as if the fire of God
had been there, destroying all roots and all the seed.

Ramiro religious thought with horror on the slopes of the eternal
punishment that reprobates have to climb with your feet and hands,
to fall back on the air inflamed and re-climb and fall without forgiveness,
without truce indefinitely.

He sat on a rock.

The river flowed at a terrible depth between rusty rocks and wild beasts. It seemed a River
of guilt and atonement, as it forges the imagination to think about hell. It seemed as though
painful spectra passed in procession down there, skimming the waves
Hanging with dark veils.

Meanwhile, the village took, with the time, desolate whiteness of bones in the wilderness, and
all the city, looking from a distance, through the vibrating shadows, like a city in another world,
a city outside of life and time, as anxious as the mysticism and psalms.

In the highest part, outstanding pieces drenched in melancholy reflection Alcázar twilight. Ramiro
recalled with mysterious inspiration that those walls had hosted one of the greatest kings glorious
history, a monarch of monarchs who ended up throwing the scepter and crown hidden refuge in
the monastery, and, suddenly, the ghost of Emperor Charles V. appeared before him with his
face half hidden by the hood of a habit.

Ah! Sackcloth that the owner of the world ...!

The sun sank behind the hills, and the city took a limp and purple
coloring, which if referred to by transparent amethyst.

Some windows that had flamed a flash went off. Ramiro overtones penetrate the sacred gathering,
sensing a sign, a voice from above. At that moment the bells of the city burst into touch
prayers. The chimes were entering long distance and moving a song which suggested in the litany
of death, and seemed as if the rock that supported the many steeples vibrated at the same time
as the box of an organ. He remembered Ramiro Avila bells, the afternoons of his childhood in the
stately tower and his mother, always weeping, always in mourning
always moody.

He prayed the Hail Mary. Was redeemed, was purified, but his chest felt hungry and sad, like a stream
without water. He wanted to enter the shrine at the foot of the altar
pour their grief deep.

Arose. The soil and rocks ranged around, his body, relieved, went to come off, no doubt, of the
earth.

Suddenly, a fire, a bolt inflamed, coming above, he entered his chest,
immersing for a few seconds in a rich state, enjoyed only with the
soul.

Then everything happened.

He thought then that he had been trasverberado as Mother Teresa of
Jesus and God just down to him in all his power and mercy, to make
testing a sip, just, of the joys that awaited him when his soul, conquering
the world, was delivered Finally, with sovereign passion, solitude
and penance.

A moment later he returned to the city in search of a convent where he changed clothes Knight
by a sackcloth of a hermit.

V

Puce dress and holding roughly with the refrain, over his shoulder, the humble backpacks saddled
him for the trip the Franciscan Sisters of Penance San Juan, funky Ramiro de Toledo, the next
morning, taking over the management of forests noon.

He wore all the hair back, the forehead without frowning, eyes moist.

He walked many days, from sunrise to sunset, sipping on his face in streams and eating the crumbs
which gave the farmers.

More than a compassionate Walker offered to take her on the rump of his horse, but he smiled and
marked in holy dust stronger footprint sandals. He slept in the yard sales or the roadside, where
he took night.

Finally, one morning, after very long trip, came to see from the top
of a hill the white city of Cordoba, bathed in the moist and radiant
blush of dawn.

It was noted from there, passing by a fruit, the convent of the Sisters of Mount Caramel, and
thought that under that roof was near his mother, felt the sobs choked breath.

Without wishing to approach the city and away from the trails, found at last, on the edge of the
mountain, a cave hidden by weeds and shrubs. Was inside a table made of branches of oak without
uncorking, an ink orange root, a stool, a hoe and several pots sunk in the mud. From the top, hung
an old suit gentleman, and besides, like two smoked hams, a pair of boots on the way with spurs.

That
same night, lighting the lamp she had, and going to bed on a pile
of litter to the bottom of the cave, he found himself with the mummified
body of an old hermit, that his hands still clutching rosary beads
dried.

Ramiro dropping hints knees and raised his arms to heaven, thanking God for having placed,
while in his way, the desired shelter and example of that death.

The next day morning, was buried the hermit, and ordered his best
inside the dark hiding place, where he had resolved to spend the rest
of his life.

Soon a sublime pleasure flooded her heart. The prayer continues, the total disregard the world
and, above all, the arduous and ingenious imposed penance, he did
know the ineffable pride of holiness great pride that swelled the
soul infinitely and he rose to sublime flight over the miseries of
man.

Compared to the admirable anchorites of the Thebaid, and was assured that in times to come would
read her story homes and dining halls for the edification of souls.

The nuns of Toledo habíanle put in the bag some books on mysticism.

Driven by those readings, Ramiro was proposed through the three spiritual paths described in treated,
and finally achieve possession of the greatest glory he had sought so far by misleading ways.

But
the flame of the early days could not be maintained, no longer feel those raptures again that
lit up in the crypt of her soul heat lamps that spoke Fray Juan de la Cruz. The night of cold
and darkness fell upon his heart, the gloom and damp of den began to stale, the reading made
him insufferable.

Some afternoons, hoping to breathe free, leaving you to walk through
the mountains until the evening.

The breeze was always delicious and brought from the farms to the
perfume of blossoms softened the will and away any idea of ??penance.

      Smiles of women, carmine of her lips
    parted, Blinks malicious, appeared before him in the dark pink or
blue in the shade of trees.

      
    

Apathy, laziness invincibility began to overwhelm its members as a magic and spirit until he
spent most of the day lying in bed hermit, busy counting dimples in the rock or water droplets
that fell from the slopes. Lizards, cockroaches, mice and many insects that were previously
unknown, ended up climbing over his body, and he, rather than frighten,
maintained complete immobility, to observe about their every move.

He spent weeks without praying the rosary and without going into the city to hear the Sunday
Mass and call provisions, as was his custom.

One morning he heard a woman's voice a few steps from the cave:

They sing and sing of Roland Oliveros and non of Zurraquín, CA was
great barragán.

Song of Roland or Olivero sings and non of Zurraquín, CA was a great gentleman.

It was a double chorus Medrano, Esquire, never tired of repeating. It seemed the voice Casilda.
Would not it be a deception of the senses?

He got up and looked out a moment. A woman, covered with a green veil, hurry down the hill,
and the song fell and walked away with it gracefully.

Another morning, gathering firewood by the outline, found at the foot
of a tree a sword cover rust.

Took her to his hideout and frotola strongly with wet sand. Was a lordly weapon, several silver
rings girdled the black leather scabbard, the blade had the mark of Hortunas, the garrison was shed
and thin, like a Miranda.

One trivial incident came to tear your laziness.

Since then spend hours sprucing up the sword in the smallest cracks,
and was pleased to bring it to light for sun run a flame over the
sheet, and wield wield it with force, it blow in the wind.

Since she never went out into the woods that carry it, and sometimes,
looking over and Moreover, as if someone might surprise you, bend
the tip of the trunk somewhat trees to remember the terrible lunge
that had killed Gonzalo.

His blood was roused again, and spirit, inflated again with the wind of honor dream again and
praise the triumphs of life and all the deeds that he could have
performed by the world.

Hallab an afternoon of September sitting on a high cliff, and pondering the idea shortly to visit
her mother when she saw walk up the hill, on a gray mule, a old lean and slender than his head
down and looked with singular attention to the grotto.

The man happened again the next morning, looking always with the same
curiosity.

Finally, one day when Ramirez came to feel so unbearable torment of hunger, mysterious old
man happened to be passing at the time of dusk, carrying forward on the chair a small basket
full of loaves and a string of onions around his shoulder.

Ramiro walked toward him, exclaiming:

- Give me, by God, an onion and some bread!

The man went on.

Ramiro, then, in a menacing voice and stronger, he repeated:

- For the love of God, give me some bread!

But the stranger, holding just the mule, said sharply:

- Better to go to ganalle with your arms.

Do you think perhaps that this filthy lazy delete crimes and perjury?

He crosses his path, and grasping with a hand brake of the horse, lifted with the other of its
bronze crucifix, repeating:

- Give me, I say, a few crumbs in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ!

Then the old man bent his body forward and, in reply, spat twice with holy boldness barbaric
image of the Redeemer. Ramiro gave a cry of horror. His body hesitated fought side by two impulses.
Finally, running with a vengeance to the cave, took the bar and came straight to the man, intending
to kill him right there. But to raise the tip to sink in that breast sacrilegious, a voice strong
and dominant, a voice penetrated his heart, checked him at once:

- Ah! Ramiro, Ramiro, just want now to stab the man who gave you life!

In pronouncing these words, Walker took off his broad hat he wore, to discover your head and better
show the whole face.

Ramiro experienced great shock. He had just recognized the mysterious character of the suburb
of Santiago, the dedicated Moorish had saved his life, leaving later, as I recall, the Saracen
dagger valuable.

- Yes, I have begotten you in the haughty Dona Guiomar - continued the old man - and your grandfather
preferred Casalla at once with the old Don Lope, in hatred of my race and my belief. Then, back
in Avila, I gave you life a second time, sacándote from the daggers
of the believers, and I Castilla expelled as a traitor.

But you, Ramiro, I paid in good coin Christian break your oath and giving to the Inquisition and
the wretched Gulina Aixa Aixa the Jarifa, Aixa the holy, that they
were thrown into the fire after they have cured and given with much
love as you have them!

Tears fell from his eyes and trembling voice, exclaimed at last:

- Ah! I do not want to curse, because a father's curse of Allah is always heard ..; no, I dare
not curse ...!

With these words he waved his left hand back, and heavily beaded mules, left fall down all the loaf,
then disappeared among the rocks.

Ramiro looked after him without calling him and walking toward the cave, went to sit in the corner
darker by pressing the crucifix to her chest.

What was heard? Her father? A Moorish!

All the mysteries of his life
came to his memory: the loneliness of his childhood, harsh grandfather
before him, the continuous and tearful melancholy Dona Guiomar, so
foreign species he had raised his lance to the converted, the sudden
diversion of Beatrice, the insult of Gonzalo on the street ... The
selfless love of one man of another faith, another race!, And saw
that it was highly understandable in light of the terrible revelation.

Could
it be true? Is it, indeed, the son of a Moor? Ah! More worth then
broken veins and let all his blood was spilled on the mud of the cave
ignored. His reason fell in terrible turmoil. The ideas seemed to
howl and swirl like the wind in one night gale. I did not want, do
not want to think, and knelt in front of nails to stun, waved his
arms in the darkness, puffing furiously as a man alienated by terror;
but was increasingly brooding inexorable, more eloquent, more profound.
Sometimes laughing their own credulity, dismissing as absurd greatest
words of the Moor; others came to feel fully convinced, and was surprised
not to have conceived so far no suspicion among many clues.

Suddenly,
the same horror of that uncertainty, he stands on his heels. Turns
the limelight. Instant thought just crossed his mind. Get in the stool,
picks old clothes and boots hanging from the top of the cave. A sound
currency pocket in breeches.

When he had changed the sackcloth of
those clothes from another time and girded sword, left the cave and
began to wander at night. He had no idea that yet another break away
without to the sea, another hope that the galleons.

He dreamed of
a region of India, where plants, fruits, birds, stars, everything
was new to him and nothing will remind old and evil land of his birth,
the land where everything was adversity, hex, hexing. Only then could
escape the curse that haunted him perhaps from the womb. 

Walked
tirelessly pushed as Ashavero, by a mysterious wind that moved the
leaves trees, and that he, with all his might, I could not resist.

At
night, in sales, seeing him appear with the old suit and beard disheveled,
tiptoe over a farmhand hit the cup of wine and crossing himself escaped
the corral.

In contrast, day, crossing the villages, the kids made
fun of his appearance and he threw behind nutshells and handfuls of
dust.

With the money he had found in the breeches bought a mule to
shorten the path and a cloak to cover, and thus, after many adventures,
was finally the city of Cadiz, in mid-December.

The same day, walking
the streets, saw a banner hung from a window company, asked by the
captain and told him that he had left the day before to Jerez. Was
going to retire when a soldier who was sitting on a bench, next to
the door, said:

- If your worship, sir knight, wants to talk to Pablo
Martinez, the lieutenant, there will have on your right.

Ramiro turned
her face and her astonishment was immense when he saw crossing the
street to her house dress page soldier's finery.

Pablillo was barely
in Flanders
