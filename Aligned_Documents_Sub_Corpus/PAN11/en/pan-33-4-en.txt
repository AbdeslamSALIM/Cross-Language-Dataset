 

We leave these captains and discuss the other two that he sent the Uscovilca ansímismo Andesuyo
part, which is called Yana and Toquello Vilca Vilca [15] whom when give them their Lord Uscovilca
the other party of people, left Paucaray there, to whom, departing, they were commanded by Uscovilca
not arrived to Cuzco with ten leagues, but pasasen sections of, Becausethe Uscovilca wanted
this company in Cuzco for himself. And thus, the Apart from these two masters, getting by
the province of Condesuyo, winning and conquering provinces to arrive at the Chiriguanos, where
we shall leave and discuss Uscovilca.

Which, as hobiese released their four captains in the way you have already heard, and had [16]
great desire for him to go and hold the Cuzco and the Inca Viracocha, taking other third share of
people who left, leaving his land and people with the collection and keep necessary so that if
any of it will prompt you to come back in their care and shelter, - and so he, already done
this and provided, broke with its people and taking their two captains in é looking Viracocha
demand. Which was very still that anxiety, because he not at war
against anyone or tried to take or remove any one for him.

And still ANSI standard of this war that came upon him, came to him two messengers who invia
Uscovilca, by which we mean that winters give obedience, as unto the Lord it was, where not,
to gear, nickel was going to make war, and I thought dalle battle é sujetalle, let him know
Quél Vilcacunga was in, which is seven miles from the city of Cuzco, and it would be rather short
with him. And saw the Inca Viracocha of an embassy that Uscovilca he sent him, and who brought great
power, and everything left behind was subject to him, inviolable say he was happy to give him
obidient, and I wanted to eat and drink with him. Then went they were the messengers of the
city of Cuzco with the embassy of Viracocha Inca, made raise its key and entered into his agreement
to see what to do, because they were as brief Uscovilca couriers, who did not give rise to that
with his apparently take in what was to respond, and so they responded to what you heard, and
then came [17] and being it considered that Uscovilca came with great power of people, and leave proud
and which ANSI giving it so easily, that would be lightly esteemed, and agreed to with the best
chapter the things they were doing to their preservation, but there are still subjective and
therefore would not easily as if they would give, - to be out of this city of Cuzco, Viracocha
with all city ??people, and most of their neighbors who wished to follow, go to a Penol quest
seven leagues from this city of Cuzco, on top of a village called
Traces, which Penol strong Xahuana Xaqui called Caca [18].

About this time Inca Viracocha had seven children, had one of these least of all, which Inca
Yupanqui was called, and at that time that Viracocha Inca Cuzco wanted out of this his son
Inca Yupanqui, though minor, was a youth of great presumption and a man who had much his person,
and it ill that his father Viracocha Inca to the desmamparar its people and want to give subjetacion
as well as we had promised, it seemed that it was bad case and great shame for the people that
they had desto news, and seeing his orchestra agreed father and the other lords of Cuzco is
out, itself presupposed not to leave him and join the people who could, and since Uscovilca
came, he did not give such obidient, but die before to say who lived
in subjection, and that could bring together so many people happiness
and good fortune be such that the Uscovilca expires, and so they were
liberating their people.

And assuming that ANSI had thought, and went in search of three young men, sons of gentlemen
and his friends, and children of those men with whom his father had entered into consultation it
out and give obedience to the Chanca, - the names of whom were young men, one Vica Quirao [19]
and the other Apo Mayta, and the other Quilescachi Urco Guaranga; - and joining Inca Yupanqui
with these three young men gentlemen, consulted with them what I had thought, and said that
before was due to assume and be glad to receive him in death, not living in such subjection and
infamy, not having been born subjective. And while all four ANSI time, the young men rejoiced
Inca Yupanqui to tell them that, é gave him what word to him to do, and being all four of a review
and Paresce, Viracocha Inca and the city went out for Penol bringing the people of Cuzco, and most
of their neighbors who could carry. Inca Yupanqui and the three youths and those gentlemen, they
stayed in the city with each path servants wanted to stay with them, which is called Pata raised
Yupanqui, and Muru UAnC [20] and Apo Yupanqui, Uxuta Urco Guaranga, which were alone, was not with
them other most outstanding person of his servants. And seen his son Viracocha Inca Yupanqui
was with that purpose, she laughed and ignored much of him, because it took him six children,
and with them the greatest and most beloved of his, who was called
Urco Inca, whom he thought to leave location and name of person.

Known that the Chanca was what he had done Uscovilca Viracocha, decided to send him a captain
of his who was said Guaman Guaraca, that the Inca Viracocha concluded that Paresce, well I
had him, which became captain, and received him very Viracocha While in El Penol Do was. And
the captain for Uscovilca shipped to Viracocha Inca, known how they had been in Cuzco Inca Yupanqui
with the three gentlemen already mentioned, and each a servant to serve, and in order to die
and not be subjective, and known this new by Uscovilca, rejoiced much, because it paresció, who
beat the Inca Yupanqui, son Viracocha Inca and to the three gentlemen who were with him, that
could succeed, and taking them over in Cuzco, dondél came to track. And a captain Deste Uscovilca
called Tomay Guaraca, known the new Deste purpose of Inca Yupanqui, Uscovilca asked his Lord,
do her the favor of this enterprise; Quél wanted to go to Cuzco and to apprehend and kill Inca
Yupanqui and those who were with him. And Uscovilca replied that such an undertaking than that,
that if he wanted, and that he wanted his hand to finish, and then he sent a messenger to his Inca
Yupanqui, by which he sent to say that you were delighted to know that he wanted to try their
strength and courage of youth, who is dressed himself and his family who were with him, which to
three months there wanted to go see him, that because of not to complain, I wanted to give
space three months that he could see best, and so they dress the same weapons and people who
Paresce. For as the Uscovilca hobiese known that Viracocha had been run away from the city of Cuzco,
and brought with him all his people, and the most that could lead from other neighboring villages
to the city of Cuzco, had this Uscovilca that would turn him no part of the Inca Yupanqui, who was
to resist the power that he brought. And since to Inca Yupanqui what say Uscovilca winters,
Quél was answered quickly before he died fighting be subjective, Nascar and had free Quél sir,
and if his father was obidient, which could provide for himself and those with him had there in
the Peñol do was and that he was not in it, but if he was to be Lord of Cuzco and titled as such who
fought with him and overcome him, TERNIA of such renown, and that his father rejoiced hobiese desmamparado
Cuzco and come out of it, being held opinion of himself, which he may never had made Cuzco
and been beaten by anyone since it had founded Mango Capac. And heard their embassy and response got
out of Cuzco, and went to his Lord Uscovilca, who was at that time rejoiced with the gentlemen
who brought them there in the seat Vilcacunga, and hearing by the response Uscovilca Inca Yupanqui
that he winters with his messenger, della rejoiced, because I thought success of Cuzco as I have
heard.

The changa [21] entered into its agreement with the three gentlemen who had them, and agreed to Send
It Viracocha a messenger to his father, which winters will say, that looked disgrace he came
and Cuzco had never been subjective since I had Mango Capac village; parescia him, if he Paresce,
who must defend their city, and not allow Se say that such a thing hobiese desmanparado his people,
and then be given and surrender his enemies, who came to his city, he promised, as his son was
dying front of him, if he craves to return, and defendella for budget had died Quél rather than
of will say that he had left subjet being freed Mr. and being born.

And then he was one of the four young men there had, which was told to carry the embassy already
have heard, which messenger departed and came to where he was Viracocha Inca, and said its
embassy from Inca Yupanqui. And heard for Viracocha Inca your child what invia to say, she
laughed much of an embassy and said: "As a man I communicate and talk to God and known by
him have been advised that I am not part Uscovilca to resist, and being ANSI warned I got out
of Cuzco to better able to order what I do dishonor Uscovilca and mine to mistreatment, and
that boy Inca Yupanqui want to die and I presume that been wrongly decided? I turn and decilde
river of his youth, and that he and his men come I get it, and if they want to do, which I regret,
because my son and want to die development way. "The messenger answered with these words he was
saying Viracocha Inca, that his master budget had that, and that in no way left to die or conquer
it and those with he was before coming into subjection. And to this he replied Inca Viracocha,
which return, and that it was the opinion of his master and his will, which pelease and will make
every power, quentendia that it was to be the end of their battle, it would be a prisoner
dead boy é and without understanding: and to tell them to their masters, Quel not think to go
there and that no so winters will become like an embassy. And it heard by the messenger, broke
your answer to where her master was, and that was reached, told him that his father Viracocha
Inca winters will say in response to your message. All of which is heard by Inca Yupanqui, rescibió
Despite this response, because he thought his father would invest some relief, and as they saw their
neighbors in the quest villages around the city of Cuzco, his father Viracocha Inca succor him
with some help and assistance, for so it would come and would give him such favor the neighbors.

And being so sad he and his family for what you already have heard, it was well parescióle
Send It their messengers to the chiefs of the neighboring villages, informing them of the need
in quest and how he had invia their messengers to his father, which he had not loved Send It no
relief, he begged them with his powers he favoresciesen and people. And this thought ANSI by Inca
Yupanqui, he called those four lads that there had, to those who sent them, and to every one
another, to go with the embassy have learned from the chiefs and gentlemen who longs were around
the city in the space of three leagues, and remains divided (and) by Inca Yupanqui these messengers,
was left alone each to the people and chiefs with the embassy You heard, where, as hobiesen come
to the chiefs and gentlemen, do his master winter, and heard by such chiefs embassy and ask them
invia Inca Yupanqui, answered them these messengers in this way: "Go back, brothers, and tell
your master Inca Yupanqui we call [22] of heart and will, and that he rejoiced in helping
us make that calls and succor to our people and power, but, Paresce us that the power of Uscovilca
Chanca that about him and comes to us, which is great and very large, and as he [did not] have
more people to his person and his companions, and the power they could give and help him ansímismo
was little, and could not help, and if it was perhaps those lifeguard tiniendo no more power to
him until there he was, it would spoil him and them - because ansímismo obidient they were to
give the Chanca, as his father intended to do, whenever and that the Chanca they were requested,
which until there had been for the inviolability Chanca to ask for anything, but it [that] they would
do with him was, that as he looks from somewhere or by any air had so much power some people,
that they were ready ansímismo of help you need and resistance like I wanted to do, which not
only he only played, but to them ansimismo, and to every one for himself: and that ansímismo
inviarian to the other provinces and towns with each confined [23], to ask for its aid and favor,
and with its people and with such aid, who promised he will help and assist each and when
those they saw that he had somewhere to put people in such resistance; which thanked him and prayed
that craves it did, what they would do what ansimismo said had. "All this heard by courier turned
where his master was, to which said the response that you heard. And heard by Inca Yupanqui, rescibió
big penalty by himself alone, and offerings will see that the chiefs were doing it, considering
themselves they had together [24] and asked what was right, quel had some people, with which
that of such chiefs and help that were made [it together]. And being in this sentence, say
it would be about time the sun had set and it grew dark the night, and as it was dark, which
said to his companions and his servants to others, who were all there together as they were, é
none go out with him, and so they just left the room without taking any other them.

Inca Yupanqui was very virtuous and amiable young man in his conversation,
was a man who spoke to be as little boy, é did not laugh too much
so, but with great tact, and very friend to do good to the poor, and
that was chaste youth, who never heard that hobiese known woman, and
she never knew of his time lying and that he should put that thing
that no longer meets.

É as he had these parts of virtue and gallant gentleman, but boy, and was of great courage,
considering his father to the Inca Yupanqui be his son, reigned envy aborresciale it and,
because I want an older child of his, who was said Urco Inca, had this being of Inca Yupanqui,
and as he saw that this virtue reign in Inca Yupanqui, not consented who might set up in front
of him, and gave occasion to that no one knows him that loved him because as he saw that I had such
great parties, feared that his days after the lords of Cuzco the other community é hikes you this
for that Lord, and that leave to Inca aunquél Urco by as Lord, these gentlemen would deprive
Deste state to see it was something simple and that all was not it that capacity and be that Inca
Yupanqui, which everyone loved strong will, as we have heard.

É as the Inca Viracocha Urco wanted to leave in place after his days, at which might make him
the lords of the city of Cuzco and the other people that always respected that made him, and
yearns to serve and that will serve him with the lords of Cuzco the real insinias his person
were doing, they were, that before the parescia not none, lord it
was, nor any of his brothers, with shoes on their feet, but barefoot
and heads down the whole time they were talking in front of or to
fetch him some some message, he ate alone, no one dared to lay hands
on the silver chelated ate, brought in litter and shoulders of lords,
if came into the place, sat in the seat of gold had made tyrosol ostrich
feather dyed red, drank in golden vessels, and others were ansímismo
Service vessels of his house, gold, had many women, of all which was
very Ageno Inca Yupanqui, being, as you heard, hated by his father,
and have love to Inca Urco.

And so when he saw Inca Viracocha Inca Yupanqui had stayed in the city of Cuzco, dello rejoiced,
thinking that would end his days there, and when he sent him to ask for relief You heard, he
would not help.

É Inca Yupanqui away from their companions the night and history has told you, say he went
to do some part any of his seeing him, the space of two deep shots of the city, and that there
was in prayer to the Maker of all things, which they call Pachayachachic Viracocha, and Quest
in their prayer, which said it this way: "Lord God you made me be a man gave é, help me in
this need that I am, as you My Father, and you gave me together and being and as a man, do not
let me be killed by my enemies, please give me against them, do not let that I'm biased of them;
and as you love me made thee free and only subjective, I'm biased let this people who craves me
subjective and want to put in bondage, give me, Lord, Podell power to resist, and beam me thy
will, for I am yours. "É when [25] these reasons he said, crying all the decisions heart. É
being in his prayer, he fell asleep, being overcome sleep, and Questar
in your dream, came to him the figure of Viracocha in man, and he
said, "Son, do not grieve, I will send you, the day that thou art
to battle your enemies, people with that disrupt and stay victorious.

"

E Inca Yupanqui then recalled dream Deste serious and wanted amanescer hour, Deste as sleep
was gay, took courage, and went to his, and he told them were happy, because he was, and that
he had no fear that they would not be vanquished their enemies, Terni is the hobiese people
when necessary, and meant them no more, no other things to do, or how, or where, although they
questioned him. And there later, every night away from his teammates and went to the site
do their prayers had been done, he always continued to do nothing less than the first time
he did, and not for him every night the dream came the first.

But that night the latter end, Questar him in his prayer, that around him Viracocha in figure
man, and while awake, and he said, "Son, tomorrow I see us enemies to battle, and I will succor
to people, so that disruption and stay victorious. "And the next day morning, Uscovilca say down with
his people by Carminga [Carmenca] down, a hill standing on the lowered
to the city of Cuzco, going from the city of Los Reyes, and as descended
this Uscovilca with all his power and people, who peeked twenty squadrons
of people do not view or conosca by Inca Yupanqui and his own, which
people looked out the Collasuyo and the path of Asha, and by the way
Condesuyo, and how to get these people to do Inca Yupanqui was, which
was looking to his companions how he descended to his enemies, and
as he reached him that in his favor came, took him in the middle saying,
Apu Inca Capac aucaccata atipullac chaymiccanqui China (?) Punchaupi
[26], which says: "Come on, just king, and defeat your enemies, now
you on this day triples prisoners, "and can not wait they went to
the people who came Uscovilca all boil down hills, and finding, locked
his battle and fought from morning, which was when they got together,
up to half day, and was in such a way the battle, that people died
very large amount Uscovilca of people, and none was taken to hand
that would not die.
