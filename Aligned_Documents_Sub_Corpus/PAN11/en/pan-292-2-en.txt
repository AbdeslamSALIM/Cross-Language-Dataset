 In a magnificent chapel in the same church,
  is the marvelous painting of the Crucifixion, by Tintoretto:
  The Battle of Lepanto, for the same. In this chapel the altar of
  the Rosary, built immediately after the famous naval battle of
  Lepanto, is surrounded by tables and wonderful statues, the
  walls surrounding the altar are elegantly dressed admirable
  bas-reliefs with Torreti statues, was master of Canova,
  the three ships the temple are very high.
  

  Playing with the church is the Civil Hospital, fronted marble and
  cedar.

  
  The church of the Jesuits, on the other side of the Grand
  Canal, with rich facades of marble statues that support columns
  Corinthian: The floor of the interior, marble, the roof cool.
  Entering the first altar on the left, a picture inimitable
  the great Titian, representing the martyrdom of St. Lorenzo,
  a masterpiece, like everything that flowed from his inspired
  palette. The walls of the church, mosaic, and the pulpit carved
  in Greek marble, so graceful in execution staggering: close
  to the altar, to the left, a divine represents Tintoretto painting
  of Paradise: the presbytery has an inlaid marble floor, so masterfully
  done that it is necessary, indispensable, touch it with bare
  hands to persuaded that there is a carpet. The tabernacle is
  lapiz lazuli, on all sides there are statues of Sansovino, batteries
  holy water is made of marble from Egypt.

  
  
  Is it not seem ironic that so much art, so genius met? Are not museums,
  and wonderful museums, churches Venice?

  "It is certainly remarkable that in one church has everything I
  have noted briefly?

  
  Ah! nothing like Venice, its impression will last me forever, art
is there everywhere, and what art!

  How clever!
  
  And we only read the notes from my wallet, I saw everything, There
  is much more, is admirable.
  
  Traveling through my notes I see that there is still something to
  say about Health Church: in the sacristy, there are four tables
  Titian, the glory of art, one of which represents St. Mark: are
  in the same church a separate chapel Health dedicated to
  the Virgin, two elegant columns, statues marble, was built in 1670
after a harrowing epidemic, the Plague is here represented by an old,
excellent idea.

  In the whole temple is not nothing but marble, jasper precious Titian,
  Sansovino, the way the church is circular, superb cupola, pictures
  of Jordan.
  
  This disorder is the place to me, after having described Church Health
  at one of the previous pages, I reoccupied it, the reason is
  very simple, browsing the Travel Wallet I found new details: the
  transfer to This book, written hastily.

  With this method, the reader follows the same course, the very
  route that I followed in Venice: if two sites describe in one
  place, proving that I visited him twice.
  

  The Church of the Redeemer, located across the channel Giudecca,
  of Judea, is superb as all, and before I forget, let me refer
  to a scene slightly moved me to go and visit the church.
  
  It was on June 18 unless I am mistaken: there was a procession in
  fishing village, San Nicolas. I, on my arrival gondola at the foot
  of the Church of the Redeemer, a man asked that approached, as long
as the gondolas do play in the shore, I asked, I say, what was the
function to be held that day.

  The man to whom were addressed to me was a venerable old man,
  poorly covered with a threadbare suit.
  
  Upon hearing my question bowed his head, and after a silence Religious
  few minutes, I said with an accent excitedly "Formerly, in
  time of the republic, when I was a boy, holding a big party: all
  fishers dressed in their finery, came in procession to this church,
  there were many animation, very pleased, very happy: today ... there
is nothing, sir, silence and sadness ... the fatherland There ....Â»

  
  
  My character, eager to seek these emotions on all sides, my
  opinion in regard to the Austrians, the respectable old the Venetian
I had before me, his accent tender sense, all penetrated my soul,
everything I touched.

  
  
  Since there is nothing more sacred in my eyes the love of God,
  Family, Fatherland and Freedom, as I saw deeply saddened old man
  who had spoken, as I assumed that The idea would be painful
  to die, he, so old, leaving the country in the hands of tyrants,
  I wanted to comfort him, I wanted comfort to myself, heralding the
  coming emancipation of Venice heroic and dejected, I spoke
  with warmth, passion, according to my custom, according to my beliefs,
  and their enthusiasm never dead, awoke, and his face, folded
  by the time and suffering was prolonged cheering, and handed me
  one of his hands trembling I hastened to shake, and together
  we call support to Venice in Venice, and together we
  ask God to emancipated, and together they filed the heart, I so excited
as him
