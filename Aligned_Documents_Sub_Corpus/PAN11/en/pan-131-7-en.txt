 In sitting down the Indians, that all they
face the plaza, are the wives and daughters of the guests, each with a plate big mud, comes
and puts it under the table, at the foot of the father or husband, and retires slightly, remaining
standing in front of her husband, the entire duration of the meal, which will serve some Indians,
who bring each guest a plate full of good sized food, of eating a little or do you eat, and
then empties into the dish that has its feet, giving the empty plate, and bring it back full
of something else or the same, and does same with the first, and so continue until completion.
So that together on a plate All leftover meats few have served at the table, to dessert, if any,
together with the others. After they have finished, come and take women's plates leftovers and
take them home, where husbands are also, and together with their children or friends eat what
is left in the banquet.

Although magistrates have the same style when I came to these towns, they have banished entirely
in private, and treat that in these feasts and the patron saint Holder of the people have at
home, and do just as the Spanish. Within your house have the table well served and neat in
her women sit together with their husbands, and they behave soberly, and priests go home to
bless the magistrates the table.

A morning run in the square ring, giving the wearer awards, and at night are repeated dances and
wane.

Of these functions is done with more solemnity is the holy day of the holder pattern Village.
For her feature in the plaza at the entrance of the street that is opposite the door of the church,
a castle or scaffold made of high beams, which are frames and balconies, green branches, and
adorned with racks of linen draperies and painted, there placed in a shrine of the saint's image,
and before, at the foot of the altar, give way to fly the royal standard. Very early yesterday
morning, as are all lobbyists, military offices and other town employees dressed and saddled horses
to go out and get on the road to the governor, the lieutenant and the priests, administrators
and councils of other countries, invited to the party, have put spies on all roads, and warning
that someone comes out to a quarter of a mile to find it, there I salute welcome him and accompany
him to his lodging. In these submissions become the whole morning, using running time intervals
riding around the square, is the dominant passion of the Indians, who never cease to run all
three days of the function, and for this they have carefully reserved the horses that are
to serve those days, which they call the horses of the saint, and they serve only particular
tasks, but not in the daily service of rooms, so it is also desirable, as are in good condition
those horses when needed.

On the first councilman who is responsible is the use of real Lieutenant, to whose house the council
goes at noon, and accompany him to the council house, where he delivered logo real lieutenant,
a tall pole has a shield over the fist-sized silver hand, which are carved the royal arms. Real
Ensign accompanied by a little Indian which serves as a page, and takes the baton when he
wears the royal standard. For either peoples have dressed the same, with expensive embroidery
and braids, but, as they are the old cut and are not adjusted to their bodies, make them ridiculous.
The lieutenant takes real the royal standard and with all the accompanying leads and placed in
the castle, repeating many times: "Long live the King, Our Lord, Don Carlos III." From there
all go to the door of the church, and find the picture in the manner aforesaid, and then enter
the church, where the singing of the Magnificat, and withdraw, take her home to the royal standard
bearer.

In the afternoon, after given two ringing of bells to announce the run, is the town hall mounted
and accompanied by the royal officials and other attendees, a governor's house or lieutenant governor, along
for the ride out of the standard, where all managers attend Spanish and other competitors,
as well as the magistrates and councils of other peoples; and all are mounted from there to house
the royal standard bearer, which accompany and are to take the royal standard, and to receive
repeated the "Long live the King" to the sound of boxes, trumpets, bells and several shots of
Camaret, and arranged in good order, turning the square, walking ahead military officers on the
street with banners, pikes and other signs, playing and beating flags at intervals, and repeating
"Long live the King." Arrive at the door of the church, where they expect the priests to all
competing religious, who, after given water blessed sanctuary attached to the royal standard,
which receives the priest or the one is to celebrate Mass, and placed within the sanctuary,
next to the gospel in a foot wood, and they put real Ensign chair, rug and pillow, the same on the outside
of the sanctuary, in front of that occupied by the governor or lieutenant governor, and running
out the run, back to retire in the same way and, before giving back to the plaza, placed the royal
standard in place.

The next day we repeated the ride, and sing the Mass and Vespers the evening before, and noon real
reserves the banner, but the real picture remains discovered all the day, occupied in running
in the square, dancing, ring in the evening and other entertainment. In the same way that continues
the next day, which usually take some bulls Cut the blades to not hurt the fighters, which
are very clumsy and adventurous. In some representing peoples operas or comedies truncated
nights, but as representatives are Indians, and most of them boys, and do not understand what
they say and can not pronounce While the Castilian, are poorly understood
and have little grace these representations for Spanish and for them.

At noon join the tables in the square for the blessing in this way, regular pass this day twenty
tables which are arranged, and some rich people even reach percent, and all very rich meat,
cheaper for the people must spend this day at least 50 bulls, because
of the neighboring villages attends many people, and all provide food
in abundance.

In those days it was divided, while the dances, bull ring, and several trifles of who work in towns,
such as beads, cups, spoons, combs and canvas blade cotton, are also given, if there in the
store, needles, tape, knives and other trifles they believe a lot. Of this, some things are
given as a reward to those who dance or carry ring, and others were thrown in the catch, which
is what they have more fun, and together to catch them all, even the lobbyists, if something
falls to where they are sitting forget the formality with which they
are cast as children and to take what they can, although in the day
contain something.

Happy working all year just hoping that the party is done with grandeur; and if they want to
reduce something, they reply that they work just happy to spend that
day, and if yours are moderated despite the cost, it is recognized
hereinafter fainting in the application to work.

Although the custom in their distributions go to know the date and time of all are so used to not
do anything without it sent, to await the signal for all drum, or voice of the preacher or publisher,
and so all day we hear repeated touches and post boxes in the streets what they should do.
At dawn, after the bell makes signal under the drums and the streets are divided by some Indians,
who were loud stand up to say praise God, to get ready to go to church to hear mass, then the
work, and thus the will of God will be provided the support and please their higher. At all
hours of the day repeating the same diligence as they have to do,
the same to come to the rosary, however, that the bell tells them.

Though I noticed that in several hours of the night played the boxes, particularly the morning,
curiosity prompted me to ask what purpose were those touches, and I responded I always had this habit
of remembering all the people in a few hours of night, and that's why they were doing. Hastening
over this matter and its origin, I was told that the Jesuits, knowing the lazy genius of the Indians,
and, tired of working all day, then who came home and dined, they slept until the next day,
at dawn they were up to go to church and then to work, and not reached their wives husbands
long time, and decreased the population, and arranged so that in
some hours of the night, remember to comply with the obligation of
marriage.

Can not tell these people that the people causing noise on populations, each one at home has
been a profound silence, not join a conversation or a fun, even if they are offered together
to talk about, because they are lacking in species, nor have games to pass the idle time, even
the kids play and have fun in squares and streets, as befits his age do not hear songs in their
language, or in Castilian, and thus did not hear them singing in their tasks or jobs, as workers
tend relief work; sing nor Indian, nor even know them or they speak up. From kids raise them
so cramped that if they send for some, but I have to view, do not know raise your voice to
call, and go where it is and tell you there call, nor usually not allowed to touch them in their
homes guitars or other instrument, and less home having dances, on
the day are allowed, but with many limitations.

This is most notably the political and economic governance of these Indians, whose story can help build
comprehensive concept of who they are and the state in which they are.

Since I have told you what I found most peculiar to this province and its natural I argue it
will not be disagreeable to you, before going on to try other things, talked to you something of
the Indian nations infidels, confining to these peoples, as well as they may eventually increase the
province, and because their news may be fuller concept of all this, and what then intends for the purpose
of improvement. And ignoring the nation of the Guaicurus, previously disturbed people nearest
to Paraguay, because in the distant day is considered by the successful orders of the current
governor Mr. Don Pedro Melo de Portugal, which have established populations Ñembuá and taken other
measures, has subjected this nation, so that has not stopped even
the slightest fear of invasion in these villages, speak only of Guyana,
the Tupi, the Minuanes and Charrúas.

Under Guyana's nomination include these natives to many other nations, who have some relationship
to each other, and whose genius, customs and language differ little,
this is like the Guarani, and probably has the same origin, and, although
altered and disfigured with a different accent and pronunciation,
with little difficulty understanding the Indians of these towns.

The nation Guyana, together with other nations their peers, is quite large, living on either
side of the Parana, from about 20 miles from Corpus Christi to the Salto Grande Paraná and even
higher, ranging up to about Uruguay, Iguazu River, St. Antonio et al. Its natural docilísimo, and
so friendly with the Indians of these towns no news I have made the slightest damage to the frequent
trips that make yerba mate; rather help them to work, look and show the places where many trees
grass and even their assistance with food when they scarce, contenting
himself with some trifles they are given, such as beads, mirrors,
some girls and some axes cotton canvas.

These Indians live scattered in the mountains, feeding on the hunt, kill with arrows without
poison, not used or known to eat any bugs, but their main food is the honey from the mountains.
Also plant some fields, but not cultivated; what they do is pour the seed in some place, and while
they think will result and turn around and collect what they find, the seeds you have are: beans
of several species and some bear fruit all year until the cold consume
the plants, corn and pumpkins or pumpkins of various species, some
of exquisite taste.

Twelve miles from the town of Corpus, to the east, a small reduction Guyana nation, named San
Francisco de Paula, who is in charge of the Dominicans; and although many years ago it was founded,
or is increased, and there is hope to remain with fruit, for though
the Indians manifest inclination to be Christians, there are many
impediments that make it difficult to achieve the set them civil and
Christian life.

The number of Christians that make up this reduction is about 50, including young and old,
but they do not always assist in the reduction, therefore, accustomed to seeking their food
in the mountains, they come for them to ensure, where they try and talk with relatives and friends the infidels,
estándose with them many months, resulting which may not return to the reduction. Unbelievers also
frequent it often, particularly reduced when they eat, then filled the reduction of infidels,
and consuming what needs to retire, taking with them many of the
Christians, or fans treatment, or forced of necessity, go with them.

The site is located where the reduction is one of the greatest difficulties is to is increased,
the proximity and deal with their own will not let them forget their old ways and inclinations,
the little forest bare ground does not allow them to extend their farms, let alone raising
animals, since, besides the lack of land, so abundant mosquito flies
and gnats of various species, which may even have a horse for the
service of doctrinaire religious.

In October of last year, 1784, while the illustrious Don Fray Luis de Velasco, bishop of the city
of Paraguay, visited the people of his diocese, Corpus being in the Guiana Indians declined
to confirm Christians in that town. On this occasion had the opportunity this illustrious gentleman,
and had me talk to them, and particularly with the mayor, that although Guyana nation was born and raised
in the people of Corpus, and asking for the reasons that motivated seemed to him the little
overtaking of decline, said the shortness of their land and immediacy to the mountains, where
were necessary for food, along with not being accustomed to work, were the reasons for the
reduction distracted by the low, and the infidels, although all wanted to be Christians, seeing
that they had nothing to eat in the reduction, would not come to it, and only come around when
they know there to eat, and in turn consuming to the mountains, and only give them good land
elsewhere would be achieved increasing reduction. To which I said the bishop to speak to relatives
and friends and persuaded them to come out from the mountains, that the King would grant them
mercy land and how to survive in other places with the amenities of that seen in people, and
provide for their ministers that the doctrine and teaching the way of Heaven, and diligence
that brought to the execution after they returned to the reduction, and their I tell my result,
for me to participate to the bishop and his excellency Viceroy to the report had it convenient,
and although it stayed in, particularly the sheriff, so far nothing has resulted or will result
as I tell you.

In the time that the people of Candelaria was covered in my office, had prepared Indians those
frequent trips to the wild yerba mate, and among other things and mandated to be controllable
in this task was one which retains the best harmony with unbelievers, fans deal with them,
and always they had a chance Christians to lure them out of the mountains and, welcome everybody
to conveniences they had in their villages, and they were patents, see if they could persuade
some chiefs that, as a walk, come and see his people, and indeed one with wine two other Indians
with some of Candelaria, who entertained and gave a lot. And treating them the issue of conversion
and reduction, and they replied that they, like everyone else of those mountains, they wanted
to be Christians, but were there to teach them religious, because they could not get out, because
if they came to the villages had to die, and of this persuasion, that gave no reason, I could
not deter
