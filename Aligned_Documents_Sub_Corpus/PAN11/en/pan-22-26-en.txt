 I would drop dead of fright. Here we will be still, than it looks the danger
in it dies.

So that conversation ended, details of which I kept in my memory, despite the time elapsed. More
often happens that the facts too remote for our children, remain etched in the imagination more
intently than those witnessed in age mature, and if it prevails over
all powers of reason.

That night D. Marcial Alonso and continued lecturing in the few times that the suspicious Dona
Francisca leave them alone. When she went to the parish to attend the ninth, as the pious custom, the two
sailors breathed freely as busy school that lose sight of the teacher. Encerráronse in the office,
got some maps and were examining them with great care, then read some papers that had targeted
the names of many British ships with the number of its guns and crew and for their warm conference
that alternated with the strongest reading comments, I noticed that
devised the plan a naval battle.

Marcial imitated the gestures of his arm and half the teams progress, the explosion of the barrages,
with his head, the balance of the boats combatants with his body, falling the side of the ship
will sink, with her hand, raising and lowering of signal flags; with a slight hiss, the Boatswain's
command, with the blows of his club foot against the ground, the roar of cannon, with its slurred
language, oaths and unique voices combat, and as my master in this task with the utmost gravity,
I too take my room to spades, encouraged by example, and giving vent to that need natural eater
make noise that dominates the temperament of children with absolute rule. No poderme contain, seeing
the enthusiasm of the two sailors, I started pacing around the room therefore trust that was
treated by my master allowed me to do this, head shadowing arms and the provision of a vessel that
encircles the wind, while uttering, cupping voice, booming monosyllables that most resemble
the sound of a gun, such as Bum, bum, bum! ... My respected master, maimed sailor, as kids like me
at that time, did not stop lying about what I did, then fed them
seize their own thoughts.

How I laughed after recalling that scene, and how true it is, so far
my teammates in that game, the excitement of the old becomes the old
in children, renewing the antics of the cradle to the brink of the
grave!

They were very engaged in his lecture, when they heard the footsteps
of Dona Francisca returning from the ninth.

"What comes! - Marcial said with terror.

And the point kept the planes, concealing his excitement, and stood to talk about things indifferent.
But I, or because the young blood could not easily placated, either because not observe the
entry time of my mistress, kept in the middle of the room showing
my disposal with phrases such as these, uttered with the utmost self-confidence:
the starboard mura!

... Luffs! ... The barrage of lee! ... Fire! ... Bum, bum! ... She came to me angry, and without notice
me in the stern downloaded the barrage of her right hand with such good aim, I did see the stars.

"You
too! - Shouted mercilessly flogged -.

You see - he said looking at her husband with flashing Eyes -: you teach him to lose respect ...
Have you ever thought you were still in Caleta piece of rascal?

The beating continued as follows: I walk into the kitchen, crying and ashamed after lowered the flag
of my dignity, and without thinking about defending against an enemy
so superior; Dona Francisca behind hunting and giving me testing my
neck with repeated blows of your hand.

In the kitchen, threw the anchor, tearful, considering how bad my
fight was over naval.

-V-

To oppose the mindless determination of
her husband, Dona Francisca was not based only in the above reasons,
had, in addition to those, another powerful, not indicated in the
previous dialogue, perhaps too well known.

But the reader does not know and I'll decírsela.

I have written my master had a daughter. Now, this daughter was named Rosita, age slightly higher
than mine, as I just moved from fifteen years, and had arranged her marriage to a young artillery
officer named Malespina, a family of Medina, distantly related to that of my mistress. He had wedding
set for the end of October, and already understand that the absence of the father of the bride
objection would have been as solemn days.

I will say something about my girl, her boyfriend, their loves, their proposed link y. .. Alas,
Here are my memories take a melancholy tint, evoking images in my fantasy importunate and
alien as if from another world, waking up tired in my chest sensations, indeed, I do not know
if my spirit bring joy or sorrow. These burning memories that seem to wither away in my brain
today, as tropical flowers transplanted frozen north, sometimes make me laugh, and sometimes make
me think ... But let that the reader gets tired of annoying reflections on what a single mortal
care.

Rosita was very pretty. I remember vividly her beauty, though I would be very difficult to describe
his features. It seems I see before me smile. The singular expression on his face, that of any
other similar, for me, for the clarity with which it offered to my understanding, one of these
primitive notions, it seems we have brought from another world, or we have been infused mysterious
power from the cradle. And yet, no answer for being able to paint, because what was real as an
idea has become uncertain in my head, and nothing fascinates us Thus, just as nothing escapes
so subtly to any assessment specification as an ideal wanted.

Upon entering the house, I thought that Rosie belonged to a higher order of creatures. Explain my
thoughts so that you admire my simplicity. As children, and a new be coming into the world in
our home, older people tell us that you have brought from France, Paris or England. Deceived
myself and everyone about this unique way of perpetuating species, believed that the children
came to order, packaged in a drawer, like a bundle of hardware. Well, looking first to the daughter
of my masters, so reasoned that beautiful person could not have come from the factory where we
all come, ie Paris or England, and was persuaded of the existence
of an enchanting region, where architects divine styling knew so beautiful
specimens of the human person.

As children both, though in a different condition, soon we are dealing with self-confidence of age,
and my greatest joy was to play with her, suffering all their impertinence, that was great,
because our games are never confused classes: she was always miss,
and I always brought up so I had the worst, and if he blows it is
not necessary indicate here who received them.

Go get to leave school to accompany her home, was my golden dream, and when for any unforeseen
occupation was responsible for another person so sweet commission, my punishment was so profound
that I equated to the increased penalties that can go in life, being man, and said: "It is impossible
that when I grow up experiencing major disgrace." Upload his orders to the orange of the courtyard
to catch the blossoms of the highest branches, was to me the greatest delight, position or
prominence than that of the best king of the land uploaded on his
throne of gold, and I do not remember me joy comparable to that caused
by forcing to run after her in that divine and immortal game called.

If she ran like a gazelle, I flew like a bird to catch it soon, taking her on the side of his
body that was at hand. When the parts were reversed when she was the pursuer and I was for
being caught, they doubled the innocent pure and sublime delights of this game, and more dark and ugly
place, where I Shrunk and breathing, waiting for the printing of their eager hands shake, it
was for me a real paradise.

Add that never, during those scenes, I had a thought, a feeling that not emanating from the more
refined idealism.

And what I say about her singing? As a child I used to sing olé and reeds, with expertise of nightingales,
they know everything in music without having learned anything. All you praised that ability, and formed
a circle to hear, but I was offended applause of his admirers, and wished to silence others. That
song was a gurgle melancholy, even your child's voice modulated. The note, which impacted on
itself entangled and unraveling like a thread of sound, was lost up and faded away to return descending
with timbre. Emitted by a bird appeared, the first dating back to Sky, and then sing our own
ear. The soul, if I may use a simile vulgar, seemed to be lengthened following the sound, and then
shrank back to him, but always mindful of melody and music combining the beautiful singer.
Singular was the fact that for me to hear her sing, especially in
the presence of others, was almost a mortification.

We had the same age, more or less, as I said, it only exceeded mine yours in about eight or nine
months. But I was little and stunted, as she developed with great vigor, and thus, upon the expiration
of three years of my residence in the house, she seemed much older than me. These three years
have passed without suspicion us that we grew, and our games are
not interrupted, as she was more mischievous than I, and her mother
scolded her, trying to fix it and make it work.

After three years I noticed that the forms of my adored Miss widened and rounded, completing the beauty
of her body: her face was more on, fuller, warmer; her large eyes brighter, although the look less
erratic and volatile, his pace more leisurely; their movements do not know if more or less
light, but certainly different, but could not then nor I can now appreciate what the difference.
But none of these accidents me confused as well as the transformation of his voice, which gained
some serious sound good different from that mischievous and joyful squeal with calling me before,
turn the trial, and making me forget about my chores, to attend the
game.

The rose bud became and cocoon.

One fateful day a thousand times, thousand times gloomy, my mistress was presented to me in
a suit under. That transfiguration wrought in me such an impression that the whole day did not
speak a word. Was seriously as a man who has been cruelly deceived, and my anger against him was so great
in my soliloquies proved strong reasons that the rapid growth of my mistress was a felony. He woke
me fever reasoning, and on that controversial issue passionately myself in the silence of
my sleepless nights. What I was stunned to see that with a few yards of cloth had completely
changed its character. That day, a thousand times unhappy, I ceremonious tone spoke, commanding
me gravely and even disdain the tasks that unless I liked, and she, who so often was aiding and abetting
my laziness, then scolded me lazy. And all these, no smile, no jumping, or cute, not a fast race,
not a bit of olé, and hide from me for the look, or pretend angry
to laugh then even a disputilla, not even a slap with her soft little
hand!

Terrible crisis of existence! She had become a woman, and I remained child!

Needless to say, gone are the frolic and play, and I did not go to orange, whose blossoms grew
quiet, free from my girlfriend rapacity, developed with vigor leaves and luxuriously his provocative
fragrance, and did not run over the yard, nor did more trips to the school to bring her home,
so proud of my commission would have defended against an army, had it tried to take it. Since
then walked with Rosita the utmost caution and seriousness, several times I noticed a stairway
before me, careful not to show a single line one inch above your ankle beautiful, and this system
of fraudulent concealment was an affront to the dignity of one whose
eyes had seen somewhat higher.

Now I laugh considering how broke my heart with those things.

But had yet to occur more miserable. One year after its transformation, Aunt Martina Rosario cook,
Marcial and other characters of the easement, it occupied a certain day serious matter. Diligently
applying my ear, then I learned that there were rumors alarming Miss
was going to marry.

The thing was unheard of, because I did not know any boyfriend. But then I arranged all the
parents, and the strange thing is that sometimes went too bad.

As a young man of great family asked for her hand, and my masters on him. This young wine home
with his parents, who were a sort of counts and marquis, with a title booming. The claimant brought
his Navy uniform, in which served honorable body, but despite such elegant trappings, its
facade was very unpleasant. So it must have seemed to my mistress, it showed early on that
wedding disgust.

His mother tried to persuade her but in vain, and made him the most complete picture of the
good qualities of the groom, of high lineage and great wealth. The girl was not convinced, and
others opposed these reasons very strings.

But the main thing was silent rogue, and the main thing was that she had another boyfriend, whom the
truly loved. The other was an artillery officer, called, very good looks and gentle Fig. My mistress
had known him in the church, and the treacherous love over her, while prayed, because the temple
was always very suitable place for his poetic and mysterious enclosure
to open wide the doors to love the soul.

Malespina haunted house, which saw I several times, and much talked about in Vejer of these
loves, the other knew, and challenged. My master knew all when the news came home that had
mortally wounded Malespina rival.

The scandal was big. The piety of my masters are shocked both this fact, who could not conceal
his anger and Rosita was the main victim.

But it was months and more months, the wounded healed, and as Malespina was also a person of birth
and rich, were noted in the political atmosphere of the house that the young inklings D. Rafael
was going to enter it. Resigned to link parents of the injured, and instead presented the winner's
home to ask for his son the hand of my dear mistress. After some delay, it is granted.

I remember when I was there. He was a man very dry and straight, with thirty sucks colors many
flaps on the clock, large queues, and a long nose and sharp, with which he seemed sniff out people
who supported the conversation.

He talked a blue streak and kept get a word to the others, he said it all, and could not praise
anything, because the point out saying he had something better. Since then I crossed out and
mentirosísimo vain man, as I was able to see clearly later. My masters received him with open
arms, as that her son, that he was coming. Since then, the boyfriend continued to going home every
day alone or in company with his father.

Further processing of my mistress. His indifference to me was so marked that touched the limits
of contempt.

Then I could see clearly for the first time, cursing the humility of my condition, trying to
explain the right they had the superiority of really were superior, and I wondered, in anguish,
if it was fair for others to be nobles and wealthy and wise, while I was on the Creek ancestry,
for my person only wealth, and could barely read. Displaying the reward was my ardent love,
I realized that nothing could suck in the world, and only later acquired the firm conviction that
a large constant effort of mine I would perhaps everything that did not possess.

In view of the indifference with which she treated me, I lost confidence,
I do not dare to deploy lips in his presence, and filled me with more
respect than their parents.

Meanwhile I attentively observed the signs of love that dominated. When he took, I saw anxious
and sad at the slightest sound to indicate the approximation of one, was turned on its beautiful face
and her dark eyes shone with anxiety and hope. If he came at last he could not hide her joy,
and then were talking hours and hours, always in the presence of Dona Francisca, because my teacher
was not consented to talks alone or in bars.

There were also long correspondence, and the worst part is that I was mailing two lovers. That gave
me a rage ...! Under the slogan, I went to the plaza, and there was, more timely than a watch,
the Master Malespina, which gave me a note to deliver it my lady. Fulfilled my order, and she gave
me another to carry it. How often felt temptation to burn the letters, not to get your fate!
But my luck, I serenity to dominate so ugly purpose.

Needless to say, I hated Malespina.

Since he looked into my blood was inflamed, and if I ordered something, doeth the worst possible
way, meaning you willing my high anger. This detachment that they
thought bad parenting and me a burst of courage, elevated own hearts,
gave me some reprimands and, above all, gave rise a phrase from my
teacher, who stabbed me in the heart as a painful thorn. In some occasion
I heard him say:

"This kid is so spoiled, you will need to send him
away."

At length the day fixed for the wedding, and pointed out a
few before and told her what happened and my master's project
