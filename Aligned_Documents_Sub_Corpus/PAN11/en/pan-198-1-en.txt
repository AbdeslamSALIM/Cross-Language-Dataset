 And what was the poor deteriorated Pepeta!

...

A booming voice came down like thunder tomboy through the gap in the ladder.

- Elisa! ... Upload milk soon.

The Lord is waiting.

Rosario began to laugh herself. Now called Elisa: Do not you know? Age requirement rename office
and speak with an Andalusian accent.

And mimicked with rustic grace the voice of the invisible tomboy.

But in spite of his joy, was quick to withdraw. He feared the above.

The booming voice or The Lord of the milk could give something bad for his delay. He climbed the
ladder faster, After much to recommend Pepeta that ever pass through there, to remember together
the things from the garden.

The weary bell rang de la Rocha over an hour through the streets of Valencia. Released the withered
teats to milk the last drop of tasteless product of a poor grass
leaves cabbage and waste, and finally undertook Pepeta back to his
hut.

The poor peasant walking sad and pensive under the impression that meeting. Remembered like it was
the day before the terrible tragedy that engulfed the Barret with whole family.

Since then, the fields over a hundred years ago the ancestors of the
poor working labrador had been left by the wayside.

His cabin, deserted, without a hand merciful to cast a patch to the roof and a handful of mud
cracks walls, was sinking slowly.

Ten years of continuous flow together had managed to ruin that people do not take notice already
on it. Pepeta it had long had not stopped his attention to the old shack. This interest only
to the boys, who, inheriting the hatred of his parents, he plunged into between the nettles
of the barren fields to mow the abandoned house with stones, breaking the timbers of its closed door,
or blind with dirt and stones that opened well under a very old vines.

But this morning, Pepeta, influenced by his recent encounter, he noticed debris and to stopped
on the way for a better view.

The Barret fields, or rather for her, "the Jew and his unholy Don Salvador heirs "were a blur
of misery amid the fertile garden, worked and smiling. Ten years of neglect had hardened the
ground, drawing from its neglected innards all parasitic plants, all the thorns which God has created
for the punishment of the farmer. A dwarf jungle, tangled and misshapen spread over those fields,
with a wave of foreign shades of green, tinged here and there by
mysterious and rare flowers, the kind that only arise in the ruins
and cemeteries.

Under the foliage of the jungle tiny and encouraged by the safety of his lair, grew and multiplied
all sorts of nasty, spilling into neighboring fields: Rough-backed green lizards, giant beetles
with metallic shimmer shell, spiders short-legged and hairy, even snakes that glide immediate
ditches. There living in the heart of the beautiful and neat plain, forming separate world, devouring
one to others, and even cause harm to the neighbors, they were respected with a certain reverence,
for the seven plagues of Egypt seemed little to those of the garden to throw on those lands are
cursed.

As Barret lands would never be for men, were nesting in them bicharraco
disgusting, and the more the merrier.

In the middle of these desolate fields, which stood out on the beautiful
plain as a stain of dirt in a regal cloak of green velvet, rose the
cabin, or rather this, falling, with straw cap of gutted, teaching
through the openings pierced the wind rain and its rotten wooden ribbing.

The walls, scratched by water, showed their raw clay bricks, no more than a very slight white
spots that exposed the former whitewashed. The door was broken underneath, gnawed by rats, with
cracks that cut from one extreme to another. Two or three windows, completely open and martyred by gales,
hung from one hinge, and were to fall at any moment, just blow a rude gust of wind.

Sorry to ruin that mood, squeezing the heart. It seemed that the left were CASUCO to shut out
ghosts in the night, who were inside screaming to people from murdered, that the whole bush was
hiding under a shroud of it hundreds of corpses.

Horrific images was what inspired the contemplation of these abandoned fields, and highlighted
even more dismal misery when contrasted with the lands near, red, well maintained, correct full
of rows of vegetables and seedlings, to which was the autumn leaves
transparency caramel.

Even the birds fled from the fields of death, perhaps for fear of
the animaluchos that rebullían under brush or by sniffing the breath
of misfortune.

On the broken thatch, if anything could see was the fluttering of
black wings and treacherous funeral feathers of crows and kites, which
were shaken mute the laden trees of joyful and playful fluttering
PIID, remaining silent the garden, as if there were sparrows half-mile
radius.

Pepeta going to move forward, toward his white farmhouse, which peeked through the trees some fields
beyond, but had to lie still on the high side of the road, that he
should a cart loaded advancing stumbling and seemed to come from the
city.

Her feminine curiosity was excited to notice him.

He was a poor farm cart drawn by a bony old nag, which helped in hard bumps a tall man who was
walking next to him encouraging him with shouts and pops whiplash.

Labrador dressed, but how to wear the scarf round his head, his pants corduroy and other details
of his suit, which was not betrayed in the garden, where personal adornment has gradually been
contaminated by the taste of the city. Was a farmer in some remote village: kidney may come
from the province.

On the car amontonábanse, forming pyramid to higher than the poles, all kinds domestic objects.
Was the emigration of an entire family.

Consumptive mattresses, straw mattresses scandalous stuffed corn husk, esparto chairs, pans,
kettles, plates, baskets, bed green benches, all piled on the car, dirty, worn out, miserable,
smelling famine, to escape desperate, as if the march unfortunately
after nipping family heels.

At the top of this mess three children could be seen hugging, which provided the fields with
wide eyes, as explorers visiting a country for the first time.

On foot and behind the cart as watching for anything out of it fell, a woman and a marching girl,
tall, slim, slim, it seemed daughter. On the other side of the horse, helping when the vehicle
is stopped in a bad way, was a boy of eleven years.

Its exterior betrayed serious child, accustomed to struggle with poverty, is a man at the age others
play. A dirty little dog panting up the rear.

Pepeta, supported on the back of his cow, they looked forward, ever possessed the most curiosity.
"Where would these poor people?

The way that, tributary to Alboraya not going anywhere. Extinguished in the distance, and exhausted
by the myriad branching paths and trails that gave entrance to the barracks.

But his curiosity had an unexpected ending. Jesus!

The car left the road, crossing the dilapidated bridge of logs and earth which gave access to
the cursed land, and is got by Barret fields, flattening their tires
brush respected.

The family remained behind, saying with gestures and words confusing
the impression that caused him misery, but straight at the wrecked
cabin, and who takes possession of what is yours.

Pepeta not want to see more. Now I really ran to his hut. Anxious to arrive before left to the
cow and calf, and the two beasts continued their march calmly, as who does not care about things
outside the barn and has insurance.

Pimento was lying on one side of his hut, smoking lazily, staring at three sticks smeared with lime,
put in the sun, around which fluttered some birds.

Occupation was a master.

Upon seeing his wife come to the astonished eyes and poor chest heaving, Pimento changed positions
to hear better, recommending that does not approach the wands.

Let's see, what was that? Have you had stolen the cow? ...

Pepeta, with emotion and fatigue, could barely say two words together.

"The land of Barret .... An entire family .... Iban to work, to live
in the barracks. She I had seen.

"

Pimento, bird hunter with league foe of labor and terror of the contoured, could not impassive
gravity retain great man at such unexpected news.

- Recontracordóns! ...

Got a jump straight weighed and human muscles, and began to run without waiting for further explanation.

His
wife saw how he ran cross country to a bluff to the lands immediately cursed. There he knelt,
lay on his stomach to peer through the reeds like a Bedouin lurking, and after a few minutes
he returned to run, lost in this labyrinth of paths, each of which
led to a hut, to a field where men hunched by shone his hoe like a
flash of steel.

The garden was still smiling and murmuring, imbued with light and whispers, dormant under the
waterfall golden morning sun.

But voices sounded in the distance and appeals: the news was transmitted to belt out a field to
another field, and a shudder of alarm, surprise, indignation, ran through the whole plain, as if they
had spent centuries and circulate a notice that the beach had appeared an Algerian galley looking
white meat shipment.

II

When harvest time Barret watched the pictures of different crops that their lands were divided, could
not contain a sense of pride, and looking at the high wheat, cabbage-heart with his curly blonde,
green melon poking back to flower ground peppers and tomatoes, or half hidden by foliage, praised
the goodness of their fields and the efforts of all his predecessors
to work better than the rest of the garden.

All the blood of their grandparents was there. Five or six generations had passed Barrets their lives
tilling the same soil, turning upside down, medicine her womb with
burning manure, taking care that no decrease in their vital juice,
brushing and combing with the hoe and gate all those lumps, of which
there was not one that was not watered with the sweat and blood of
the family.

Many wanted the farmer to his wife, and even forgave him the folly
of having given four daughters and no sons to help him in his task,
not least he loved the four girls, one angels of God, who spent the
day singing and sewing at the door of the hut, and some Sometimes
they got into the fields to rest a little to his poor father, but
the supreme passion Uncle Barrett, the love of his love, were those
lands on which had passed monotonous and quiet of your family history.

Many years ago, many - in time the old Tomba, a nearly blind old man who kept the poor herd of a
butcher Alboraya, he traveled, heading del Fraile, shooting blunderbuss
against the French - these lands were among the religious of San Miguel
Kings, good gentlemen, fat, glossy, earthy, showing no big hurry in
the collection of rent, it being satisfied that afternoon, passing
through the cabin, I received the grandmother, who was then a real
girl, presenting us with deep gourds of chocolate and offerings of
fruit.

Before, long before, had been the owner of all that a great lord, who deposited their sins by dying
and farms within community, and now, alas! belonging to Don Salvador,
an old man in Valencia, which was the torment Uncle Barret, for even
in dreams appeared to him.

The poor farmer hid his troubles to his own family. He was a brave man, customs pure. On Sundays,
if I was a little tavern at the Copa, where he met all the people of contour, was to look to trick
players, to laugh like a blessed listening to the nonsense Pimento and other brutalities that were
acting cocky guys went from the garden, but never approached the counter to pay for a glass.
He always carried a pocket of his tight band on the stomach, and if he drank, was when one
of the greedy invited to all present.

Enemy to communicate their troubles, he was always seen smiling, good-natured, calm, taking pulled
down over his ears blue cap that justified his nickname.

I worked at night to night, when the whole garden was asleep, as he
was, to the uncertain clarity dawn, scratching their land, increasingly
convinced that he could with them.

It was too much for one man. If only I had a son ... Seeking help took servants who robbed him working
little and finally said goodbye to surprise sleeping in the barn in the sunshine.

Influenced by the respect to his ancestors, wanted burst of fatigue
on their lumps before to agree that some of them were transferred
on lease to foreign hands.

And not being able to with all the work, left unproductive and fallow half its fertile land,
claiming with the culture of the other supporting the family and pay the master.

This effort was a silent struggle, desperate, stubborn, against the
needs of life and against their own weakness.

Had but one wish: that the girls ignore their concerns, that nobody would account at the home of
the hardships and sorrows of the father not to disturb the holy joy that house, busy at all
hours by the laughter and songs of the four sisters, aged only one
year differed.

And while they, who were beginning to attract attention of the young men of the garden, attended
with new silk scarves, colorful, and ironed and noisy skirts to the feasts of the little towns,
or waking at dawn to go barefoot and shirt to look through the cracks in the wicket who were
singing them albaes [2] or presented with strumming the guitar, the poor guy Barret, increasingly
engaged in leveling its budget, drew, ounce after ounce whole bunch
of gold amassed farthing farthing on it his father had left him, shutting
and Don Salvador, old miser who never had enough, Not content with
squeezing, talking about how bad were the times, the scandalous increase
contributions and the need to raise the price of the lease.

[2] dawns.

Barrett could not have found worse master.

Enjoyed throughout the garden a nasty reputation because rare was the game where it had no land. Every
afternoon, wrapped in an old layer, which had until spring, looking squalid beggar, and accompanied
by curses and hostile gestures that left his back, was visiting the paths to the settlers. Was
the tenacity of the miser who wants to be in contact at all hours
with their properties, stickiness the usurer who always has to settle
outstanding accounts.

The dogs barked at him from afar, as death approaches, the children looked at him sulky, the
men were hiding to avoid painful excuses and the women came to the
door of the cabin with their eyes on the floor and lie on the point
to pray to Don Salvador to be patient, answering with tears and threats
to his snorts.

Pimento, who as the bully was interested in the misfortunes of his
neighbors and was the knight errant of the garden, promised to mumble
something like hitting a beating and cool off in a ditch, but the
very victims of greedy deterred him talking the importance of Don
Salvador, a man who spent his mornings in the courts and had friends
of many bells.

With people like the poor always lose.

In all of its settlers, the best was Barret: although at the expense of great efforts, all he
owed.

And the old man, who cited as a model to other tenants, when in front of him extreme cruelty,
was more demanding, excited by the gentleness of the farmer, glad to find a man who could satisfy
his instincts without fear of oppression and prey.

Increased, finally, the rental price of land. Barrett testified, and even cried recalling the
merits of his family who had lost his skin in those areas to of them the best in the garden.
But Don Salvador was adamant.

Were they the best? ... Should therefore pay more. And Barret paid the increase. The blood
would give him rather than abandon these land which gradually absorbed his life.

Had no money to bail out and only had what they produced in the fields.

And completely only, hiding the family's situation, having to smile when he was between his wife
and their daughters, who recommended he not tried so hard, gave poor
Barret to the most absurd folly of work.

Lost sleep. It seemed that their vegetables were growing less rapidly
than those of neighbors he just wanted to cultivate all the land,
worked at night to grope, the lower cloud of hail made him beside
himself, trembling with fear, and him, so kind, so honest, even advantage
of the carelessness of the farmers adjacent to steal some of irrigation.

If
your family was blind, in the slums surrounding the situation well
guessed Barrett pitying his meekness. It was a good fellow, did not
know "stand up" to the nasty miser and he was going to devour it slowly
sucking in full.

And so it was. The poor farmer, burdened by a life
of fever and dementia laborious stayed bones, bent like an octogenarian,
his eyes sunken. One characteristic hat justifying his nickname and
did not stop his ears, taking advantage of the growing thin, down
to the shoulders as a memorial apagaluz of its existence.

The worst
thing for him was that this unsustainable overtiredness only allowed
to pay half the insatiable ogre. The consequences of their folly by
the work did not wait. The Barret hack of an animal suffering that
followed in its desperate efforts tired of working day and night,
to go pulling the cart to load Valencia Market vegetables, and then
no time to breathe or headbands, be coupled to plow, took the game
to die rather than allow the slightest attempt at rebellion against
poor master.

So yes that was considered lost irretrievably poor farmer!
In desperation looked at their fields, who could no longer grow, the
rows of fresh vegetables, people city ??consumed with indifference,
not knowing the anguish that their production does to suffer a poor
father ongoing battle with the land and misery.

But Providence, which
never abandons the poor, spoke by the mouth of Don Salvador. For something
say that God often brings good from evil.

The mean unbearable, the
greedy moneylender, knowing his misfortune offered to help with a
kindness paternal and moving. What needed to buy another beast
