 Son, it must be something in life: one believes that a poor, women, nine children, two and
three sisters-in-law, two mothers in law, yes sir, mother and grandmother of my wife and if
one does not contrive to keep this FAMILION ... The truth is that everyone di cordelejo: D. Mauro,
the fool of John of God, and yourself, now resurrected to ask me to Agnes. "But you love her?
Anda, zanguango, cortéjala, to see if you can marry her, which, although difficult, not impossible
..., the girl will have a regular feat, and you could inherit primogeniture and the title, which
will, according to the tenor of the scriptures ... Ah, ragamuffin! I it seems that you bring
a little project between the eyes. Are you going to Cordoba? Hey I remember that I called
up, crying dove very tender, half-dead when the driving in the litter my intern and me. Ja,
ja, ja! Do you know what I laugh? That goose Juan de Dios, which was here the other day, and
kneeling before me, I said, 'Give me Agnes, because I'm dying without it! Give it to me you kill
me today and tomorrow! "It was a comedy, Gabriel, and although we laughed a lot, so we finally got
tired, we had to throw a stick in the clerkship.

I lent sustained attention to these and many other reasons the lawyer Lobo, which, for that
nothing was missing in his inexplicable kindness and courtesy, at the time said to me goodbye
that perhaps could give me some lessons in Latin, if I was in the mood, as it was so great humanist,
to earn his bread by teaching. Tell him thank you, and so satisfied I retired from the results of
my research, that same day when I decided to go to Cordoba was restored.

I still you, and, tired of these adventures, they will leave it to run only in resolving issues more
interested than anyone else that this writer? No, I hope not so we part untimely, and when
it appears likely that, following me, you attended a show that make them more bearable annoyance
of my personal stories. We, therefore, and take account with us, Mr. de Santorcaz, who lead
the country Andalusian family matters. I told him that wanted to take me as a squire, but he said
he had no money to pay my services, because their stock was not available to meet expenses of
servitude and would welcome take sick as a companion and friend. That was, in effect, and as
I needed a few days of recovery, he waited for me, and one of the last days May or early June,
after I left my obsequious guards, accounting as I could, and John of God, who hid the object
of my expedition, we set off.

VI

As Santorcaz was poor, and I still poorer, our trip was so irregular,
which that we described in old novels.

We do not take any classes systematically in uncomfortable vehicles known in our Spain, on
several occasions walked in galley male others, if they offered us their horses the carriers
who become the Stain vacuum, and more often on foot. We did night in inns and hostelries of
the road where Santorcaz wearing his prodigious skill at not spending, always managing to serve
him well. To these and other mischief, my friend posing as a famous character, sending me that Excellence
and call him before I discovered him whenever we looked at the innkeeper. I met promptly and
with such artifice, more than once, in addition to not paying anything, leaving to say goodbye
humbly begging dispense them bad service.

Beyond Noble and Villarrubia de Santiago, and when after a long day
sesteábamos, sections of the road, next to the chapel of the Holy
Child, we added a waiter told us bore the same way that we and since
then was our constant companion.

Was about twenty years, was called Andresillo Marijuán, and although a native of Aragon, was to serve
muleteer a town of Andalusia, home of the Countess of Rumble, his mistress and lady, since
it owned farms in the land of Almunia de Doña Godina was born the young man. At once frank and
cheerful genius sympathized with me and we became close friends. Santorcaz treated us superior,
but without tyranny. When arriving at an inn riding him in evil male and we walk, we were going
to hold the stirrup and then remove spurs, bursting into compliments and courtesies, we had to
grit their teeth for not release the laughter. Marijuán, what better than to pretend I knew, was
in charge of directing the landlord to give him the best master of the pantry, because His
Excellency, who was Regent Seville, was a man fiercely punished terrible and the innkeepers that served
him well.

So we crossed the Channel, sad and lonely country, where the sun is in his kingdom and man seems
to work exclusively from sun and dust; country among all known since
the world hase used to assume the immensity of the plains traversed
by the horse D. Quixote.

In general opinion is the ugliest Mancha and the least picturesque of all the lands known and
the traveler who comes today from the East Coast or Andalusia, was bored with the wicket the
car, eager to end soon that bare steppe, which as still and stagnant sea ??of ??land, offers no accident
eyes, no surprise, nor variety, nor any pleasure. This is true: the English Channel, if you have
beauty, is the whole beauty of its own bareness and monotony, which, if not distracting or suspended
imagination, freeing up, giving space and light where rush without mishap. The greatness of the
thought of D. Quixote not only understand the greatness of La Mancha. In a mountainous country,
cool, green town of welcome shade, with beautiful homes, flower gardens, warm light and thick
atmosphere, D. Quixote could not have existed and would have died in bloom, after the first ride,
no surprise the world with the great deeds of the latter.

Don Quijote needed that horizon, that land without roads, which, however, all of it is the
way, that land without directions, because of it goes anywhere, without going determinedly any, land
crossed by the paths of chance, adventure, and where everything pareer
must pass charges of chance or of the geniuses of the fable that needed
sun melts the brain and makes the sane crazy, that endless field where
stands imaginary battles powder, producing the transparency of light,
visions of armies of giants, towers, castles, cities need this shortage
that makes it rare and the presence of an extraordinary man or an
animal need silence when There are quiet, and this prodigious roar
when storm winds; quiet and noise are equally saddened and extend
their sadness to everything that happens, so if you are a human being
in the wilderness, to the point he is a creep, a distressed a beggar,
a grievant who is looking for protection against the oppressors and
tyrants; needed, again, this total absence of human works representing
positivism practical sense, limits to the imagination, which would
stop its senseless flight needed, in short, that man does not put
more samples in those fields of industry and his science that patriarchal
windmills, to which only the missing language to be colossal, restless
and furious, which from a distance call and scare the traveler threatening
gestures.

VII

This is the English Channel. While crossing could not help remembering D. Quixote, whose reading
was fresh in my mind. During our days we were bored enough, except when Santorcaz We had some extraordinary
event that was witnessed in distant lands. A Once we left with an open mouth telling the feast
of the coronation of Bonaparte, with all their hair and signs, and again we put the hair on
end talking the most famous battle of the many that had been found. When we had men in two
males who provided little money for some carriers of Villarta, and I'm not sure if we pierced
and the term of Puerto Lápiche or were going into it. I do remember is that to escape the
heat we started our journey long before sunrise, and night was hazy, the sky overcast and gloomy,
damp earth the strong storm water to unload the previous day.

I should point out the landscape before us, because unless the picturesque relationship Santorcaz,
it helped to impress my senses. The road was straight to us left elevábanse a gently rolling hills
which were lost in the dilated forming horizon bends at the bottom and far away you could
see a hill higher on the skirt of which seemed to distinguish the
houses of a village on the right soil lay completely flat, and the
immense power crust and takes a stream and rainwater were many small
pools, the surfaces, illuminated by the moon, offered for the misleading
perspective view of a large swamp or marsh.

I have spoken of the moon, and I must add that this star, disfiguring
of the things of earth, paid imposing solemnity bare and lonely landscape,
leaving a dark clarified alternatively, depending on whether or not
gave way to his pale rays the gaps, tears and acribilladuras clouds.

Santorcaz, after a moment of silence and meditation, held his horse, he stood in the middle
the road, and gazing with a rapture the distant horizon, the hills on the left and puddles on the
right, spoke thus:

- I'm amazed, because I've never seen two things that seem so much like this country to another
far away where I was three years ago at this same time, in the early hours of 2 December. Is
it my imagination that I reproduce the forms of that famous place, or miraculous art we are in
it? Gabriel, is not there right in front and a large swamps? Can not see the ending left a few hills
at the top with a small wood?

Do not be raised before a hill in a village whose skirt whitening? And those towers distinguish
the other side of the hill, are not those of the castle of Austerlitz?

Marijuán and I laughed, saying that he put off such things, and if well as the pools were true,
there was no castle Terlin or anything. Then he placed the horse to step and sending us to
follow him on either side, went on as follows:

- Guys, I can not forget that famous day, we call the Three Emperors, and that is certainly the
bloodiest, the most glorious, most business with which he illustrated his name the great tyrant,
godlike man, whom I can now appoint a mouthful, because we do not hear more than heaven and
earth. Let me tell you guys, that ye may know what is the hatchet in the hands of the woodcutter
in Europe.

I was in Paris without resources, after being on Latin teacher, a painter of signs, Ventadour showgirl,
Swordsman, server émigré Coblentz, postilion prosecuted, saithe and typesetter printing, when enlisted
in the army of Boulogne, intended to give a coup de main against
England ... When the Emperor moved us suddenly, without revealing
his thoughts, the heart of Europe, were somewhat piqued because the
violent marches mortified us much, and as we were dunces, we did not
understand the plans of our boss.

But After the capitulation of Ulm, we thought we were the first soldiers of the world, and speaking
the Prussians and the Russians, we laughed at them, tried until unworthy of our bullets. When
we passed the Inn, as they prepared to boast about great things to boarding in Moravia, after
the action of Hollabrunn, we realized that the Russian-Austrian army We would submit formal battle.
What was not restricted to our heads was the reason if we would take the offensive or defensive
operators. But the big head, one that has a lock on the front and the beam between the eyes,
it would decide soon.

At this point came, when we marched twisted road to the right, describing a great lap, so that was
a right angle to its original direction. Santorcaz again amazed at what seemed to him extraordinary
coincidence, continued:

- But this is not the way Olmutz?

Gabriel, or is this very thing, or it looks like one drop to another drop. Look, now we face
the swamp to our left Satzchan Pratz Hill. Look over there. Do not you hear the sound of drums?
Do not you see some lights? Then there are the Russians and Austrians. Do you know what your intention?
They want to cut off the road to Vienna, to which will come down the hill and placed among
Pratz our right and wetlands. See if you are stupid! That is exactly what we want the Emperor,
and everything has to make it appear that we retired to Vienna. Imagine that here is our army,
consisting of seventy thousand men, whose immense compared occupy all Hills left the road and part
of the plain on the right. The Emperor after filling the nostrils of snuff, leaving at midnight
to walk the field and observe the enemy's movements. See?, For there is. Did not hear the footsteps
of his horse and cheers that greet you soldiers? Can not see the glow of bonfires that light in
its path? But you do not see this? Bah! It is my hope, but such stirs my memories as the similarity
of the landscape that I seem to see and hear what I'm counting ... But you will want to know
how it was we beat the Russians and Austrians, and I'm going to refer. At dawn, oh, boys!, The
Russians down mechanically by that high hill opposite, in order to come to our right to cut
off the road. Do not forget that here before we have a meandering stream that comes from left
to right until it was lost in the marshes. The Emperor had the right to pass the stream and verified,
the Russians attacked. The center, commanded by Soult and Lannes left, eager to enter into
fire, but the Emperor containing the ardor of those generals, to
await the Russians had just committed folly to go down from the heights
of Pratz to get into the mother Golbasch Brook.

I will explain it. There, in the distance and at the foot of the hill, are the villages of Telnitz
and Sokolnitz ...

- If there is not such villages, sir - interrupted Marijuán, unruly to the mystification.

- Fool, will you shut up? - Continued Freemason -. I know what I am saying, is that all Napoleon's
desire, after he saw off the Russians, was to take those villages After seizing the ridge in front
of us. Do not you see? Well Generals Soult Lannes and departed at a gallop to direct the operations
of the center and left. I belonged to the center, and was at 17. Number of orders online and
Vandamme. Move towards the stream, you see?, we went through here in a hurry.

"If there are no such stream - Marijuán said, laughing -. You if you have a head full of streams
and villages, and right and left.

- We arrived at the village of Telnitz and there began the attack - continued unabashedly Santorcaz
-. In the hill were still twenty-seven Russian infantry battalions and Austrian errands in
person by the two emperors and the Russian Commander in Chief Kutusof. Ah, boys, if could have seen
that! Look to front, because from here it is quite different from the position which respectively
had: them over, we below ... At first we were riddled; but Soult sent us up at all costs, and up defying
the rain of bullets.
