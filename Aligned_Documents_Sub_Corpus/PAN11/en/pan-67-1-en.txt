 The choir, the troupe and the plot lines
are allegories for the choir of angels, communion of saints and the apocalyptic destruction
of Babylon and the raising up of Rome, sanctified by the blood of the confessors of Christ, as the
New Jerusalem; as described in the Book of Revelations by St. John the Divine (Eagle of Patmos).
