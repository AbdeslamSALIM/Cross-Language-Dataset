 They rolled the barrels of the last harvest, and the soldiers filled in red
spray metal bucket pending his waist. Then the wine was bottled out to light in order of date,
instantly lost in the river of men that passed and happened. Desnoyers watched with pride the
effects of his munificence. The smile reappeared on the faces fierce, the French joke jumping
from row to row, the groups initiated away a song.

Then he saw in the town square of several officers who gave a short break to his horses before
returning to the column. With contracted brow and dark eyes, talked about this recall inexplicable
to them. Days earlier, at Guise, had inflicted a defeat to their pursuers. And yet, still retreating,
obedient to an order strict and severe. "We do not understand say ...-- -. We do not understand.
"Orderly and methodical Tide dragged to these men who wanted to fight and had to retire. All had the
same cruel question: 'do not understand. "And the question became even more painful the incessant
march, a march that lasted day and night with only short breaks, alarmed the leaders of the body
at all hours for fear of being cut and separated from the rest of the army. "One more effort,
children mine. Courage! Rest soon. "The columns should be removed, covered hundreds of miles.
Desnoyers saw only one of them. Other and others made the same back at the same hour, comprising one-half

almost without fighting, unable, by a severe order, to defend the land? "Just as in 70, he thought. Externally
there was more order, but the result was going to be the same.

As an echo that respond negatively to his sorrow, he heard the voice of a soldier talking a
peasant

- We left, but it is harder to jump over the Boches.

Joffre's grandfather was the go back into the pocket at the time and site of your choice.

Desnoyers was revived at the name of general.

Maybe this soldier, who remained intact their faith through the endless marches and demoralizing,
I sensed the truth better than reasoners officials and scholars.

The rest of the day was spent making gifts to the last groups of the column. The wine cellar was emptied.
In order of dates still spreading the thousands of bottles stored in the basement of the castle.
As the night were bottles covered with dust for many years which gave the men who seemed weak.
As the column marched was offering saddest aspect of fatigue and wear. Passed behind, dragging
with disappointment the raw feet inside your shoes. Some were spared this torturous confinement
and marched barefoot, with heavy boots hanging from a shoulder leaving
blood stains the ground.

But all overwhelmed by a mortal fatigue, preserved their weapons and equipment, thinking the
enemy was near.
Desnoyers was the generosity of many of them stunned. Were used to
pass the homeland having to struggle with the selfishness of the grower.
Nobody offered nothing
