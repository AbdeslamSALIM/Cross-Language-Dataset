 

Any failure was impossible because Mutileder came to where the ocean Phoenician who was subtracted
and his revenge. Time had passed, pampanitos have had before that the ocean might set up a shot
from his sling or at your club.

He believed then that Adherbal Mutileder had taken with him to be ornament Echeloría main flagship,
from which he had to command the fleet, and anger that bordered on extreme, kicked, swore, snorted,
cursed, and even had to be plucked some of the lovely auburn curls
that crowned his head.

Through it all, was great when he won his consolation to know that
the rogue and courteous marine despicable flatterer of princes, had
this to Solomon's beautiful Echeloría.

How to resist the temptation here how much more expensive D. Juan Fresco is puffed and proud,
and what you put plump, well paid and given the eyebrows have been
peeled decoding and reading the inscriptions and papyri manuscripts
from which is taken from this story?

For it is stated that a bermejino, for within bermejino was Mutileder, as was Vescio Villabermeja
then, rivals Solomon comes to making brilliant and extraordinary see the role that reading followeth.

Mutileder
not discouraged to learn that he was in the harem Echeloría Solomon ordered before stay in
Jerusalem, spy opportune moment, and as soon as they submit, grab it by the forelock, the pretty
girl wresting from the hands of the Wise King. Thought why not make slightest damage to Solomon.
Mutileder was too monarchical, and the king, as king and his science infused and other virtues,
he instilled respect.

Solomon also was not to blame nor had any Mutileder offended. He had accepted the gift that had
brought him, and had given proof in good taste to accept and store.

Sometimes conceived Mutileder some flattering hope. I imagined that had to mourn Echeloría
he and Solomon had to say, with all courtesy and finesse, that did not love him because he loved to
another and wisdom was that Solomon, who was kind to women, and so polite and condescending
have consented to the idols of the land of each of them should not
be fierce with Echeloría, but not well knew that his idol was Mutileder,
had to give up their claims.

Mutileder came to descry as likely to make the King look to deliver a the girl, and even that
may be smoothed to be best man.

The strength, perseverance and endurance Echeloría had to move all this and more, generous spirit
of Solomon.

What mattered to this great King a woman more or less when had in his harem queens seven hundred,
eight hundred concubines, and infinite number of princesses? So it was natural that, seeing Solomon
Echeloría love with another, distressed and tearful, and rejected by surly style and Mountaineer,
was to appear detached.

In making this assumption, very plausible, Mutileder blushed with shame. Presented in his mind
how well behaved Echeloría, sullen as a cat and steady as a rock
saw the royal and noble detachment behavior of Solomon, and considered
unworthy and wanted to remember his infidelities with Chem, which
would open the earth and swallow him.

These remorse, the sorrow and the blush of guilt were, however, quite of savory and sweet. Oh,
how soon all this was changed to bitterness when he heard Mutileder what was said in Jerusalem public
streets and squares!

To find out what they said should take it back and get into some explanations.

Solomon's palace was immense, and society as it very enjoyable. Multitude of poets and toilets
harps, drums and harps, he rejoiced continually. There were skilled
dancers ingenious artists who made elegant furniture and other works
of extreme delicacy, and the best then known chefs. That was in the
highest degree, the fifth elevation power, life wedding of Camacho.
Solomon and his wives and servants devoured every day thirty fattened
oxen, a hundred sheep and lots of deer, buffalo, gazelles and birds.
And do not think it ate some bread. The daily consumption of flour
used in bread, cakes, Frolla buns and pasta or flora, was ninety choirs,
or forty-five cahíces, twelve bushels understood
