 Freya moaning eyes
closed, without departing from its inertia.

The sailor, scowling, wrinkled with rage, with tragic ugliness, remained motionless, staring
grimly female to fall.

I was satisfied with his brutality, was a timely relief, breathing better. At the same time
I felt shame. "What have you done, cowardly ?...Â» For the first time in its existence had
hit a woman.

His right hand was sore to the eye level. One of his fingers bled. Maybe had caught on her earrings,
perhaps he had torn a lost pin on his chest.

He sucked the blood of the deep scratch and then forget this wound to continue watching the
body lying at his feet.

Little by little accustomed to the dim light of the room. Saw and all objects clearly. Freya
covered his eyes with a look that blended the hatred and remorse.

The head, buried in the pad, had a painful profile. She seemed much older, as if his age would
have doubled with tears.

The brutal coup had done away with funeral flapping its wonderful freshness and youth. His eyes
were half open an aura of momentary wrinkles, the nose had taken the pale edging of the dying.

... your thing. Hit me more, if that calms your anger.

Wanted to
assert his humility advancing towards him with a kiss lips timid,

- Ah, no! ... No!

Ulysses, to escape the touch,
