 Perhaps
the somewhat epicurean temperament of the author of In Journey something has influenced this
sudden change of front, but giving up parliamentary life, the political press, government active,
to take refuge in a diplomatic retreat, when he was still young, without have reached even half
of life, full of life, aspirations, bulldozers ... blood! Mystery! The diplomatic life is, indeed, noble
sphere of action, but for a man of these conditions is like a moral suicide. Because if the diplomatic
functions allow have leisure, it is necessary to fill them and if they are not filled with literary
work, a temperament overactive danger of using them to rush to the dregs the cup of Capua, and - this
cup is fatal.

Reminds me of Mr. Cane to figure so nice and so similar to that brilliant French spirit was called
Prevost-Paradol, also was a writer who could have easily transposed the highest peaks: skills, training,
ambition, all possessed. Success smiled forever ... But the letters he left politics, and changed
the active struggle for the rest diplomat. That beautiful talent is completely sterilized.

It
reminded me of an incident really figure in the life of Prevost-Paradol.

One day a friend told him: "Why do not you write the history of parliamentary ideas? Is there
an interesting book and worth of tempting talent.
