 His ashes rest in the Cathedral
of Santiago de Galicia.

In contrast, many other illustrious dead sleep the eternal sleep in the ancient temple of Salamanca,
where they are lying on their quiet graves magnificent statues, prayer niches within worked in
the thickness of the walls, now in sumptuous chapels through .-- And strangely! between the most

and his wife Ms Anne, fine their days in a convent
