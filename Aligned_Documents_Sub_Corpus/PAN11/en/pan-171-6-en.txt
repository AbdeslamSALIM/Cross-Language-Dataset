 Who says extension-all,
it contradicts the terms, and yet this is reduced to the view we're talking.

[46.] If a room is reduced to nothing all that it contains, it seems that the walls can not be distant.
The idea of ??distance, including a medium between objects: nothing can not be a means, is
nothing. If the delay is nothing, no distance, they will be empty words. To say that nothing can
own property, to destroy all ideas, is to affirm the possibility of being and not being at the
same moment, and thus subvert the foundations of human knowledge.

[47.] To say that all content is annihilating negative space, is to play with words and leave
standing the same difficulty. This negative space is something or nothing, if anything, falls are
fighting opinion, if anything, the challenge remains the same.

[48.] If the answer is that in spite of not getting anything between the surfaces, they nevertheless
left with the ability to contain, observe that this capability is not on the surfaces same,
but the distances between: otherwise arranged in any way the surfaces always retain the same capacity,
which is absurd. We therefore advance a step: need to explain what
that capacity, that distance, the question is still intact.

[49.] Perhaps you could replicate that wiped contained within the surfaces, not volume is destroyed
that form, and the idea of ??this volume enters the building.

But I reply that the idea of ??wrapping volume away, for if it does not exist, no volume, and there
is no such distance, if distance is a mere nothing.

[50.] Pondering to release these difficulties so hurry, think of a specific response at first
sight, but well considered, is as futile as the others. The distance, we say, is a sheer denial of
contact, the denial is pure nothing, then we have nothing with this what we want. I repeat that
this solution is as futile as the other: for if the distance is nothing but the denial of contact
distances no greater or less, all are equal; since in having denial
of contact, and be all you can be.

The same exists denial of contact between two surfaces that are far each one millionth of a line
like a million miles. This denial then, nothing explains the same problem continues to exist.

[51.]
Far from the idea of ??distance can be explained by the contact, as its opposite, On the contrary,
the contact can only be explained by the distance. If you ask what is the proximity of two surfaces,
as explained by the immediacy, we say that touch because there is nothing between the two, because
there is no distance. In the idea of ??contact the relative qualities do not come to the senses,
nor of the action that one contiguous bodies can exert over another, such as momentum or compression:
contiguity is a negative idea, purely geometrical: it contains nothing but denial away. Contiguity
has no more no less, for all that may be, it is enough that no distance is a real denial. Two things
can be more or less distant: but can not be played more or less, with respect to a same parties.
What can be is more contact points, but no further contact between
the same points.

[52.] Strive but the argument for the reality of space, on the assumption
that are attributed to capacity and distance.

Suppose an area of ??two feet in diameter, entirely empty. Within that space is not over: if space
is nothing, nothing left.

I ask now: in the interior of the hollow sphere is it possible the movement? It seems certain; there
is no reason, there is a movable body, there is a greater extent than the body, no distance
to go. In addition, if the movement is not possible, it would be impossible also that the area
is filled with any body, after being empty, and emptying into being full. Neither empty nor filled
can be no movement of bodies in the interior of the sphere, and this movement is not a body
within another body, but in space: 1. ยบ For the bodies are impenetrable: 2. No. Because when
it fills the area after having been empty, the body can not find
another body goes, and whoever comes out when the field is empty,
it moves through space it leaves, in which nothing but himself, and
nothing remains in dating him.

After assuming a hollow sphere, within it there can be movement. Now, if the content space is a pure
nothing, the movement is also nothing, and therefore does not exist. The movement can not exist
nor be conceived, but walking distance; this is essence, if the distance is nothing, anything goes,
then no motion. What will it mean the body has traveled half the diameter, or one foot? If this
is nothing, no mean nothing.

I do not know what to respond to all these good reasons in that axiom: nothing has no property.

[53.]
However great the difficulties are refusing to give the space a reality, I do not reach that
can be as serious as those which militate against anything, on the assumption one wishes to grant
extension. Those, as we shall see, lie rather in certain problems born out of our way of thinking, that
based on sound reasons; when we have just proposed are based on the ideas that underlie all knowledge:
in that most unquestionable proposition: nothing has no properties. If this proposition is not
admitted as incontrovertible axiom goes awry all human knowledge, including the principle
of contradiction: for obvious contradiction is that nothing has any property or parties, that nothing
can say anything, that nothing can move anything that the idea of ??nothing can be founded
a science as geometry, that refer to nothing all calculations are made on the nature.

CHAPTER VIII.

OPINION Descartes and Leibniz, ON THE SPACE.

[54.] If space is something, what is? Here is another very serious difficulty: to combat the
opponents have been easy to hold the position you choose, not be so. Could it be said that
space is nothing but the same extension of bodies, which conceived
abstract, which gives an idea of ??what we call pure space, and that
the diversity of points and positions, are but modifications of the
extension?

As soon as you see that if the space is the same extension of bodies, where there will be no blank
body. Then a vacuum is impossible. This result is inevitable.

So two philosophers have thought so egregious as Descartes and Leibnitz, but do not know why
both wanted to point out to the universe an indefinite extension. It is true that this sort
eluded difficult to imagine the spaces beyond the limits of the universe, then that if the universe
is limited, there can be nothing out of bounds, and therefore everything
We can imagine is within the universe.

But this is not to circumvent the difficulties but releasing them, for a review to avoid a
hard drive, nothing is in favor of strength.

[55.] According to Descartes the essence of body consists in extension, and as in space extension
conceived out of necessity, it follows that body, extension and space,
are three things essentially identical.

The vacuum as usually conceived, is an extension or space without a body, is something contradictory
as that body is to assume, therefore that extension means, and no body, therefore it is supposed
to removed.

Descartes simply accept the ultimate consequences of this doctrine. Thus, proposing the difficulty
Founded in which we imagine that God could remove all matter contained in a glass, staying
the same shape of the glass, answered firmly that this is impossible. "For we can, he says, correcting
an opinion so false, we see that there is no necessary link between the glass and body that
you full, but it is so absolutely necessary between concave glass figure, and the extension
must be included in this concavity, which there is more reluctance to conceive a mountain
without a valley, that such an extension without the concavity it contains, and this extension
without any extended thing, because it's nothing, as has been observed many times, can not have
extension. For which reason, if we are asked What would happen if God removed the whole body
is in a glass, without allowing enter another answer to the sides of this vessel would be
found so close, that would play immediately.

For two bodies must touch when there is nothing between them, it would be contradiction in these two
bodies were apart, ie have distance from each other, and that this distance was not anything. Distance
is a extension property that can not exist without the extension "(Princ. of Filos. p. 2. ยง 18).

[56.]
If cinemas Descartes argued that space, because it contains real distances can not be a pure nothing,
its reasoning would seem conclusive, but when he adds that the space is the body, for the reason that
space extension and the extension is the essence the body, seat does not prove a thing. They
do not conceive or imagine body without extension, only follows that the extension is a property
of the body, without which we will not conceive, but not that is its essence. To be sure of this,
it would be necessary as we have the idea of ??extension, the body
we had also to see if among them are identity.

But the bodies we know nothing but what we experienced through the senses, without being there
been given to penetrate the intimate nature.

Where does the inseparability of the extension and body ideas? Born from the idea that body we have
is a confused idea, as conceived as a substance that is a relationship with us, and because the
impressions we call sensations. And as we have shown above, the basis of feelings is the extension,
this is the only conduit through which we put ourselves in relation to the body. When this
base we need, because without it, we have no body but a general idea of ??being, or of substance,
not anything that characterizes and distinguishes him from the rest.

All these things are in the order of our ideas, but we can not infer that the bodies themselves
did not actually nothing more than extension.

[57.] With the same reasoning is destroyed the opinion of the infinite or indefinite extension. Descartes
unwrapping his doctrine on the idea of ??extension, said: "We will know too this world, or the
extended matter that makes up the universe has no limits: because where we propose to pretend
they want, we can imagine further, spaces indefinitely extended,
not only imagine, but we conceive to be such in fact as we imagine;
of luck containing an extensive body indefinitely, because the idea
of ??extension which we conceive in all space, is the true idea that
we have the body "(ib. p. 2.

ยง 21).

In this passage, but the error on the essence of bodies, there is free transit of a purely ideal,
or rather imaginary, to a real order. It is true that wherever I imagine the limits of the universe
as an immense dome, denying, still imagine outside the dome new wastes of space that my fantasy
is submerged, but this infer that the reality is as I imagine, does not seem very tight to the
rules of sound logic. If this is as clear as Descartes supposed, it is not just imagination,
but concepcion based on clear and distinct ideas, how is that many
philosophers are not at all this more than a game of imagination?

[58.] Leibniz says that space is "a relation, an order, not only among existing things but
among the possible, as if they exist "(New Essays on the understanding
human, Lib.

2, chap. 13, ยง 17). Cree also that the vacuum is impossible, but not based on the reason of
Descartes. These are his words.

"Philalethes. Those who take the field and the extension for the same thing, pretend that interior
walls of a hollow, empty body be touched, but the space between two bodies is sufficient to
prevent mutual contact.

"Theophilo. I would argue the same way: when I not support empty distinction matter of extension, and
I confess that if I had a vacuum in a sphere, so it would touch the opposites. But I think
that this case does not support the divine perfection "(ib.

ยง. 21).

[59.] I think that Leibniz makes in this passage a petition of principle. Said that the Of course
if the walls would not be touched, because the space between them sufficient to prevent it; but
this is precisely what has to be proved: the actual existence of this space. This is which denies
Descartes.

[60.] Comparing the views of Descartes and Leibniz, one can see that both agree to deny to space a reality
distinct from the bodies, but based its opinion on matters very different. Descartes puts
the essence of the body in extension, where extension is body: where
there is space extension: therefore there can be no vacuum.

Leibnitz not inherently create an empty capacity absurd, and if not supported, it is because,
in his opinion, repugnant to the divine perfection. The two famous philosophers came to the same
starting point very different principles: Descartes lies in metaphysical reasons, based on
the essence of things, Leibniz does not rely on the absolute essence, but in its relations with
the perfection divine. The empty capacity, was not contradictory feelings of Leibnitz, but as
soon as opposed to optimism.

[61.] Since it is rather remarkable that three such distinguished
philosophers as Aristotle, Descartes and Leibniz, have agreed to deny
the existence of this capability is called space considered as being
different from the bodies, and which can exist without them.

The diversity of their opinions only proves that at the bottom of the matter is a difficult thing
more serious than some ideologues seem to believe that so easily explain the idea space and their
generation, as if it were simple things.

CHAPTER IX.

OPINION OF THE SPACE THAT ATTRIBUTED TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF BODIES.

[62.] By the above considerations, it seems little short of demonstrating
the contradiction enclosing a space-anything.

If it is a capacity, with dimensions that can actually measure, has real property, and therefore
is not a pure nothing. We have idea of ??space; it combines a science as true, as obvious as the geometry,
this idea we is also necessary to design the motion. This idea can not match a mere nothing.

"The
space will be somewhat different from the same extension of bodies? In this opinion objetรกrsele
usually holds that space must be either body or spirit if not body is spirit, which is contradictory
because it is essentially composed of parts, as space can not be
simple and spirit.

Strong reasons militate against the opinion which gives the space a different nature the body,
but I do not think much of that I have proposed, for in denying the
alternative, The whole argument is ruined.

How do I test that there is no medium between body and spirit? No way. Also, do not know the
essence of the body, not the spirit, what we claim the right to assert that there is nothing
in the universe than one of these extreme nature of which is unknown to us?

[63.] Reply that there is middle ground between simple and compound, and not between the other
and not, and that therefore there is no medium between the body that
is composed, and spirit is simple.

I agree that there is no middle ground between simple and compound, and that everything that exists
is one or the other, but not everything is composed of body, spirit and everything simple.

This proposition: "Every body is made" is not identical to this: "Each compound is body. "Then there
may be compounds that are not bodies.

The composition, having parties, is a property of the body, but this is not its essence, or
at least we know. Otherwise it would be necessary to embrace the opinion of Descartes, that the
essence of the body the extension is. What is known about whether there may be things that have parts
and not are body?

[64.] Note that the very state of the question to us assume the space as a substance, that is
subsisting by itself, regardless of the inherent other being: therefore, having released the difficulty
in this course, as is the case more difficult, and therefore at all. Moreover, assuming that space distinct
from the body, yet true reality would pose serious substance indispensable, since they are
not inherent to nothing.

[65.] To explain what I have said that to be a simple thing need not be spirit, observe that:
"Every spirit is simple" is not the same as "everything is simple spirit." Simplicity is necessary
to the spirit, but not its essence. The idea of ??simple, explicit denial of parts, and the
essence of the spirit can not consist of a denial.

[66.] Against the opinion which gives the space a different kind of
body into an extended substance, does not seem worth the argument
that there wanted to deduct its infinity, because even in this case,
there is no objection to point out a limit.

What then beyond? nothing. We conceive extension still vague, but
the imagination Not really.

Also imagine the same thing referring to a time that we figured before the creation of the
world: if they try on something in the imagination for the many the world, would prove also for
its eternity.

And here remember that the arguments with which I have fought the space-anything, do not lie
in we imagine, but that is impossible for nothing is extension, or have any property. This capital
is the reason I challenged those who claim to be possible are designed and there are properties
that are attributed to space, and yet space a pure nothing.

CHAPTER X.

OPINION OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE THAT THE SPACE IS the immensity of God.

[67.] Overwhelmed by some philosophers such serious difficulties, unable to reconcile with
the anything that actually offered us space, nor conceive any created thing, immobility, infinity,
perpetuity and imagined space, have said that the space was the very immensity of God. This
at first sight seems an absurd extravagance, but but then prove the falsity of this opinion, it is
necessary to do justice not only straight to the intention of those who have sustained, healthy
and sought explanations that take hand, but also the reason that led to such an extent, by the
way, but nothing solid, Nor is negligible.

[68.] Here is how to reason in favor of this opinion. Space is something.
Before God nourishing the world, there was space.

It is conceivable that there are bodies without extending space. Before there, we think that capacity
that can be placed: then the space is eternal. No movement out of space, and in the first instant
of being raised bodies, were unable to move and move.

Although not involve more than one body in the world could move, and this movement may extend
to infinity. Then space is infinite. If God annihilate the whole universe, at least one body,
this body could also move in all directions, extended to infinity.
If it were then reduced to nothing the one body, the extension would
stay in that movie: it could create new bodies, new worlds. Then the
space is indestructible. An eternal, infinite, indestructible, can
not be raised, then the space is uncreated. Then it is God himself.
Then must be God as we understood with relation to the extension,
then the space is the immensity of God. The vastness is that attribute
by which God is everywhere: this attribute is the relationship says
to the Chapter. Space since it is the vastness of God. Adopted this
theory there is no objection to the space infinite, eternal, indestructible.

[69.]
This opinion is against him, which destroys the simplicity of God.
If the space is a property of God, God himself, because everything
in God is God. Then, being essentially extended space, God is also
extensive.

Clarke saw the force of this argument, force also made
him feel the argument Leibnitz opponent, but responds to it in a very
weak. Says that space has parts, but not separate. Then, whether as
may be, does
