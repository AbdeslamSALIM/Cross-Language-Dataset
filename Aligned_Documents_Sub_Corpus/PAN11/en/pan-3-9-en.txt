at the universe as the result of a mysterious force that deployed with a spontaneous movement, but
necessary and ongoing, is breeding and raising beings on a perennial species transformation.
Thus, the greater perfection of the body the power plant would produce animals, and these, perfecting,
would become sensitive; And as progress would go in the order of sensation, is close to the region
intelligence, which could finally be achieved. With this system has no small analogy thinking
that makes a feeling transformed: with him is erased the dividing line between intelligent
beings and unintelligent, the feelings of the oyster could go refined to become an intelligence
superior to that of Bossuet or Leibnitz, the development of the faculties of man statue, would
be an emblem of the development of the universe.

[4.] It has been noted that this talk about the sensitive faculty itself apart its relations with external
objects, and therefore understand the word feeling, all conditions of the senses, and are currently
produced, and remembered, and imagined ie all conditions in the whole extension of the scale, since
there is awareness direct them, or are present when the experience, until it reaches limit
on the commencement of actual intelligence.

You can not throw here the line between sensible and intelligent, this requires extensive and
deep feeling considerations compared to the idea, which does not correspond into this place, but good
will have noted the existence of this line so that no confusion a delicate matter, and in which no
misses without reaching consequences.

[5.] What is the feeling? What is your inner nature? Just know it is a modification of our being,
and we can not explain it. All words are insufficient to give an idea of ??a sensation to
those who do not experience, the hearing would be born blind As been said and written by philosophers
about the light and colors, unable to imagine what which are the
colors and light.

In this there is no other teaching experience, so that if we suppose a man an alteration of meaning
that it constantly seems yellow green, and yellow green, not your mistake will never in spite
of continuous treatment with other men; and never come to suspect
that his whole life has been using the two words green and yellow,
taking them in a different sense than the others gave them.

[6.] By analogy, and even by natural inclination, we believe that the brutes are not mere machines,
and they have feelings too.

The vast scale on which are distributed the irrational states that the power of feeling is spread
through the universe with an amazing profusion, and very different degrees.

Our experience is limited to the globe we inhabit: the limits of the sensitive life are the same
as those of our experience? Even over the globe, the observation is limited to allowing the imperfection
of our senses and auxiliary instruments: how how extending the chain of life? Where is the
term? In people who have by inanimate, is there any involvement of that mysterious power? Does
the universe consist a set of monads endowed with a certain perception,
as claimed by Leibnitz?

This is a hypothesis destitute of foundation, but being so limited our means of observation,
we walk with restraint by finding an edge to the region of life.

[7.] Commonly used by faculty to feel that in a matter of a very inferior
order; so in effect, when compared with the intellectual faculties,
but this does not mean that considered in itself, is a remarkable
phenomenon, able to amaze and confound those who meditate about it.

Feel! ... with this single idea takes a quantum leap in the scale of beings. What insensitive
sensitive compared to what? It is insensitive, but not experience it, there is nothing in it
but himself, the sensible experience it is, and is it something more than himself, all As he feels, all that
is represented in it.

The insensitive, even surrounded by beings, is in complete isolation, loneliness, the sensible,
even alone, may be in a world of representations infinite variety.

[8.] The idea of ??self is somewhat applicable to every sentient being, it is not conceived
feeling, without a permanent, experienced the transient, ie without
being one, in the midst of multiplicity. Every sentient being, if
he were capable of reflection, could his own way I mean, I, for verifying
that all is oneself to be experiencing the variety sensations
