 This surface, which has little about
twenty square degrees, or are thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty leagues, to twenty-five the
degree, is bounded on the north by the Guaporé or Itenes and Beni (river to draw the boundary
between Bolivia and Brazil), with the latter that separates it from the Caupolican province
by the north-west parle. Natural limits to the west by the side of the country of Yuracares
are desert plains are located at the foot of last foothills of the Andes. Finally, the province
is circumscribed towards Moxos the south, southeast and east by immense impenetrable forests or
swamps brought without certain threshold, between it and the provinces of Santa Cruz de la
Sierra and Chiquitos.

Mountains.

Albeit quite Moxos province neighboring hills to the Chiquitos east and north to the Brazilian mountains,
outlining the right bank of Itenes river, and west to the last foot of the mountains of the Yuracares,
contains no in its division one mountain, nor even minor hills, formed by So a flat surface,
which meets the south with the vast plains of Santa Cruz of the Sierra, and the north-west with
the province Caupolican. On the horizon without limits, scarcely four highlights are found
rising to the height of thirty poles on the remainder of the land, and that, unless it be in the
midst of a country so highly level, it would perhaps inapercibidos. These four points are a few
morons isolated the first which is the Cerro del Carmen, is situated about twelve or fifteen
miles southeast of the mission its name, and between the rivers Blanco and San-Miguel, the
second placed on the bank Machupo River right, and neighbor to the mission that is called,
is the hill of San-Ramon, the third is a small hill below the Exaltation located on the right bank
of the Mamore: finally, the fourth, which is the hill of Saint-Simon, is found east of Magdalena, his
reputation I feel very rich doubtful, as it must be that of all places inaccessible ensures
no However, it is full of mines of gold and diamonds.

Rios.

In a mountainous country reliefs determine the direction of the currents; per in Moxos whose
territory no more than a single uniform and without sharp plain, where eminences that separate
small rivers disappear under the flood at stations rain, in canoes through allowing a large part of
the province, all currents the plain weave circuit converging towards the center, and heading
to the slopes Amazon, after having met on three main, which are the
Guaporé or Iten, the Mamore and Beni.

Guaporé or Itenes tributaries.

The Barbados born in Rio de Chiquitos Province [1], at quite a distance away from Moxos: This
stream, chief among those that give birth to Guaporé, is navigable Casalbasco further up. As
she starts in a swamp where the river takes origin also Paraguay, would very likely join the
first tributary of this river with Guaporé, opening for this channel
only four thousand eight hundred yards.

In this way they would hand the two giant rivers of South America, the Plata and Amazon coming to
form a natural channel of over two hundred thousand leagues.

The Rio Verde takes origin north of San-Ignacio de Chiquitos, and
moving toward the northwest, go to Barbados to meet the river, near
the 64 degrees of longitude and latitude of 14, forming Guaporé this
river or Itenes: steamboats can freely browse and upload it too up
towards its headwaters.

The Rio Serre was born north of Concepcion de Chiquitos, and in the
same direction as the Green River, joins the Guaporé twenty-five miles
below.

It is equally navigable for boats of any dimension.

The Rio Blanco or Baures also takes its origin north of Concepcion de Chiquitos, and as previous
two is heading towards the northwest, passing immediately and to
Carmen Concepcion Moxos to go to flow into the Guaporé, near the fort
of Beira.

You can browse this river to Chiquitos.

The Rio Itonama receives, under the name Rio de San-Miguel, much of the waters of Chiquitos; is
then attached to Huacaré near Guarayos, and is parallel to the Rio
Blanco to join Guaporé conjunction with the Machupo River, near the
fort of Beira.

Ships can steam everywhere sail on its waters to Chiquitos.

The Rio Machupo wealthy tribute of many streams that leave from the bosom of the plains Moxos
flooded, these streams are, San-Juan, navigable from San-Pedro, the Mooch, Mill, the Machupo and
Chananoca, all gathered and when the river passes Machupo ahead of
the missions of San-Ramon and San-Joaquin, to go and join the river
Itonama, and to couple this throw then in the Guaporé, also near the
fort of Beira.

Guaporé river, once the repository of all these streams of water running
towards the oestenorueste to become incorporated with the Mamore,
around 12 degrees south latitude and 68 west longitude meridian of
Paris.

Tributaries of the Mamore.

Mamore river receives all the waters of the eastern slopes of the mountains, its tributaries, starting
with those found further east, are as follows.

Ivary River rises in the flood plains that are west of the country of Guarayos and heading towards
the northwest, left receives the waters of the rivers Tico and San-Antonio, going to meet with
the Mamore a little above the Trinity Moxos. River is navigable body almost all along its course.

The
Rio Grande has all the waters Chayanta mountainous provinces of Cochabamba,
Mizque and Valle Grande, then descending to the plains of Santa Cruz,
and Adunaic Piray to form the Sara river north of the province.

You can browse their waves up near Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

Piray River rises in the mountains of Samaypata, province of Valle Grande, flows into the plain
of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and passes near the city of that name, receiving everywhere small
tribute, and then continuing parallel to the Rio Grande to join with him to form the Sara River,
far to the south of 15 degrees latitude.

Its still very fast current in some parts, but when mother leaves can navigate the waters ships
of any dimension.

The Rio Ibaba takes origin under the name of Yapacany in the mountains
east towards the east the country of the Yuracarés, and continues
to run, parallel to the rivers Grande and Piray up Sara plunge into
the river, a few miles below the point at which flows in this same
the last of those.

Ibaba river is navigable for the most part.

The Rio Mamore born east of the river Ibaba on the mountains of the eastern slope of the and
the country ranges from Yuracares. His current that flows received course the Chimoré, walks
along the plain towards the north Moxos, bending a few degrees west. This river, receiving
the tribute of the other rivers of the province preserves Mamore name to 10 degrees south
latitude, in which the term incorporated with Beni, making the denomination
of the Madeira River.

The Mamore can serve as a vehicle to the cruise to the foot of the mountains.

The Rio Chapare, consisting of rivers Coni, San-Mateo, Paracti and many others born in the country
of Yuracares, west of Mamore on the eastern slopes of the mountains,
and heading north meets the south towards the Mamore 15 degrees south
latitude.

You can browse by him, to the confluence of the river Coni, ie to the point where the plain begins.

Securi
River, formed by the rivers Chipiriri Samucebeté, Isidoro, Yaniyuta, and Sinuta Securi, all
of them navigable to the foot of the mountains, receives the streams of the watershed East
of these, from 68 to 70 degrees west longitude, and is incorporated
the above Mamoré of Trinidad, north of 15 degrees latitude.

Tijamuchi River rises in the Eastern Cordillera, west of the last tributaries Securi river, the
river receives water Taricuri and crosses the plain of the province by the northeast to the
Mamore, which meets as 14 degrees latitude, a little above Mission
San-Pedro.

Large boats can ascend it to the foot of mountains.

The origin takes Aper Rio, west of the former, on the same mountain: after receiving the tribute
of the Rio San Jose is heading towards the northeast to go to join
the Mamore below the Tijamuchi, less than half a degree away from
each other.

It is also This navigable river to well above its current.

The Rio Yacuma also born west of the implement and at the same cerranía;
Adunaic then with Rapulo river, immediately goes to the mission of
Santa Ana and goes to meet with quite the Mamore 14 degrees north.

He can climb up the confines of the plains.

Iruyani River has its headwaters in the plain, and receiving the river flow is Bococa throws
in the Mamore towards the north of 13 degrees.

The Mamore, after flows have treasured these eleven main streams, are Aduna as 12 degrees or Guaporé
Itenes river, then continued his march towards north to receive the drainage of Beni and form the
Madeira River. Tributaries of the Rio Beni.

The Beni River, which has already been made when talking long Mension Caupolican, mountain boots located
northeast of the mountains in the provinces of Cochabamba, Sicasica,
Yungas Dolls and Apolobamba, and ends in the plains as 14 degrees
latitude, receives tributes to the west of the river Mapiri, Tuyche
river, etc.. This is followed by running towards the north to 11 degrees,
with change of direction, twisting the northeast to go to join with
the Mamore at 10 degrees latitude.

When considered as a whole streams that cross the province Moxos not can but admire you have
an area of ??eighteen degrees, or are ten thousand leagues, thirty-four crossed rivers, navigable
almost throughout its entire course, not having Meanwhile another conduit for draining the Mamore
River. Naturally results from this unique territorial arrangement, which in the rainy season most
of the waters of the province Chiquitos, Bolivia and center on the eastern slope down at once,
with more or less momentum, to settle to the bottom of that great receptacle, say so, that is the
province Moxos, where not finding it easy and natural conduit to the overflow, they spread across
the plain, causing flooding, that few Parages are on deck so we can traveled almost the whole
province in this season, rowing in canoes that pass unimpeded over some small eminences that separate
rivers. But if in the rainy season there is only little tongues of land, and immune to flood are
a kind of island where they breed cattle and tilled the land, everything changes in appearance
in the dry season, the rivers are encased in their beds, gorgeous meadows replaced to the muddy
swamps, and the province has an all over virgin soil which provides to agriculture. Its territory
is a set of plains on which they became aware of distance boscages isolated at intervals, taking
higher ground, he can not reach water the annual floods.

The perfect equality Moxos field determined in this province a geographical disposition very particular.
Not only small eminences that should be among the various currents, are entirely foreign to its
territory, but also take different rivers origin in the same swamp, like the river and the
river Machupo Huarichona (tax the Itonama), both born in the same lake. Would not this a timely
occasion to ask to geographers too systematic, that everywhere you want indispensably mountains between
each row of water, how come in this place not exist?

In most of the streams just mentioned there are still many streams, branches of these main trunks,
and I do not give here the nomenclature. Its currents could only used for navigation during periods
of rising: in the rest of the year remains almost completely dry.

Lagos.

If time Moxos growing province, flooded almost everywhere, shape, say, a single sheet of water
in the dry season the plains are lean, and only on the parts are more sunken floor, many wetlands,
particularly east and west of the province, but many lakes are permanent.

Can include certain however:

Chitiopa Lagoon, which is located far above the Carmen, in the same header White River, which
gives rise accordingly.

Itonama Lagoon, which is placed on the river of the same name, about twenty-five Magdalena leagues
above: is this lake about two miles wide, on four to five long and consists of an extraordinary widening
river.

Only time serene Indian venture to sail in her, but always with some suspicion that leaves
to be founded, as the olad usually wind up suddenly, inevitably plunge their canoes.

Near San-Ramon, are two permanent lakes, one located at a distance of half a league and the
other a little less than two leagues. Both have an oblong shape and
diameter as a league at the most.

It is very exquisite fish to be taken from them, but the crowd of alligators clogs much to the
fishermen. Still, in the vicinity of Mission San-Joaquin, another lake of the same dimension
as above and also contains plenty of fish.

By the time they are finally to dry more of the above, is in the middle
of the plain is immediate to the rivers, many small lakes or ponds,
as too narrow causes are unimportant: on the other hand, those who
are on the edge of rivers, such as those on the banks of the Mamore,
change frequently according to the terromonteros site or the avenues
of such rivers.

Geology.

Moxos province no since, apparently, another aspect that of a geographical plain to the south
circumscribed by the mountains of the Andes and the hills of Chiquitos towards the north by the
hills of Diamond and Brazilian ITENE. This plain, in the who come to finish all the currents
of the eastern slope of the mountain ranges and western and northern slopes of the province of
Chiquitos and the General Captaincy Mato-Grosso, meets with pampas through Monte Grande, whereas
prolonged to the north, established at that point the communication with the major source of
the Amazon: so that the province is nothing Moxos the northern continuation of pampas, the southern
continuation of the plains of the Amazon, or rather, a prosecution of that immense low is located
on a the last foothills of the mountains and forests Brazil, which embraces from north to south
across the center of the southern continent of America, interrupted
only from the ninth to the tenth degree of latitude, the slightly
elevated cerranía determining the many rapids and falls of the Madeira
River.

When the river of San-Miguel out of control, which takes place every year, its steep banks offer alluvial
earthy, very fine sand mixed with clay or blackish, and deposited in horizontal layers. They
leave such land gradually lifted with the addition of particles pulled to the high places of
the province of Chiquitos. Between the rivers of San-Miguel Baures and significant wetlands,
mud-covered modern alluvium and clay muddy red that I have some relation to my land of the pampas,
but not seen I in them animal fossils: these clays are in that place the bottom layer to the floods
current, because they are not plain to see but when these floods, blackened earth compounds
or fine sand, become uprooted by erosion. These lands are remarkable especially in the stream
of San-Francisco and somewhat later, towards the mission of Carmen. According assured me, these
same clays be stretched, rising towards the south, on a vast area that lies between the rivers
Blanco and San-Miguel. In their midst rises, and at a distance of twelve leagues to the SSE, a
small sandstone moron of the Devonian formation, which has many similarities
with that of Guarayos.

White does not cross the river but above modern alluvium, I have found yet on many points in the vicinity
of Concepcion, and mainly in the immediate surroundings to the mission, some patches of pampas
field below the fine sand of recent flooding. All the plains, which extend from Concepcion
and from Baures to Magdalena, are consist of alluvium, to exception of small towns places
where boscages discover a little red silty clay: the slopes of Guacaraje and several points Magdalena
also around the manifest. These small pieces of land of the pampas,, scattered everywhere, I
gave unequivocal evidence that silt covers the eastern province, and if not visible in other
places is because it has been covered. In these plains, a rod of difference in the level it
is enough to cover up the floods, making it disappear completely. There to the east, 20 degrees
north of the compass and about ten miles from Magdalena, a fairly high hill which I did not visit,
but that according to what I said a priest who had considered, should
be composed also of sandstone.

Between Magdalena and San-Ramon are still covered with alluvial plains, being noticeable only
near the hacienda of San-Carlos, and between Machupo and Huarichona rivers, some spots red clay.
San-Ramon is found under those muddy clay, a true clay containing a large number of hydrated
iron nuggets and offers throughout the layer Guaraniana my field. Is effectively the same package,
and they are composed the same round grains. Placing one beside the other two rocks do not have
the most slightest difference. On the slopes of the river red clay Machupo manifest covering
Dry all parts of the outlines of San-Joaquin. However, on the same site the mission and its circuit,
and seven miles further north, and also near the confluence of rivers Machupo é Iten, I noticed under
considerable pieces of land tertiary Pampa Guaraniana with hydrated iron nuggets. These clays, filled
with shiny black seeds hydrate of iron, cover, according to my particular observations, an
area of ??about twenty leagues long, where the richest ore shown at ground without ever intended
to benefit. In making this discovery the year 1832, immediately figured the fat benefits that
could accrue to the Republic tillage these mines, and no doubt they would operate a favorable
change things, providing its inhabitants the material and the means of all manner of industrial enterprises.

The
left bank of Guaporé, near Fort Beira, consists of flooded lowlands
rising time, or from scraps of land Guaraniana with hydrate of iron
nuggets: the right bank, on the contrary, it is rising in hills to
the mountains formed by one of the branches of the Diamond, which
mountains, going in parallel with the current Itenes River east-southeast
toward the oestenorueste and continues to a point well separated in
the middle of the jungle, where it is to determine the rapids and
falls of the Madeira River.

It is composed these mountains of crumbling sandstone, very ferruginous and generally red, similar
at all to those of the Sierra de San-Jose de Chiquitos and also to those of the last foothills of
the mountains, going down towards the north and northeast of Cochabamba. This stone Sandstone
is a compact whole hidden layer at an angle of twelve or fifteen degrees. These layers, which seem
to stretch it out to far to the north, going to finish near River Iten, where they are disguised,
over a width of more than a league, by crowding ferruginous, in perfectly horizontal streaks, which
contain much iron hydrate. These conglomerations, entirely identical to those of Chiquitos,
and even tell you also to the Corrientes province, represent exactly my field Guaraniana.
I have found thus in this part of the province, the tertiary crowding Guaraniana as ferruginous
level of the ancient land, in the clay layer with hydrated iron nuggets, similar to those of Corrientes,
and finally, the Pampa area with limos, all of which is covered by modern alluvium.

Guaporé stream introduced me everywhere, on its left bank, landslides modern, which extend to
a point that is ten miles before reaching the confluence, where I believed again noted a considerable
layer of reddish silty clay, mixed with floods: the right bank is composed meantime, for the space
of a few leagues from ferruginous crowding often concealed by landslides after floods land and
flooded only to the confluence of the Mamore. I have not offered this on its banks, almost
all along its course, anything but modern alluvial sand. I noticed however, some leagues Exaltation
down in the middle of a forest located short distance to the river,
a small isolated hill on the plain, to which I could not approach;
but they assured me that was composed of crumbly sandstone, perhaps
similar to the stone Carboniferous sandstone.

Also found muddy red clay beneath alluvium in around the missions of exaltation, of Santa Ana, San-Pedro,
San-Xavier, Trinidad and Loreto.

Chapare river current has taught me everywhere modern alluvial sandy, I believed noted, however,
on many points, which were hidden under these alluvial clays muddy, but this only happens
to a great distance from the mountains. The first QUIJARRO manifest at the confluence of the rivers
Coni and San-Mateo. I've seen it done this in the river Securi. In all the places where no current
passes over land and tours of the waters, I saw a thick layer of alluvial soil, sand formed
fine clay or brown, hornaguera, which conceals a silty clay, yellow or red, a very different
time and come from causes clearly announced prior to the current state of affairs. A report about
the age of alluvial assured me completely.
