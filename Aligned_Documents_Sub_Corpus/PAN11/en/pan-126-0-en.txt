 The old caught
him by the left ear and gave him three or four pulls hard. The dog a howl of pain. Then he took
the other, and many other tugs. More and more still sad howl. Fulfilled his duties with the
law of the land, shrank mastiff back to the table in the barn, but not releasing it under some
curses and blasphemies. This scene was repeated a few times a day, provided that any person suspected
as now arrived for purposes hostile to the rectory. El Cuco deplored in their hearts that had
not shaved best ears.

- Afternoon, D. Gil - said the old, angry expression suddenly changing the other smiling melosísima,
showing who knew him.

Fr Gil, who was not happening as much, answered very politely and
asked D. Restituto.

- The priest must be toward the barn.

Come in, D. Gil. I'll call him.

- No need: I will fetch it myself. "The barn is here? ...

- Yes, sir, here behind the house.

He turned it all the priest, went a few steps in a dirty alley, and
found a miserable factory made of uncut stones from the river only,
with a rickety door.

It was locked, and nobody was there before. Going to leave that place and come back to home behind
the barn when he heard the sound of voices. He went thither, and found, in fact, Don Restituto,
not a little surprised the suit and the situation in which he appeared.

The old priest was wearing corduroy trousers wide, patched, as they
spend the peasants through the land, wore on her feet clogs with socks
of coarse cloth, shiny coat through use, and spinning linen shirt
he loves, without collar or anything like it.

Was the costume of a peasant, without removing it or put anything. But what really made pilgrim
and outlandish attire is that the old head and wore a greasy cap.

Fr Gil was shocked by that figure, and more astonished, when he warned the occupation that
the pastor was delivered. I was, kneeling on one knee on the ground, skinning a calf. He helped
in the operation servant.

The animal had spread between the two, most raw it now. He turned his head D. Restituto steps,
feeling, and being with young fellow stood up and came toward him with bloody hands clutching a huge
knife.

- What miracle is this, man? The future priest Peñascosa deigns to visit us! ... Look, do not shake
hands, because you see how I have it.

Good health, right? ... Not here no novelty.

D. Restituto was you, familiar to all young clerics he from first interview. When Gil had explained
the reason for his trip, showed some surprise, but was quick to respond:

-
Well, well.

I will close immediately. Go home, and wait.

But the young man expressed a desire to go to church.

- To the church? - Said in surprise. Among them was customary confession at home .-- All right.
No problem. Calls to love the key, and wait there. It will not take.

Would to God that had taken more! And above all, would have had time pluguiérale to wash. For
the theologian dismissed him a whiff of cutting down slaughterhouse. While confession lasted, and
lasted a long time, Fr Gil could hardly think of anything else. He felt suffocated for that foul
smell; acudíanle some worries and sweats that were about several to deprive of sense sometimes.
Don Restituto felt great satisfaction in order to get shine your old battery theological propositions.
Each question his troubled penitent offered him, he answered triumphantly with a Latin text.
As the veteran off-hook with joy their weapons to the signal of war, the old opponent of the
Lancia picked lectoralía of memory texts already Perronne rusty and Balmes. How can one doubt
of immortality the soul, when it is something simple, and simple things can not be broken? Who
dare to imagine that the Catholic Church may someday die, when there bleeding Christ's words:
"The gates of hell shall not prevail (non pr?valebunt?)"

How be given more credence to the word of men than of God? What! Divine Wisdom has said: "For
this I was born and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth? "And this testimony
is not is clear and well illustrated in the works visible exceed the natural power, for example,
in healing the sick, the resurrection of the dead and other wonderful miracles performed by
Our Lord Jesus Christ and the Apostles?

Fr Gil received absolution, promising not to be insane or an idiot, so don judged Restituto
who doubted the truths revealed by angelic ministry. Shortly after kissing the hand not well purged
from the blood of the bullock, and when he had risen to praying before an altar of repentance, our
priest fell ill. Had to leave immediately from the church, seized with violent nausea. On the
back porch all food. The priest brought him home, and tried to cure him with a cup of sage,
the supreme remedy used against all the ailments that afflict mankind, but his young companion,
I knew what to expect about your condition, obstinately refused all medication. The pastor then
went on to show the garden, in which encryption was so proud and in depth of theological knowledge.
It was full of fruit trees and vegetables. There was not a flower or ornamental shrub. From there
they went to a vast lawn, where he had a few raising operators wall. D. Restituto began giving
instructions, adopted a number of things failed other, forgetting all about his guest. One of
the workers took him to the mill had stopped because the son of Cosimo had deviated above the
water to dry the bed of the creek and catch eels. D. Restituto was furious and announced plans
Cosme to sue and ask for damages and losses.

Of it is not mocked; was determined to make his property was respected. From there he ran into the
cornfields, and the pastor was a fellow with extreme joy the great state of plants. The water
had come just in time, but most of the water was due to the large quantity of fertilizer had
missed.

- You say: where you can make D. Restituto much manure to a land like this, fifteen days of oxen?
I'll tell you. I, though I have nine heads of cattle, could not pay even half of the land
that I have. Here's intelectus! In every parish, as you You know, there are a lot of wretches, to
whom it is not possible for them out one quarter or baptisms or marriage
or anything.

However, these calamities forced them living to take from time to time outside their homes (commonly
pens) a good amount of dry leaf or gorse. With water and the passage of pedestrians and cattle
manure is crossing becomes after some time pass.

When it is well rotted and I'll bring me forming lot until the time comes to distribute the
land. What?

From there they jumped to an inheritance of meadow. D. Restituto, as it was, let out a sharp,
mocking laugh, he did raise his head to his young companion and look at him curiosity.

- This is the meadow below the mill ... the meadow below the mill, you already know ... How? Do
not you know the history of this field? Well, much has run the town ... Belonged to the meek
of the parish, and had been trasconejado when selling them. I had, and nobody in the parish dared
to denounce him. But here was a rich landlord called Lino (already busted, thank God, last year),
and that he was eager Lino the meadow. At the end gave the breath in the administration, keeping
the hand, not wanting to be wrong with me, and brought it to auction. Two days before done,
came here the very hypocritical and I said, 'Father, I do stand in the meadow below the mill, but
if you I want to stay home. "The rascal probe for the amount I planned to offer. "No, I do
not want, you can top it when you like," I replied. The man, seeing that I went to auction, and
knowing that any neighbor was in a position to throw, they were promised very happy. Lancia Y sent
to his cousin. But this road trip we went to of rocks, and spoke highly relevant, represents sin incurred
goods topping of the Church, I promised him rent the pasture and
put him forty dollars in hand.

What was the man do? It was a Lancia, finished him off and handed it to me to me in the next
breath ... What a laugh that was assembled in the town, buddy! Lino ill with rabies, and as
was presented occasion that was after two months, coming from a pilgrimage, he stuck a knife
to his cousin ... But, go, good rooms that cost him so puñaladita!

He did not do ten thousand.

As the sun went down, after having taught a winery, he had built for cider, D. Restituto led
back to his penitent home and invited him to chocolate. But the toilet was still not good.
Also in a hurry.

Refused all treat and started Peñascosa way. The priest accompanied him some distance.

Out and understanding their properties and the continent reflective Peñascosa toilets that his
heart was seized with serious thoughts, D. Restituto wanted to return to the load though he seemed
well established that all doubts of his companion were only that pumps soap, which breaks with
a blow anyone who has even hailed Sacred Theology.

- You look out, dear - he said with unlimited protection, - the truths of faith are contrary
to reason, but above it. The opposite of truth, what is? False, is not it? And how has to be taken
for false what is divinely confirmed? The things we know by divine revelation can not be contrary
to natural knowledge, because the natural knowledge also comes from God, because God is the
author of our nature.

Because the ratio exceeds one thing should not be considered as contrary to it. Thus says San Augustine
as truth that which is shown by the holy books, is the Old, New Testament is in any way may find
otherwise. The human mind can, of course, aware of the existence of God, our intelligence course
in the way of this life begins his knowledge of the meaning, and therefore, the things that do not
fall under the senses can not perceive it as by the senses can colleagues their knowledge ...

The
evening was cold and quiet. The countryside stretched under heaven transparent, reflecting in
shades of green, clear, yellow, the rays of setting sun. The sea was a stain blue yonder. The
two priests had crossed the main building, where women sat at the front door, gave them a good
afternoon and went to kiss children hand. In the region were open, slightly undulating, which
characterizes the coast at that country. Fr Gil, silent, he walked with his head down, lifting
it from time to time to straighten his eyes wandering, lost, into the distance, the red soil
and bare rocks that festooned the sea. The sun died firing his last flare, which reddened part of
the skyline. And there came a slight breeze that colored frozen fingers and tip of the nose,
invigorating the muscles and causing tingling in his eyes. The countryside was preparing to
sleep, breathed a sigh of welfare welter of voices and lows, gnashing
of cars, ringing of bells and the murmur of waves, melting everything
and harmonized to the extent the limitless plain.

Fr Gil was trying to meet his old arguments companion was teeming with deep and solemn voice. Were
the same as had been hearing for seven years in the chairs of the seminar Lancia.

By leaving the path and enter a narrow street they saw a herd of cattle
moving slowly.

D. Restituto interrupted his theological and put his hand to his
eyes by way screen.

- Are my cows - said softly.

Before they arrived he shouted to the servant that led:

- What is Brown, limping?

- He should get a spine.

- Then when he arrives at the register pen well and the bags, you know? ... It is the best cow I have - he
said softly, turning to his companion.

And as I was among them, the priest approached caring, paternal, and started the Brown to stroke
his forehead, while lowering his head to look at her legs.

- To, Brown! ... To! To! ... Spine should be, because the legs do not see anything. After that it
serves the wash well with a little wine and rosemary ... Teresa gave
it to you prepare ... Born and raised in the house, do you know? -
Continued turning to the toilet with the face tenderly .-- Me D. was
Jovino, your parishioners, sixty dollars for it ... As if to give
me eighty!

This gem not leave the house. What width of breasts, eh? What back room! (And he softly stroked
with the palm of your hand.) does not give much milk, but everything is butter ... This one also
born at home ... Quiet, Guinda, still! ... It is more awkward than the other ... One heifer
still ... No a fortnight ago has given birth for the first time ...
It collapses in milk ... Repairs, repairs that udder!

You can not go with it! ... Each jet off as the finger ... Look, look ... Quiet, Cherry! ...

And
get off a shot the animal's teats and output two or three squirts
of milk moist soil.

At the same time turned his face, flushed by the position as well as by joy, to the young priest.
He smiled for complacency, but immediately separated sight, it was unable to suppress his revulsion.

He
got back up and herd them too. D. Restituto picked up the thread again his speech.

- I know some say that reason can not prove that God is, and this only can be obtained by faith
and revelation ... Crasísimo error. The falsity of this view manifested by the art show, which
follows the effects of causes, and the same order of science, because
if there is no knowable substance out of the sensitive there will
be no science nor supernatural, as they say in quarto Metaphysicorum.

Must distinguish what is known per se simpliciter, and what is known quoad nos. Simpliciter
God is in itself, is known ...

D. Restituto had a most happy memory.
After so many years remembered very well his Dogmatic, and poured
into Castilian recited with the same emphasis as if he had invented
