 At ten months of marriage, a girl had Facia, and without having achieved the year, her husband,
the people who had disappeared a week ago, came home at night, broken and disheveled; gave two
slaps his wife because he affectionately asked how he had gone, where had gone and what was
coming, and while threatening to open in channel if anyone had he had not seen hide nor hair
from the previous week, made a mess of hastily trinkets he had left at home and with others,
it seems, like it was pulling out of wide pockets of his clothes and disappeared without saying
goodbye to the house facia and the people lost in the darkness of the mountains ... until today.

After
two days of this, came to town a couple of the civil guard and an
indictment of Judge of the party asking for him.

It was the theft of a church and a stabbing the poor clerk who tried to prevent ... Two birds
of the gang had already fallen into the trap, and are looking to the third, the captain of
her, married the famous baratijero Tablanca ... and three or four parishes of Spain and the
Indies, according to their background was process.

With this coup was shocked the neighborhood, took Don Celso hands
to the head, and aged Fifteen years suddenly poor Facia.

The rogue was heard only fugitive who walked by the republics of America, recently escaped
from Spain and was given up for dead many years ago or dragging a chain.

Shortly after being abandoned, sad and sorry the hapless Facia, picked it up again Don Celso by love
of God, and love of God is also not said a word since then that relates even remotely close
to his madness or his misfortune, and his hand was growing Tona girl, ignoring the real reasons
for the sadness and bitterness of her mother, and living in the belief that his father had been
a good man who, like many others, had gone to "the other side" to improve your fortune, and that she
had died without succeeding, after year.

Such is the substance of what he told me Chisco. This could be explained only on arrechucho that of
Facia, and also could not explain, of all kinds, the case even after
known the history of the gray woman, who was interesting, was not
to get into unscrupulous inquiries, and I went.

With two guides so complacent and so experts like mine, soon met the main paths, ravines and
gorges, wildlife and flora of the mountains nearest the contour; I lost the fear I instilled
the "hints" or discovered along the cliffs, being be noted that there is no way small or large
is not a hint continued, and gained the ease and strength of my legs lacked the same principle to
support me on uphill slopes than down, ie if he was, because it is the absolute truth in the saying
instead, that in this craggy region there is no other plain the room of Don Celso. No climbed
to great heights, because it shows me much tempting of that caste, nor did my rough guide to
great lengths to encourage me to overcome the inclinations of my complexion relatively lazy, but
why not let meet my little curiosity in the contemplation of beautiful scenery. Finally, I
also met major ports in winter and summer, which send their cattle in the valleys surrounding,
and admired the freshness of those brañas ("flocks") in tight, thin grass, real big bald in
the middle of dense forests and vegetation powerful. Each These plaques are, in the ports of summer,
a hut, and the other a 'winter' hut to shelter people who herd cattle, and the winter, building
large and robust of lime and stone, barn and stables for a good herd of cattle. Usually, each
winter correspond to the cattles of eight or ten co-owners of "hazas" or contiguous parts of the
brane. Some of these winter were already occupied. At night the cattle eat pinned to the manger,
of "priming" the barn, mowed in August hazas, pasta day outdoors, while time consent, the care
of their owners, who after leaving gathered at dusk down to sleep in the village, unlike in summer,
during which they sleep huddled in the hut, leaving the cabin "acurriada", ie, the flock gathered
around it. The stud are more independent and free, and stood, wild state, where less we thought.

Pete
was very rough, and it happened more than once I go very careless and feel my back a ferocious
roar that made me make two turns in the air.

It was the shotgun's gaznápiro: a escopetón older and patched the jokes, he had made one of
hers. Pito not tired to tell anyone or taking the slightest precaution when a part is put throw,
ie, as he peered, both in the air than for Matos, who through the mountains is over, because
for a weapon the size of yours and the stuck shrapnel that had not far and fences: it threw
in the face, and above of my shoulder or between the legs of Chisco, as requested by the situation
of things and people, without getting tired of saying 'there goes that', "puuunnn!" It was
like the end of world: the mountains tremble, and the piece was not only dead, but in tatters,
because He did not lose once, or a single grain piece of shrapnel escopetón.

And the piece was a hare, a fox, a bobcat, a "Aeschylus" (squirrel), a pheasant or a vermin of
regular size, it is very noticeable that in this and other similar
strains are animals he encounters one going for a walk, even for sites
nearest to the people clothing as elsewhere in the world, is not it,
with the domestic cat, loving dog or poultry.

Chisco behaved very differently than his comrade: everything was unchanged in most at least that
its placidity of the continent. If I put a piece shot with a hand me stopped smoothly, with
the other pointed to me, and with an expressive gesture or half word
I implied that was down to me.

If I wandered the coup, as was almost always, he'd he amended, if not anticipated the shotgun
from where less could Chorcos wait, and I noticed in the first case, some malicious pleasure
in the look me directed, while kicking the victim on the floor or down from the sky tumbling
as if to say: "Nah, you how not val Vey a pitu that shotgun, to be as nice as it is?" But Chisco
are greatly mistaken, because the weapon was excellent, and very decent ammunition it. What failed
was the hunter, that being so clever as I was in the shooting White did not know where they
walked when they had to throw on the run or the flight. The case is that this stupidity came to
spite me, and contributed much to it, rather than looks Chisco syrupy, the brutal laughter that
solemnized Chorcos each amendment was their grungy espingardón the failures of my gun. And so I
arrived in mortification, having put my five senses in this business, I got soon, if not the
skill of my companions, to behave in a way, other than "amendable" by none I missed shots. This
cessation of smiles and laughter of a another, and I felt I downloaded the mind of a great
weight, because that weaknesses are strung together of life, and has never been told the truth
as the pompous Don Hermogenes: "There is little or much at all. "

Twice accompanied us on these expeditions, exploration and mixed game, the priest Don Sabas, but
no weapon that pinto club that served as a cane. Was it something like gunpowder decline in
spending in those bursts of pure pleasure, and called them "creatures of God" those who were in
the magnitude scale, from wild boar and deer down. But how knew the full scale complete and
true, and those mountains and other such, and how respect he heard
the two men, as hunters, both are growing at my side, and how happy
I listened and I watched him this way ... and many others, for those
without eyes or the rough ears of Chisco witted and his comrade!

Because it's true that this word hombrazo so dull and so poor in resources in the party My uncle,
a bit more pleasant and loose officiating in the church where he spoke from the altar more fairly
to the case and the extent of understanding of his rustic parishioners, in the heights of the
mountain did not seem to himself. It was under him, to be much, the interest to know in a few
colorful phrases and the news I asked, not to satisfy I supplied the Chisco and his partner,
about the great beasts in their hideouts in those mountains and how
to catch them, trouble sets in which they had seen him and As this
was related to near and far, their descriptions of journeys made by
this or that port during an unbridled "cellerisca" their risk of death
among these snowdrifts, sometimes at fault and clinging to life itself,
and most of them for love that of others: the rest was, for me, the
way they "fall" on the mountain, like a statue master in its own right
pedestal; that their way of enjoying the nature that surrounded, swelling
it by smell, by sight and even every pore his body, so after this
surfeit, was reading me aloud as he passed his eyes through the pages
of this immense book so close and in Greek to me, the ease that was
within the rough simplicity of their language, the right word, the
picturesque touch, note exact box needed to be well observed and well
meaning, the role played in this work of true artist, his painting
club, stressing in air and the end of the arm extended, the force
of words, the folding of the humble cassock, gently moved by the continuous
air blowing from the heights, the head erect, eyes sparkling, his
hat down over his neck, correctness and elegance, in short, all lines
of this living sculpture ... Oh! diéranle the poor priest in plain
land in the open valley, in the city, a miter, the papal tiara in
the capital the Christian world, and would give them death: breathing
at will, to live at ease, to know God, to feel in all its immensity,
to worship and Don Sabas serve as served and worshiped him, he needed
the continued spectacle of those grand altar of that wilderness, rugged
and lonely, with their peaks vanished so often in the clouds that
blended with the sky.

None of this, how beautiful it was and so was the view, read or estimate the two monsoon how deep
respect for Don Sabas had only become a priest of the parish and man of unquestionable competence
as soon as they reached them.

My temper, in the scale of the sensible, not even reached the level of the innumerable as for
"feel natural" need to see reproduced on canvas and embellished by fantasy the painter and resources
of the palette, and yet, I read something I had never read in nature every time I looked in
the light of the impressions of Don Sabas perched on the tops of the mountains. And it was much
appreciated and even admired for me this miracle cure Tablanca poor; miracle that had never
been to me no pictures, no books or speeches.

On the last occasion for those coming home the two, I surrendered, and hastily, and it so fresh
and so lively as if it had not left the place, told me he had seen everything me until then it
was like to see nothing and had to do something that I had promised.

- What you want when you want - I answered trembling, for its commitment to acquiring with the
man for whom gambling excursions were a thing to me out of joint.

- Well, my account is the case - he replied - and there is no more to say.

My visits to the village thorough examination alone and I made my own, leaving appear in it as
the careless, to surprise the best in their intimacy. Knowing "Sight" to your neighborhood at
Mass the previous Sunday, I had noticed very strongly monotonous uniformity "cut", so to speak, and
even clothing.

All the boys used the 'lastic' red and green all the old, and all women had the "blanket" or similar
color shawl and similarly crossed over his chest and kidneys; everywhere and all kinds abounded
blond and the curved line, not without grace, with a tendency the
square to the shoulders, everyone walked, talked and moved with the
same calm, and in all faces, old and young, you could see the same
expression of goodness in some tinge of fright, as if the continuing
vision of the great masses in whose shadow they live those people,
the had frightened and suspense.

I did not have one iota to rectify these impressions, received at a glance that the whole neighborhood,
when I tried studied in further detail on the contrary, resultóme that the monotony of their way and
clothing to be well confirmed by, had to add another monotony less salient by the way: that
of their rooms. All Tablanca houses, with very rare exceptions, I found the same plane built
by: the ground floor, for livestock stables sheep and goats, on the floor, family room and
the kitchen ceiling without the roof, and above the loft, bounded by a vertical board on the edge
corresponding to kitchen, forming with the three remaining walls
what might be called "smoke box."

Outdoor accessory to a block and a cattle barn, and stuck to her or the house, an orchard very
small.

Just as in the kitchen of my uncle spoke all over the place for young and old, old and young. As a
characteristic of that language, such as jacks and Hs oes as esu
end gratia "jermosu" and "jormigueru" with beautiful mound.

But as so melodic and rhythmic cadence is giving the sentence, which
are not the rough a word is unpleasant to the ear: on the contrary,
and have expressions and idioms of taste so signally classic, that
this and the rhythmic chant that accompany them, listening a conversation
between those mountaineers, came to my mind the "music" of our old
romances.

It is also very noteworthy that none of these peculiarities in the way of being and expression,
undergoes alteration visible by changing places or customs. It's very common there to migrate
during the summer the men servants to the provinces as distant as those of Aragon to hold the
office of sawing wood, or those of Castile, or work implements chestnuts, to exchange for wheat
or cash. I spoke with these men, newcomers the valley after many months away from him, and did not
find the slightest difference that distinguished in dress or speech, or how to conduct themselves
at all, its other neighbors; nor have I found after looking for her to try, very noticeable signs that
interest them outside their homes, rather than the issue that brings them, as if they only
had eyes heart to see and feel the native homeland.

The race is as healthy and beautiful I have ever known in Spain, and I think they are a prominent
part it continued fitness of the mountain, the abundance of milk and the integrity of customs public
and domestic. I learned with astonishment that there was no place in a tavern, and that Property
of the City, who sold the recipe and came to almost every consumer I drink at home, from where
it was, by force of habit, which was very poorly regarded the man who showed instincts' bartenders,
"and much worse that was carried away from them, albeit rarely.
