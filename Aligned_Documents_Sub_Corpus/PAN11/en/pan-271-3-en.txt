 It is an old man who knows half
world and know more than Lycurgus. He has traveled to Chile, Bolivia and Peru, and know every
inch the land where these hours have to be fighting armies.

I got curious, I sat up in bed and said aloud: - "Don Salvador, if not very sleepy, you want
to get a little? Take a mate and chat "Don Salvador .-- up immediately, rolled back the stone
she sat up close to me, and smiling sat down again.

- Imagine, Don
Salvador, who for three long days that I walk between the hills, alone
and deploy the lips, because the others are always behind.

- We are
accustomed, sir.

But once, many years ago, I too, in a long trip, I got tired of walking alone, find a partner
(which would not have more worth found!), and put me in a case that
I have not ever forget.

- Was he a villain?

- No, sir, but if you
have patience, I'll tell how it was that, so that later you tell it,
but do not believe it.

But I swear it's true, and if not, ask about it in Peru friends say where you go.

Don Salvador was when I told the curious adventure, which I started
writing again I could hardly, in my plain and simple style, not daring
to imitate the special language picturesque and adorned the narrator.

Don Salvador was in San Juan, in his youth as a laborer, had traveled almost the whole Republic
mules driving from one point to another, under the orders of a foreman.

Thus as found in Salta, where he came to serve an old and known carrier. There was few years,
then, always in his office, went to Peru, he made a small capital is well the game soon dissipated,
is forced to return to work, took the chasqui profession or own for
which he did indefatigable strength suitable for horseback riding,
or more properly, mule.

But that office, in a land where the Indian and running more quickly than the beast and can pass
through places where it does not risk, it was not very lucrative indeed. No is my purpose
to narrate the vicissitudes of the life of Don Salvador, how the interior of Peru passed to
the coast, and later became a miner in Copiapo, then going back to the Republic Argentina and
finally occupied the honorable position of mail that played for ten years.

It was one of those trips as chasqui when the case came up he was referring.
