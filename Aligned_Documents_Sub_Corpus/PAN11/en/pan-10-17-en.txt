 

As the night went without asking any street name, and who knows where you intends to go and
insists on hiding it. Doña Manuela and Leocadia was out on the balcony, and the last past him on
a bluff and go for the bow to the Plaza Mayor, had a sentence was the abbreviation of the situation
by running through the family.

- How strange it is me! It seems impossible to be home!

When he returned, after an hour, was not where he was or what he did, just talk the hustle
and bustle of the court. Then he said:

- Many have walked through the streets, and how many stamps there are ugly and obscene in some stores!
But while wearing habits, no one has gotten me.

- What then? - Pepe
said - you thought you were going to eat?

- No wonder I had been
insulted.

As he is free now ungodliness and haunts us and abuser who wants us! ...

- Laugh about it, and you will be convinced it's a lie.

There is no such wickedness, nor such persecution: In short, you
will see a little walk around Madrid.

- I warn you that I care little.

Do not I have good hands?

XIII

Although sleep and travel fatigue and honored him, were not mentioned that night without writing
Tirso a long letter, which perhaps had something to do with the output that was in the afternoon.
While Dona Manuela and Leocadia's father slept, he began to write.

The lamplight shone full and angled his face sallow, his eyes were large, looking brown and stubborn,
a high forehead, somewhat spoiled by depression towards the temples, the tough lips and ledges and
rough features, such as wrong size carved. Dábanle aspect hardness the sharp brow, which involuntarily
frown, and a dark sheen was left safe at the beard, even recently shaved. Feelings seemed a man
with a late, but strong and durable, ready to turn the firm into stubbornness and coldness
in violence. Its sweetness, when the show was to be enforced, his anger, sincere, all accused in the
character own energy before the fight that complacency of the will. His soul possessed grim
devotion, should feel better the earnest proselytizing the sweet Peter Arbuckle God love Santa
Teresa. His priestly progeny was not among the meek of heart, but between those clerics who imagined
heaven's door open with the hatchet to fight Moors. His religious fervor had hints of war enthusiasm.
San Pablo cutting the ear of Roman soldier to defend Christ, or battling in Santiago Clavijo, were
a thousand eyes times more glorious than outlawing Hilary force. Some worship the Lord, others
fight by dilating his kingdom on earth was their Tirso. While the Church had unbelievers to
gag, to defend privileges or privileges require the contemplative life seemed to him own narrow
minds.

       A mystical readings that @ the imagination, preferring the legends
of daring missionaries who are the knights of faith.

A verse liked the Gospel above all: he who says: "I have come to bring peace to the world, but
the sword. "

* * * * *

The next morning he rose early and did not leave.

Leocadia was listening to read newspapers his father, although he
remained a long time with them, not say a word about purpose of his
trip.

When the night was sleeping Leocadia Dona Manuela and Don José, he told his daughter:

- Pepe often come too late?

- No, almost always before noon.

- Then wait for him today and tell him to come into the bedroom: I have to talk to him.

Mother and daughter guessed what it was, but he suggested no suspicion.

All equally surprised by the long silence of Tirso.

It was really weird to not give the any explanation about the trip.

Perhaps came only to see their parents, but this was not credible
who missed so many years without it.

One guess was that it was logical Would he have come to expect? Would
I want to be canon?

Who would it support?

Before midnight came Pepe, and Leocadia, who was waiting for him,
went with him to the bedroom his parents, where Dona Manuela and Don
José asleep waiting disclosed.

Leocadia without a word heard the short dialogue that father and
son argued.

- Pepito, is not it hits you?

- A lot, but you miss
the cause.

- Is that not a word ... Do you not told you anything?

-
Nor.

- Been here two days ... I do not understand what could be.

What do you think?

- No, Dad. If you speak, hear, and if not, let time pass. Already
know.

Has been home to her parents? Welcome is.

Do not you trust us? Well, not them up by force.

- It's cold, indifferent ...

- No: he should be. It is time to talk or want to bother now.

Besides, you know I think: we have tried, we do not know, how we
love ourselves as hell we love it and I? - Y Leocadia nodded her head
yes.

- You're right, son, but I loathe you have it.

The light of a candle that Pepe had made in the next room shakily
lit the table, and the old man's face appeared in print the curious
restlessness that he was concerned.

The bed was half undone, because he was fidgeting in her until she
saw enter your child, and occasionally ran his eyes to his wife, as
astonished that I could sleep free from doubts and suspicions that
he was experiencing.

- Oh, to rest, Dad.

Leocadia Pepe and kissed their father and two children, and left.

Passing of the bedroom Tirso, noted that snoring.

- Do you hear?
- She asked.

- Yes, listen, listen how you lose sleep over the excitement
of being at home.

- Goodbye, Jimmy, see you tomorrow.

- Abur, puppet,
ugly.

- Tonto, look like a boy.

- At the foot of you, madam, ugly,
hideous.

During the following days, Tirso kept identical save: no way out, talked of things indifferent, shunning
all talk about his past, avoiding features of intimacy and acting as have not heard what he disliked.
When eating, sit last in the table, muttering the Benedicite between
his teeth, he knew that others had to pray it, and go at night to
be collected rosary from his pocket, leaving him in his hand to his
room.

The first Sunday he spent in the house he rose more than usual and
was praying over while, but did not leave or mass. Leocadia, taking
a moment he saw him go into the dining room looking for a breviary
called Pepe:

- Come, come and see what has put that in the bedroom.

I have come to make his bed, and look how I feel this. It's nice, huh?

Tirso had covered the glass of the window overlooking the garden with bits of paper brightly
colored, married forming bad taste and whimsical shapes. Sunlight, stained and distorted by
the improvised transparent, giving the room a pitch variegated. It looked like a caricature of a Gothic
window. Furthermore, on the head the bed was against the wall with chewed bread a picture of
a very beautiful San Jose, with curly hair on low heat, rosy cheeks and holding the palm of
a hand a child standing, as if to teach him to make puppets, while the other brandished a stick
with more flowers than bow Seville. On the opposite wall had a chrome: latest Ecumenical Council,
meeting old dressed in red, sitting in a semicircle as bishops in the first act of the African,
among which stood out for their white robes, a man who came to tell secrets in his ear a dove coming
through a window, looking like being wrapped in a light beam. Pepe covers everything at a glance
and made a gesture, between laughs and contempt, telling his sister:

- As these doodles had to buy them out that made the day he arrived,
because certainly has not set foot in the street.

- Certainly.

In the afternoon, while Don José was asleep, the mother in the kitchen
and dressing Pepe to go see Peace in walking distance, Tirso spoke
to his sister dearly, but violent to appear calm.

- Have not gone
to church today ...

- I made the chocolate for all, I've combed hair
and mom, I have composed a tattered a cloak was in your room, Lord,
what a cloth so hard!

I scan the room and I down on the purchase ...

- I mean, here everything, absolutely everything, is before God.

Suddenly, taking a newspaper that was on a chair, read the title: La Libertad Spanish.

- What is this? - And touching only the tips of the fingers, as if
afraid to get dirty he dropped to the ground muttering

- Papelucho
atheists!

- Do not throw it, which then asks for a weapon and Pepe
breaks loose!

Tirso went into his room and Leocadia was to help his mother, but the priest went out immediately
back to the room with the haggard face, and took the paper, crumpled
it hard and made a ball, threw it into a corner.

As the hall was very short, Leocadia heard the rustling paper crushed
and ran back to his brother while ere it closed in his room.

The girl knew what had just happened.

Tirso held before her anger at seeing the paper, but then, left alone, the anger overcame prudence.

The
prospect of a dispute between two brothers, who could sour, frightened Leocadia deeming it happened
a threat to the peace of the house. His good sense told him I was forced to hide it from Pepe.
But how?

After much thought, after trying in vain unwrinkle the newspaper with
his hands, took him to the kitchen and straightened with a hot iron,
leaving it to his brother after find him without seeing him Tirso.

When evening came Pepe Millan, who used to eat there on Sunday, leaving much of the night with
Don Jose, for being near Leocadia. Presentation made him the father of his eldest son happily
ate all desktop and talked about politics, the only conversation
I had the privilege of diverting the poor old man, who was every moment
means to relate the events of that time with those of his youth, drawing
comparisons between men and different times.

Pepe had begun to read Spanish La Libertad, which asked Leocadia and she brought without a single
wrinkle, to the surprise of Tirso, but this remained silent, willing to listen Miller that, looking
from time to time to the girl, holding a dialogue with Don José. Said old:

- Here are not only clumsy, if the liberal party is divided, we will see things sad.

- Already we are seeing. Does it seem to you little development left to take to war?

- If what you have done now for 69 Prim! ... Of course, sooner or later, will to do: with no
progress Conventions anything.

I remember that when the de Vergara, who were actually lost us after the Liberal Party said
the crown the Queen, he was treated like a black-Espartero cornered
him at once, to official Carlist favored them much, they said we were
all brothers, and ours, which winter had beaten in denim pants ...
went to the Philippines or as Fernando Poo looked suspicious.

- That
and similar things so many Republicans in the new generation, because
we convinced that there is no alternative.

- That is very dangerous:
people are not ready.

- And since no one teaches anything, does he
have to learn at their own expense.

- Is that today there is no civic
virtues.

If you had known Mendizabal, then to Olózaga, now so fallen ...:
it was he who called progressives who said before exalted.

It has always been more liberal enthusiasm now. If you only saw what indignation 40 year unfolded
against Toreno and Martinez de la Rosa, requested the extension because of half tithe, and
even the whole tithe and the scoop! Well they would not approve Espartero the famous Councils
Act!

- Enthusiasm sterile, and have often been drowned in blood.

- In that you are right. Was condemned to death for anything. Since the execution of Manzanares
sixty partners and twenty of Alicante, May 8, until the Sergeants
June 22, has last year without any such brutality, except to Zurbano,
and the death of Mariana de Pineda, for whom it was necessary to make
a new club, because my neck was very skinny ...

- In spite of this
- broke Pepe - there are those who look favorably upon the Restoration
and who fights for Don Carlos.

If Spain are monarchists, and especially Bourbon is because nobody
reads contemporary history.

- Finally, my children, you know that
I have a good memory: well, since December 43 to Christmas Eve of
44, two hundred and fourteen people were shot, most by liberals.

-
Have you right, Don Jose, and paid the crown to the Liberal Party,
first by the father and then the daughter, had made so many sacrifices
...

- Well if you do have family holy spirit - Pepe said - we were
without a drop of blood.

Upon hearing this joke wicked Tirso could not take it anymore. Praise Mendizabal, the reference
to tithing and the scoop, the horror of the executions of revolutionaries, the liberal spirit
throbbing in the conversation, made him harm, but to exploit what a grace the third person of
the Holy Trinity, set the height to their outrage. Then, rising from his seat, approached the
group formed by Pepe and Miller with Don José and, as before the
balcony, on which stood clear opening its slender black figure and
said sternly:

- It seems incredible that men talk and opinion!

Miller stopped in deference to his friend, and Don Jose because he repented of having said
such things, leaving room for the wrath of Tirso: Pepe, more passionate, he faced it, and while
talking moderately, he said:

- It is natural to have sympathy for the reactionary parties, are those that protect you; but
do you deny that we can not look good for the Church? Always, and renege on their origin,
has been the enemy of freedom and democracy.

- Freedom!

Freedom! What for? " And what is democracy? allowing them to send crooks. Democracy! How many
pounds of potatoes are bought with that?

- No! freedom is what Christ commanded you to preach democracy is that which hath allowed you,
clerics and monks, born among the most humble, climbing posts highest
in the world.

- For Mendizabal was a thief.

- That is a nonsense
that has nothing to do with what we say.

And look, do not fret; but what I like Mendizabal, is for being who has done more harm to the
Church.

- Hush, my children, hush! - Shouted Don José: - Are you
going to fight now?

I will not say much, but Mendizabal was a great man. Take care if you have had merit a fifth
of the 100,000 men!

Tirso made futile efforts to hide his disgust. In vain to calm those affected hear things. His displeasure
was not grief, but anger, seeing that he was wrong when, shortly set foot in the house, he imagined
that there was no devotion or belief.

His father was a progressive ridiculous that Espartero excited talking, and his brother a demagogue
atheist, of which make a mockery of God and Divine Providence, his mother a poor lady, whom he
imagined to be a saint because he was industrious, and a little girl
presumed Leocadia, who spent the morning embandolinándose hair.

There was no mass, or fasting, or praying; there was no bull, ate meat on Fridays and father
tolerated Pepe wicked jokes. Was to vent their anger about violence in apostrophes, of which
so often heard the gentlemen who frequented the house of Mr. Thaddeus,
but just looked at her brother pity, saying:

- You seem like Jews!

No greater insult conceived.

The women looked at the last words of dialogue, said gruffly, surprising
the news that there Wheels by political matters, Miller went to stand
beside Leocadia; Don Jose was silent, trying to find means of changing
the conversation, stood Tirso to the balcony, as challenging them
to all and ready to resume the dispute.

His figure was arrogant, more like soldiers ready to fight, that
man eager to convince After a while, as a champion who has waited
in vain for his adversary, left the room quietly.

Pepe and Miller went for a walk through the streets. In the portal, that he asked, referring
to the last scene:

- Have you heard?

- You are going to have much trouble.

- Would you believe that this is the time we do not know why you came?

- Was he in town Carlist relationships with people?

- Why do you ask?

- Be careful ... lest there come with some commission. Now stir a lot. Let's see if you give
the police a scare.

To print your father would be a disaster.
