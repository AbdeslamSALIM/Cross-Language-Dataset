that was impossible or at least very difficult to escape.

However useful that men are skilled, and very suitable for all, I can not deny that rarely
become absolutely necessary, notably when they are on top of a man of strong will and irresistible
power whom they serve and whose whim and markets are as posted. Don Andrés Rubio had, so to
speak, made to Don Paco, and so as he had done could be undone. There would be missing for this person
or persons to replace Don Paco, dividing their jobs, if one was not enough to fill them all
with same efficiency and skill.

Don Paco was fully aware of what was and what to expect and fear still don Andrew, so that much
gratitude as sighted prudence, he served with the highest zeal and loyalty and always tried to
please.

Don Paco, however, had misgivings about losing its elevated position
and enviable Privanza.

In addition to its rare credit, was holding on to very good knockers.
