 

The end of the novel can not be more tragic. If only considering the material and external Life
can not be more pessimistic. Soledad is helpless, and almost accused of thievery dishonored. Her
husband, who has returned from Buenos Aires and has taken part in a huge riot popular, died
of a gunshot captaining the mob. And the good D. Antonio, no person friend to care for him,
and among the rapacious clutches of their infamous cousins, unfortunately just his life.

But the singularity of this, which proves that style, beliefs and feelings the narrator and the
skylight that illuminates perhaps the most cruel and higher Disasters can exchange the evil
into good and make the poison antidote is that Angelito and Soledad, as hapless materially,
are worthy of envy and glory, and poor D. Antonio, who at the beginning of the novel almost
gives us is the object of scorn and laughter and fun, just to be loved and revered by readers.

He
let in the minds of them must be read after the novel is heartbreaking
nor depressive, but full of soft and religious consolation and truer
morality and higher.

And when this does not preclude, but agrees and arranges to entertainment pleasant to work in
this class have to bring with you (because if you were bored moral, morals become immoral, as it would
morally odious), these works deserve applause and meet business and discreetly in order to be proposed
novelist, delighting and teaching time, not annoy the spirit, without giving us a hard time, not
sad or oppress hearts.

I think the novel Mr. Montoto dutifully performed the said purpose. Therefore I am to celebrate, send
the author my warmest congratulations, and I get excited, as far
as my approval and reach my praise, to continue writing stories with
the wisdom that can be expected which already warns The four pennies
and celebrate.
