and confusion, and all that lovely set of impressions and dreams, regrets and memories, misfortunes

whose cover was a Honda! What future? ... The vague and unknown - infinite and marvelous -
that touches the heart in his dreams of hope, and that doubt covered with its shadow when the traveler
says: Who knows?
