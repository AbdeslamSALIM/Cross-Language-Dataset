 Quando So you find us, and we can only, I force them to labreis our land, and if not you
cut the noses and ears.

There was replicated as discrete reasoning. I went to the tilth of a black woman by keep my ears
and my nose, and after a year I rescued. Having seen all quanto good, beautiful and admirable
in the earth, I determined to see no more than my household gods:
I married in my country, I was a cuckold, and saw it was the most
pleasant condition of human life.

       

End of the voyages of castigating.

MICROMEGAS,

Philosophical history.

CHAPTER ONE.

Journey of a denizen of the world of the star Sirius to the planet Saturn.

There was one of the planets revolving around the star called Sirius, a boy much talent, whom
I had the honor of meeting in the last journey he made to our paltry nest. Micromegas was his
name, a name that falls perfectly to all large, and had eight leagues high, I mean twenty-four
thousand five steps geometric calipers.

Some algebraist, caste people are very useful to the public, to take this step in my story pen, and
calculated that taking the Lord Don Micromegas, Sirius country dweller, from soles to occiput
twenty-four thousand feet, making one hundred and twenty thousand feet King, and we citizens
of the land going through the community of five feet, and taking our globe nine thousand miles
in circumference, it is absolutely essential that the planet where our national hero has fully
twenty-one million six hundred thousand times circumference of our earth. Well, nothing is more
common and more natural, and states certain princelings of Germany or Italy, which may beating
in half an hour, compared with Turkey, Russia, or Spanish America, is an image, still very distant
from Indeed, the differences that nature has established among men.

It is the height of His Excellency that we said, where all our painters colegiran and sculptors,
whose body might be about fifty thousand feet in circumference king because is very well proportioned.
His understanding of the most insightful is that you can see he knows a multitude of things, and some
have invented: only bordered with the two hundred and fifty years, while a student at the
Jesuit college of your planet, as there style is common, I guess by the force of his intelligence
over fifty propositions of Euclid, which are eighteen but did Blaise Pascal, the qual having guessed,
according to her sister, thirty and two playing, became, walking
the years, fed medium geometry, and malisimo metaphysical.

Age of four hundred and fifty years, but not to get out of childhood, dissects a very small
insects that did not reach a hundred feet in diameter, and the microscopes were hiding regular,
and wrote a book about them very funny, but that he brought not a few surprises. The mufti
of his country, not less ticklish than ignorant, found in his book proposals suspicious, ill-sounding,
rash, heretical, or smelling of heresy, and he chased the death, then tried to see if the substantial
form of fleas from Sirius was of the same nature that of the snails. Micromegas Defendiose
salty, declared the women in their favor, because after two hundred and twenty years which had lasted
the lawsuit, did Mufti condemn the book for qualifiers that he had not read nor could read, and
was banished court time the author for eight years.

Not much afflicted him out of a court full of intrigue and gossip. He composed a few tenths very
funny against the mufti, that this does not give a damn, and devoted himself to travel planet
to planet, only to perfect his reason and his heart, as they say. Those who are used to walking
in car cufflinks, or chaise was amazed at the carriages up there, because we, in our ball of
mud, do not understand other styles than ours. Fully knew the laws of gravitation and the forces
attractive and repulsive our walker, and he used them so well that
now mounted in a sunbeam, now riding a kite, balloon balloon went
he and his servants, as well as a paxarillo flits from branch to branch.

Soon there run the Milky Way; and I regret to confess that never could descry, among the stars that
is planted, that beautiful sky empyrean, who with his spyglass discovered the illustrious Derham,
curate [Footnote: English Wise, author of Theology astronomical, and other works, who strives to
prove the existence of God by the contemplation of the wonders of nature.]. I do not say why that
has not been very well Mr Derham, God forbid size of committing mistake, but after Micromegas was
in the country, and was a good observer: I do not want to contradict anyone.

After many journeys came a day Micromegas the globe of Saturn, and although he was used to see new
things, yet we stop confusing the smallness of this planet and its inhabitants, and could
not release the smile of superiority that can not contain more sane sometimes. Truth is that
Saturn is nine hundred times larger than the earth, and the inhabitants the country are dwarfs
of about two thousand yards, with a short difference in height. Riose to top of them with their
servants, as does an Italian musician Lulli's music, when it comes
to France, but Sirius was the man of reason, and quickly recognized
that one could very well be that thought to have nothing of ridiculous,
since there from six thousand feet height.

Acostumbrose to Saturninus, after having been shocked, and became
a close friend of the secretary of the Academy of Saturn, a man of
great talent, which in truth nothing was invented, but very nicely
gave account of the inventions of others, and to regularly couplets
girls and big load.

I'll post here, to the satisfaction of my readers, a conversation
very surprised that the secretary had one day Mr. Micromegas.

CHAPTER II.

Sirius Talk to the inhabitants of Saturn.

HE went to bed, went up to his face to the secretary, and said Micromegas: We confess that is
very diverse nature. Truth is, he said the Saturnino; is nature as a garden, whose flowers
.... Ha, he said the other, DEXA gardening. As it is, followed the Secretary, as a reunion of
blonde and brunette, whose adornments ..... What do I care about your brunette? interrupted
the other. Or as a gallery of squares, whose images ...... No, Sir, no, replied the traveler,
nature is as nature. ? A what the hell you walk looking for those comparisons? For to rejoice,
'said the secretary. If I do not want to recreate me, what I want you to teach, "said the traveler.
Tell me what senses are first quantos men of your globe. Nothing more than seventy-two, he
said the academic and everyday We complain about such a shortage, that our imagination is dexa
back our needs, and we believe that with our seventy-two senses, our annulled, and our five
moons do not have enough, and it is true that despite our great curiosity and passion that of
our seventy-two senses are daughters, we have plenty of time to get bored. Well what I think,
he said Micromegas, because on our globe we have about a thousand ways, and we still are not
that vague desires, not that concern, which constantly tells us that we are girl thing, and that
other beings much more perfect. I made a few voyages, and have seen other very inferior to
us mortals, and others who are far superior, but I have seen no with no more desires than real
needs, and more needs satisfaction. Perhaps a day will END a country where nothing is needed, but
I have not been told of this country. Then threw themselves to form conjectures on Saturnino
and Sirius, but after many no less ingenious reasoning uncertain, was forced to re-establish
facts. ? Quanto long live? he said the Syrian. Ha, very little, "replied the man from Saturn. The
same is true in our country, 'said the Syrian, we are always complaining about the shortness
of life. Must is that it is universal pension of nature. Alas! our lives, 'said the Saturnino
is five hundred revolutions of the sun movie (coming to be fifteen thousand years, or near,
counting as us.) You see that it is almost die so that one is born: it is our existence one
point, a moment our lives, our globe an atom, and each instruction is just beginning something, when
death snatches before experience. As for me I dare not any draft form, and I am like a drop of
water in the vast ocean, and what more sonroxo cause me in your presence, quan look ridiculous
in this figure do world. Micromegas answered her: If you were not a philosopher, would have, the
apprehension of desconsolaros, telling that is our life seven hundred times more extensive than
yours, but you well know that when has been to restore the body to the elements, and revive
differently Baxo nature that is what you call die, Quando is reached, say, this moment of metamorphosis,
it matters little have lived forever or one day alone, two is the same. I have been in countries
where people live a thousand times more than mine, and I saw that still complained, but are
everywhere sugetos of reason, who can resign, and give thanks to the author of nature, which
with a wonderful kind of uniformity has spread in the universe varieties with an endless profusion.
So par example, all people who think they are different, and they all look in the gift of thinking
and desire. Everywhere is the matter extensive, but each has different properties globe. ? Qantas of
these properties have your area? If you speak of the properties without the quale we could
not survive our globe as he is, he said the Saturnino, do not exceed three hundred, to wit the extension,
impenetrability, mobililad, gravity, divisibility, etc.. Without doubt, replied the walker,
which is sufficient for such a short number of breeder plan your intimate room, and in all
things I love his wisdom, because if all I see differences, also provides in all proportions. Your globe
is small, and so are its inhabitants, you have few feelings, and your subject has a few properties:
this is the disposal of Providence. ? Color is your sun well tested? Very ashen white, 'said the Saturnino,
and when we divide one of its rays, we find that has seven colors. The strip our flesh, he
said the Syrian, and we thirty-nine primary colors. In all quanta have examined, I have not
found a sun that looks like another, and not on your planet is a
face that no differs from all others.

After many queestiones analog, was reported to be different substances quantas Saturn knew, and
was answered that he had until about thirty, God, space, matter, people who feel large, extensive
beings who feel and think, people they think and are not widespread, which penetrate, and not
penetrate, and so on. The Sirius world in which there are three hundred, and that he had discovered
in his travels up to three thousand, I leave necessarily extraordinary philosopher stunned to
Saturn.

Finally, having communicated a quanto another almost all knew and
did not know many things, and having discoursed for space of an entire
solar revolution, were determined to make a short journey together
philosophical.

CHAPTER III.

Journey of two people from Sirius and Saturn

They were to board our two walkers in the atmosphere of Saturn with a very decent provision of
mathematical instruments, when the lady of Saturninus, who knew, it came to make bitter complaints.
This was a very graceful brunette, who had no more than fifteen hundred feet high, but repaired
with the boy through his body. iha cruel! exclaimed, I've resisted after fifteen hundred years,
when I had just given up, having no above last hundred years in your arms, go ime abandoned by traveling
with a giant another world!

Come on, you're not more than a curious, and have never been in love, that if you were Saturnino
legitimate, most constant serious. Where are you going? ? You want? less wandering is that you
our five moons, and less changeable our annulled. This is just, I want anymore. Philosopher embraced her,
weeping with her, as philosopher, and the lady, after having fainted, went to console with
a dude.

They cut our two curious and jumped first to nullify they found very flattened as you guessed
a famous inhabitant of our globule, and from there they went to moon in moon. A comet passing
close to the last, and threw him with his servants and instruments.

Just had walked a hundred and fifty million miles, they encountered satellites Jupiter. Alighted
on this planet, where they stopped a year, and learned very secret curious, which would have
given to the press, had it not been for the inquisitors propositions have found something hard
to swallow, but I managed to read the manuscript the library of the Most Illustrious Archbishop
of ... allowed me to register their books, with all the generosity and kindness that characterize
such an illustrious prelate.

Let us return however to our walkers. Leaving Jupiter, passed through a space of about a hundred
million miles, and cost the planet Mars, the qual, as everyone knows, is five times smaller than
our globule, and they saw two moons that serve this planet, and have not our astronomers have discovered.
While the abbot was written in much Donayre Ximenez against the existence of these moons,
but I appeal to those run by analogy, all great philosophers who know very well that it will be possible
to live without two moons Mars at least, being so far from the sun. Anyway, they seemed to our
travelers thing girl, who feared not finding a comfortable inn, and went forward as do two Quando
walkers encounter poor sales in the wilderness, and continue to the
next village.

But then he repented the Syrian and his partner, who walked a long
period without finding hostel.

After a little light descry, which was the land, which seemed very
mean thing to people who had come from Jupiter.

However, rezelando repent again, were determined to land on it. They went into the comet's tail,
and finding an aurora borealis by hand, went inside and brought ashore to the north shore of
the Baltic Sea, five of July 1737.

CHAPTER IV.

That accounts of what happened on the globe of the earth.

Having rested a bit, had lunch two mountains that are then cooked his servants with much toilet.
Wanted to recognize the wretched country then where they were, and headed north to south. Each
step ordinary Sirius and his family was about thirty thousand feet of the king, followed him by far
the dwarf of Saturn, who lost his breath, because I had to take twelve steps while the other leg
stretched out, almost like a lapdog that is, if you will excuse the comparison, a captain of
the guards of the king of Prussia.

As they went in a hurry these foreigners, were seen around the globe in thirty-six hours: truth is
that the sun, or rather the earth, makes the same journey in one
day, but we to repair something that is easier to turn on its exe
to anchor foot.

They returned after the etab first place, having seen the raft, almost imperceptible to them,
they call the Mediterranean, and another pool boy with big name around our den Oceano; the dwarf
gave him water to half a leg, and barely had wet the other heels. Were and came up and abaxo,
making quanto could be determined whether or not it was inhabited this Balloon baxaronse, acostaronse,
tempted by all parties, but was so disproportionate their eyes and hands with the petty things
that go dragging Baxo here, who had no more slight feeling for where they might fall under
suspicion of us and our brothers the other inhabitants of this globe.

The dwarf, sometimes with some precipitation failed, he decided then that there was no living on
earth, and his first reason was that there had been none. Micromegas given to understand with great
civility, which was not founded consequeencia because, he said to him, with your eyes so kids
do not see some stars of Quinquagesima magnitude that I can distinguish very clearly. ? Colegis
why there is such a star? If I have tempted all, 'said the dwarf. And if not you have felt what
it is? he said the other. If so bad collated this globe, "replied the dwarf, if it is so irregular,
and a configuration that seems so ridiculous that everyone is I imagine chaos. ? Not see these
streams, which runs any right, these ponds and are round or squares, or oval or any regular
figure, all these bumps pointed that this bristling, and I have entered on your feet? (And wanted
to talk about the mountains). ? Do not you notice the way around the globe, flattened at the
poles, and spinning around the sun so confused direction, which by necessity climates of both
poles have to be uneducated? What forces me to believe that there is really living in, is that
no one who had reason floor would want. ? Who cares? Micromegas he said, may not have common sense
people, but after it is presumed that this has been done without any purpose. You say that
you all here appears irregular because everything is thrown into the line in Jupiter and Saturn.
Well, for the same reason is perhaps some confusion here. ? No I said that I had always noticed
variety in my journeys? Replied the Saturnino these reasons, and not completed the dispute,
if the heat she had not broken the thread of his Micromegas diamond necklace, and caidose
these, that they were very nice bright, though tiny and uneven, the thicker weighed four hundred
pounds, and fifty the most petite. Some grabbed the dwarf, and leaning saw the eyes as they were polished,
microscopes were excellent: grabbed as a kid microscope hundred and sixty feet in diameter, and
was applied to one eye, while Micromegas is served another two thousand and five hundred feet.
At first they saw nothing with them, since they were gifted, had to be put in the position that
was required. After the inhabitants of Saturn saw something bobbing imperceptible in midwater
the Baltic Sea, and it was a whale, nicely laid it over your finger and placing it in a thumb,
she was taught to Sirius, the second time he laughed at the huge smallness the inhabitants of our
globe. Persuaded by that Saturnino was inhabited our world he imagined then that it was just
for whales, and as it was great discurridor, tried to guess where the movement came to an atom so
mean, and if I had ideas, will and free will. Micromegas not know what to think, but having examined
the animal patiently, bag of consideration that he could not reside in the body as a soul boy. Inclinabanse
for our two walkers to believe that there is no reason in our room, when, with the aid of a
microscope, package distinguish other thicker than a whale in the Baltic Sea walked fluctuating.
We know that by that time returned from the polar circle, a flock
of philosophers, who had gone to make observations that no one had
hitherto thought.

They brought the papers public that their boat had capsized off the
coast of Bothnia, and they had a difficult time going out to rescue,
but you never know in this world there is to vnder rope.

I I have naively the event, without removing or adding anything,
effort on the part of a historian is exceedingly meritorious.

CHAPTER V.

Experience and reasoning of both walkers.

Micromegas tended with great circumspection hand via the site of the object, and stretching and shrinking
fingers of fear of being wrong, and then opening them and closing them, I take very mana the
ship where they were these gentlemen, and placed on a "not too tight, not estruxarle. Lo here
a very different animal from the other, 'said the dwarf of Saturn and Sirius put the pretense
animal in the palm of the hand. The passengers and sailors tripulacioon, which is believed
caught by a storm, and thought they aground on a Baxi, are all in motion; sailors caught barrels of wine,
toss them at the hand of Micromegas, and after they are thrown; seize the geometries of quarts
circle, their sectors, and Lapp, and alight on the fingers of Sirius:
Finally both were busy, they felt it shaking a thing that beetles
in the fingers, and it was a club with an iron tip nailed him a foot
in the index finger: the itching made him believe that the body had
become something The creature that I had on hand, but could not suspect
anything at first, as its microscope barely enough to distinguish
a ship of a whale could not make visible a entecillo as inconspicuous
as a man
