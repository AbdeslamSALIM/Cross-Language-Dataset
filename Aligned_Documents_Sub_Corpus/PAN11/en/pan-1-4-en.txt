 And if done by the sell
advantage that can be followed, do not come so bare this guild, you can not Entry pay more
than they are worth four mules.

- Well, it wants Mr Andrew Knight - said another gypsy - the no-fault death, and God know if I regret,
and for its youth, it has not yet closed (which is not used between
mules for hire), as it should be wandering, it has no crust on the
flanks, or wounds, on the spur.

Dilatóse his death until night, and the remainder of that day were the ceremonies Andrés input
to a gypsy, which were jettisoned after a ranch in the best the horde, and adornáronle of branches
and pine needles, and Andrew sitting on a medium oak, put him in the hands a hammer and tongs,
and the sound of two guitars that two Roma rang, I did give two somersaults, then stripped
him an arm and a silk ribbon and a new club gave him two laps gently. A Beautiful everything
was present and many Roma, old and young girls, that the one with
wonder, others with love, I looked: such was the graceful arrangement
of Andrew, that even the gypsies were aficionadísimos.

Having thus, the aforementioned ceremonies, an old gypsy hand made by Preciosa, and since in front
of Andrew, said:

- This girl, who is the best and brightest of all the beauty of the Roma we know that living
in Spain, we deliver it to wife, because our free and easy life is not subject to a lot of fuss
or ceremony. Look at it, and see if you like, or if it Vees something you unhappy, and if you see,
you choose from the girls here are the most will be content, that we chose you to give, but
know that once chosen, not have to leave the other. # # With our laws and statutes we stay
and live happy; we are masters of the fields, the fields, the jungles, forests, sources and
rivers, the mountains give us wood bucket, trees, fruits, vines, grapes; orchards, vegetable,
sources, water, rivers, fish, and closed seasons, hunting the shadows rocks, fresh air, bankruptcies,
and houses the caves. For us the elements of heaven are oreos, snack, snow, rain baths, music
and thunder and lightning axes; for us are the dumps hard soft bed mattresses, the leather
of our bodies serves as an impenetrable harness that defends us, our light not prevent crickets,
or stop gullies or walls in contrast, to our mind does not twist
ropes, pulleys or undermine him or drown him play, nor tame horses
