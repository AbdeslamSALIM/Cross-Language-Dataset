 Sofia had some questions on the matter, she was sure that Aristedes had something to
do with the disappearance of Melissa even though they had gone their separate ways. All afternoon
they tried to solve the mystery, and when night came, Mrs. Morpheo, soft-heartedly worried about the

could help in discovering the run-away. Even though Aristedes was at first thought to be an accomplice,
the honest boy was soon able to convince her family that he was innocent. Mrs. Morfeo feared that
there was a possiblily that the girl had drowned in a ditch, or, which seemed almost as tragic
to her way of thinking, that she would be found muddy, her cloting
stained so badly that there would be no hope that soap and water would
be able to bring them back to the original state
