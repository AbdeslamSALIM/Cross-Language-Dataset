 But
no, he indignantly rejected all domestic caliph thought of losing sight of the Villa and Court,
speaking pests and lost fools who spend the summer with borrowed money, and who spend three
months here room pittance for the pleasure of living a few days in inns making mistakes and
prominence to what they feed on them.

That double roughness that was mentioned above went slowly softening. Bringas was not intolerant
in a superlative degree, and though he was, knew to sacrifice the conjugal peace somewhere their
economic dogmas. The explanations he gave Rosalie makeshift class did not satisfy him completely,
but with a good faith effort known The great economist admit some of them. The faith of his religion
commanded you believe marriage something inexplicable, and believed it. If Rosalie had not passed
away, peace, after that transient alteration would have made a solid king at home, but did
not know the Pipaón and restraint, and the habit of secretly circumvent the rules of the Order
was bringuística and deeply rooted in his soul. Proporcionábale this habit, as well as the satisfactions
of vanity, a hidden pleasure. Who had so long been a slave, why ever was not to your liking?
Each of those actions wrong and illegal caressed the soul before and after smoking. Consciousness
knew how to draw, no one knows where, a thousand sophistries that justify all fully. "Quite a few hardships
I've had ... Why, perhaps not worthy I another position? ... You will have to get used to me a
little more liberated ... And ultimately After all, I look for the honor of the family ...».

What
most troubled his mind in those early days of solitude and heat was
the need to return the money in the casket.

Milagros had given him everything. Where do you get what was missing? Instantly she remembered
Torres, and since I had the opportunity to do so, made him a discrete indication. "He had,
what a pity! If a friend had ... Finally, the next day response. " Our friend was not baked the
bread to know the answer Torres, because every time I thought next disaster, which would be
great, strong and inevitable, since Bringas register their treasure. Fortunately or by special
intervention of the saints who invoked the Pipaón not yet had happened to the good man lift
the top ceiling. But when he did ...! And it was not worth the discretion of papers with rude
art imitating tickets, because I saw the mouse, albeit poorly, and it was impossible to touch was
relying only to the tonnage of the box. On tenterhooks the lady was all day 31 and part of
the immediate Torres gave up hope remedy. She began making it difficult, considering what had
worked to understand the convenience of the loan to his friend. Which was a certain Torquemada,
a man who did not your money without collateral. On that occasion, however, in deference to
Torres, would not require the husband's signature on the contract, because the lady was enough
... I could not do the loan more than a month, date extended, and giving four thousand pieces
of the note would four thousand five hundred. Ah, the four hundred thousand were deducted
brokerage real ...

Rosalie saw the heavens opened when Torres gave him the news, and
all it seemed little revenue and brokerage, for the great favor that
he did.

With three 1800 actual would have enough for their purpose, and you still have more than enough
about six dollars for something unforeseen occur. Everything would be fixed the next day August
2.

And the time running out, and the danger was imminent, as discussed by this phrase Bringas
copied verbatim:

"Daughter, I am sending Golfín account and will have to pay it after tomorrow 3. He leaves 4,
as I have said today. I shudder when I think of meat this man will take me by man of means.
How much will I? Can you think of yourself? I've thought about it all night, and I had nightmares
as Isabelita ... And today I said a phrase I Golfín got chills ... What I say, you're losing
me with the sheen loud that you see ... Well look that makes me laugh ... when you do not know if
we will be wrong with the doctor, that I say ... so, with that cheeky twang ... "Mr. D. Francisco,
yesterday saw his wife out of Mass San Ginés twelve ... Ever so elegant !...». So you will be happy
elegance knife that this man is going to mow your neck.

"

At half past ten the other day, while Don Francisco and the whole family was often in ride on the Cuesta
de la Vega, the operation was performed. Usurious appeared with accuracy, a fixed time, Torres
and Torquemada. This was a middle-aged man, graying beard shaved four days, dark and a clerical air.
Invariable practice was to ask him by the family to make your greeting, and spoke the words
apart and put between paragraphs asthma breaks, so that he could not hear but feel contaminated
obstructions in the emission of breath. Accompanied his tiresome speeches slow Lift the right
arm, forming with the index finger and thumb a kind of donut to put it to his partner before
his eyes, as an object of veneration. The visit was brief. The only part of the contract to
repair was made Rosalia concerning the time a month, which seemed too short, but Torquemada said he
could not extend it. "In early September had to ... give a bond in the County ... Provincial,
because presented to the auction ... Hospitals meat. While Pensáralo ... lady not have believed
it if possible ... refund at the time ... agreed, the loan ... not be verified. " In all it agreed
the lady, attentive only to leave the conflict of the day, took money, signed, and the two friends
parted, leaving expressions for the owner home to one of them who did not know. Remained the
Pipaón thrilled, and thought only on how to enter in the money pit. A little difficulty occurred,
and that was that not having a ticket of 400 scudi, but several small, had to procure a of those.
If the bills were otherwise, but the amount was the same, the cominero be called misleading.
With the pretext of making a visit out in the afternoon, frightened to death, suspecting her husband
whenever he pleased, while she was away, recording the Treasury. But a good angel watching over her,
nothing happened during the time spent doing the unusual exchange small bills for large one.
The money changer in the street looked at Carmen some wonder. At night, the delicate operation to
replenish the amount embezzled was made with all happiness.

Rarely had he felt so nervous my friend Bringas as in the moments
leading up on arrival Golfín account.

At about ten o'clock on day 3, he sent a message Paquito verbal, begging the doctor promptly
send her note attendance fees care, and would be half past eleven when the boy returned home, bringing
a letter. Bringas not breathing while her trembling hand tore the envelope and unfolded the paper.
Rosalia waiting also eager curiosity ... Eight thousand pieces! Reading this sum was perplexed Bringas,
wavering between joy and sorrow, as if the amount seemed excessive, on the other hand, fears that
were absurdly large, calm down before the true figure. There sometimes believed that the bill would
not lower than twelve or sixteen thousand pieces, and this suspicion will put out of it, others
conceived it not exceed four thousand. The party had actually the difference between these two
sums illusory, and finally came to comfort economist with arguments of Don Hermogenes school,
saying that if eight thousand reais were a lot of money compared to four, were relatively little
sixteen ... A further reason his Don Hermogenes that dominated the tumult of ideas at that time
arithmetic boiling in his brain, and that was that Ridley, as the recommended sick of the Queen,
having had no been nothing ...

"But anyway, I agree.

I have not gone wrong, for I have come to my eyes. The first is health and health first sight.
And the truth is that this murderer has cured me well. Eight realitas thousand! It is quite
possible - he added with a sigh and feeling annoyed slightly - which, if not been for your elegance,
the shotgun would not have happened four thousand ...».

He took the money, he put a card very fine and very polite, thanking the learned doctor admirable for
his assistance, and all, letter and notes, oh sweet treasures of his soul, was introduced Gorgeous
in an envelope, of the office. Paquito was to take the second message. If Bringas sadly saw
the expatriation of his beloved banknotes, on the other hand felt the deep satisfaction and experience
of pay. This pleasure is only given to people a lot arrangement that to save money on saving
feelings it produces, and of these, they are content to enjoy the
most pure and spiritual.

Glided after this day with tedious slowness, the month of August, the month Madrid is Madrid,
but a solitary pan. In those days there was more theater summer circus of Price, with its seemingly
clows horses and that made all nights the same graces. The historic Prado was the only place of
solace, and in his twilight the love and conversation groups spent their time in conversations
more or less boring heat with defending abanicazos and sips of cool water. The locals that spend
the summer at the Villa are the real outcasts, outlaws, and his only
consolation ie drinking the best water in the world.

In his horrible boredom, dislike the Pipaón to go to the Prado, because I was reviewing this
as of misery and vulgarity. He had used many times the vexed formula-explanation of exile: "We took
a house in San Sebastian, pore ...»; Bringas disease and tired of it, dodging the chances
of repeating. At night and some people Bringas of the few in the city had been, they would get seats
on the terrace, and were North side of a group that lacked animation. Candida never failed. Completed
Mrs. gang of Montero de Espinosa, the two heads of office, that of an officer the secretary,
the director of the Royal Tables, the head of Wardrobe del Rey. Males attending the few that
there were lots, and were class lower, but the summer is very democratizing, and my dear Bringas,
longingly of society, not disdain to alternate, at a gathering in the open, with goalkeepers
Banda and Glass, with Storage Manager, with the aide of Silver, with two lockers, people all
six thousand reais down. These used to join a kitchen helper, who enjoyed fourteen thousand,
and some Saleta usher, who saw nine thousand. At these gatherings there was talk heat had done
for the day, the Court had already left the farm for Lequeitio, and other minutiae of personal and
household. On the third floor and in the spaces squares mode cut the length of the corridors,
streets, social gatherings were also formed office of porters, maids, sweepers and people coming
up out of stables. In the corresponding site large bars overlooking the Plaza de Oriente, on the ledge, the
strike lasted all evening with great entertainment, laughter, guitar playing and a soft drink
horchata strains. Doña Candida trilled against these disorders, because he could not close my eyes
all night, and threatened offenders to report them to the inspector general.

In the morning the whole family down to the Manzanares, where they bathed and Alfonsin Isabelita.
Dad had brought back to light denim suit, and with this, and the straw hat seemed he had just
come from Havana. Sheltered from light for very dark glasses, his eyes healed quickly, thanks
to the timely completion of the treatment plan that had Golfín left. The morning air and the
joy of the resort will put in a good mood, and constantly asserted that if the fools who will
be known establishments Jeronimos, Cypress, the Rainbow, the Esmeralda and the Andalusia, the
win would not have fixed migration. Paquito also threw intrepid wave of those little dirty
seas, sandwiched between mats, and swimming was a beauty, standing on the bottom. A Alfonsin was
necessary to beat him out, and she entered only to force. Five returning slowly small appetite for
ostrich, D. Francisco very happy and purposes lunch not to offend. To lower the river, Bringas had
to overcome the repugnance what inspired him. Just for the sake of her children she was able
to make that sacrifice. Le disgust gave water and bathers, all people more or less. I could not
look without horror septa mat, more appropriate to threaten the decency to keep it safe, and
Regular urchins shouting him so much nerves.

In the afternoon, almost dusk, would come down to Madrid to visit
a friend or to around known stores.

These had very few people. Luenga curtain kept in the local atmosphere less heat than the
street, and this darkness, as the idleness invited to the employees to sleep on pieces of cloth.
Occasionally found home for Sobrino Hermanos to some lady behind, some banished like her. New edition
the famous formula: "We took a house in San Sebastian, but ...». The other would say with commendable
frankness: "We hope to trains flights of September."

As in those days were shopkeepers hand over hand, to show entreteníanse
Mrs different fabrics and things on a whim.

"This will be much in the fall ... This is now range, because it is the fashion of the season. "
These phrases seemed to come from the folds of parts to be unfolded. The principal, who was preparing
to make the usual trip to Paris, urged to buy something, and she fell into temptation, sometimes
because I had some real bargains, others because the genre he entered through his right eye, lighting
all the fires of his passion Trappist, and could not fail to satisfy, on pain of suffering long,
the desire to purchase. Oh! The martyrdom of the summer had to compensate in next fall, dressed as
God commanded, her husband liked it or not. Was intended a new dress made of velvet for winter
and one of the most graceful canopy, new and elegant. At Young children dress like princes.
Ya, ya see the bobbin with Who was ... Thinking about these and other plans, slowly walked
the streets again home, he stopped at the shop windows of fashion and jewelry, and made a thousand
calculations the more or less remote chance of having something very valuable and rich he saw.
Sadness of Madrid in this period increased his sorrow. The calm of a few streets over hours
heat, the melancholy cry of those who proclaim horchatas and lemonade, the slow pace of the
panting horses, the doors of shops with many long hooded canopies, most are for folded to rejoice
that the spirits of those who also sit on your skin the effect of a high temperature and in spirit
from the beaches nostalgia. Preceded by wind storms dirty dust nerves horribly excited him, and
his only pleasure in witnessing was to see weather forecasts denials Bringas, which from the
sky clouding, said: "see how cool this afternoon." What had to cool ...! On the contrary, twice
the heat.

If you ever went out at night, heavy and suffocating atmosphere of the first hour This put
her in a devilish mood, let alone thinking how happy were those who at that when they were walking
in the Zurriola.

All of Madrid seemed ordinary, profane, a town lugarón more boorish people and sow the world.
When I saw the inhabitants of the most popular possessed of the sidewalks, their shirt-sleeves,
they too lightly, the children half naked toying with the stream, believed to be in a town of
Moors, as the idea I had of African cities. Up early and bathed in their own home, not wanting to stoop
to be a river nymph as pedestrian and pretentious as Mr. de Manzanares. In the early hours of
the day, open wide the balcony of the house, which gave West, came a little cool, and the
body and the spirit of the lady received some consolation. When I went to have a stroll through
the shops, the mortified by different odors doors out in the crowded streets, the smell of humanity
and stews. Louvered goodbye basements in some places a wave of freshness that's invited to
stop, but in those basements where there were kitchens, the fog was so disgusting that impelled toward
stream. He saw with delight the hoses, feeling eager to get a shower in their own meat, but
then it appeared from the ground a suffocating vapor, fumes mixing anything balsamic, which forced
her to revive the pace. The dogs drank from dirty puddles formed by the spray irrigation and
then refugiábanse in the shade, such as street vendors, tired of preaching goat shoes, tubes,
all real, lace, guide rail, whistles and pots artificial carbon economy ... During those hours in
that horrible and annoying station, only the flies and Bringas were happy.

XXXIX

It was, yes, the day of San Lorenzo when they received a letter that both of them stumped and just
as stunned.

Who does he ever come to meet the wonderful, this item life that
the ancients represented by appearances of angels, gods and spirits?

In our age wonder there as in the past, only the Angels have changed name and figure, and never
enter the keyhole. The extraordinary thing that my dear friends surprised her solitude, Augustine
was a letter from Knight. Both of them believed that the very specter of Indian generous they
were put forward. Speaking in the plural, they said to have taken a house in Arcachon, and
knowing that Bringas and kids suited to breathe fresh air and saline, were invited to spend
a month there. Offering was as cordial as explicit. The house was very large, with gardens and a
thousand comforts. Messrs. Rosalia would be staying in style and treated like royalty, without
them having to do expense of any kind ... "Amparo and I - the letter said in conclusion - we
are delighted for you to accept. "

Rosalie's first impulse was to hate and spite ... Daring to invite a respectable family ...! "That's
to be gloss alternating with us ... That is to get through decent people appearing in our company
... In short, they want us to be the honored flag covering contraband
... Are not you angry?

Because this is an insult. "

D. Francis was so busy untangling the awful mess of ideas that the letter put together in his
mind, had not yet had time to be outraged.

She continued chewing his wrath, and the storm clouds that erupted in her brain, bright lightning
that said "Basin!". Are booming in this word, chic and friendly even if it was issued nose,
was as involved a world of sleek satisfaction. Go to France, find station in San Sebastian
or San Juan de Luz a few Spanish families known and say, after the first greetings, "I will
Basin", was how to confess relational the Eternal Father. In thinking this, a puff of smoke came
balsamic Heart lady, pervaded his whole chest and he went up to the nose, giving it a very
lively and recessed itching considerably. Finally Bringas brain after a laboriosísimo delivery,
gave birth to this idea:

- Did they married? ...

- Marry! ... do not believe ... Well, little would have ballyhooed ... No, live like animals ...
It is indecent that we invite to live with him. For what? ... Distinctions are not there already
between people, no morality? They believe that we have so little shame in them ...!

- What a pity they are not married! - Economist murmured looking at her thumbs were still facing
each other, as wary of joining -. Because if they lived as God intended
... You see what proportion.

Free tickets, free home, free food! ...

The idea of ??humble Amparo and be his guest and owe a big favor,
revolted pride the Pipaón ...

- You'd be able to accept - he said -.

I can not stoop to that.

- No, I do not ... Is saying ... Take, for example - stammered Bringas, even more perplexing -.
And we have reason to ensure that there are married.

- Marry or
not ... Do you think it is worth that silly ...?, who have been fed
leftovers our house ...

- Oh, my dear, do not ski, and who remembers
that?

The world will soon forget these things. When you have money you do not ask if you have never eaten
soup silly. Just imagine, in Arcachon nobody will know us or them or us ... Not that I want to
go. On the contrary. I will reply thanking you ...

Such a refusal would put back in the eyes of the lady the ideal prospect of a journey that popular
site for recreation
