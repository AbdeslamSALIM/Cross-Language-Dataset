 

In this critical time in life when naive curiosity, eager and indiscriminate makes its first
delivery of the facts and explanations about things in the world, and that all kinds of superstitions
can penetrate the mind and take root, home, environment and school have a first class role.

And
in those circumstances, the plan of the religious school is to meet
the natural curiosity the child on the facts and things in the universe
around him, with the explanations the wise old graduate courses lengthy
fasting and solitary meditation in the wilderness, in caves, in the
ruins or in the cloisters, put in the mouth of the gods, then, to
give them an authority they had, to require an absolute acquiescence,
only possible way to make them effective in their time, and the object
of the positive school is to meet the same curiosity with positive
knowledge acquired by modern scholars the investigation of nature
with modern methods, and without requiring obedience to them or acquiescence
of any kind, that the progress of human intelligence has been superseded,
since the truth does not bring as a supposed mandate from the dead,
but its agreement with reality, his strength of conviction of the
understanding.

DISCLOSURE AND EVOLUTION

The Jewish concept that informs the two wills, and according to which the progress of humanity decay
is a process of content just because the man was perfect from the hands the operator and deteriorated
in perpetuity by the original sin, the most diametrically opposed the modern concept of the
upward trend of the human species was a common concept to all ancient peoples, the natural result
of pessimism resulting from powerlessness man to the evils of the earth and the omnipotence of natural
laws, unconquered by human intelligence.

In all, the conscious or subconscious ideal was to stay or approach
to state or condition in which the man was in contact with the wisdom
of their respective maximum Confucius or Solomon, or in communication
with the divinity itself by the respective prophets or apostles; all
lived with the thought in the past and relying on the help of the
ancestors posthumously; everyone understood that the happy times,
the heroic, holy times were behind and not before humanity today.

Studies of philosophers and theologians - Utopians Retrospective - education in schools, preaching
in the pulpits, everything was oriented on the long-awaited return to the glorious past, or
holy, or joyful. Wisdom was a formula verbal output of the past and the mystery.

And so, the gift of the human capital: the possibility of improved indefinitely, was always more
or less offset by any religious or philosophical doctrines understood give new life, because
"all theory is gray, and the tree of life is evergreen," as Goethe
said, because the human mind is like water that is stagnant and moving
corrupts purified.

Although the sky has fallen in crystal drops and oxygen, of immobility the pond or muddy swamp,
inhabited by tenants harmful, microbes, Diatomaceous guzarapos larvae. So the myriad of mogigatos,
sexton, laymen, monks, nuns, hermits, abbots, canons, priests and bishops, have occurred by spontaneous
generation of pests in Christian thought, stalled since the third century and therefore tainted inevitable
by the creeds, dogmas, bulls, short and fees.

Is that evil of all religions is in its very essence, they can not rejuvenate steadily as the tree of
life, replacing with green leaves and dry leaves new shoots the old guard, when they can not
change and walk with the progress of the spirit human.

They are a breath of life and action, a blaze of lights and dazzle infinite one time, as did the
Mohammedanism in historical times, then fall into a new plan of mental darkness, spiritual
and moral sterility. Philosophy, literature and Greek art still living, were reassigned to our
intellectual flow. In Egyptian religion, Greek and Roman that prevailed for so many centuries, there
is nothing, nothing, if not sorry fetishism incorporated into Greek and Latin churches, of which
not be anything left.

In Europe and Christian America, as in China, as in Muslim Africa, the past spiritual took precedence
at all about this, the word "master" of the prophets and the apostles was the last resort of
the human spirit.

As the Cid, who won battles after death, St. John Chrysostom, St. Augustine and St. Thomas
have won by many centuries in all disputes. In law, medicine, natural sciences, "which thought
the old sages "made law to modern scholars. The most backward, ie the most versed in ancient lore,
were the most qualified to teach the past to present and that title was the governess Church
universal.

Only when in the nineteenth century paleontology, philology, archeology, etc., Etc., Put uncovered
the huge mistake of those concepts, showing that the more human beings old had been less strong
and less healthy, less wise and more barbaric, the theory arose the
upward and began to conceive the perfection of man as a fact of this
and future, and the human spirit was able to transfer its guidance
and service objectives of the dead to serve the living and the evils
that were the evils which are the world from nothing into the world
of life from stagnation to progress from quiescence to action, the
absolutism to freedom, tradition, evolution, "moving the center of
gravity intellectual and emotional God to humanity ", the huge event
is taking place today, and will be the beginning of a transformation
larger and more universal happy that all that preceded it in the course
of time.

At the moment we are in the transition period, with religious school, aided by intellectual
inertia which leads to 18 centuries of obscurantism in credulity and ignorance chronic educates
children to the truths and virtues of the past and the liberal school The educated to the
possibilities of this in the way forward, with sectarian school school closes and reopens positive
human curiosity to know the hunger charity and make up that gives us, on average, a wonderful week.

Between us, the progress of liberalism is quite satisfactory, considering that anchored to the
shining modern liberty from the medieval intelligentsia miserable, so jealously preserved by
the monks in Spain and its colonies, that we have not yet a century of independence and that its first
half was, fatally, the extension of colonial terrorism and obscurantism, for the failure of the
early liberal initiative Rivadavia, and outlawed the picture by closing the schools at the time
of Rosas, after which they were reopened under the thumb of the priests - recipients in all ages
of savagery, that our public education is only about secular from 1884; that up to seventy-odd
inmates of the recent national schools used to having to get away, still jumping back walls to escape
the obligatory confession at Easter, that mankind does not produce but an educator in every
century, as Emerson said, and has just started to not miss Sarmiento
in senior management instruction public that our civil marriage law
and statistics yesterday showed, and in our large capital two thirds
of marriages without the intervention of the priest, that almost all
our men were cool mature understanding when they were green and had
not still widespread, with railroads and the press, modern ideas and
feelings, each broad day in the love of truth and humanity, prompting
well-tempered souls to work in this world of the living to leave his
departure better than they found it arrival, the reverse of that miserable
feeling of religious believers in magic that leads us to give and
bequeath to the churches for the good of his soul alone.

THE LAST AURORA

The nineteenth century is the starting point of a new benefit was more fraught for men that was
opened with the Sermon on the Mount, is the point in time that men
more highly civilized start to stop asking God to make good and wise
and strong to strive to be themselves, to ignore the imaginary worlds
to take advantage of the real world, leaving the fold of the revelation
to conquer nature, changing its focus from past to future, fatalism
to determinism, prayer action, the game discouraged pessimism to optimism,
loose the wings of spirit to explore all walks without a passport
of ecclesiastical authority; emancipated of that silly pity for the
dead that holds believers crying stupidly on remediable misery of
this by the irremediable misfortunes of the remote past, distressed
for the suffering of Jesus, the martyrs and all the dead and perfectly
insensible the suffering of the living enslaving others to exploit
it instead of appropriating the forces of nature to free the man's
arms, to pierce the mountains, sail seas, river channel, bridge the
gap and penetrate the core of things to discover its laws, to isolate
the microbes, serums and invent and discover anesthetics pedagogy
and psychology, asepsis and antisepsis, enabling them to reach their
own physical and mental depths, to remove the infections, tumors,
calculations and cysts, bad moods and passions, in absolutely certain
whether or not God, who has done more good and less evil, which has
been most useful to his and strangers, the less you have suffered
the wrath of hate and love you enjoyed most and friendship, in short,
which "has been a great soul in this world, you are more likely to
be a great soul in any other world.

"

In the nineteenth century, in fact, has fought the decisive battle between new and old ideals,
which are beaten and in retreat. Human rights are being evicted to the priest and the king,
the nobility and the clergy have lost their privileges secular, the dignified solidarity it replaces
the humiliating charity, there has been the emancipation of the serfs and the liberation of
slaves, and behind them the socialist workers, not the Catholic worker who insists on remaining
the priest, the worker has come to be a person with the right living, thinking and fighting for
economic emancipation for the improvement of their condition a more equitable social participation
in the fruits of their labor. And finally, women daughter and slave spiritual confessor - the secular
Catholic home intruder - father supplementary religious marriage, regaining his personality, is
incorporated, it also the emancipation movement of the human race subjugated by the Church of God.

Meanwhile,
we are happy that we are currently witnessing the twilight of what was and the dawn of what will
be. Blessed are we who can think and say about the future and the past that we come to mind,
without fear that torment us, we burn or we banish the ministers of God offended and angry about
it, as they did with our grandparents, almost without fear of reproach us, slander us and persecute
us, as they did with our parents, the official representatives of the God of goodness.

Those who have every reason to be complaining, sorry and sad we are not certainly the self-consciousness
we have fantastic terrors and reach of science, which is the effective
working of miracles, Edison system, Röntgen, Marconi, etc.., ETC.
but manufacturers imaginary terrors and miracles, the human sacrifice
of the truth to divine truth, the omnipotent yesterday struck down
the wrath and vengeance of the Almighty, mental lepers expelled today
as the nation's most advanced in Europe, unable to defense, because
that formidable weapon with which ruled the world until the eighteenth
century - the excommunication - is reduced by the progress of human
reason to the modest role carbine Ambrose.

PAST AND FUTURE

If a crazy anti-humanitarian to lie down now to find a way of taxing people with the maximum
disabilities, expenses, work and penalties for the most useless of the goals imaginable probably could
not find anything as effective as the revealed religions "before Science and Civilization, "as
A. France.

For this double set of simultaneous governments, commonwealths and superimposed on the town the
temporary needs of this world, the spiritual needs of others, our ancestors climbed the hill of life
with two enormous octopus on their backs, prevented them develop and grow, robbing even the most wretched
amenguadas fruit of their energy, in compensation for the work they were taken to curtail thinking
- which is a form of motion, such as electricity, magnetism or light, - kill the spirit of initiative
and tutearlos after they had crippled the capacity to act and to behave themselves.

Unintelligible memorize the catechism - the librejo more full of absurdities and nonsense after
the Qur'an - obliged to attend all events and religious ceremonies, day and night, not thinking
without permission of the priest, fasting, confession, communion, penance, grieve and mourn
in the days and hours desired, to obey the church campaign Cowbell mules to the sponsor, pay tithes
and first fruits priests outside of taxes and extraordinary accidental miracles for each of the
events of life, from birth until after death, funerals and "ends years, "all under pain of excommunication,
persecution, confiscation of property, and banishment or death.

Buy the prince the right to live under their whims and brutality, and work under the regulations
more stupidly wasteful, at best cases - the free man - were certainly social, economic and moral were
impossible capita prosperity and progress of the nation.

Only by decreasing the Church's spiritual government and temporary government princes, and the
extent to which managed the influence of philosophy and science resurgent, by successive explosions
of the doubly oppressed and exploited, has been increasing human capacity for human life.

And as in the Protestant church government first declined for secession with the papacy and
the removal of miracles, confession, communion, indulgences and St. Peter's pence, was where I first
grew them by faith in the self-help I replaced the belief in the
miraculous rescue of the saints, the ability of the individual and
correlative prosperity of nations.

And as in Spain and Italy was more burdensome tyranny Church, were also burdened them more impoverished
individuals and community by the Church that had made the scriptures not a prison but a beacon
of human intelligence, a prison with no air and no light, which they put to Protestants free
inquiry, doors and windows.

When the Romans came to Egypt, could not resist, because the priests
absorbed in this country a third of national wealth for their useless
masquerades.

Turn the exactions of the Roman treasury, hundredfold by the insatiable greed of the collectors,
had been destroyed in situ force of the empire, long before the invasions of barbarians, and
the holdings of priestly greed, reinforced by the Holy Office and Jesuits, and admirably supported
by the imbecility of kings and ministers fans who expelled Jews and Moors to the Catholic unanimously,
making the capita servant of the Church and 3 | 5 fertile land dead hand goods, so completely annihilated
the human energy of the empire where the sun never set, which without pushing the outside,
he fell from spontaneous decay inherent weakness, as Muslim peoples are falling this.

And of course that the cure is greatest where larger evil, as happened
in the French Revolution, if the Latin countries had an advantage
over whites in getting rid all of that expensive drug and government
of conscience by the Vatican, as France has begun, would recover in
the future, the ground lost in the past.

Because you can anticipate, as now, the universal human capacity glut problems of human life, that
will come when they have disappeared altogether, with priestly class who exploited the problems
of the future life, still consumed today so much of human power completely
useless and expensive ceremonies to toil over the void to find the
most diverse and disparate illusory solutions the unsolvable.
