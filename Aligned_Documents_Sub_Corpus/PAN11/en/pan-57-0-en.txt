 

He saw that lifted the portrait, which the crowd swirled in endless circuits and saw agitated
in the air crowd of white handkerchiefs coming out of the turmoil as a foam.

The disorderly procession went down the street from Atocha and entered the Plaza Mayor. There spread
a little. But then tried to cross the street arc to enter the Bitterness in silver. The great
monster was measured at a glance the number of its members multiplied arch width and the way he
had to pass. The camel was going to go through the eye of the needle. There was a convulsive
movement of elbows, and the abdomens became depressed, turned the bodies and some hats jumped impelled
by the impact and shock of many heads. Some voices tried to pronounce an order to overcome this
difficulty, a problem of obstetrics no doubt.

- In front of the
portrait.

Pass up the portrait - said. It was impossible, people flocked to Thus, the portrait could not
happen. Finally, after long efforts, the picture passed the arc. Behind the more confusion
was the great mass of people. The crowd that filled the square was standing and waiting. The
portrait and its lackeys resulted in the High Street; but once there, unparalleled surprise stopped
the procession. Two rows of soldiers were in Platerías, reaching beyond the square of the town.
The stakes of a squad lances gleaming in the distance, and before the troops were, Captain General
of Madrid, horseback, waiting with great poise and courage. This man came, followed by two or
three, and pointing with his sword, summoned the removal order to the portrait. There was a
quick consultation of glances between them. A civil authority also approached and said the best manners
to leave everyone to his house and to give up the demonstration, because the government was determined
to not go one step further. The appearance of a vivid impression to the troops the portrait,
besides, they had the help of Sagunto regiment and the regiment Sagunto was locked and well
guarded in their barracks.

They tried, however, move on, and said that this demonstration was purely moral, not trying
to cause any disturbance, nor was aggressive attitude, or were more object of admiration paid
tribute to the hero who gave freedom to his country.

"Every man to his house! Behind the portrait," Morillo said resolutely.

The

defense was impossible. The procession had no weapons.

The alleged weakness of the government had turned to unwavering firmness. Some began to desert,
parading through the streets of Milan and the square of San Miguel. The portrait rested ground
and moved back and forth, unsure in the hands of its bearers.

They spoke: but all was useless: people began to recede, some screaming, and there were also those
who wanted to resist the troops.

Meanwhile, the crowd stood still occupied the square.

Who was it that so many people rose, and shaking hands, voices uttering the crowd cheering? He
spoke well, no doubt: big cheers welcomed his words, but the constant jostling, the cries of the
downtrodden and crushed not allow one to express relief.

Some called for silence, but silence the whole place was impossible.

At best, those who in the arc discussed with the authorities, fell to see that the troops resisted.
Confusion then came to a close.

He continued his invective, but the continued exiting the not to give to people in their efforts
to verify the event. He was pale, panting, and every word was like a whip that encouraged the
crowd to move forward.

As the troops advanced clearing the square, and some were so bold,
that before horses resisted and shouted apostrophizing Morillo and
his people.

- To those who cry! - Said the commander of the picket.

Arremolinóse the crowd. Many ran to escape.

Others took turns, carried by the wave, or remained troubled, not knowing what to do. Lazarus was
silent.

- Who cried? - Captain said, - To those who cry. Seize the screaming.

Lazarus tried to flee, but the strong arm of a soldier stopped him strongly.

- Seize the screaming.

This is the preacher.

In this!

Lazarus went from a strong hand to another very strong. Just realized that he had on. He thought
he would release him immediately and tried to free herself, but to no avail.

- Back, back! Outside the plaza! - Continued the captain.

And it was well obeyed, because the crowd was quickly disbanded. The procession failed. The picture
was shattered in the middle of the square, the troops took all the entries.

What happened to Lazarus? Fifteen minutes after entering, honorably guarded the gates Villa of
the jail, and was honorably also introduced a sad, dark and dirty cell.

CHAPTER XIII

# Do not get the expected arrival of an unwelcome .--.

#

Of all the procedures that the spirit used to torment himself, the most terrible is expected.
Against this there is no remedy. Seems to be easily resolved not to wait, divert the imagination
of the thing hoped for, and live by only one life at a time time, without that painful aspiration
for the future that unsettles the self, leading him out of the center.

When you expect what is to come times are centuries, when what should have been expected to arrive,
flying hours and seconds.

Clara was at the time of the ten with the soul in suspense, trembling and attentive, full of
restlessness and anxiety. Spend ten, and the traveler is not, the clock flies eleven to twelve,
and twelve to one. Pascuala was very afraid, because the noise of people in the street was increased
every hour. The two were sitting in the room interior, and did not say any thing, nor the maid had
those tales of nymphs and little dragon, who had learned in his village, and the orphan was laughing
with the booming and natural simplicity of his character. Both were very quiet, looked anxiously
when some noise is felt on the stairs and make sure that was not what I waited, fell in his
despondency one indifferent, the other on her calmly, melancholy
and hidden agitation.

Clara, at dawn, entered the period of speculation, forming the spirit gives all the torments
imaginable. What had happened? "Would overturn the car? Do you have left Thieves with those
tremendous trabucos painting in prints? Had he abandoned the trip? Perhaps Would love with
some girl in the village?

Would you stop a game of realistic? All he could think less right. Right now it is easy to reassure
taking a bit of serenity, but nobody does, and a blindness to the normal deep insight replaced
understanding. Calm enough reason to say: "Did not come? You have stopped casually. Tomorrow
will come. "But instead of doing this logical reasoning, it is generally
thought is this: "Do not you come?

For it is dead: killed him."

Then the night contributes to this torment the night, which gives
to every horrible ways, as to material things than to the visions.

Clara, who had failed or could not sleep, never ceased to receive
reports, bumps, blood, darkness, suddenly opposed to a large light
that shines horrors.

Da fever that situation.

Feverish impatience creeps into the blood that stirs and circulates
as if the speed of its march accelerate the arrival of what is expected.

The disappointment of our desire is more terrible, because it is slow,
with no limits.

No front but eternity is.

Do not come to mind the changes that can bring next day.

That night and the loneliness seems to have no end in sight.

The first light of day did, however, only increase their sadness. Yesterday! Since yesterday he
had been waiting for! I wanted to get out and run, asking you all for the unfortunate young man.
He opened the balcony, looked into the street, thinking that I would
see him pass, and considered to all passersby.

Then he noticed a person who sets the corner, looking at her tenacity.

Confident that he was not turned away, and did not care more of that person.

Closed the balcony, because he felt fatigue and many irresistible
urge to sleep.

He went to his room and sitting in a chair, rested his head on the
bed.

But instead of sleep began to ponder with such as delirium and agitation
overnight.

Elijah had not returned. What would it? Oh, what light! Maybe he'd
found and would be together somewhere.

Then there came Pascuala coming from the street.

The Alcarrian came to Clara, decorating round and broad front of
his face with cheeky smile.

- Do you know what is going on?

- What?

What's up? - Clara said with interest.

- That this gentleman the other day ... well ... Mr. military ... I stood in the corner.

- And what do I care?

- That says it comes here.

- Jesus, here! And why come here? We are alone.

- As it is a very accomplished gentleman.

- Yes? Well I have not noticed.

- Did not you saw the other day here ... when the Lord came bad?

-
Yes, like a good person.

But back to what you want here?

- You either it maliciously. Oh, you naughty! At that moment in his pocket rang Pascuala the
pesetas that the military had given him. Then he felt footsteps on the stairs and the bell sounded
faintly.

- Is he - said Alcarria.

And before Clara could stop him, the damsel ran, opened the door, and the military, which know,
entered the hall, was found with respect and went up to Clara.

- Who were you looking for? - Clara said .-- It is not: it has gone.

- If you are, not out, - said the military with aplomb.

- Who? But who were you looking for?

- It is easy to understand that do not look that old, whose deal away rather than attract people.

-
But what do you mean? What's you? - Clara asked with a slight look of alarm .-- I alone, leave
you.

- For the same reason I will not.

- If you do not leave, call, yell, - said Clara, certainly determined to do what he said.

- Then reñiremos - military said with a smile of friendly frankness
that disarmed in Clara's anger part.

- For God, who is about to arrive!

But who are you? What you come here? Who has given permission to enter? You are the one who
came the other day with him. Because I recognize, but do not understand to what is today.
Pascuala, Pascuala!

- Do not look at me as an enemy. My entry was unique, but I'm not a thief or a murderer. I come
as a friend, bring peace and friendship. Do not be afraid, Clara. I come as a friend. And we know
of a single day when I came here to this poor guy holding.

- Oh! and can now come - said Clara alarmed. Go away you, God. I do not know him I do not care
all that I said. If he comes ....

- The last thing I care about is that old - he answered .-- Before the military was interested
a little. You thought it was relative, perhaps her husband.

But then I know that is a petty tyrant who lives to torment a poor orphan, who dies giving
melancholy enclosed here. No I can see with indifference that someone so beautiful, so kind,
so worthy of being happy, go life in the hands of this beast.

-
Oh! Well, I'm fine.

We appreciate your kindness - Clara answered, - but not necessary. Go away, by God.

- I will not go, no - the military said, getting excited a little. A few days ago that I am
concerned idea of ??martyrdom that you must suffer. I feel a strong desire to liberate you of this
maniac, and I think I will realize this purpose. I've been there a hundred times a day and horror
has given me the dark side of this house, grave in life so beautiful creature. You will laugh at me,
I understand. It might seem strange that I have taken this interest
a person whom I've only seen once, but this mystery not talk now.

What matters is that you decide to do what I advise. You know, I've sworn not to allow here
die of boredom and loneliness. I'm sure you, so simply told me the only time we saw some of
his misadventures, have the confidence I need today, will appreciate
the nobility of my purposes and will not object to that conduct.

Clara did not know what to say.

I was confused to see the generous and fraternal interest was to
a person whom she had seen so little.

This would be proud to another woman, but Clara was very modest,
and before that had no affectionate demonstration that gratitude and
shame.

Never thought to deserve that.

- I really appreciate it, sir - said, - but ....

The truth is that I could tell he was happy and wanted to continue
that kind of life.

It was true what the military said.

It was impossible to live in the company of that beast.

But perhaps did not expect their salvation from another person? This idea led to more vigorously
reject the offers that you did.

- You do not know the person with whom you live - continued military
.-- You do not know him, I yes: I have already informed of his character
and his ideas.

Not only is a flamboyant man and intractable, but a fanatic without a heart, a fierce man of perverse
instincts and horrible calculations.

No: you can not go longer in the hands of this man, who is not your relative or friend: is
called its guard, to make you a victim of brutal pride.

Clearly understood by the vehemence with which the boy spoke, it was
certainly his interest, and also known that the old paint was not
exaggerated.

The stranger was acting with the highest nobility, sincerity and good faith. He was one of
those characters inclined to adventures difficult and dangerous involving the salvation of the
suffering.

His spirit of chivalry, his heart for good, in that event found a reason for occupation, and devoted
its activity to the completion of the most generous purpose. In addition, a very strong feeling
of sympathy for this poor orphan, he was moved to proceed with such
diligence.

More later we will know the name and deeds of this noble gentleman.

- But you is not here any longer - Clara said .-- How do you convince
me that interested in me, if just being here proves to me otherwise?

If he comes and finds him at home ....

- Do not say anything. That man is so miserable, that does not care neither happiness nor honor
you: everything look with indifference. You has no more protection than me.
The orphan, when he heard these words he felt a chill in the soul.
The timing was such made them look like a great truth. Its sole, legitimate
and true friend would not come. No he had more protection than an
upstart.

- Nothing more than me, but it is enough - the young man
with affected voice you follow the plan .-- I will check: If you do
not that old. I will for you all that can be a man of heart and honesty.
You have in me the confidence that what we have has to be saved ....
And now, Clara, I go. But I shall soon return to give my orders to
the poor prisoner, whose happiness depends on me. What pride I feel
at this! I am always alert. If you think of a new misfortune, no need
to tell me. I find myself here to help her and cheer. He has no more
protection to you than me. Think you well. Goodbye.

The unknown man's
decision, suggested as novel in the secrets of home, was very firm.
It was proposed to undertake an adventure generous, he bowed to at
the same time a feeling of sympathy, and confirmed in him the desire,
to do well.

If there was a bit of selfishness in it, then we will
see. Since he left, when left Pascuala scared of the kitchen and said:

-
The Master!

- Do not open - Clara said .-- Wait fearful, hiding you.

But
Elias, who had a key, you need not open for entry.

- No matter -
said the officer, who was trying to calm Clara.

Opened and tagline.
Came downcast and withdrawn. Took a few steps down the corridor without
see the intruder, but to get to the end, he noted that bulk, looked
up and saw the young man who bowed before him with respect.

CHAPTER
XIV

# The determination. #

- What do you look? Who are you? What
are you doing here?

- Would not you know me? I few days ago brought
to you very badly to his house, and went to see if you were already
fully recovered.

- Yes, sir, I'm good - snapped, and went into the
room, where he followed the young man - not offered anything else?

-
Nothing more, and I retire, I have just arrived - said the military
naturally affected .-- I retire repeating that I care very much for
your health.

- Well, since you told me the other day - said glancing
suspicious Coletilla to Clara and to Pascuala.

- Did not send me
anything?

- Nothing more but I leave you in peace. Are not you going
to the procession? It is very lucid.

- I'm not for processions.

-
Do you like them you know what happens in the houses of the royalists?
- Said the old man bitter and suspicious accent typical of his character
.-- Here there is a conspiracy. And if I conspired, so you would not
come to amaze the dandies of the National Militia.

Clara was shaking.
The military seemed that, offended by this insult, was about to draw
his the tremendous saber at his waist and to download it over the
head of the realist. But he smiled disdainfully and said:

- Dude,
I see that I judged you wrong. You can be sure to give him away I
will not. What harm can you do?

- Me? ... ....-- Damage the fan responded
with a fierce grin, that it was equivalent to the smile.

- Soon will
you do and for a short time. That I swear to you. With that I shall
make the favor of leaving. Goodbye.

He went to the exit, not without
trying to express to Clara with a look which he had previously that
in so many words, that is, to trust him and wait. Would have liked
to be accompanied the girl to the door, but dared not unhappy
