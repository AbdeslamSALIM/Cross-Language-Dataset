time to write brochures, to make speeches from the podium the lodge "Harmony" to make verses,
and talk to their countrymen of disease of the homeland and its necessary and possible cures.
A night to discuss the assassination Student of Medicine, met the Cuban residents there, Martí spoke
and recalled one who was at that memorable meeting, which was flashing his speech, on, sweeping,
and also recalls what happened that night something supernatural. Hanging from the wall above
the podium, there was a map of Cuba, and when Marti, full of the most tender lyricism made a
tearful call to her home, surrounded by chains, when the audience, suspended of his word, trembling
with emotion, the map fell like a crown on his head. It was like if your whole entire earth, to
respond to their calls lie! And when the proclamation of the Republic in Spain - as fleeting
as a breath swallow - Marti put in the hands of Estanislao Figueras a long letter advocating for
the independence of Cuba. And when the feds in formal session held at the Academy of jurisprudence,
declined to declare the Cuban Madrid who were content with the Spanish Federal Republic, Martí,
who was present, objected to this, and a debate that kept him up seven hours, poured on the
ground these purposes. Marti also opposed the establishment in Madrid of a Cuban casino. That
and other traits, went to his young age and in full court of Spain, as the verb and the tormented
soul of his people and miserable ....

of air, and he went to Zaragoza Martí where just arrived, won the
affection and estimate of the sons of that noble piece of Spain.

The insurgents were called in Aragon but the so called, without anger and hatred. Zaragoza Martí was
everything, he in meetings, newspaper writer, poet ever.
