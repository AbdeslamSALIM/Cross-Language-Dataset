 I admire much
to Dante, but I can not believe they are only mentioned in his poem theologies and philosophies
that in more detail, clarity, substance and can be studied in order San Anselmo, San Bernardo,
Peter Lombard, St. Bonaventure, St. Thomas Aquinas and other Doctors of the Middle Ages. So
if I think of Dante, what do you think of Zola and what I believe Zola who can teach me, not learn
best in any encyclopedic manual: the Bouillet, for example?
