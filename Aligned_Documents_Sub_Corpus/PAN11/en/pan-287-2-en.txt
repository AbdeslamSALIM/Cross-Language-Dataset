 Andaluz, impressionable,
susceptible and graceful hyperbolic discussed without ceremony, Castilian has measured your attic
and common sense in a thousand epigrams and comments burlesque, harsh and raucous Catalan
take things seriously, as if in Parliament or in the bag . Everything discussed in coffee mysteries
Court Chambers and the Government's conduct, press events, causes and phrases noisy scandals,
international events and glorious victories of literary and Torero, speaker and singer. Depth discussion,
perorations eloquent and gallant, chronic things scandalous, frivolous and big business and light
illusions, and even ardent love and terrible passions are aroused at the altar full of life,
essentially democratic. Those who have studied a small cafe in Madrid and Barcelona, ​​Seville
and Cadiz, knows one of the most marked phases of Spanish society. For the rest, coffee is not for
the Spanish, but an element of association, because apart from being
very sober have no taste or drink coffee know.

What
is the milk is very, very slightly sweetened with brown paint, and have
a fancy to drink a cup to warm. They are not power, but in terms chocolate
and wine.

I am averse to bitter coffee, because he delights in rancid oil. Everyone has their tastes
and that there is no dispute.
