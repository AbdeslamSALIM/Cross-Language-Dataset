 The
dyer was pounding in a mortar one hundred and one hundred subjects who was now taking a pot,
a kettle pray, pray in a pouch, and rummaging around, and having a pot to another, and throwing
now here, now thither, smelled tablespoons of liquid, and whose contact was necessary to save the
skin because it gnawed more than fire, was preparing to empty the ingredients in different boilers, and
buried in that filth large number of materials and manufacturing invaluable. "This is going to
waste all, he said analytical. In this dish is the ingredient A, such as V. know, is extremely
caustic, and that also gives a color very ugly. In this other rubber B is excellent for spotting,
and whose signs are not removed but with great difficulty. In this boiler is the stick C, which
may serve to give a crude color and common, but that I do not have to produce anything how exquisite.
In a word, examined everything separately, I find that V. ingredients used contrary to what
V. proposed; and now I can be sure that instead of taking anything according to the beautiful
samples is V. in the office, going to suffer a loss of consideration in its reputation and interests.
" "Everything is possible, Mr. Philosopher, he said the inexorable dyer, taking into his hands
the precious rich materials and manufacturing, and dipping them without mercy on the dirty and smelly
boiler anything is possible, but to end the discussion, let V. see here within a few days. " The philosopher
came into effect, and the dyer faded all objections to deploying fabrics eyes rigorous demonstration
that had to be squandered. What a surprise! What a humiliation for the analytical! Showed a
fine scarlet, other delicate green, other beautiful blue, sometimes exquisite orange, black
uploaded other, other white covered Thin with many flowers, others sported delicious jasper field
to a time where beauty and caprice. The nuances were many and charming, manufacturing clean, smooth,
bright as if they had been covered with glass without suffering the hand contact man. The philosopher
is left confused and crestfallen, saying to himself, "knowing is not the same what a thing by
itself, or what may be in combination with other, hereafter no I shall just break down and separate,
which also makes composing and collecting wonders: witness the dry cleaner. "

Objects seen by one side.

Understandings otherwise very clear and insightful, unfortunately spoil by itching to develop
a series of ideas that represents the object but on the one hand, eventually lead to bizarre
results. Here is the reason that all tested and everything is contested, and sometimes a man who
obviously has the truth on their side, is castellated pointed to the convictions, and stand
with the arms of good sense and sanity to the attacks of a sophist who breaks through all the
cracks, and drained to through the most solid and compact as filtered through the pores. The same
superabundance ingenuity produces this defect, like people too remain agile and spirited hard
at a measured pace and serious.

Disadvantages of a perception too fast.

Speed ??is precious quality
