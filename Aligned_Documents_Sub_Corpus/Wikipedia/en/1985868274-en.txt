For other uses, see Boa constrictor (disambiguation)Boa constrictor is a non-venomous boa species found in Central America, South America and some islands in the Caribbean. The common name is the same as the scientific name, which is unusual. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable and it may grow to become quite large. Ten subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.''DescriptionAdult sizes vary among the subspecies, although those found in northern South America reach the greatest lengths. The largest specimens on record are two from Suriname; one measuring 13.5 feet (411 cm) and the other slightly over 14 feet (427 cm). However, such sizes are very rare and on average 10 feet (305 cm) is considered a large specimen.Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. ISBN 0-8069-6460-X. There is also a report of an 18.5 foot (5.6 m) specimen from Trinidad, but this is now believed to have been a misidentified anaconda, Eunectes murinus.Murphy JC, Henderson RW. 1997. Tales of Giant Snakes: a natural history of anacondas and pythons. Malabar, Fl: Krieger Publishing. 221 pp. ISBN 0-89464-995-7.The tail is slightly prehensile and there are no thermoreceptive labial pits around the mouth.Parker HW, Grandison AGC. 1977.

ISBN 0-8014-1095-9 (cloth), ISBN 0-8014-9164-9 (paper).The color pattern consists of a ruddy brown ground color, becoming a rich brick red on the tail. Dorsally, the ground color is overlaid with a series of large tan-colored saddles that become lighter towards the tail. Here, the saddles break up into half rings of a pale cream color in vivid contrast with the red.Ditmars RL. 1933. Reptiles of the World. Revised Edition. The MacMillan Company. 329 pp. 89 plates.Common namesThough all boids are constrictors, only this species is properly referred to as "boa constrictor"; a rare instance of an animal having the same common and scientific binomial name.All subspecies are referred to as "boa constrictors," while the nominate subspecies, B. c. constrictor, is often referred to specifically as the "red-tailed boa."B. c. constrictor is also called the "common boa."Other common names include "jibóia" (Latin American) and "macajuel" (Trinidadian, pronounced mah-cah-well).Mendes J. 1986. Cote ce Cote la: Trinidad & Tobago Dictionary. Arima, Trinidad. p. 92.Geographic rangeFound from northern Mexico through Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) to South America north of 35°S (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina. Also in the Lesser Antilles (Dominica and St. Lucia), on San Andrés, Providencia and many other islands along the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America. The type locality given is "Indiis" -- a mistake, according to Peters and Orejas-Miranda (1970).HabitatFlourishes in a wide variety of environmental conditions, from tropical rainforests to arid country.Stidworthy J. 1974. Snakes of the World. Grosset & Dunlap Inc. 160 pp. ISBN 0-448-11856-4.BehaviorSmall individuals may climb into trees and shrubs to forage, but they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. It is said that specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily.Stidworthy J. 1974. Snakes of the World. Grosset & Dunlap Inc. 160 pp. ISBN 0-448-11856-4.FeedingPrey includes a wide variety of mammals and birds. The bulk of their diet consists of rodents, but larger lizards and mammals as big as ocelots are also reported to have been consumed.ReproductionOvoviviparous, females give birth to live young that average 15-20 inches (38-51 cm) in length.CaptivityThis species does well in captivity, usually becoming quite tame. It is a common sight in zoos. Captive longevity is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts of over 40 years (BeBe, the oldest captive specimen on record, reached almost 41 years of age), making them a long-term commitment as a pet. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan. Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, it is widely bred in captivity.SubspeciesSubspeciesTaxon authorCommon nameGeographic rangeB. c. amarali]]''(Stull, 1932)Amaral's boaB. c. constrictorLinnaeus]], 1758Red-tailed boaB. c. imperator]]''Daudin]], 1803Common northern boaB. c. longicauda]]''Price & Russo, 1991Tumbes Peru boaB. c. melanogaster]]''Langhammer, 1983Ecuadorian boaB. c. nebulosa]]''(Lazell, 1964)Dominican clouded boaB. c. occidentalis]]''Philippi, 1873Argentine boaB. c. orophias]]''Linnaeus, 1758St. Lucia boaB. c. ortonii]]''Cope]], 1878Orton's boaB. c. sabogae]]''Barbour]], 1906)Pearl Island boaSee alsoList of boine species and subspeciesReferencesExternal linksBoa-constrictors.com.
