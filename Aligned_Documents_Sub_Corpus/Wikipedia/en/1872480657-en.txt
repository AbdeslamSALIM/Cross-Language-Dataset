| deathplace=Rome, Italy| other=Adeodatus   Pope Saint Adeodatus I or Deodatus I (which is Given by God in Latin, also called Deusdedit, which is God Has Given; both are now considered variants of the same name) (died November 8, 618) was pope from 615 to 618.He was born in Rome, the son of a subdeacon. According to tradition, he was the first pope to use lead seals (bullae) on papal documents, which in time came to be called "papal bulls".He is the first priest to be elected pope since John II in 533. He was a priest for 40 years prior and represents the second wave of anti-Gregorian challenge to the papacy, the first being that of Sabinian. He reversed the practice of his predecessor, Boniface IV, of filling the papal adminstative ranks with monks by recalling the clergy to such positions and by ordaining some 14 priests (the first ordinations in Rome since Pope Saint Gregory).He was appointed Pope 13 November, 615, and was distinguished for his charity and zeal. He encouraged and supported the clergy, who were impoverished in consequence of the political troubles of the time; and when his diocese was visited by a violent earthquake and leprosy he set an heroic example by his efforts to relieve the suffering. One bulla dating from his reign is still preserved, the obverse of which represents the Good Shepherd in the midst of His sheep, with the letters Alpha and Omega underneath, while the reverse bears the inscription: Deusdedit Papæ. His feast occurs 8 November.References       Adeodatus 1 Adeodatus I Adeodatus 01 Adeodatus 01 Adeodatus 01 Adeodatus I Adeodatus I Adeodatus 1 Adeodatus Category:7th century Christian saintsaf:Pous Deusdedit bg:Адеодат I ca:Deodat I cs:Deusdedit de:Adeodatus I. es:Adeodato I eo:Diodono fr:Adéodat Ier gl:Adeodato I, papa ko:교황 아데오다토 1세 id:Paus Adeodatus I it:Papa Adeodato I sw:Papa Adeodato I la:Adeodatus I hu:I.
