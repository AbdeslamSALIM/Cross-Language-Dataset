He is credited with inventing the Spinning Jennifer (shortened to spinning Jenny in 1768) in 1764.Along with Richard Arkwright, Hargreaves is one of the most famous names of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, yet little is known of him as a person. Born at Knuzden Brook near Stanhill in Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire, he lived at Blackburn, then a town with a population of about 5,000, known for the production of "Blackburn greys," cloths of linen Warp and cotton weft. They were usually sent to London to be printed. The demand for cotton yarn outstripped supply, and the crude one-thread spinning wheel could not keep up.The idea for the spinning jenny is said to have come from the inventor seeing a one-thread wheel overturned upon the floor, when both the wheel and the spindle continued to revolve. He realised that if a number of spindles were placed upright and side by side, several threads might be spun at once. This idea may have come from Hargreaves, or perhaps from Thomas Highs, who had a daughter called Jenny: the sources given below are in conflict.Whoever the inventor was, he designed a frame, in one part of which he placed eight rovings in a row, and Hargreaves certainly developed the idea from its crude beginnings.The spinning jenny was confined to producing cotton weft, it was unable to produce yarn of sufficient quality for the warp. This deficiency was supplied by Arkwright's spinning frame.Opposition to the machine caused Hargreaves to leave for Nottingham, where the cotton hosiery industry benefited from the increased provision of suitable yarn. Arkwright also ended up in the town, and was even more successful. Hargreaves made jennies for a man called Shipley, and on 12 June 1770, he was granted a patent, which enabled him to take legal action against the Lancashire manufacturers who had begun using it. Although he failed in this, Hargreaves' business was carried on until his death in 1778, the year before that in which Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule.==External links==Essay from www.cottontown.org on Hargreaves and the Spinning JennyEssay from www.cottontimes.co.uk/SourcesHargraves Spinning Jenny - Confined to spinning weft Category:People of the Industrial Revolution Category:English engineers Category:People from Oswaldtwistle Category:1720 births Category:1778 deaths Category:History of the textile industryca:James Hargreaves de:James Hargreaves es:James Hargreaves fr:James Hargreaves ka:ჯეიმზ ჰარგრივზი nl:James Hargreaves ja:ジェームズ・ハーグリーブス no:James Hargreaves pl:James Hargreaves sv:James Hargreaves vi:James Hargreaves
