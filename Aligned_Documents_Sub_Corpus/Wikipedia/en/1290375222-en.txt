The family first moved to Scotland, but then settled in Knopfler's mother's home town of Newcastle upon Tyne in the north-east of England when he was nine years old. There, he and his younger brother David (also a musician) attended Gosforth Grammar School, where he was inspired by his uncle Kingsley's harmonica and boogie-woogie piano playing. Later, in his teens, he wanted to buy an expensive flamingo-pink Fender Stratocaster just like Hank Marvin's, but had to settle for a £50 twin pickup Höfner Super Solid.Kilburn, T. (2006) Mark Knopfler Authorized Biography Retrieved on April 2, 2007 Like many other schoolboys of the 1960s, he served an early apprenticeship by forming and joining anonymous schoolboy bands and listening to singers like Elvis Presley and guitarists Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, Jimi Hendrix, Django Reinhardt and James Burton. At sixteen he made a local TV appearance as half of a harmony duo along with a friend from school named Sue Hercombe.In 1967, having displayed a flair for English, Knopfler studied journalism for a year at Harlow Technical College.The Journalism Centre Retrieved on April 2, 2007 At the end of the course he secured a job in Leeds as a junior reporter on the Yorkshire Evening Post.Chaos on the Sheepscar Interchange Retrieved on April 2, 2007. Two years later, he decided to further his studies and graduated with a degree in English at the University of Leeds.Who's been here Retrieved on April 2, 2007 He worked as a lecturer at Loughton College during this period. It was while Knopfler was living in Leeds that he married Kathy White, his long-time girlfriend from school days; however, the marriage didn't last.After separating from his wife, he moved to London and joined a High Wycombe-based band called Brewers Droop, appearing on the album "The Booze Brothers". One night while spending some time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it playable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it. He said in a later interview, "That was where I found my 'voice' on guitar." Soon after he recorded a "demo" tape of an original (but unreleased) song; "Summer's Coming My Way", in a London studio.The Dire Straits years Dire Straits' first sessions were done under the name of Cafe Racers, with Knopfler's brother David writing and serving as front man on one of the five songs, with Pick Withers as drummer and John Illsley on bass guitar. Knopfler often wore a headband during performances.Dire Straits recorded and released their first album, the self-titled Dire Straits in 1978 initially to little fanfare in the UK, but a single release, "Sultans of Swing" became a chart hit in Holland and album sales took off across Europe and then in the United States and finally the UK. The second album, Communiqué ''produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, followed in 1979, reaching number one in Germany while the first album was still at number three. There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits after the release of ''Making Movies, with Mark Knopfler increasingly the driving force behind the group.The group's third album, Making Movies, was released in 1980 and marked a move towards more complex arrangements and production which continued for the remainder of the group's career. Making Movies contained many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions, with the song "Romeo and Juliet", about a failed love affair becoming what critics call his best loved song; with a trademark he developed keeping personal songs under fictitious names. Dire Straits' fourth album, Love over Gold followed in 1982 and included the UK #2 hit "Private Investigations", "Telegraph Road" and "Industrial Disease", as well as the title track to that album.With Love Over Gold still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song EP titled ExtendedancEPlay in early 1983. Featuring the hit single "Twisting By the Pool", this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer Terry Williams, (formerly of Rockpile), who replaced Withers in November 1982. A world tour called Alchemy: Dire Straits Live followed later in 1983, and a double-LP of the recordings of two live shows in Hammersmith Odeon in London was released in March 1984, selling over 500,000 albums.At this time Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects, including writing the music score for the film Local Hero, released in 1983. The soundtrack album Local Hero was a large success, and it was followed in 1984 by his scores for the films Cal and Comfort and Joy.Knopfler got married for the second time in November 1983, to Lourdes Salamone. Their twin sons, Benji and Joseph, were born in 1987.Dire Straits' biggest studio album by far was their fifth, Brothers in Arms, released in 1985. It became an international hit and spawned several chart singles including the US number-one hit "Money for Nothing," which was the first video ever to be played on MTV in Britain. It was also the first compact disc to sell a million copies and is largely credited for launching the CD format. Other successful singles were "So Far Away", "Walk of Life", and the album's Brothers in Arms (song). The band's 1985–86 world tour of over 230 shows was immensely successful.After the Brothers in Arms tour Dire Straits went on a lengthy hiatus, with Knopfler concentrating mainly on film soundtracks. Knopfler joined the charity ensemble Ferry Aid on "Let It Be" in the wake of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. The song reached #1 on the UK singles chart in March 1987. Additionally in 1987, over a meal at a Notting Hill wine bar, Knopfler formed The Notting Hillbillies, a more country-focused band. Knopfler further emphasized his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with Chet Atkins, Neck and Neck.In 1988, Dire Straits regrouped for the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert at Wembley Stadium, in which they were the headline act and were accompanied by Elton John and Eric Clapton, who by this time had developed a strong friendship with Knopfler. 1990 saw the release of the Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time. The line-up of that group featured Guy Fletcher.After touring with the Notting Hillbillies, Knopfler reformed Dire Straits. The band toured with Slowhand and Elton John during the Knebworth charity show the same year. Drummer Terry Williams had left the group in 1989, and in 1991 when Knopfler, John Illsley, Alan Clark and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album, they were accompanied by several part-time sidesmen, including percussionist Danny Cummings and Toto drummer Jeff Porcaro.In September 1991, the eagerly awaited follow-up to the Brothers In Arms album was finally released. On Every Street was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached #1 in the UK. A gruelling world tour to accompany the album followed, which lasted until the end of 1992. This was to be Dire Straits' final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous Brothers In Arms tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such massive operations. This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group's dissolution in 1995.Dire Straits lyrics, music, biography, records, band, album, videos, CD, and the discography including Dire Straits famous works&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Two live albums were released after On Every Street. Released in 1993, On The Night documented Dire Straits' final world tour. It was followed in 1995 by Live at the BBC, which was released as a contractual album for Vertigo Records just before Dire Straits disbanded.Knopfler's marriage to Lourdes Salamone ended in 1993 and in 1995, having quietly laid Dire Straits to rest, he launched his solo career. Keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, while Danny Cummings has made frequent appearances, including one on Knopfler's latest solo album.2007 Recording Diary - Week 1 - January 2007 Retrieved on April 2, 2007.Solo careerFollowing the dissolution of Dire Straits, Knopfler released his first solo album, Golden Heart in March 1996, featuring the UK single "Darling Pretty".

In the promo for "Shangri-La" on his official website he said that his current line-up of Glenn Worf (bass), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), Chad Cromwell (drums), Richard Bennett (guitar) and Matt Rollings (piano) "play Dire Straits songs better than Dire Straits did." The "Shangri-La" tour took Mark to countries like India and the United Arab Emirates for the first time. In India, his concerts at Bombay and Bangalore were very well received, with over 20,000 fans gathering at each concert to listen to a legend many thought would never visit their country.In November 2005 a third compilation, The Best of Dire Straits &amp; Mark Knopfler: Private Investigations was released, consisting of material from most of Dire Straits' studio albums and Knopfler's solo and soundtrack material. The album was made available in two editions: a single CD (with a grey cover) and also as double CD (with the cover in blue), and was well-received.
