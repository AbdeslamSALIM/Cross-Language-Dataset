It is believed that the city was originally established during the Celtic period as an Iberian settlement, about 300 B.C., although the name Abrantes comes from the Latin Aurantes perhaps owing to the alluvial gold (aurum) found along the Tagus. Roman mosaics, coins, the remains of an aqueduct, and other antiquities have been discovered in the neighborhood.Since 1172 (in the reign of Alfonso I), Abrantes was the Spanish military Order of Saint James of Compostela's first commandery in Portugal, where it soon became a distinct order, which Pope Nicholas IV in 1290 released from the jurisdiction of the Spanish grand master in Uclés.It was the seat of Portuguese marquesses, one of which was an early patron of the Brazilian-born versatile scientist, naturalist and pioneering inventor-aeronaut Bartholomeu Lourenço de Gusmão.Abrantes was captured on the 24th of November 1807 by the French under General Junot, for which achievement it was created by Napoleon I a victory title of ducal rank in chief of Abrantès for Jean-Andoche Junot in 1808 (hereditary, extinguished in 1859, but then extended in female line 1869, finally also extinguished in 1985). By the Convention of Cintra (22 August 1808) the town was restored to the British and Portuguese.Abrantes was made a city in 14 June 1916, which is celebrated every year on this same day.Sources and References Heraldica.org- Napoleonic victory titlesExternal linksPhotos from Abrantes Category:Cities in Portugal Category:Municipalities of Portugalda:Abrantes de:Abrantes eo:Abrantes es:Abrantes fa:آبرانتس fr:Abrantes gl:Abrantes it:Abrantes nl:Abrantes no:Abrantes pl:Abrantes pt:Abrantes ro:Abrantes ru:Абрантеш fi:Abrantes sv:Abrantes tr:Abrantes vo:Abrantes zh:阿布兰特什
