, the current Duke of Gloucester]]  Duke of Gloucester () is a British royal title (after Gloucester), often conferred on one of the sons of the reigning monarch. The first four creations were in the Peerage of England, the next in the Peerage of Great Britain, and the last in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; this current creation carries with it the subsidiary titles of Earl of Ulster and Baron Culloden.The title was first conferred on Thomas of Woodstock, the thirteenth child of King Edward III. The title became extinct at his death, as it did upon the death of the Duke of the second creation, Humphrey of Lancaster, fifth son of King Henry IV.The title was next conferred on Richard Plantagenet, brother to King Edward IV. When Richard himself became King, the dukedom merged into the crown. After Richard's death, the title was considered ominous, since the first three such Dukes had all died without issue to inherit their titles. The title was not awarded for over 150 years, the next to receive the dukedom being the son of King Charles I, Henry Stuart, upon whose death the title became officially extinct.William, son of Queen Anne, was styled "Duke of Gloucester" for his whole life (1689–1700), but was never created Duke. Frederick, Prince of Wales was styled "Duke of Gloucester" from 1718–1726, but was then created Duke of Edinburgh rather than of Gloucester.The next actual creation was for the brother of George III, Prince William Henry, the full title being "Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh".The fifth and final creation was for Prince Henry, son of King George V. Upon Prince Henry's death, the dukedom was inherited by his son Prince Richard, who still holds the title. The heir to the title is presently Alexander Windsor, styled Earl of Ulster.There is a preserved steam locomotive called ''Duke of Gloucester''.Dukes of Gloucester, first Creation (1385)Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester (1355-1397) (forfeit with his death (1397)Dukes of Gloucester, second Creation (1414)Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester (1390-1447)Dukes of Gloucester, third Creation (28 June 1461)Richard, Duke of Gloucester (1452-1485) (became King Richard III in 1483)Dukes of Gloucester, fourth Creation (1659)Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester (1640-1660)Dukes of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1764)HRH Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1743-1805)HRH Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh (1776-1834)Dukes of Gloucester, fifth Creation (1928)HRH Prince Henry, 1st Duke of Gloucester (1900-1974)HRH Prince Richard, 2nd Duke of Gloucester (b. 1944)Heir Apparent: Alexander Patrick Gregers Richard Windsor, Earl of Ulster (born 24 October 1974)Lord Ulster's heir-apparent: Xan Richard Anders Windsor, Lord Culloden (born 12 March 2007)The above two are the limits of the first duke's agnatic descendants, and therefore the dukedom's line of succession.See alsoPrince William, Duke of GloucesterExternal linksDuke of GloucesterSee also Earl of Gloucester.
