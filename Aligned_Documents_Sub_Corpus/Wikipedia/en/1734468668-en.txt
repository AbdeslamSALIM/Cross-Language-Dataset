SchooldaysBale was born in Cardiff, the younger of two children, and attended Eglwys Newydd Primary School at Whitchurch. His outstanding talent was evident from very early on, in particular his poise and left foot. It was while at this school he first came to the attention of Southampton at 9 years old, when he was playing in a 5 a side tournament with his first club, Cardiff Civil Service football club.Bale then attended Whitchurch High School in Cardiff, where, as well as football, he played rugby and hockey and was a distance runner. Because of his superior skills, the school's PE teacher, Gwyn Morris, had to write special rules. These restricted Bale to playing one-touch football and not using his left foot. Whilst at Whitchurch, Bale trained at Southampton's satellite academy in Bath, although there was initially some doubt if Southampton would give him a scholarship due to his height.Despite being only 16 at the time, he helped the school's under-18 side win the Cardiff & Vale Senior Cup. He left school in the summer of 2005 with a Grade A in PE amongst his GCSE results. In his final year at school he was awarded the PE department's prize for services to sport. In the presentation, Morris commented: "Gareth has a fierce determination to succeed and has the character and qualities to achieve his personal goals. He is one of the most unselfish individuals that I have had the pleasure to help educate."Playing careerSouthamptonAt the age of 16 years and 275 days, Bale became the second youngest player ever to play for the Saints (after Theo Walcott) when he made his debut on April 17, 2006.

He siged a new four-year deal with the club in August 2008.WalesHe made the senior Welsh squad at the end of the 2005&ndash;06 season and then played his debut on 27 May 2006 as a substitute in a 2&ndash;1 win over Trinidad and Tobago, making him the youngest ever player to play for Wales aged just 16 years and 315 days to break Lewin Nyatanga's three-month old record.
