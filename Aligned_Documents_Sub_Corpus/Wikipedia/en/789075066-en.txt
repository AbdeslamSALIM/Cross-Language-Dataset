It has been in the Jupiler League since 2005-06. Roeselare is a semi-professional club, meaning it comprises both professional and amateur footballers.HistoryThe first club of the city was founded in 1900 by some students and named De Verenigde Vrienden (Dutch for The United Friends) but that name changed early to Red Star Roeselare. In 1902, the club is known as Union Sportive Roulers (in French) but it will retire from the football association for financial problems in 1909. The next year, two new clubs are founded -- Sportvereniging Roeselare (the Catholics) and F.C. Roeselare (the non-Catholics)-- but not for long as the former club activity stopped in 1914 due to World War I. The birth of S.K. Roeselare arose seven years later. The same year (1921) it received the matricule n° 134 as it became a member of the national association. The other club from the town registered in 1923 as F.C. Roeselare with the matricule n° 286. However, this matricule does not exist anymore as K.S.K. Roeselare and K.F.C. Roeselare merged in 1999 to form K.S.V. and kept the n° 134. The first time a team from Roeselare achieved promotion to the first division was in 2005 when K.S.V. won the second division playoff.Current squad                            http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/download/brand/195643.html KSV Roeselare logotypeFormer Players Kevin Hoddy (1989-92)HonoursBelgian Second Division:Runners-up (1): 2004-05Belgian Second Division Final Round:Winners (1): 2005European recordAs of September 8, 2006:CompetitionAppearancesMatches playedWinsDrawsLossesGoals ForGoals AgainstUEFA Cup1430198Uefa Cup 2006 - 20071st qualifier:FK Vardar Skopje - KSV Roeselare 1 - 2KSV Roeselare - FK Vardar Skopje 5 - 12nd qualifier:KSV Roeselare - FC Ethnikos Achnas 2 - 1FC Ethnikos Achnas - KSV Roeselare 5 - 0References Official website* Roeselare Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1999de:KSV Roeselare es:KSV Roeselare fr:KSV Roulers it:K.S.V.
