Colmar is also the seat of the highest jurisdiction in Alsace, the Cour d'appel de Colmar. It is situated along the "Alsacian wine route" and considers itself the "Capital of the alsacian wines" (Capitale des vins d'Alsace).In 2006 Colmar had a population of 67,163. Colmar is also the chief town of the arrondissement of Colmar, with 86,832 inhabitants.Colmar is the home town of the painter and engraver Martin Schongauer and the sculptor Frédéric Bartholdi. The city is renowned for its well preserved old town, its numerous architectural landmarks and its museums, among which the Unterlinden Museum.HistoryColmar was founded in the 9th century. This was the location where Charles the Fat held a diet in 884. Colmar was granted the status of a free imperial city of the Holy Roman Empire in 1226. During the Thirty Years' War, the city was taken by the armies of Sweden in 1632, who held it for two years. The city was conquered by France under Louis XIV in 1697.In 1679 (Treaties of Nijmegen) Colmar was ceded to France. With the rest of Alsace, Colmar was annexed by the newly formed German Empire in 1871 as a result of the Franco-Prussian War. It returned to France after World War I, was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1940, and then reverted to French control after the battle of the "Colmar Pocket" in 1945.GeographyColmar is 64 kilometers (40 miles) south-southwest of Strasbourg, at 48.08°N, 7.36°E, on the Lauch River, directly to the east of the Vosges Mountains. It is connected to the Rhine by a canal.ClimateColmar has a sunny microclimate and is the driest city in France, with an annual precipitation of just 550 mm, making it ideal for Alsace wine. Colmar is also the Capital of Alsatian wine.The dryness results from the town's location next to mountains which force clouds arriving from the west to rise, and much of their moisture to condense and fall as precipitation over the higher ground, leaving the air warmed and dried by the time it reaches Colmar.Sights's "Virgin in a rose-garden" inside the Église des Dominicains]] .]]  Relatively spared by the destructions of the French Revolution and the wars of 1870-1871, 1914-1918 and 1939-1945, the cityscape of old-town Colmar is homogenous and renowned among tourists. The city area of the city crossed by canals of the river Lauch, and which formerly served as the butcher's, tanner's and fishmonger's area, is now called "little Venice" (la Petite Venise). Colmar's cityscape (and neighbouring Riquewihr's) served for the design of the Japanese animated film Howl's Moving Castle.Architectural landmarksColmar's secular and religious architectural landmarks reflect eight centuries of Germanic and French architecture and the adaptation of their respective stylistic language to the local customs and builiding materials (sandstone, timber framing...).Secular buildingsMaison Adolph - 14th century (German Gothic)Koifhus, also known as Ancienne Douane - 1480 (German Gothic)Maison Pfister - 1537 (German Renaissance).Ancien Corps de garde - 1575 (German Renaissance)Maison des Chevaliers de Saint-Jean - 1608 (German Renaissance)Maison des Têtes - 1609 (German Renaissance)Poêle des laboureurs - 1626 (German Baroque)Ancien Hôpital - 1744 (French Classicism)Tribunal de grande instance - 1771 (French Classicism)Hôtel de ville - 1790 (French Classicism)Théâtre municpal - 1849 (French Neoclassicism)Marché couvert - 1865 (French Neo-Baroque).
