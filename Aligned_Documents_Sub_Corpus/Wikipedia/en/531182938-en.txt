John Derek (August 12, 1926 – May 22, 1998) was an American actor, director and photographer most famous for the women to whom he was married.Born Derek Delevan Harris in Hollywood, California, he was first married to actress Pati Behrs (1922-2004), grand-niece of Leo Tolstoy and mother of his two children, Russell & Sean.His matinee-idol good looks quickly got him supporting roles, most notably as Broderick Crawford's son in All the King's Men (1949), but he also enjoyed leads such as "Nick Romano" in Knock on Any Door (1949) opposite Humphrey Bogart (who told him, "You look great, but kid, that's not enough"), "Brock Mitchell" in Fury at Showdown, and as Robin Hood in Rogues of Sherwood Forest (1950) with Alan Hale.Perhaps Derek's most memorable film appearance was in a supporting role in the 1956 epic film, as the noble Joshua in The Ten Commandments.Derek had a minor role as a film director. He directed his fourth wife, Bo Derek, in four movies. The 1990 film Ghosts Can't Do It was his last attempt in the director's chair. He also directed two hit music videos for Shania Twain, "Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?" and "Any Man of Mine".His last three wives seemed to be nearly identical in appearance, especially Linda Evans and Bo Derek. Derek took photos of all three, at different times, for Playboy magazine. He died from cardiovascular disease in Santa Maria, California at the age of 71.Derek was married to:Pati Behrs (1951-1957)Ursula Andress (1957-1966)Linda Evans (1968-1974)Bo Derek (1976-1998)External links Category:American film actors Category:American film directors Category:American photographers Category:California actors Category:Deaths from cardiovascular disease Category:1926 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Los Angeles, Californiade:John Derek es:John Derek fr:John Derek it:John Derek nl:John Derek ja:ジョン・デレク pl:John Derek fi:John Derek sv:John Derek
