 | Section2 = UsesBufferSodium borate is used in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for gel electrophoresis of DNA, such as TBE or the newer SB buffer. Borate buffers (usually at pH 8) are also used as preferential equilibration solution in DMP-based crosslinking reactions.Co-complexingBorax as a source of borate has been used to take advantage of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to complex various substances. Borate and a suitable polymer bed are used to chromatograph non-glycosylated hemoglobin differentially from non-enzymatically glycosylated hemoglobin (chiefly HbA1c), which is a model for long term damage done by hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus. Borate and a proprietary synthetic amino acid, Deselex (from Henkel) have been used to complex water "hardness" cations to make a non-precipitating water "softener". Borate alone does not have a high affinity for "hardness" cations, although it has been used for that purpose.FluxA mixture of borax and ammonium chloride is used as a flux when welding iron and steel. It lowers the melting point of the unwanted iron oxide (scale), allowing it to run off. Borax is also used mixed with water as a flux when soldering jewelry metals such as gold or silver. It allows the molten solder to flow evenly over the joint in question. Borax is also a good flux for 'pre-tinning' tungsten with zinc - making the tungsten soft-solderable.Small-scale miningBorax is replacing mercury as the preferred method for extracting gold in small-scale mining facilities. The method is called the borax method and was first discovered in the Philippines. PuttyWhen a borax-water solution is mixed with PVA glue (wood glue) a rubbery precipitate is formed, which is the result of cross-linking in the polymer.Food additiveBorax is used as a food additive in some countries with the E number E285, but is banned in the United States. In consequence certain foods, such as caviar, produced for sale there contain higher levels of salt to assist preservation.Other usesComponent of detergentsIngredient in enamel glazesComponent of glass, pottery, and ceramicsFire retardantAnti-fungal compound for fibreglass and cellulose insulationInsecticide to kill ants and fleasPrecursor for sodium perborate monohydrate that is used in detergents, as well as for boric acid and other boratesTreatment for thrush in horses' hoovesUsed to make indelible ink for dip pens by dissolving shellac into heated boraxCuring agent for snake skinsSwimming pool buffering agent to control the pHNatural sourcesBorax occurs naturally in evaporite deposits produced by the repeated evaporation of seasonal lakes (see playa). The most commercially important deposits are found in Turkey and near Boron, California and other locations in the Southwestern United States, the Atacama desert in Chile, and in Tibet. Borax can also be produced synthetically from other boron compounds.ToxicityBorax, sodium tetraborate decahydrate, is not acutely toxic.

Simple exposure can cause respiratory and skin irritation. Ingestion may cause gastrointestinal distress including nausea, persistent vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Effects on the vascular system and brain include headaches and lethargy, but are less frequent. "In severe poisonings, a beefy red skin rash affecting palms, soles, buttocks and scrotum has been described. With severe poisoning, erythematous and exfoliative rash, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and renal failure."

However, it is better formulated as Na2B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·8H2O, since borax contains the B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;2− ion. In this structure, there are two four-coordinate boron atoms (two BO4 tetrahedra) and two three-coordinate boron atoms (two BO3 triangles).Borax is also easily converted to boric acid and other borates, which have many applications. If left exposed to dry air, it slowly loses its water of hydration and becomes the white and chalky mineral tincalconite (Na2B4O7·5H2O).When borax is added to a flame, it produces a bright orange color. This property has been tried in amateur fireworks, but borax in this use is not popular because its waters of hydration inhibit combustion of compositions and make it an inferior source of the sodium which is responsible for most of its flame color, and which overwhelms the green contributed to the flame by boron.However, commercially available borax can be mixed with flammables such as methanol to give the characteristic green flame of boron when ignited, which then slowly gives way to the characteristic yellow-orange flame of the sodium.See alsoBuffer solutionBorax bead testSodium borohydrideUlexiteTwenty-Mule-Team BoraxFrancis Marion SmithJohn VeatchBoric acidReferencesExternal linksInternational Chemical Safety Card 0567International Chemical Safety Card 1229 (fused borax)National Pollutant Inventory - Boron and compoundsNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical HazardsSodium Borate in sefsc.noaa.govCategory:Borate minerals Category:Boron compounds Category:Borates Category:Cleaning product components Category:Cleaning products Category:Food additives Category:Household chemicals Category:Sodium compoundsar:بورق bn:বোরাক্স bs:Boraks ca:Bòrax cs:Tetraboritan sodný de:Borax es:Bórax eo:Borakso fr:Borax gl:Bórax id:Bleng it:Borace lt:Boraksas hu:Bórax nl:Borax ja:ホウ砂 pl:Boraks rodzimy pt:Bórax ro:Borax ru:Бура (минерал) sr:Боракс sv:Borax tr:Boraks vi:Borac uk:Бура zh:硼砂
