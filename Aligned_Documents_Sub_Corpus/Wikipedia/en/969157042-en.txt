The majority of the species are native in Africa, with a few in southern Asia and one in tropical Central America. The segregate genus Pleomele is now generally included in Dracaena. The genus Sanseviera is closely related, and has recently been synonymized under Dracaena in the Kubitzki system.Dracaena have a secondary thickening meristem in their trunk. This monocotyledonous secondary thickening meristem is quite different from the thickening meristem found in dicotyledonous plants and is termed Dracaenoid thickening by some authors. This character is shared with other members of the Agavaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae among other related families.SpeciesThey can be divided into two groups based on their growth habits:A group of tree-size species with stout trunks and stiff, broad-based leaves, growing in arid semi-desert areas, and known as dragon trees.A group of smaller, shrubby species with slender stems and flexible strap-shaped leaves, growing as understorey plants in rainforests (and very popular as houseplants), and known collectively as shrubby dracaenas.Dragon treesDracaena americana - Central America Dragon TreeDracaena arborea - Tree DracaenaDracaena cinnabari - Socotra Dragon TreeDracaena draco - Canary Islands Dragon TreeDracaena ombet - Gabal Elba Dragon TreeShrubby dracaenasDracaena aletriformisDracaena bicolorDracaena cinctaDracaena concinnaDracaena ellipticaDracaena deremensisDracaena fragrans - Striped Dracaena, Compact Dracaena, corn plant, Cornstalk DracaenaSynonym: Dracaena deremensisDracaena goldieanaDracaena hookerianaDracaena manniiDracaena marginata - Red-edged Dracaena or Madagascar Dragon TreeDracaena marmorataDracaena phrynioidesDracaena reflexa - Pleomele Dracaena or "Song of India"Dracaena sanderiana - Ribbon Dracaena, marketed as "Lucky Bamboo"Dracaena surculosa - Spotted Dracaena or Gold Dust DracaenaDracaena thalioidesDracaena umbraculiferaSeveral other species previously included in Dracaena are now treated in the genus Cordyline.UsesA bright red resin, dragon's blood, is produced from D. draco and, in ancient times, from D. cinnabari. Some species such as D. deremnsis, D. fragrans, D. godseffiana, D. marginata, and D. sanderiana are popular as houseplants. Rooted stem cuttings of D. sanderiana are widely marketed in the U.S.A. as "Lucky Bamboo", although only superficially resembling true bamboos.References and external linksWaterhouse, J. T. 1987.
