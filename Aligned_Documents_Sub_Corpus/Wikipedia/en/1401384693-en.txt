After a late start, he was ordained priest, and Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, sent him as an appropriate ambassador to Pope Pius V, a position which he held for fifteen years. Gregory XIII made him bishop of Pistoia in 1573, archbishop of Florence in 1574, and cardinal in 1583.In 1596, Clement VIII sent him as legate to France where Maria de' Medici was queen. Alessandro was a friend and disciple of St. Philip Neri. , by Alessandro Algardi.]] On March 14, 1605, eleven days after the death of Clement VIII, 62 cardinals entered the conclave. Prominent among the candidates for the papacy were the great historian Baronius and the famous Jesuit controversialist Robert Bellarmine. But Aldobrandini, the leader of the Italian party among the cardinals, allied with the French cardinals and brought about the election of Alessandro against the express wish of King Philip III of Spain. King Henry IV of France is said to have spent 300,000 écus in the promotion of Alessandro's candidacy. On April 1, 1605, Alessandro ascended the papal throne with the Medici name Leo XI, being then almost seventy years of age, but was taken ill immediately after his coronation and died within the month.He was nicknamed Papa Lampo ("Lightning Pope") for the brevity of his pontificate.Referencesoriginal text from the 9th edition (1882) of a famous encyclopedia.External links[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09166a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia:] Pope Leo XI        Category:Popes Category:Italian popes Category:Cardinal-bishops of Albano Category:Cardinal-bishops of Palestrina Category:Cardinal-bishops of Porto Category:Cardinal-bishops of Sabina Category:Roman Catholic archbishops of Florence Category:People from Florence Category:1535 births Category:1605 deathsbg:Лъв XI ca:Lleó XI cs:Lev XI. de:Leo XI. et:Leo XI el:Πάπας Λέων ΙΑ΄ es:León XI fr:Léon XI gl:León XI, papa ko:교황 레오 11세 id:Paus Leo XI is:Leó 11. it:Papa Leone XI jv:Paus Leo XI ka:ლეო XI sw:Papa Leo XI la:Leo XI hu:XI.
