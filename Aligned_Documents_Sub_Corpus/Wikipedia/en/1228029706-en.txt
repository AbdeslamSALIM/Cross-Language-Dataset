The earliest instruments similar to the duduk's present form are made of bone or entirely of cane. Today the duduk is exclusively made of wood with a large double reed. Armenian duduks are mainly made from aged apricot wood (Prunus armeniaca, "Armenian plum" in Latin), although other regional varieties use other materials (mulberry, etc.). The particular tuning depends heavily on the region which it is played. In the 20th century the Armenian duduk began to be standardized diatonic in scale and single-octave in range. Accidentals, or chromatics are achieved using fingering techniques. The instrument's body also has different lengths depending upon the range of the instrument and region. The reed (Armenian: ղամիշ, ramish or ghamish), is made from one or two pieces of cane in a duck-bill type assembly. Unlike other double-reed instruments, the reed is quite wide, helping to give the duduk both its unique, mournful sound, as well as its remarkable breath requirements. The duduk player is called dudukahar (դուդուկահար) in Armenian.==History==  The duduk is one of the oldest double reed instruments in the world and dates back over 3,000 years. Variants of the duduk can be found in Armenia and the Caucasus. The roots of Armenian duduk music go back to the times of the Armenian king Tigran the Great (95–55&nbsp;BC). The instrument is depicted in numerous Armenian manuscripts of the Middle Ages.Duduk Music&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Balkan dudukWhile the term duduk mostly refers to a double reed instrument, it sometimes also refers to a kind of blocked-end flute, which in some part of Macedonia is also called kaval or kavalče. Made of maple or other wood, it comes in two sizes: 700–780&nbsp;mm and 240–400&nbsp;mm (duduce). The blocked end is flat. Playing the duduk is fairly straightforward and easy, thus it is widely used throughout Macedonia. Its sound is clean and pleasant.ReferencesSee alsoZurnaShviKavalMusic of ArmeniaMusic of IranGevorg DabaghyanDjivan GasparyanExternal linksDuduk video played by Norair KartashyanFree online library of duduk scores, online FAQ database of pro armenian music instruments and accessoriesFingering chart for Duduks and zurnaArthur Grigoryan duduksDuduk and Duduk Reed instructions Ararat Music OnlineBalkan DudukDuduk practical page - Information and tips on playing and caring for a duduk.Karen Hakobyan - Pro music instruments master, duduk, zurna, bagpipe and much more, listen online demo, man who prepares duduk for Jivan GasparianDeleyamanDuduk community on Yahoo Category:Caucasus music Category:Albanian music Category:Armenian music Category:Azerbaijani music Category:Bulgarian music Category:Georgian music Category:Greek music Category:Persian music Category:Serbian music Category:Turkish musical instruments Category:Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity Category:Middle Eastern culture Category:Single oboes with cylindrical bore Category:Armenian culture Category:Armenian musical instruments Category:Albanian musical instruments Category:Georgian folk instruments Category:Serbian musical instruments Category:Slovenian folk instruments Category:Belarusian musical instruments Category:Bulgarian musical instruments Category:Georgian musical instrumentsaz:Tütəkde:Duduk es:Duduk fa:نرمه‌نای fr:Duduk hr:Duduk it:Duduk ka:დუდუკი nl:Duduk pl:Duduk ru:Дудук simple:Duduk zh:Duduk
