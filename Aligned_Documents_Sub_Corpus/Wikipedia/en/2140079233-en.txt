Founded on March 18, 1932, it will play the 2008/09 season in the Segunda División. They play in white with blue shorts. The home stadium is the La Romareda that seats 34,596 spectators.HistoryReal Zaragoza was originally formed out of two rival teams, Iberia SC and Real Zaragoza CD. By the 1930s, the team was making headway in La Liga, but the Civil War put a brake on a lot of the progress made.On September 8, 1957 the team left their original stadium (the Torrero) for the La Romareda. It was not until the 1960s that Zaragoza would see their first successes, in the Copa del Rey and in the Fairs Cup. The Real Zaragoza side of this era contained los Magnificos (the Greats), an attacking line of Canario, Santos, Marcelino, Villa and Lapetra. Other notable players included Reija and Violeta in defence. Fans of the side had to wait until the 1980s to experience another victory in the cup competition.Real Zaragoza have played the majority of their history, a total of 45 seasons, in the Primera División. Being more of a specialist cup side, they have not managed to win the league, although they have come second on one occasion. In the 2001-02 season they were relegated from the Primera for the first time in 25 years; however, they earned promotion back to the Primera the following season.In late May 2006, Agapito Iglesias bought Alfonso Solans' shares and took the control of Real Zaragoza. Agapito promised to build one of the strongest team in Spain and Europe. In his first year owning Real Zaragoza, Agapito bought Pablo Aimar for 11 million euros to reinforce the midfield. In a poll in 2007, Zaragoza fans voted Aimar the teams greatest ever player.Thanks to Diego Milito's 23 goals in 2006/07 (he finished third to AS Roma's Francesco Totti and Real Madrid CF's Ruud Van Nistelrooy, 26 and 25 goals, respectively, for the European Golden Shoe), Real Zaragoza managed a very respectable 6th place finish, qualifying for Europe. However, despite having nearly the same squad as they had during the previous campaign, the 2007/08 season would finish with this Zaragoza team becoming one of the most disappointing and underachieving teams in La Liga history. They crashed out in the first round of the UEFA Cup. By the turn of the year, they found themselves slipping further and further down the table. Gaffer Víctor Fernández was sacked, and 3 different managers, culminating with former Zaragoza standout Manolo Villanova, were brought in from January to May in a desperate attempt to change Zaragoza's fortunes. Largely due to having managed only a dismal 8 points from 18 away fixtures (despite having managed 34 from all their games at La Romareda), they went into their final fixture of the season needing a win to guarantee their Primera División survival. Kickoff was delayed for over an hour due to a torrential downpour, but not even the rain could keep Zaragoza from relegation as they fell to Real Mallorca 3-2, despite 2 goals from Ricardo Oliveira and at 1-1 looking like they might stay up.HonoursWinnersInter-Cities Fairs Cup: 11965UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 11995Copa del Rey: 61965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001, 2004Spanish Supercup: 12004Segunda División: 11978Runners-upInter-Cities Fairs Cup: 11966La Liga: 11974-75Copa del Rey: 61963, 1965, 1976, 1993, 2006Spanish Supercup: 21994, 2001Segunda División: 61929, 1936, 1942, 1951, 1956, 2003Current squad''The numbers are established according to the official website: www.realzaragoza.com and www.lfp.esAs of August 21 2008                          Out  to Tottenham Hotspur  to AEK Athens  to Olympiacos  to Benfica Lisbon  to Genoa CFC  to Real Betis  to Racing Santander  to SD Huesca Statistics 2008/09Top Scorers:Diego Milito - 1 goalsTop GoalkeepersLópez Vallejo - 2 goals in 1 MatchesRecent History1971/1977-1988/1992]]see also Notable coaches César, 1960-63, 1968-69 Fernando Daucik Domènec Balmanya, 1953-54, 1970-71 Antoni Ramallets, 1963-64 Jenő Kálmár: 1970 Luis Costa Víctor Fernández Víctor MuñozChronology of coaches&nbsp;see also See alsoReal Zaragoza B, Real Zaragoza's reserve team, formerly called Deportivo Aragón.External links Real Zaragoza Official WebsiteReal Zaragoza Unofficial WebsiteReal Zaragoza formations at football-lineups     Zaragoza Zaragoza Category:Real Zaragoza Zaragoza Category:Copa del Rey winners Category:Organisations based in Spain with royal patronagear:ريال سرقسطة an:Real Zaragoza bg:Реал Сарагоса ca:Real Zaragoza da:Real Zaragoza de:Real Saragossa el:Ρεάλ Σαραγόσα es:Real Zaragoza eu:Real Zaragoza fr:Real Saragosse gl:Real Zaragoza ko:레알 사라고사 id:Real Zaragoza it:Real Saragozza he:ריאל סרגוסה lv:Saragosas &quot;Real&quot; lt:Real Zaragoza SAD mr:रेआल झारागोझा nl:Real Zaragoza ja:レアル・サラゴサ no:Real Zaragoza oc:Real Zaragoza pl:Real Saragossa pt:Real Zaragoza ru:Реал Сарагоса simple:Real Zaragoza fi:Real Zaragoza sv:Real Zaragoza vi:Real Zaragoza tr:Real Zaragoza zh:皇家薩拉戈薩
