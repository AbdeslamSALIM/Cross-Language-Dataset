Muhu (in German Moon or Mohn; in Estonian also called Muhumaa), is an island in the Baltic Sea. With an area of 198 km² it is the third largest island belonging to Estonia, after Saaremaa and Hiiumaa.Together with neighbouring smaller islands of Kesselaid, Viirelaid, Võilaid and Suurlaid it forms Muhu Parish (), the rural municipality within Saare County. The municipality has a population of 1,822 (as of 1 January 2004) and covers an area of 206.12 km². The population density is 8.8 inhabitants per km².Most important villages in Muhu are Kuivastu, Liiva (where the school can be found) and Koguva.The island is divided from mainland Estonia by the Suur Väin Straits (Moonsund) and from Saaremaa by Väike Väin Straits. It is linked by ferry to Virtsu on the mainland, and to Saaremaa by a causeway, the Väinatamm. In winter an ice road connects the island to the mainland.In January 1227, an army of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword (20,000 men commanded by William of Modena) crossed on sea ice from the mainland and attacked the island of Saaremaa to reduce the last holdout of pagan Estonians. The Estonians surrendered on Muhu at a circular stronghold, the earthworks of which are still preserved near the causeway between the islands. This ended the Estonian Crusade.Muhu is also famous for having the only still-working windmills in the whole country of Estonia, and for the Battle of Moon Sound in September-October 1917 between Russian and German naval forces (and three daring British submarines).See alsoMunicipalities of EstoniaList of municipalities of Estonia Image:NorthMuhuCoast.JPG|Northern coast of Muhu, Estonia.
