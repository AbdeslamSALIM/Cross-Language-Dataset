 | constell=[[Ursa Minor]]  Beta Ursae Minoris (β UMi / β Ursae Minoris) is the second brightest star in the bowl of the "Little Dipper," the constellation Ursa Minor. It also has the traditional name Kochab. Kochab's magnitude is 2.07. It is 16 degrees from Polaris. The star is an orange giant and is 126.4 ± 2.5 light years from Earth. It is 130 times more luminous than the Sun. Kochab has a surface temperature of approximately 4,000 K.Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad are both naked eye stars. They served as twin pole stars, Earth's North pole stars, from 1500 B.C. until 500 A.D. Neither star was as proximitous to the pole as Polaris is now. Due to precession of the equinoxes, the previous holder of the title was Thuban, and the next was the present-day Polaris. This succession of pole stars is a result of earth's precessional motion.The origin of the name Kochab is indistinct. It has sometimes been associated with a Hebrew word for star. The name "Kochab" may originate from Arabic الكوكب al-kawkab and means simply "the star".ReferencesBeyer Steven L., The Star Guide, Little, Brown and Company, 1986.Mythology: Bx Times Reporter, New York http://www.webspawner.com/users/cosmic/    Ursae Minoris, Beta Category:K-type giants Category:Ursa Minor constellation Category:Northern pole stars Category:Stars with proper namesbe:Кохаб be-x-old:Кохаб cs:Kochab de:Kochab es:Kochab fr:Beta Ursae Minoris ko:코카브 it:Kochab lb:Kochab (Stär) nl:Kocab ja:コカブ pl:Kochab ru:Кохаб sk:Kochab fi:Beta Ursae Minoris sv:Kochab zh:北極二
