Sensors monitor wheel speeds, and if one is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers all the power to the other wheel. The price in Germany is 8.950,00 €.

It was a USDM version of the Gol range, produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Brazil. It was a design unique to South America, although it bore a family resemblance to the Volkswagen Jetta. After 1990 the Wagon was discontinued from the North American market; it was the last two-door wagon offered in the US. However, the Fox sedan and coupe lasted until 1993 in the US. Early models (1987-1989) feature Bosch Jetronic electro-mechanical fuel injection known as CIS-E. The CIS-E system used an Oxygen sensor to assist in fuel management to meet emissions requirements. VW offered a standard 2 and 4 door sedan with a 4 speed transmission and a "GL" sport model with a 5 speed transmission. In Canada the Fox from 1987-1989 was offered with the simpler Bosch CIS fuel injection system. The CIS injection system did not utilize an Oxygen sensor as part of an engine fuel management system. The Fox sported a longitudinal mounted 1.8L, 81 hp (DIN)engine, sharing components with the VW Golf of the era. VW never offered the Fox of this generation with an automatic transmission in the North American market. The Fox had a squared off front end with rectangular sealed beam halogen headlamps, while the final U.S. version (1990-1993) had Bosch Digifant electronic fuel injection and a more modern styled front end with glass headlamps.In South Africa, the Volkswagen Fox was a model based on the original Jetta, but featuring the front end of the Citi, a facelifted version of the original Golf Mk 1, which is still in production in South Africa.In the United States and Australia the Audi 80 was badged as the Audi Fox during the 1970s. The Australian version was assembled locally by Volkswagen Australasia Ltd.ReferencesExternal linksVW UK's Fox websiteAdam's Volkswagen Fox Homepage   Fox Category:Subcompact cars Category:Cars of Brazil Category:2000s automobiles Category:Vehicles introduced in 2004da:VW Fox de:VW Fox es:Volkswagen Fox fr:Volkswagen Fox hr:Volkswagen Fox it:Volkswagen Fox lv:Volkswagen Fox nl:Volkswagen Fox ja:フォルクスワーゲン・フォックス pl:Volkswagen Fox pt:Volkswagen Fox simple:Volkswagen Fox fi:Volkswagen Fox sv:Volkswagen Fox
