 A joint venture (often abbreviated JV) is an entity formed between two or more parties to undertake economic activity together. The parties agree to create a new entity by both contributing equity, and they then share in the revenues, expenses, and control of the enterprise. The venture can be for one specific project only, or a continuing business relationship such as the Sony Ericsson joint venture. This is in contrast to a strategic alliance, which involves no equity stake by the participants, and is a much less rigid arrangement.The phrase generally refers to the purpose of the entity and not to a type of entity. Therefore, a joint venture may be a corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal structure, depending on a number of considerations such as tax and tort liability.When are joint ventures used?Joint ventures are common in the oil and gas industry, and are often cooperations between a local and foreign company (about 3/4 are international). A joint venture is often seen as a very viable business alternative in this sector, as the companies can complement their skill sets while it offers the foreign company a geographic presence. Studies show a failure rate of 30-61%, and that 60% failed to start or faded away within 5 years. (Osborn, 2003) It is also known that joint ventures in low-developed countries show a greater instability, and that JVs involving government partners have higher incidence of failure (private firms seem to be better equipped to supply key skills, marketing networks etc.) Furthermore, JVs have shown to fail miserably under highly volatile demand and rapid changes in product technology.Some countries, such as the People's Republic of China and to some extent India, require foreign companies to form joint ventures with domestic firms in order to enter a market. This requirement often forces technology transfers and managerial control to the domestic partner.Another form joint ventures may take are the Joint Ventures (JV's) in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico dedicated to the conservation of priority bird species and their associated habitats. Each of these JV's is different in how they go about their respective missions, but all try to follow the principles of Strategic Habitat Conservation (SHC). SHC combines biological planning, conservation design, conservation delivery, and evaluation and monitoring. Gulf Coast Joint Venture, Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture, and Prairie Pothole Joint Venture are just three of the 20+ JV's found in North America.BrokersIn addition, joint ventures are practiced by a joint venture broker, who are people that often put together the two parties that participate in a joint venture. A joint venture broker then often make a percentage of the profit that is made from the deal between the two parties.Reasons for forming a joint ventureInternal reasonsBuild on company's strengthsSpreading costs and risksImproving access to financial resourcesEconomies of scale and advantages of sizeAccess to new technologies and customersAccess to innovative managerial practicesCompetitive goalsInfluencing structural evolution of the industryPre-empting competitionDefensive response to blurring industry boundariesCreation of stronger competitive unitsSpeed to marketImproved agilityStrategic goalsSynergiesTransfer of technology/skillsDiversificationExamplesThe most famous JV today which is also a success story is Mittal- Arcelor another is TATA- Corus.INTO University Partnerships specialises in creating JVs with British universitiesAutoAlliance International between Ford Motor Company and MazdaBrewers Retail Inc. between Inbev, Molson Coors and Sapporo BreweriesBank DnB NORD between DnB NOR and NORD/LB.Equilon between Texaco and Royal Dutch ShellStrategic Alliance between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch AirlinesLG.Philips Components between LG Group and Royal Philips ElectronicsNUMMI between General Motors and ToyotaPenske Truck Leasing between GE and the Penske CorporationSony Ericsson between Sony and EricssonTNK-BP between BP and TNK (Tyumen Oil Co.)Verizon Wireless between Verizon Communications and VodafoneCW Television Network between CBS Corporation and Time WarnerThe Baseball Network between ABC, NBC, and Major League BaseballThe Prime Time Entertainment Network from the Prime Time Consortium, a joint venture between Warner Bros.
