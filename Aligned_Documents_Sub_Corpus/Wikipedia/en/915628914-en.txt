 Larks are passerine birds of the family Alaudidae. All species occur in the Old World, including northern and eastern Australia; only one, the Shore Lark, has spread to North America, where it is called the Horned Lark. Habitats vary widely, but many species live in dry regions.DescriptionLarks are small to medium-sized birds, 12 to 24 cm (5 to 8 inches) in length and 15 to 75 grams (0.5 to 2.6 ounces) in weight (Kikkawa 2003).They have more elaborate calls than most birds, and often extravagant songs given in display flight (Kikkawa 2003). These melodious sounds (to human ears), combined with a willingness to expand into anthropogenic habitats &mdash; as long as these are not too intensively managed &mdash; have ensured larks a prominent place in literature and music, especially the Skylark in northern Europe and the Crested Lark and Calandra Lark in southern Europe.With these song flights, males defend their breeding territories and attract mates. Most species build nests on the ground, usually cups of dead grass, but in some species more complicated and partly domed. A few desert species nest very low in bushes, perhaps so circulating air can cool the nest. Larks' eggs are usually speckled, and clutch sizes range from 2 (especially in species of the driest deserts) to 6 (in species of temperate regions). Larks incubate for 11 to 16 days (Kikkawa 2003).Like many ground birds, most lark species have long hind claws, which are thought to provide stability while standing. Most have streaked brown plumage, some boldly marked with black or white. Their dull appearance camouflages them on the ground, especially when on the nest. They feed on insects and seeds; though adults of most species eat seeds primarily, all species feed their young insects for at least the first week after hatching. Many species dig with their bills to uncover food. Some larks have heavy bills (reaching an extreme in the Thick-billed Lark) for cracking seeds open, while others have long, down-curved bills, which are especially suitable for digging (Kikkawa 2003).Larks are the only passerines that lose all their feathers in their first moult (in all species whose first moult is known). This may result from the poor quality of the chicks' feathers, which in turn may result from the benefits to the parents of switching the young to a lower-quality diet (seeds), which requires less work from the parents (Kikkawa 2003).In many respects, including long tertial feathers, larks resemble other ground birds such as pipits. However, in larks the tarsus (the lowest leg bone, connected to the toes) has only one set of scales on the rear surface, which is rounded. Pipits and all other songbirds have two plates of scales on the rear surface, which meet at a protruding rear edge (Ridgway 1907).RelationshipsLarks are a well-defined family, partly because of the shape of the tarsus (Ridgway 1907). They were long placed at or near the beginning of the songbirds or oscines (now often called Passeri), just after the suboscines and before the swallows, for example in the American Ornithologists' Union's first check-list (American Ornithologists' Union 1886, according to Patterson 2002). Some authorities, such as the British Ornithologists' Union (Dudley et al. 2006) and the Handbook of the Birds of the World, adhere to that placement. However, many other classifications follow the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy in placing the larks in a large oscine subgroup Passerida (which excludes crows, shrikes and their allies, vireos, and many groups characteristic of Australia and southeastern Asia). For instance, the American Ornithologists' Union places larks just after the crows, shrikes, and vireos. At a finer level of detail, some now place the larks at the beginning of a superfamily Sylvioidea with the swallows, various "Old World warbler" and "babbler" groups, and others (Barker et al. 2002, Alström et al. 2006).==Species in taxonomic order== FAMILY: ALAUDIDAEGenus: ''Mirafra''Monotonous Lark, Mirafra passerinaSinging Bushlark, Mirafra cantillansAustralasian Bushlark, Mirafra javanicaLatakoo Lark, Mirafra chenianaWhite-tailed Lark, Mirafra albicaudaMadagascar Lark, Mirafra hovaKordofan Lark, Mirafra williamsiFriedmann's Lark, Mirafra pulpaRed-winged Lark, Mirafra hypermetraSomali Long-billed Lark, Mirafra somalicaAsh's Lark, Mirafra ashiAngola Lark, Mirafra angolensisRufous-naped Lark, Mirafra africanaFlappet Lark, Mirafra rufocinnamomeaClapper Lark, Mirafra apiataCollared Lark, Mirafra collarisIndian Bushlark or Red-winged Bushlark, Mirafra erythropteraGillett's Lark, Mirafra gillettiFawn-colored Lark, Mirafra africanoides (sometimes placed in Calendulauda)Rufous-winged Bushlark, Mirafra assamicaJerdon's Bushlark Mirafra affinisRusty Lark, Mirafra rufaPink-breasted Lark, Mirafra poecilosterna (sometimes placed in Calendulauda)Degodi Lark, Mirafra degodiensisSabota Lark, Mirafra sabota(sometimes placed in Calendulauda)Genus: ''Pinarocorys''Rufous-rumped Lark, Pinarocorys erythropygiaDusky Lark, Pinarocorys nigricansGenus: ''Heteromirafra''Archer's Lark, Heteromirafra archeriSidamo Lark, Heteromirafra sidamoensisRudd's Lark, Heteromirafra ruddiGenus: ''Certhilauda''Cape Lark, Certhilauda curvirostrisAlgulhas Long-billed Lark, Certhilauda brevirostrisEastern Long-billed Lark, Certhilauda semitorquataKaroo Long-billed Lark, Certhilauda subcoronataBenguela Lark, Certhilauda benguelensisShort-clawed Lark, Certhilauda chuanaDune Lark, Certhilauda erythrochlamysKaroo Lark, Certhilauda albescensBarlow's Lark, Certhilauda barlowiFerruginous Lark, Certhilauda burraGenus: ''Chersomanes''Spike-heeled Lark, Chersomanes albofasciataGenus: ''Eremopterix''Black-eared Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix australisChestnut-backed Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix leucotisBlack-crowned Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix nigricepsGrey-backed Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix verticalisChestnut-headed Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix signataFischer's Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix leucopareiaAshy-crowned Sparrow-lark, Eremopterix griseaGenus: ''Ammomanes''Bar-tailed Lark, Ammomanes cincturusRufous-tailed Lark, Ammomanes phoenicurusDesert Lark, Ammomanes desertiGray's Lark, Ammomanes grayiGenus: ''Alaemon''Greater Hoopoe-lark, Alaemon alaudipesLesser Hoopoe-lark, Alaemon hamertoniGenus: ''Ramphocoris''Thick-billed Lark, Ramphocoris clotbeyGenus: ''Melanocorypha''Calandra Lark, Melanocorypha calandraBimaculated Lark, Melanocorypha bimaculataTibetan Lark, Melanocorypha maximaMongolian Lark, Melanocorypha mongolicaWhite-winged Lark, Melanocorypha leucopteraBlack Lark, Melanocorypha yeltoniensisGenus: ''Calandrella''Greater Short-toed Lark, Calandrella brachydactylaBlanford's Lark, Calandrella blanfordiHume's Lark, Calandrella acutirostrisLesser Short-toed Lark, Calandrella rufescensRed-capped Lark, Calandrella cinereaAsian Short-toed Lark, Calandrella cheleensisSand Lark, Calandrella raytalSomali Short-toed Lark, Calandrella somalicaGenus: ''Spizocorys''Pink-billed Lark, Spizocorys conirostrisBotha's Lark, Spizocorys fringillarisSclater's Lark, Spizocorys sclateriObbia Lark, Spizocorys obbiensisMasked Lark, Spizocorys personataGenus: ''Eremalauda''Dunn's Lark, Eremalauda dunniStark's Lark, Eremalauda starkiGenus: ''Chersophilus''Dupont's Lark, Chersophilus dupontiGenus: ''Galerida''Crested Lark, Galerida cristataThekla Lark, Galerida theklaeMalabar Lark, Galerida malabaricaSun Lark, Galerida modestaSykes's Lark, Tawny Lark or Sykes' Crested Lark, Galerida devaLarge-billed Lark, Galerida magnirostrisGenus: ''Pseudalaemon''Short-tailed Lark, Pseudalaemon fremantliiGenus: ''Lullula''Wood Lark, Lullula arboreaGenus: ''Alauda''Skylark, Alauda arvensisJapanese Skylark, Alauda japonicaOriental Skylark, Alauda gulgulaRaso Skylark, Alauda razaeGenus: ''Eremophila''Shore Lark or Horned Lark, Eremophila alpestrisTemminck's Lark, Eremophila bilopha== See also ==Lark BuntingLark SparrowMagpie-lark (Neither a lark nor a magpie, but a giant Monarch flycatcher)MeadowlarkTitlark, a synonym for Meadow PipitSonglarkReferencesExternal links Lark videos on the Internet Bird Collection* Category:Bird familiesar:قبرة bg:Чучулигови ca:Alaudidae de:Lerchen es:Alaudidae eo:Alaŭdedoj fr:Alaudidae io:Alaudo it:Alaudidae lt:Vieversiniai hu:Pacsirtafélék mr:चंडोल nl:Leeuweriken ja:ヒバリ科 (Sibley) no:Lerkefamilien nn:Lerkefamilien pl:Skowronki pt:Cotovia ru:Жаворонковые scn:Alaudidae fi:Kiurut sv:Lärkor tr:Toygargiller zh:百灵科
