Shi Jing (), translated variously as the Classic of Poetry, the Book of Songs or the Book of Odes, is the earliest existing collection of Chinese poems. It comprises 305 poems, some possibly written as early as 1000 BC. It forms part of the Five Classics.The collectionThe collection is divided into three parts according to their genre, namely feng, ya and song, with the ya genre further divided into "small" and "large":Chinese character(s)PinyinNumber and Meaning風 (风)fēng160 folk songs (or airs)小雅xiǎoyǎ74 minor festal songs (or odes traditionally sung at court festivities)大雅dàyǎ31 major festal songs, sung at more solemn court ceremonies頌 (颂)sòngeulogies]] , sung at sacrifices to gods and ancestral spirits of the royal houseThe Confucian tradition holds that the collection, one of the Wu Jing, or Five Classics, came to what we have today after the editing of Confucius. The collection was officially acknowledged as one of "Five Classics" during the Han Dynasty, and previously in Zhou Dynasty Shi (詩) was one of "Six Classics". Four schools of commentary existed then, namely the Qi (齊), the Lu (魯), the Han (韓), and the Mao (毛) schools. The first two schools did not survive. The Han school only survived partly. The Mao school became the canonical school of Shi Jing commentary after the Han Dynasty. As a result, the collection is also sometimes referred to as "Mao Shi" (毛詩). Zheng Xuan's elucidation on the Mao commentary is also canonical. The 305 poems had to be reconstructed from memory by scholars since the previous Qin Dynasty had burned the collection along with other classical texts. (There are, in fact, a total of 308 poem titles that were reconstructed, but the remaining three poems only have titles without any extant text). The earliest surviving edition of Shi Jing is a fragmentary one of the Han Dynasty, written on bamboo strips, unearthed at Fuyang.The poems are written in four-character lines. The airs are in the style of folk songs, although the extent to which they are real folk songs or literary imitations is debated. The odes deal with matters of court and historical subjects, while the hymns blend history, myth and religious material.The three major literary figures or styles employed in the poems are fu, bi and xing:Chinese characterPinyinMeaning賦 (赋)fùstraightforward narrative比bǐexplicit comparisons興 (兴)xìngimplied comparisonsContentsSummary of groupings of Shi Jing poems Guo Feng  Guo Feng () &quot;Airs of the States&quot; poems 001-160; 160 total folk songs (or airs) &lt;/caption&gt; group  char  group name  poem #s   01  周南  Odes of Zhou & South  001-011   02  召南  Odes of Shao & South  012-025   03  邶風  Odes of Bei  026-044   04  鄘風  Odes of Yong  045-054   05  衛風  Odes of Wei  055-064   06  王風  Odes of Wang  065-074   07  鄭風  Odes of Zheng  075-095   08  齊風  Odes of Qi  096-106   09  魏風  Odes of Wei  107-113   10  唐風  Odes of Tang  114-125   11  秦風  Odes of Qin  126-135   12  陳風  Odes of Chen  136-145   13  檜風  Odes of Kuai  146-149   14  曹風  Odes of Cao  150-153   15  豳風  Odes of Bin  154-160  Xiao Ya  Xiao Ya ()  "Minor Odes of the Kingdom" poems 161-234; 74 total minor festal songs (or odes) for court  group  char  group name  poem #s   01  鹿鳴 之什  Decade of Lu Ming  161-170   02  白華 之什  Decade of Baihua  170-175   03  彤弓 之什  Decade of Tong Gong  175-185   04  祈父 之什  Decade of Qi Fu  185-195   05  小旻 之什  Decade of Xiao Min  195-205   06  北山 之什  Decade of Bei Shan  205-215   07  桑扈 之什  Decade of Sang Hu  215-225   08  都人士 之什  Decade of Du Ren Shi  225-234  Da Ya  Da Ya ()  "Major Odes of the Kingdom" poems 235-265;  31 total major festal songs () for solemn court ceremonies  group  char  group name  poem #s   01  文王之什  Decade of Wen Wang  235-244   02  生民之什  Decade of Sheng Min  245-254   03  蕩之什  Decade of Dang  255-265  Song Song ()  "Odes of the Temple & Altar" poems 266-305;  40 total praises, hymns, or eulogies sung at spirit sacrifices  group  char  group name  poem #s   01  周頌  Sacrificial Odes of Zhou1  266-296   01a  -清廟之什  Decade of Qing Miao  266-275   01b  -臣工之什  Decade of Chen Gong  276-285   01c  -閔予小子之什  Decade of Min You Xiao Zi  286-296   02  魯頌  Praise Odes of Lu3  297-300   03  商頌  Sacrificial Odes of Shang1  301-305  note: alternative divisions may be topical or chronological (Legges): Song, DaYa, XiaoYa, GuoFeng TranslationsThe Book of Odes, in The Sacred Books of China, translated by James Legge, 1879.The Book of Songs, translated by Arthur Waley, edited with additional translations by Joseph R.
