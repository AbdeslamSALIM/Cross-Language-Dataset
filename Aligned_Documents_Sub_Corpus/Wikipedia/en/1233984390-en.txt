Introduced at the 2006 Geneva Motor Show, the S-Max went on sale alongside the redesigned Galaxy in June 2006. It is intended as a "sporty" alternative to the traditional MPV, and slots between the seven-seater large MPV Galaxy and compact MPV Ford C-Max. The S-Max was voted European Car of the Year 2007 on 13 November 2006 and in the future it will be sold in Japan as a Mazda.FeaturesThe 7-seater S-Max is the first vehicle to feature Ford's Kinetic Design styling. On S-Max, Kinetic Design includes angular headlights, twin trapezoidal grilles, and large wheelarches.One major selling point of the S-Max is its "FoldFlatSystem". This design allows the second and third-row seats to fold flat into the floor.There are three derivatives of the S-Max; Edge, Zetec, and the high-end Titanium. Ford have stated that around fifty per cent of all S-Max buyers choose Titanium specification. In February 2008, Ford announced that the S-Max will be made available with a new Titanium S series trim. This model aims to add an even more 'sporty character' than the current Titanium series.In March 2008, a powerful 2.2 175PS TDCi common-rail diesel will be added to Titanium series and will deliver accleration from 0-60 mph in 9.0 seconds.Engines2.5&nbsp;L Duratec turbo I5, 220&nbsp;PS (217&nbsp;hp/162&nbsp;kW) (shared with the Ford Focus ST and Volvo C30/S40)2.3&nbsp;L Duratec I4, 160&nbsp;PS (158&nbsp;hp/118&nbsp;kW)2.0&nbsp;L Duratec I4, 145&nbsp;PS (143&nbsp;hp/107&nbsp;kW)1.8&nbsp;L Duratorq TDCi I4, 125&nbsp;PS (123&nbsp;hp/92&nbsp;kW)2.0&nbsp;L Duratorq ZSD TDCi I4, 130&nbsp;PS (128&nbsp;hp/96&nbsp;kW)2.0&nbsp;L Duratorq ZSD TDCi I4, 140&nbsp;PS (138&nbsp;hp/103&nbsp;kW)2.2&nbsp;L TDCi I4, 175&nbsp;PS (173&nbsp;hp)External linkshttp://www.unece.org/trans/doc/2000/wp29grsg/TRANS-WP29-GRSG-2000-19r1e.doc European Regulation for A-pillar and windshield designFord S-Max official website (Flash)Ford S-Max &amp; Galaxy Club - Russian Club of S-Max & Galaxy II OwnersFord S-Max Owners Club - UK Based Owners Club for S-Max and GalaxyFord S-Max/Galaxy Club - German Club for S-Max and Galaxy UsersClube Ford S-Max de Portugal Portuguese Club for Ford S-Max OwnersClub Ford S-Max France - Belgique - Luxembourg French - Belgium - Luxembourg Club for Ford S-Max Owners  S-Max Category:Minivans Category:Front wheel drive vehicles Category:2000s automobiles Category:Vehicles introduced in 2006cs:Ford S-MAX de:Ford S-MAX es:Ford S-Max fr:Ford S-Max it:Ford S-MAX lv:Ford S-Max nl:Ford S-MAX pl:Ford S-MAX pt:Ford S-MAX ro:Ford S-Max ru:Ford S-Max fi:Ford S-Max sv:Ford S-Max
