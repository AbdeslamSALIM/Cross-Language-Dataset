It features music compiled and remixed for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name. The album was produced by George Martin, who worked as the producer of almost all of The Beatles' records and even played piano on some Beatle tracks, and his son Giles Martin, who said, "What people will be hearing on the album is a new experience, a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period."&lt;/ref&gt;Release historyGeorge Martin and his son Giles began work on Love after getting permission from Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Yoko Ono, and Olivia Harrison (the latter two representing John Lennon and George Harrison, respectively). In discussing the project, Giles Martin noted that elements were utilized from recordings in The Beatles catalogue, "the original four tracks, eight tracks and two tracks and used this palette of sounds and music to create a soundbed." George Martin also promised a prize to those who could crack a "code" found in the album.Beatles producers says &quot;Love&quot; soundtrack includes secret code theclockradio.com. Retrieved on June 15, 2007.Giles Martin said in an interview that he was afraid they wouldn't get the green light to do the project, so he started by making digital back-ups of the original multi-track recordings just to get started on the project. He also said that he and his father mixed more music than was eventually released, including "She's Leaving Home" and a version of "Girl" that he was particularly fond of.Norwegian Wood - The Beatles Fan ClubPaul McCartney and Ringo Starr, the two surviving members of The Beatles, have responded very positively to the album. McCartney noted that "This album puts The Beatles back together again, because suddenly there's John and George with me and Ringo". Starr commended George and Giles Martin for the album and said that the album is "really powerful for me and I even heard things I'd forgotten we'd recorded."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NME.com_2"&lt;/ref&gt;The album was first played publicly on Virgin Radio's The Geoff Show. Virgin Radio DJ Geoff Lloyd, a self-proclaimed fan of The Beatles, chose to play the entire album uninterrupted to allow younger fans to experience an album premiere.&lt;/ref&gt;Love placed at #3 in the UK Albums Chart during its first week of release, trailing Westlife's The Love Album and Oasis' Stop the Clocks compilation.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also successful in the United States, debuting at #4 in the Billboard 200, where it was certified Platinum in late 2006.Love debuted at #1 in the United World Chart selling 721,000 copies in its first week and knocked off the top spot six new big releases that occupied other positions of the Top 10. With a leap of 26,000 copies, Jay-Z's Kingdom Come debuted at #2 and with 300,000 copies less than Love, U2's U218 Singles placed at #3. The following week, the album continued occupying the top spot, this time with a respectable 436,000 copies sold. Despite a sales increase of 467,000 copies in its third week, Love slipped down to #2 knocked by Il Divo's Siempre, which only sold 5,000 more. However, the following week Love returned to #1 and the same time reached Platinum certification in the United World Chart for 2 million copies sold.Sales increased again during the next week due to the Christmas period and spent a total of six weeks at the top. It was finally displaced by U2 in late January 2007. After that, Love fell quickly in the chart and only achieved 15 weeks inside the Top 40. With only four weeks out in stores during 2006, Love became the fifteenth best-selling album of the year worldwide with 2,849,000 copies sold. During the following six months the album continued to sell steadily, at an average rate of 25,000 copies sold worldwide per week. It did so particularly in the United States, where it is still in the charts after 60 weeks.At the 50th annual Grammy awards on February 10th, 2008, the album won Grammys in two categories - Best Compilation Soundtrack Album and Best Surround Sound Album.Release detailsThe album was released in three versions — a standard CD version, a two-disc CD and DVD-Audio package and a two-disc vinyl package.
