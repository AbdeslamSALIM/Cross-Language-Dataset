He assumed office on 16 May 2007 after defeating the Socialist Party contender Ségolène Royal ten days earlier.Before his presidency, he was leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) centre-right party. Under Jacques Chirac's presidency, he served as Minister of the Interior in Jean-Pierre Raffarin's (UMP) first two governments (from May 2002 to March 2004), then was appointed Minister of Finances in Raffarin's last government (March 2004 to May 2005), and again Minister of the Interior in Dominique de Villepin's government (2005-2007).Sarkozy was also president of the General council of the Hauts-de-Seine department from 2004 to 2007 and mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, one of the wealthiest communes of France from 1983 to 2002.

His nickname "Sarko" is used by both supporters and opponents.Personal lifeFamily backgroundNicolas Sarkozy is the son of a Hungarian immigrant father, Pál Sárközy de Nagy-BócsaPál Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa is not his French name. It is the "westernised", or "internationalised", version of his Hungarian name, in which the given name is put first (whereas in Hungarian given names come last), and the French aristocratic particle "de" is used instead of the Hungarian aristocratic ending "-i". This "westernisation" of Hungarian names is frequent, particularly for people with an aristocratic name. Check for example the leader of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, whose Hungarian name is nagybányai Horthy Miklós, but who is known in English as Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya. The French name of Pál Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa is Paul Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa, where the given name Pál has been translated into Paul in French, and the acute accents on the "a" of Sarközy and the "o" of Bocsa were dropped as these letters never carry an acute accent (accent aigu) in French. The trema on the "o" of Sárközy was kept, probably because French typewriters allow this combination, whereas it is impossible to write "a" or "o" with an acute accent using a French typewriter. (Hungarian: Nagybócsai Sárközy Pál; some sources spell it Nagy-Bócsay Sárközy Pál;  ) and a mother of French Catholic and Greek JewishBBC News Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy descent, Andrée Mallah. His Greek-born grandfather, Benico Mallah (former Aaron Mallah), was a physician from Thessaloniki. Benico, who left for France to become a doctor, was the son of Mordechai Mallah, one of the eight sons of Aaron Mallah, founder of the Rabbinical School of Thessaloniki.Sarkozy's Jewish roots Australian JewishNews 8 May 2007Pál Sárközy was born in 1928 in Budapest into a family belonging to the lower nobility of Hungary. The family possessed lands and a small castle in the village of Alattyán, near Szolnok, 92 km (57 miles) east of Budapest. Pál Sárközy's father and grandfather held elective offices in the town of Szolnok. Although the Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa (nagybócsai Sárközy) family was Protestant, Pál Sárközy's mother, Katalin Tóth de Csáford (Hungarian: csáfordi Tóth Katalin), grandmother of Nicolas Sarkozy, was from a Catholic aristocratic family.As the Red Army entered Hungary in 1944, the Sárközy family fled to Germany.Weekly Standard, France girds for the Sarko-Ségo showdown They returned in 1945 but all their possessions had been seized. Pál Sárközy's father died soon afterwards and his mother, fearing that he would be drafted into the Hungarian People's Army or sent to Siberia, urged him to leave the country and promised she would eventually follow him and meet him in Paris. Pál Sárközy managed to flee to Austria and then Germany while his mother reported to authorities that he had drowned in Lake Balaton. Eventually, he arrived in Baden Baden, near the French border, where the headquarters of the French Army in Germany were located, and there he met a recruiter for the French Foreign Legion. He signed up for five years, and was sent for training to Sidi Bel Abbes, in French Algeria, where the French Foreign Legion's headquarters were located. He was due to be sent to Indochina at the end of training, but the doctor who checked him before departure, who happened to also be Hungarian, sympathised with him and gave him a medical discharge to save him from possible death at the hands of the Vietminh. He returned to civilian life in Marseille in 1948 and, although he asked for French citizenship only in the 1970s (his legal status was that of a stateless person until then), he nonetheless gallicised his Hungarian name into "Paul Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa". He met Andrée Mallah, Nicolas Sarkozy's mother (known as DaduThe tough new president still loves his mum, France's real first lady - The Guardian - Angelique Chrisafis - 14 May 2007), in 1949.Andrée Mallah, then a law student, was the daughter of Benedict Mallah, a wealthy urologist and STD specialist with a well-established reputation in the mainly bourgeois 17th arrondissement of Paris. Benedict Mallah, originally called Aaron Mallah and nicknamed Benico, was born in 1890 in the Sephardic Jewish community of Salonica (Thessaloniki), Ottoman Empire. Resettled in Provence, southern France, the family had moved to Salonica a century later. Benico Mallah, the son of a jeweller, left Salonica, then part of the Ottoman Empire, with his mother in 1904 at the age of 14 to attend the prestigious Lycée Lakanal boarding school of Sceaux, in the southern suburbs of Paris. He studied medicine after his baccalaureate and decided to stay in France and become a French citizen. A doctor in the French Army during World War I, he met a recent war widow, Adèle Bouvier (1891–1956), from a bourgeois family of Lyon, whom he married in 1917. Adèle Bouvier, Nicolas Sarkozy's grandmother, was a Catholic like the majority of French people. Mallah, for whom religion had reportedly never been a central issue, converted to Catholicism upon marrying Adèle Bouvier, which had been requested by Adèle's parents, and changed his name to Benedict. Although Benedict Mallah converted to Catholicism, he and his family nonetheless had to flee Paris and take refuge in a small farm in Corrèze during World War II to avoid being arrested and delivered to the Germans. During the Holocaust, many of the Mallahs who stayed in Salonica or moved to France were deported to concentration and extermination camps. In total, 57 family members were murdered by the Nazis.Paul Sarkozy and Andrée Mallah settled in the 17th arrondissement of Paris and had three sons: Guillaume, born in 1951, who is an entrepreneur in the textile industry, Nicolas, born in 1955 and François, born in 1957 (an MBA and manager of a healthcare consultancy company http://www.bioalliancepharma.fr/news_press0106_eng.asp). In 1959 Paul Sarkozy left his wife and his three children. He later remarried twice and had two more children with his second wife.Olivier Sarkozy, his half-brother, was chosen by the Carlyle Group, in March 2008, as co-head and managing director of its recently launched global financial services division. Nick Clarck, Carlyle poaches Olivier Sarkozy, The Independent, 4 March 2008 Early lifeDuring Sarkozy's childhood, his father refused to give his former wife's family any financial help, even though he had founded his own advertising agency and had become wealthy. The family lived in a small mansion owned by Sarkozy's grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the 17th Arrondissement. The family later moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, one of the wealthiest communes of the Île-de-France région immediately west of the 17th Arrondissement just outside of Paris. According to Sarkozy, his staunchly Gaullist grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was, accordingly, raised in the Catholic faith of his household. Nicolas Sarkozy, like his brothers, is a baptised and professing Catholic. Sarkozy also said recently that one of his role models was the late pope John Paul II.Sarkozy's father Paul did not teach him or his brothers Hungarian. There is no evidence suggesting that there was an attempt to educate the Sarkozy siblings about their paternal ethnic background.Sarkozy has said that having been abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today. As a young boy and teenager, he felt inferior in relation to his wealthy classmates.see Catherine Nay's semi-official biography He suffered from insecurities (his physical shortness of 1.65 m, 5 feet 5 inches, or his family's lack of money, at least relatively to their 17th Arrondissement or Neuilly neighbours), and is said to have harboured a considerable amount of resentment against his absent father. "What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood", he said later.EducationSarkozy was enrolled in the Lycée Chaptal, a state-funded (public) middle and high school in Paris's 8th arrondissement, where he failed his sixième. His family then sent him to the Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau, a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre pupil,Un pouvoir nommé désir, Catherine Nay, 2007 but where he nonetheless obtained his baccalauréat in 1973. He enrolled at the Université Paris X Nanterre, where he graduated with a Master in Private law, and later with a DEA degree in Business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the May '68 student movement and was still a stronghold of leftist students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organisation where he was very active. After graduating, he entered the Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris (1979-1981) but failed to graduate due to an insufficient command of the English language. Augustin Scalbert, Un soupçon de vantardise sur les CV ministériels, Rue 89, 18 September 2007  After passing the bar, he became a lawyer specializing in business law and family law.See Catherine Nay's semi-official biography Marriages, divorces and separationsMarie-Dominique CulioliSakozy wed his first wife Marie-Dominique Culioli on 23 September 1982; her father was a pharmacist from Vico (a village north of Ajaccio, Corsica). They had two sons, Pierre (born in 1985) and Jean (born in 1987). Sarkozy's marriage witness was the prominent right wing politician Charles Pasqua, later to become a political opponent. Sarkozy divorced Culioli in 1996, although they had already been separated for several years.Cécilia Ciganer-AlbénizAs mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine, Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz (great-granddaughter of composer Isaac Albéniz and of a Russian father), when he officiated at her wedding&lt;/ref&gt; to television host Jacques Martin. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced Martin one year later. Sarkozy married her in October 1996, with witnesses Martin Bouygues and Bernard Arnault. They have one son, Louis, born 23 April 1997.Between 2002 and 2005, the couple often appeared together on public occasions, with Cécilia Sarkozy acting as the chief aide for her husband.BBC NEWS | World | Europe | Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; On 25 May 2005, however, the Swiss newspaper Le Matin revealed that she had left Sarkozy for French-Moroccan national Richard Attias, head of Publicis in New York.

He also receives a yearly council pension, because he has been previously a member of the council of the Hauts-de-Seine department. Sarkozy's salary will more than double to € 240,000 as a result of an amendment to the 2008 budget. Sarkozy's salary will double to match peersMember of National AssemblySarkozy is recognised by the right and left as a skilled politician and striking orator. "French Populism", by Ignacio Ramonet, Le Monde Diplomatique, June 2007 Edition, French version , English translation  His supporters within France emphasise his charisma, political innovation and willingness to "make a dramatic break" amid mounting disaffection against "politics as usual"; some see him as wanting to depart from traditional French social and economic principles in favour of American-style economic reform. Overall, he is considered more pro-U.S. and pro-Israeli than most French politicians.Since November 2004, Sarkozy has been president of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP), France's major right political party, and he was Minister of the Interior in the government of Dominique de Villepin, with the honorific title of Minister of State, making him effectively the number three man in the French State after President Jacques Chirac and the prime minister. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as Minister of Worship (in this guise he created the CFCM, French Council of Muslim Faith). Previously, he was a deputy to the French National Assembly. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including Finance Minister.In governmentSarkozy's political career began at 22 when he became a city councillor in Neuilly-sur-Seine. A member of the Neo-Gaullist party RPR, he went on to be elected mayor of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor Achille Peretti. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. The senior RPR politician in the time, Charles Pasqua, wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organise his campaign. Instead Sarkozy profited from a short illness of Pasqua to propel himself into the office of mayor.Le Parisien, 11 January 2007 He was the youngest ever mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the National Assembly.In 1993, Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the "Human Bomb", a man who had taken small children hostage in a kindergarten in Neuilly. The "Human Bomb" was killed after two days of talks by policemen of the RAID, who entered the school stealthily while the attacker was resting.From 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister Édouard Balladur. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a protégé of Jacques Chirac. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister except his predecessor, by the equivalent of €200 billion ($260 billion) (FY 1994-1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to 6% of GDP.http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dette_publique_de_la_France&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Maastricht Treaty, the French yearly budget deficit may not be bigger than 3% of France's GDP.In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed Balladur for President of France. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget and found himself outside the circles of power.However, he came back after the right-wing defeat at the 1997 parliamentary election, as number 2 in the RPR. When the party leader Philippe Séguin resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the 1999 European Parliament election, winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident Rally for France of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.  In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see French presidential election, 2002), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as French Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for French President in 1995.Sauced Sarkozy Felice E. Baker, The Dartmouth Independent, 31 October 2007 Following Jacques Chirac's 14 July keynote speech on road safety Sarkozy as interior minister pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads.In the cabinet reshuffle of 31 March 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of Alain Juppé became clear. It became increasingly apparent that Sarkozy would go on to seek the presidency in 2007; in an often-repeated comment made on television channel France 2, when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, "not just when I shave".Broadcast of &quot;France 2&quot;, 19 November 2003In party elections of November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between sarkozystes, such as Sarkozy's "first lieutenant", Brice Hortefeux, and Chirac loyalists, such as Jean-Louis Debré.Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the National Assembly (as required by the constitution,French Constitution, article 23 he had had to resign as a deputy when he had become minister in 2002).On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station France Info reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of Dominique de Villepin without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.First term as Minister of the Interior, meeting with bicycle-mounted officers of the French National Police, 13 May 2002.]]Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most popular and also the most unpopular conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004. His "tough on crime" policies, which included increasing the police presence on the streets and introducing monthly crime performance ratings, were popular with many and unpopular for many others.Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the Muslim community. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy felt that the foundation of such an organisation was desirable. He supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit Conseil français du culte musulman ("French Council of the Muslim Faith"), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.JO associations, 28 May 2003 In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the 1905 law on the separation of Church and State, mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public fundsWorldWide Religious News so that they are less reliant on money from outside of France.Minister of FinanceDuring his short appointment as Minister of Finance, Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected libéralisme (a hands-off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state dirigisme (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the UMP.In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in France Télécom from 50.4% to 41%.Le gouvernement finalise la privatisation de France TélécomSarkozy backed a partial nationalisation of the engineering company Alstom decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003.Bruxelles valide le sauvetage d'AlstomSarkozy reached in June an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of 2%; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to 1% in September.[http://www.lexpansion.com/art/2576.78716.0.html Le Quotidien de l'Expansion, 30 September 2004]Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF (solidarity tax on wealth). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the Left and Right. Some in the business world and on the Liberal Right, such as Alain Madelin, wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the Left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.[http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html Le Nouvel Observateur, press review, 21 October 2004]Villepin governmentSecond term as Minister of the Interior, after their bilateral meeting in Washington D.C., 12 September 2006]] During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party. However, the civil unrest in autumn 2005 put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from housing projects "rabble" ("racaille") in Argenteuil near Paris. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on "hoodlums" and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities Azouz Begag. Azouz Begag, principal opposant à Nicolas Sarkozy, Le Monde, 2 November 2005  After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants,  greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents.Action as UMP's leaderBefore he was elected French President, Sarkozy was president of UMP, the French conservative party, elected with 85% of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members has significantly increased. In 2005, he supported a "yes" vote in the French referendum on the European Constitution but the "No" vote won.Throughout 2005, Sarkozy became increasingly vocal in calling for radical changes in France's economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with Le Monde on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises, and denounced what he considers to be unrealistic policies.[http://sarkozyblog.free.fr/index.php?2005/09/07/170-le-meilleur-pour-la-france Interview with Le Monde, 8 September 2005] Among other issues:he called for a simplified and "fairer" taxation system, with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all direct taxes combined) at 50% of revenue;he approved measures reducing or denying social support to unemployed workers who refuse work offered to them;he pressed for a reduction in the budget deficit, claiming that the French state has been living off credit for some time.Such policies are what are called in France libéral (that is, in favour of laissez-faire economic policies, although this judgment is made by French standards) or, with a pejorative undertone, ultra-libéral. Sarkozy rejects this label of libéral and prefers to call himself a pragmatist instead. Besides his dirigisme on economical subjects is far from laissez-faire politics.Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with quotas designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wants to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enables foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wants to select the best students to the best curricula in France.In early 2006, the French parliament adopted a controversial bill known as DADVSI, which reforms French copyright law. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of peer-to-peer systems.Candidacy for PresidentOn 14 January 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy was chosen by the UMP to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy, who was running unopposed, won 98% of the votes.

Nicolas Sarkozy came in first with 31.18% of the votes, ahead of Ségolène Royal of the Socialists with 25.87%. In the second round, Sarkozy came out on top to win the election with 53.06% of the votes ahead of Ségolène Royal with 46.94%. In his speech immediately following the announcement of the election results, Sarkozy stressed the need for France's modernisation, but also called for national unity, mentioning that Royal was in his thoughts. In that speech, he claimed "The French have chosen to break with the ideas, habits and behaviour of the past. I will restore the value of work, authority, merit and respect for the nation."Presidency (2007&amp;ndash;present) On 16 May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy became the sixth person elected President of the French Fifth Republic (the seventh overall; Alain Poher served twice in an interim role as President of the French Senate), and the 23rd president over all five Republican governments in the history of France. He is the first French President to have been born after World War II.The official transfer of power from Jacques Chirac took place on 16 May at 11:00 am (9:00 UTC) at the Élysée Palace, where he was given the authorization codes of the French nuclear arsenal and presented with the Grand Master's Collar, symbol of his new function of Grand Master of the Legion of Honour.

However, after the 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet has been adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials.Shortly after taking office, President Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president Álvaro Uribe and the left-wing guerrilla FARC, regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's "chancellor" Rodrigo Granda.Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberación de rehenes, La Cronica, 8 June 2007  Furthermore, he announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya to their country. In exchange, he signed with Gaddafi security, health care and immigration pacts – and a $230 million (168 million euros) MILAN antitank missile sale. Molly Moore, France's Sarkozy Off to a Running Start, Washington Post, 4 August 2007  The contract was the first made by Libya since 2004, and was negotiated with MBDA, a subsidiary of EADS. Another 128 millions euros contract would have been signed, according to Tripoli, with EADS for a TETRA radio system. The Socialist Party (PS) and the Communist Party (PCF) criticised a "state affair" and a "barter" with a "Rogue state". Tripoli annonce un contrat d'armement avec la France, l'Elysée dans l'embarras, Le Monde, 2 August 2007  The leader of the PS, François Hollande, requested the opening of a parliamentary investigation.On 8 June 2007, during the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050 in order to prevent global warming. He then pushed forward the important Socialist figure of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as European nominee to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). FMI: Strauss-Kahn candidat officiel de l'Union européenne, Le Figaro, 10 July 2007   Critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed to nominate Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures. Reuters, "France's Sarkozy wants Strauss-Kahn as IMF head" Sat 7 July 2007 2:38PM EDT read here  The UMP, Sarkozy's party, won a majority at the June 2007 legislative election, although by less than expected. In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the Nouveau Centre, ratified one of Sarkozy's electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the inheritance tax. Les députés votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession, Le Figaro, 13 July 2007  Les droits de succession (presque) supprimés, Libération, 13 July 2007   The inheritance tax formerly brought eight billion euros into state coffers. Droits de succession: pour une minorité de ménages aisés, L'Humanité, 7 June 2007  After winning the election, Sarkozy's UMP majority has reduced taxes, in particular for upper middle-class people, allegedly in an effort to boost GDP growth, but did not reduce state expenditures. He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so. Furthermore, Sarkozy broke with the custom of amnestying traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on Bastille Day, a tradition that Napoleon had started in 1802 to commemorate the storming of the Bastille during the French RevolutionSarkozy then went on vacation to the United States, taking his family to Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. He stayed in the 11-bathroom shorefront mansion of former Microsoft executive Michael Appe. He was brought there by a commercial jet, however, after the death of Cardinal Lustiger, archbishop of Paris, whose funeral he was to attend, Nicolas Sarkozy assistera aux obsèques du cardinal Lustiger, L'Express, 9 August 2007  one of his presidential planes flew him on 10 August to Paris and then back to America. On 21 August he returned to France by a commercial jet.Sarkozy's government issued a decree on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary biometric profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called Parafes, was to use fingerprints. The new database would be interconnected with the Schengen Information System (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons (FPR). The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés (CNIL) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR. Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français, Le Monde, 8 August 2007  On 21 July 2008, parliament, with only 1 vote to spare, passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. These changes, if finalized, introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, gives parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, ends government control over parliament's committee system, allows parliament to set its own agenda, allows the president to address parliament in-session, and ends the president's right of collective pardon. He has claimed that these reforms strengthen parliament, while some opposition socialist lawmakers have described it as a "consolidation of a monocracy"France backs constitution reform; BBC News.On 23 July 2008, parliament votes the “loi de modernisation de l'économie” (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government has also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free.Main members of Sarkozy's staffGeneral secretary - Claude GuéantArrêté du 16 mai 2007 portant nomination à la Présidence de la République Journal OfficielChief of the private military staff - Vice-amiral d'escadre Édouard GuillaudSpecial advisor to the President - Henri GuainoAdvisors to the President - Raymond Soubie and Catherine PégardDiplomatic advisor and sherpa - Jean-David LevitteDeputy secretary general - François PérolHead of cabinet - Emmanuelle MignonAdvisors to the Presidency - Arnold Munnich and Patrick OuartSpokesman - David MartinonHead of cabinet - Cédric GoubetImage of SarkozyHe was named the 68th best dressed person by the Vanity Fair magazine, alongside David Beckham and Brad Pitt.

Chloé Leprince, Pour le nouveau Président, la rupture commence par l'image, Rue 89, 21 August 2007 Former Daily Telegraph journalist Colin Randall has however highlighted Sarkozy's tighter control of his image and frequents interventions in the media: "he censors a book, or fires the chief editor of an hebdomary."Sarkozy, alongside Tony Blair, is part of the inspiration for Mathieu Amalric's portrayal of Dominic Greene, the villain of the 22nd James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.ControversiesGenerally speaking, Sarkozy is a bête noire of the Left, and is also criticised by some on the right, most vocally by the supporters of Jacques Chirac and Dominique de Villepin, such as Jean-Louis Debré.Cette droite qui dit «non» à Sarkozy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;la-Croix.com : Boutin renonce à se présenter et soutient Sarkozy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Critics have accused him of being an authoritarian demagogue, ready to trade away civil liberties for political gains.Marianne, Le retournement de Sarkozy sur Airbus, 5 March 2007 He is also accused by the Left of being a populist who favours far-right ideas.L'Humanité, 11 June 2005. [[Image:NewSarkoKaercher.jpg|thumb|Since his famous Kärcher remark, Nicolas Sarkozy has been lampooned about his fondness for cleaning out the riff-raff; here, electoral posters of Sarkozy were posted on a Kärcher car wash]]''Kärcher'' remarkIn the midst of a tense period and following a shooting that killed an 11-year-old boy in the banlieue of La Courneuve in June 2005, Sarkozy quoted a local resident and vowed to clean the area out "with a Kärcher" (nettoyer la cité au Kärcher, Kärcher being a well-known German brand of pressure cleaning equipment), and two days before the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 Paris riots]] he referred to the youth of the housing projects as voyous (thugs) and racaille, a slang term which can be translated into English as rabble, scum or riff-raff;answering to a resident who addressed Sarkozy with "Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille ?"(When will you get rid us from these dregs) (France 5, [http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm Arrêt sur images] 6 November 2005) this was criticised as being inappropriate language.L'Humanité, Nicolas Sarkozy pompier pyromane, 2 November 2005Separation of powersAs Minister of the Interior, Sarkozy has made bold statements following heinous crimes reported in the media. As a consequence, he has been accused in certain cases of failing to respect the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary by trying to apply pressure in certain cases. Most famously, he was criticised, not only by the left-wing Syndicat de la magistrature judges' union, but also by the centrist Union syndicale des magistrats for attacks on the independence of the judiciary.26 June 2006, Les magistrats accusent Sarkozy de violer la séparation des pouvoirsIn September 2005 some youths were acquitted of an arson attack on a police station in Pau for lack of proof and Sarkozy was accused of having pushed for a hasty inquiry – Sarkozy had vowed that the perpetrators would be arrested within three months.[http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/societe/20051001.OBS0822.html Le Nouvel Observateur, 1 October 2005 ] On 22 June 2005, he announced to law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of "the judge" who had freed a man on parole, enabling him to commit a murder.[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-665357@51-660372,0.html Le Monde, 23 June 2005]Sarkozy has personal friendships with some of the most powerful figures in the French business world; for example, Martin Bouygues (from the Bouygues group, owner of the TF1 channel, as well as telecommunications and public works companies) and Bernard Arnault (from LVMH) were his marriage witnesses. His brother, Guillaume, is a senior executive of the MEDEF, the foremost business union in France; in 2005, he renounced running for the top position of that union because he said he did not want to hinder his brother's political career. French presidents have long had links with the business sector, but Sarkozy's have been especially extensive, and especially publicly discussed. His vacation on the yacht of a wealthy industrialist, immediately after his election, drew particular comment, although Sarkozy was unapologetic.Religion and stateIn 2004, he published a book called La République, les religions, l'espérance ("The Republic, Religions, and Hope"),&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on [[secular]] or [[republicanism|republican]] values. He also advocated reducing the [[separation of church and state]], arguing for the government [[subsidy]] of [[mosque]]s in order to encourage Islamic integration into French society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualit%E9_1004/mosquees_a5_4504.htm &quot;L'Etat Doit-Il Financer La Construction de Mosquees?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; He flatly opposes financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with [[Tom Cruise]], Sarkozy was criticised by some for meeting with a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], which is classified as a [[cult]] (''secte'' translates &quot;cult&quot;) in France (see [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Worldwide Religious News]]'', 2 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt;Sarkozy visited the Pope on 20 December 2007, and received the title of Honorary Chanoine of the Basilica of St. John Lateran.[http://www.cef.fr/catho/actus/archives/2007/20071219sarkozy.php "Le président Sarkozy chanoine d'honneur de la basilique Saint-Jean de Latran"] A chanoine is a member of the clergy.Chanoine On his visit to the Pope, Sarkozy was accompanied by French comedian Jean-Marie Bigard,Jean-Marie Bigard was late, and text-messaged during the audience. This behavior has led some people to advance that he is not cultured enough to be in office.&quot;A lowbrow in high office ruffles France&quot;, by Michael Kimmelman, 15 April 2008, [[New York Times]]War in IraqNicolas Sarkozy disapproved of the US-led invasion of Iraq, but was nonetheless critical of the way Jacques Chirac and his foreign minister Dominique de Villepin expressed France's opposition to the war. Talking at the French-American Foundation in Washington, D.C. on 12 September 2006, he denounced what he called the "French arrogance" and said: "It is bad manners to embarrass one's allies or sound like one is taking delight in their troubles."  He also added: "We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis." Jacques Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy's speech was "appalling" and "a shameful act".Even though his current foreign minister Bernard Kouchner (excluded from the Socialist party after his inclusion in François Fillon's government) had been one of the few supporters in France of removal of Saddam Hussein from power, Sarkozy's stance on the war has not changed.View on genetic predispositionsA few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Nicolas Sarkozy said during an interview with philosopher Michel OnfrayPhilosophie Magazine, nr 8, April 2007; online extracts that he thinks disorders such as paedophilia and depression have a genetic as well as social basis, famously stating "I don't agree with you, I'd be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease"; he also claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, "I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide." These claims were criticised by some scientists, including controversial geneticist Axel Kahn.L'Humanité, 4 April 2007, « Un gène ne commande jamais un destin humain »Le Monde, 11 April 2007, Tollé dans la communauté scientifique après les propos de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la génétique Sarkozy later said, "What part is innate and what part is acquired? At least let's debate it, let's not close the door to all debate."The Guardian, 10 April 2007, « Row over Sarkozy's paedophilia comment refuses to go away »African speechOn Friday, 27 July 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech in Senegal, written by Henri Guaino, in which he made reference to "African peasants"News24.com; 28 July 2007; Sarkozy's Africa vision under fireChris McGreal;''The Guardian (UK)''27 August 2007 Mbeki criticised for praising 'racist' Sarkozy (note that the French word "paysans" can be translated as either "peasants" or as "rural people") and said that colonialism was not the cause of all of Africa's problems, and denied that France had ever exploited an African country.The remarks were greeted with disappointment and widely condemned by African intellectuals; many, such as Achille Mbembe, Mamadou Diouf or Ibrahima Thioub viewed them not only as racist, but as displaying a deep ignorance by Sarkozy of African studies, wondering how it was possible to hold similar discourses in 2008. Michel Agier, l'Afrique en France après le discours de Dakar, Vacarme n°42 Achille Mbembe; Mail and Guardian (South Africa); 27 August 2007; Sacré bleu! Mbeki and Sarkozy? Alpha Oumar Konare, head of the African Union commission, said "This speech was not the kind of break we were hoping for... It reminded us of another age, especially his comments about peasants." Other criticism was levelled at Sarkozy's failure to acknowledge the previous role of France in propping up abusive regimes. The French government defended Sarkozy's speech, saying that he also criticised the laissez faire economics of globalisation and proposed a partnership to help Africa confront it. Konare's wife Adame Ba Konare also started a movement of promotion of African History following Sarkozy's speech.A purported letter from South African president Thabo Mbeki praising Sarkozy for the speech and calling him a "citizen of Africa" raised an outcry among the South African media.Agricultural Show incidentOn 23 February 2008, Sarkozy was filmed by a reporter for French newspaper Le Parisien having the following exchange while visiting the Paris International Agricultural Show:&quot;Premiers pas mouvementés de Sarkozy au salon de l'agriculture&quot;  While quickly crossing the hall Saturday morning, in the middle of the crowd, Sarkozy encounters a recalcitrant visitor who refuses to shake his hand. "Ah no, don't touch me!", said the man. The president retorted immediately: "Get lost, then." "You're making me dirty", yelled the man. With a frozen smile, Sarkozy says, his teeth glistening, a refined "Get lost, then, poor dumb-ass, go." In French: Lors de sa traversée éclair du salon samedi matin, en plein bain de foule, Sarkozy croise un visiteur récalcitrant qui refuse sa poignée de main. «Ah non, touche-moi pas», prévient-il. Le chef de l'Etat rétorque sans détour : «Casse-toi, alors.» «Tu me salis», embraye l'homme. Le sourire se crispe. Sarkozy lâche, desserrant à peine les dents, un raffiné «Casse-toi alors, pauv'con, va». This exchange has been cause for much humour and debate regarding its propriety in the French press. It should also be noted that a precise translation into English has many possible variations.&quot;French Politics: Found on the web&quot;, by Art Goldhammer&quot;French supporters defend Sarkozy&quot;, [[Agence France-Presse], 25 February 2008]&quot;Sarkozy runs afoul of critics with rank reply&quot;, by Crispian Balmer, 26 February 2008 [[Reuters]]Awards and honoursFrench honoursGrand Cross of the ''Légion d'honneur (2007 - Automatic when taking office)''Was previously Knight of the Légion d'honneur (since 2004)[[Ordre national du Mérite|Grand Cross of the Ordre national du Mérite]] (2007 - Automatic when taking office)Other countriesHonorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (2008 - United Kingdom) Queen hosts French President Nicolas Sarkozy and wife CarlaGrand Cross of the Order of Charles III (2004 - Spain)REAL DECRETO 21/2004, de 9 de enero, por el que se concede la Gran Cruz de la Real y Distinguida Orden Española de Carlos III al señor Nicolas Sarkozy, Ministro del Interior de la República Francesa.Commander of the ''Ordre de Léopold (Belgium)Stara Planina (Bulgaria)Proto-canon of the Papal Basilica of St. John Lateran (2007 - Holy See)NotesBibliography, interviews with Michel Denisot., Grand livre du mois 1995., subject(s): Pratiques politiques—France—1990–, France—Politique et gouvernement—1997–2002., series: Les dossiers du "Canard enchaîné" 89.Alvarez-Montalvo, Marta (9 July 2004).
