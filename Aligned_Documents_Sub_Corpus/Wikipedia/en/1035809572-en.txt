Copenhagen. A pacey winger, earlier in his career he was told that he could have been a sprinter, Grønkjær is able to play both right or left wing, but he is also able to play in the hole as supporting striker. Grønkjær has been capped more than 60 times for the Denmark national football team, scoring five goals. He played for his country at the 2002 World Cup, as well as two European Championship tournaments.BiographyRaised in Thisted, Grønkjær started his career with local team Thisted FC. While at Thisted FC, he made his debut for the Danish youth national teams in October 1992 and played 6 matches at the 1994 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship. He moved on to defending Danish Superliga champions Aalborg Boldspilklub (AaB) in 1995. He played almost 100 matches for the club, including games in the European 1995-96 UEFA Champions League tournament. With three goals in six matches, as the Danish national youth team won silver medals at the 1994 European Under-16 Championship, he showed himself one of the brightest talents in Danish football. He was named 1995 Danish Under-19 Player of the Year and Grønkjær attracted the attention of a string of European top clubs.Moving abroadAs his contract was projected to run out in the summer 1999, AaB sold Grønkjær in a £3.5 million transfer deal with Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam in October 1997, with Grønkjær moving to Amsterdam in July 1998. At Ajax, he was coached by fellow Dane Morten Olsen, and played alongside Danish international Ole Tobiasen. With Ajax, he won the 2000 Dutch Cup and he was named 1999-2000 "Ajax Player of the Year" by the fans.In his first year at Ajax, Grønkjær made his debut for the Danish national team in the 2000 European Championship (Euro 2000) qualification game against Italy on March 27, 1999. In the very first minute of the game, he famously echoed Jesper Olsen's 1986 World Cup mistimed backpass to Spanish forward Emilio Butragueño, as Grønkjær passed the ball to Italian forward Filippo Inzaghi who promptly scored the first goal in Italy's 2-1 victory. Rasmus Bech, "Den aften, da Jesper Olsen blev glemt", Politiken article, March 28, 1999 Despite the disappointing debut game, Grønkjær became an important part of the national team under coach Bo Johansson and he played full time in Denmark's three games at the Euro 2000 main tournament.The record moveIn October 2000, Grønkjær joined English Premiership club Chelsea FC for £7.5m, which made him the then most expensive Danish football player. However, he was still sidelined with an injury until January 2001. His career at Chelsea lasted four years, and his erratic form caused much frustration for Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri and the Chelsea fans. However, at his best he could tear past even the best full-backs and he created some great and important goals for the club.A notable example was when Grønkjær assisted the first goal and scored the second against Liverpool FC on the final day of the 2002-03 season at Stamford Bridge to give Chelsea a 2-1 victory and the important fourth place in the league, which allowed the club to qualify for the upcoming 2003-04 UEFA Champions League tournament. The importance of this result cannot be overstated, as qualification for the Champions League was considered essential to Roman Abramovich's impending takeover of the club.In the 2003-04 UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg away at Highbury Stadium, Grønkjær came on for Scott Parker in the second half, with Arsenal FC leading 1-0 on the night and 2-1 on aggregate. Within six minutes of the substitution, Chelsea equalized through a goal by Frank Lampard. As Wayne Bridge scored three minutes before the final whistle, Chelsea went on to defeat Arsenal 3-2 on aggregate and book a place in the semi-finals.Trevor Haylett, Bridge breaks Arsenal's hearts, UEFA.com, April 6, 2004 In the following semi-final against AS Monaco, he scored from outside the penalty area with a cross-come-shot, but it was not enough for Chelsea to reach the final, as the club was defeated 5-3 on aggregate by Monaco.Grønkjær also scored a strike in front of 67,000 fans at Old Trafford against Manchester United in the penultimate game of the 2003-04 season, the second of a three-game scoring streak. His final goal scored for Chelsea came the following week against Leeds United, where he scored the winner with a header in the first half.While at Chelsea, Grønkjær became a mainstay in the Danish national team under new national team coach Morten Olsen, and he played in all of Denmark's four games at the 2002 World Cup. In the qualification games for Euro 2004, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1-0 victory over closest rivals Norway, helping Denmark qualify for the final tournament in Portugal. He missed the opening game of Euro 2004 due to the death of his mother, but went to Portugal to join the Danish squad and scored the second goal of the 2-0 win against Bulgaria.A step downChelsea had fired manager Ranieri before Euro 2004, and Grønkjær left the club and started the 2004-05 season at league rivals Birmingham City. However, after a poor start with Birmingham, where he failed to adapt to the tactics of the team, he was transferred to Atlético Madrid in January 2005 for a fee of around £2.5m. His spells with Birmingham and Atletico were a troubled time for Grønkjær, and in the summer of 2005 he transferred to Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, where the club was building a formidable squad under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, with Grønkjær playing alongside fellow Dane Jon Dahl Tomasson.However, despite the hype and expectations at the start of the season, the club struggled in mid-table. At the beginning of February 2006, Grønkjær and Tomasson openly criticised Trapattoni as "lacking the will to attack and win." The criticism came after 12 drawn games out of 20, and although Trapattoni wanted to assert his authority and benched both players in the next game, he himself was fired the very next day, on 9 February 2006.Rumours in the German and Danish media suggested that Grønkjær would leave Stuttgart in favour of Danish club F.C. Copenhagen Jesper Grønkjær spøger i FCK, Politiken, May 27 2006. and he was presented as a new player for the defending Danish champions on June 23, 2006.

Copenhagen's first UEFA Champions League campaign in the 2006-07 tournament, Grønkjær picked up a groin injury in a September 2006 match against SL Benfica. He was prognosed an eight to twelve week recovery, Jesper Møller, Jesper Grønkjær ude i 8-12 uger, Danmarks Radio, September 15, 2006 and returned in a November game against Esbjerg fB in the Danish Cup. On December 6 2006, he scored his second Champions League goal in his career, against Celtic in a match FCK won 3-1 at Parken Stadium.Career statistics  |- |1995-96||rowspan="3"|AaB||rowspan="3"|Superliga||29||3|||||||||||||||| |- |1996-97||28||1|||||||||||||||| |- |1997-98||29||6||||||||||||||||  |- |1998-99||rowspan="3"|Ajax||rowspan="3"|Eredivisie||25||8|||||||||||||||| |- |1999-00||25||3|||||||||||||||| |- |2000-01||5||1||||||||||||||||  |- |2000-01||rowspan="4"|Chelsea||rowspan="4"|Premier League||14||1|||||||||||||||| |- |2001-02||13||0|||||||||||||||| |- |2002-03||30||4|||||||||||||||| |- |2003-04||31||2|||||||||||||||| |- |2004-05||Birmingham City||Premier League||16||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2004-05||Atlético Madrid||La Liga||16||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2005-06||Stuttgart||Bundesliga||25||0||||||||||||||||  |- |2006-07||rowspan="3"|Copenhagen||rowspan="3"|Superliga||21||5|||||||||||||||| |- |2007-08|||||||||||||||||||| |- |2008-09|||||||||||||||||||| 107||15|||||||||||||||| 55||12|||||||||||||||| 104||7|||||||||||||||| 16||0|||||||||||||||| 25||0|||||||||||||||| 307||34|||||||||||||||| |International goalsScores and results list Denmark's goal tally first.#DateVenueOpponentScoreResultCompetition12001-04-25Copenhagen, DenmarkSVN1-03-0Friendly match22002-05-26Wakayama, JapanTUN1-02-1Friendly match32003-06-07Copenhagen, DenmarkNOR1-01-0Euro 2004 qual.]]42003-08-20Copenhagen, DenmarkFIN1-01-1Friendly match52004-06-18Braga, PortugalBUL2-02-0Euro 2004]]Honours1995 Danish Under-19 Player of the Year1999 Dutch Cup with Ajax2007 Danish Superliga with Copenhagen2006-07 TIPS-bladet's Player of the Year2007 Danish Superliga Profile of the Year2007 Danish Superliga Player of the Year2007 Team of the Year2007 TIPS-bladet's Autumn ProfileReferencesExternal linksDanish national team profileF.C.
