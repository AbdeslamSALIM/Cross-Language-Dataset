Reliefs are common throughout the world, for example on monumental buildings. The frieze in the classical Corinthian order is often enriched with bas-relief (low relief). Alto-relievo (high-relief) may been seen in the pediments of classical temples, e.g., the Parthenon. Occasionally, several reliefs together represent a sequence of events.Types of reliefLiegende Hetäre. around 2nd century, Head is missingBas-relief = ('bah relief") is where the overall depth of a projecting image is shallow.
