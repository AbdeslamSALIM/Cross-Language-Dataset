() (short for Carozzeria Pininfarina) is an Italian car design firm and coachbuilder in Cambiano, Italy, founded in 1930 by automobile designer and builder Battista &quot;Pinin&quot; Farina (following the company, his family name became Pininfarina in 1961, as a result of combining his nickname and surname).Over the years the company has been employed by many automobile manufacturers, notably Ferrari, Maserati, Cadillac, Nash, Peugeot, Jaguar, Volvo, Alfa Romeo, MG, Cisitalia, and Lancia. Since the 1980s Pininfarina has also provided industrial design and interior design consultation to corporate clients. Furthermore, over the years the company has designed trams (e.g. those in Lille), trains (e.g. Dutch domestic high-speed trains currently being built), and trolleys (e.g. Boston Green Line). Until his death on August 7, 2008, Pininfarina was run by Battista's grandson Andrea Pininfarina: Paolo Pininfarina, Andrea's younger brother, was appointed new chairman and CEO on 12 August 2008. The Pininfarina Group employs more than 3,000 people in subsidiary company offices throughout Europe, as well as in Morocco and China.Pininfarina is registered and publicly traded on the Borsa Italiana (Milan Stock Exchange).Pininfarina in the USA]]After World War II, a number of automotive manufacturers were interested in working with Pininfarina, whose highly innovative Cisitalia 202 design had attracted wide attention.The subsequent cooperation with Nash Motors resulted in high-volume production of Pininfarina designs and provided a major entree into the United States market. In 1952, Pininfarina visited the U.S. for the unveiling of his design for the Nash Ambassador and Statesman lines, which, although they did carry some details of Pininfarina's design, were largely designed by Nash's then-new in-house styling staff when the original Farina-designed model proved unsuited to American tastes. The Nash-Healey sports car body was, however, completely designed and assembled in limited numbers from 1952 to 1954 at Pininfarina's Turin facilities. Nash heavily advertised its link to the famous Italian designer, much as Studebaker promoted its longtime association with Raymond Loewy. As a result of Nash's marketing efforts, Pininfarina became well-known in the United States.A similar arrangement was repeated in the late 1980s when Pininfarina designed (and partially assembled) the Cadillac Allanté for General Motors. The car's bodies were assembled and painted in Italy before being flown to Detroit for final vehicle assembly.Pininfarina Sverige AB]]Pininfarina Sverige AB in Uddevalla, Sweden, was established in 2003 as a joint venture (JV) between Volvo Cars and Pininfarina. The JV is owned 60% by Pininfarina and 40% by Volvo.The C70 model -- the first car built by the joint venture- - was launched on 13 April 2006, sharing the Volvo P1 platform used in the S40. This vehicle, designed by John Kinsey, is a coupé convertible featuring a three piece retractable metal hardtop that can raise or lower in less than 30 seconds. The new C70 replaces both the current cabriolet/convertible and the coupé absent from Volvo's lineup since 2003. For the first time, the C70 will be offered with a normally-aspirated gasoline engine, as well as diesel engines with variable geometry turbocharger and common-rail direct injection.Prototype and custom vehicles]]In addition to production vehicles, Pininfarina creates prototype, show, and custom cars for auto manufacturers, as well as private clients. Most prototypes -such as the Ferrari Mythos- have served solely as concept cars, although several have become production models, including the Ferrari 612 and Ferrari F50.A recent privately-commissioned custom example was the Ferrari P4/5 of 2006, a one-car rebody (changing the exterior design) of the Enzo Ferrari according to the client's specifications. Its design began in September 2005 with sketches by Jason Castriota moving through computer aided sculpture and stringent wind tunnel testing. More than 200 components were designed especially for the car though the engine, drivetrain and many other components are simply modified from the original Enzo Ferrari. The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is unchanged from the Enzo it was derived from. The P4/5 was publicly revealed on August 18, 2006 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elégance and shown again at the Paris Motor Show in late September. Another recent prototype is the Pininfarina Nido, a two seater sub-compact that could possibly make airbags obsolete.Notable designs]]  Rondine coupe by Pininfarina]]  Hispano Habit]] ]]  ]]  Mk II]] ]]  Coupé]] ]]1933 Alfa Romeo 8C 23001936 Lancia Aprilia1938 Lancia Astura1948 Cisitalia 2021952 Ferrari 2501952 Nash Ambassador1952 Nash-Healey1953 Four Berlinetta and one Spyder version of the Maserati A6GCS/531955 Peugeot 4031955 Ferrari 410 Superamerica1956 Austin A40 Farina1957 Lancia Flaminia1958 BMC Farina cars - Austin A55 Cambridge Mk II, MG Magnette Mk III, Morris Oxford V, Riley 4/68, Wolseley 15/601959 Fiat 1800/21001960 Peugeot 4041961 Fiat 23001964 Ferrari 2751965 Dino 2061965 MGB GT1966 IKA-Renault Torino1966 Alfa Romeo 1600 Spider Duetto1966 Ferrari 330 GTC1966 Fiat 124 Spider1966 Datsun 4111966 Fiat Dino Spider1967 Proposal for replacement for BMC 1800 (ADO17)1967 Proposal for replacement for BMC 1100 (ADO16)1968 Ferrari Daytona1968 Peugeot 504 Cabriolet and Coupe1971 Fiat 130 Coupe1973 Ferrari 365 GT4 BB1975 Lancia Montecarlo1975 Ferrari 3081975 Rolls-Royce Camargue1976 Peugeot Peugette1978 Jaguar XJ61983 Peugeot 2051984 Ferrari Testarossa1984 Ferrari 288 GTO1984 Honda HP-X concept car1984 Honda HP-X concept, retrieved on August 7, 2008.1985 Peugeot 205 Cabriolet1985 Ferrari 3281987 Alfa Romeo 1641987 Cadillac Allanté1987 Ferrari F401987 Peugeot 4051989 Ferrari Mythos1989 Ferrari 3481992 Jaguar XJ220 - Rebodied an unknown number of cars1994 Fiat Coupé1994 Ferrari F3551995 Alfa Romeo GTV &amp; Spider1995 Ferrari F355 Spider1995 MG F - Roof Structure only.1996 Lancia Kappa SW1997 Peugeot 306 Cabriolet1997 Peugeot 406 Coupé1999 Songhuajiang Hafei Zhongyi1999 Mitsubishi Pajero2000 Daewoo Tacuma2000 Ferrari 550 Barchetta2000 Ferrari 360 Spider2000 Hispano Habit2001 Citroën Osée2001 Hyundai Matrix2002 Ferrari 575M Maranello2002 Enzo Ferrari2002 Daewoo Lacetti2002 Hafei Lobo2003 Maserati Quattroporte2004 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti2005 Peugeot 10072005 Maserati Birdcage 75th2006 Mitsubishi Colt CZC2006 Volvo C702006 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano2006 Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina2007 Brilliance BS42007 Ford Focus CC by Pininfarina2008 Maserati GranTurismo2008 Pininfarina Hyperion (Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe by Pininfarina)2008 Pininfarina B0 Electric CarProduct designPininfarina also works with other companies such as SimpleTech for product design.Among Pininfarina's notable product designs are the Torino 2006 Olympic torch and two luxury appliance collections for Gorenje.Pininfarina ExtraPininfarina Extra, founded in 1986, is the Pininfarina Group design company which does not work in the transport sector.
