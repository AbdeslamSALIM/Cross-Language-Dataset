 Carroll County is a county located in the U.S. state of Maryland. In 2000, its population was 150,897. It was named for Charles Carroll of Carrollton (1737-1832), signer of the American Declaration of Independence. Its county seat is Westminster.This county is a part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area. While predominantly rural, the county has become increasingly suburban in recent years.HistoryCarroll County was created in 1837 from parts of Baltimore and Frederick Counties, see Hundred (division).During the American Civil War, the population of Carroll County was sharply divided between supporters of the Union and the Confederacy. In 1863, there were significant troop movements through the county as part of the Gettysburg campaign. On June 29, 1863, the cavalry skirmish known as Corbit's Charge was fought in the streets of Westminster, when two companies of Delaware cavalry attacked a much larger Confederate force under General J.E.B. Stuart.Notable citizens of Carroll County include:Francis Scott Key, author of the Star Spangled Banner, was born at his family plantation of Terra Rubra, in what is now western Carroll County.Whittaker Chambers, former communist and accuser of Alger HissLaw and governmentCarroll County is governed by three county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland.Several times in the past, Carroll County voters have rejected charter amendments that would call for a government consisting of a County Executive and a County Council.In 2004 Carroll County voters approved legislation that will expand the number of County Commissioners from three to five. The five Commissioners will be elected from five Commissioner districts, as opposed to three Commissioners elected at-large. This change will occur beginning with the 2010 elections. The change was to take effect beginning with the 2006 elections, but the Maryland General Assembly could not agree on the districts.The incoming commissioners are:Julia Walsh Gouge, President of the Commission, former mayor of HampsteadDean L.

Various organizations, such as the United States Census Bureau, the United States Postal Service, and local chambers of commerce, define the communities they wish to recognize differently, and since they are not incorporated, their boundaries have no official status outside the organizations in question. The Census Bureau recognizes the following census-designated places in the county:EldersburgOther unincorporated communities include:AlesiaCarrolltonCarrolltowneDetourFinksburgFrizzelburgGamberGaitherGreenmountHarneyHenrytonJasontownKeymarLineboroLinwoodLouisvilleMarriottsville (a portion is also in Howard County.)MiddleburgMillersPatapscoSilver RunUnion MillsUniontownWoodbine (a portion is also in Howard County.)Woodstock (a portion is also in Howard County.)Public schoolsThe Carroll County Public Schools School system is the ninth largest school district in the state of Maryland.Law EnforcementLaw enforcement services for the county are provided by the Carroll County Sheriff's Office, Maryland State Police, as well as several municipalities having their own police forces. In addition to providing police services, the Sheriff's Office also acts as an agent of the courts: serving warrants, enforcing child support laws, ensuring courthouse security, transporting prisoners, etc. On October 4th, 2007, the County Commissioners voted to create a police department for the county. The police department would handle primary law enforcement duties while the Sheriff's office would continue to act under the arm of the courts. This move would give the Commissioners power to appoint or fire the chief of police instead of having a popularly elected Sheriff being in charge of all law enforcement. This move falls in line with Maryland's more populated counties who have such a dual system of law enforcement (Montgomery, Anne Arundel, Prince George's, Howard and Baltimore Counties), as Carroll County has begun to have a population increase. Municipal departments, such as Westminster Police, would be unaffected by the change. http://www.carrollcountytimes.com/articles/2008/01/09/news/local_news/newsstory4.txtMiscellaneousThe newspaper of record is the Carroll County Times.The county was used for scenes in the Tim Allen movie For Richer or Poorer and the Richard Gere and Julia Roberts movie Runaway Bride.Chris Rock stood in front of North Carroll Middle School during his speech in the movie "Head of State."ReferencesExternal linksCarroll County, Maryland Genealogy and HistoryCarroll County GovernmentCarroll County Public SchoolsCarroll County TimesCarroll County Today - Carroll County, MD News, Weather, MoreCarroll County Public LibraryCorbit's Charge Category:Carroll County, Maryland Category:Maryland countiesde:Carroll County (Maryland) es:Condado de Carroll (Maryland) fr:Comté de Carroll (Maryland) it:Contea di Carroll (Maryland) kw:Konteth Carroll, Tir Maria nl:Carroll County (Maryland) no:Carroll County (Maryland) nds:Carroll County (Maryland) pl:Hrabstwo Carroll (Maryland) pt:Condado de Carroll (Maryland) ru:Кэрролл (округ, Мэриленд) sv:Carroll County, Maryland zh:卡洛爾縣 (馬里蘭州)
