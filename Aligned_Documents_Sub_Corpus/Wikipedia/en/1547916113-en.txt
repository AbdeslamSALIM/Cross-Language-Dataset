, Lithuania on July 25, 2008. Performing accoustic program with Clive Nolan.]] Pendragon are an English neo-progressive rock band established in 1978 in Stroud, Gloucestershire as Zeus Pendragon by guitarist Nick Barrett. The Zeus was dropped before the band started recording as the members decided it was too long to look good on a t-shirt. There were a few personnel changes in the early days, but since 1986 the lineup has remained stable, and the band is still active as of 2008.Current membersNick Barrett - guitars, vocals (1978-present)Peter Gee - bass (1978-present)Clive Nolan - keyboards (1986-present)Scott Higham - drums (2008-present)Past membersJohn Barnfield - keyboards (1978-1984)Nigel Harris - drums (1978-1986)Rick Carter - keyboards (1984-1986)Fudge Smith - drums (1986-2006)Joe Crabtree - drums (2006-2008)DiscographyAlbumsWRIF 101 LIVE At Hart Plaza (1983) (rare Detroit radio station promo vinyl) - performed "Can't Sit Down" - June 22, 1982 This is incorrect.
