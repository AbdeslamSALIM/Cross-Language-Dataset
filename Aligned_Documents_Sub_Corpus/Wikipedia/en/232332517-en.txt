|frozen = 1962/1963 (last) Lake Zurich (Swiss German/Alemannic: Zürisee; German: Zürichsee) is a lake in Switzerland, extending southeast of the town of Zürich. It is also known as Lake Zürich and Lake of Zürich. It lies approximately at co-ordinates .Geographically, Lake Zürich is located in the southwestern part of the canton of Zürich. To the east of the lake are two minor lakes, Greifensee (Lake Greifen) and Pfäffikersee (Lake Pfäffikon).It is formed by the river Linth, which, rising in the glaciers of the Tödi Range in Glarus, which was diverted by the Escher canal (completed in 1811) into the Lake Walen, there by means of the Linth canal (completed in 1816), its waters are carried to the east end of the Lake of Zürich. The waters of the Lake of Zürich outflow from the lake at its north-west end, passing through the city of Zürich, however the outflow is then called the Limmat.No streams of importance flow into the lake besides the Linth. It is included, or the greater portion, in the Canton of Zürich, but at its east end about 20 km² towards the southern shore are in that of Schwyz, and 10 km² towards its northern shore in that of St. Gallen. The large masonry dam (the Seedamm), carrying a railway line and road from Rapperswil to Pfäffikon, divides the lake. The eastern section of the lake is known as the Obersee, German for "upper lake". West of this dam lie the small islands of Lützelau and Ufenau, where in 1523 Ulrich von Hutten took refuge and died. Both shores are well cultivated and fertile.The three population and transportation centres are Zürich, Pfäffikon SZ and Rapperswil.Besides Bürkliplatz in Zürich and the Seedamm, there are no bridges across the lake. There are a number of passenger ferry services, noticeably the small auto ferry between Horgen and Meilen.The lake was frozen in the following years1223, 1259, 12621407, 14911514, 1517, 15731600, 1660, 1684, 16951709, 1716, 1718, 1740, 1755, 1763, 17891830, 1880, 1891, 18951929, 1963Cities on the lake List of cities on Lake Zurich  Left shore ¹Right shore NuolenLachenAltendorfPfäffikonFreienbachBächRichterswilWädenswilAuHorgenOberriedenThalwilRüschlikonKilchbergSchmerikonBollingenRapperswilFeldbachUerikonKehlhofStäfaMännedorfUetikon am SeeMeilenHerrlibergErlenbachKüsnachtZollikonZürich Note: ¹ Left shore from the entry of the Linth River, i.e. the south shore, which gradually becomes the west shore. Zürich, at the north-western end of the lake, is the largest city on Lake Zurich.On the west shore (which gradually becomes the south shore) are Thalwil, Horgen, Wädenswil, Richterswil, Pfäffikon, and Lachen.On the opposite shore are Küsnacht, Meilen, Stäfa, and the medieval town of Rapperswil-Jona, the castle of which shelters a Polish museum. Schmerikon is close to the east end of the lake, and a little further east is the larger town of Uznach.Water qualityLake Zurich's water is very clean and reaches, during summer, temperatures well beyond 20°C. Swimming in the public baths and beaches is very popular. The lake's water is purified and fed into Zurich's water system; it is potable.Gallery Image:Zuerichsee Horgen.jpg|A view of the lake from Horgen Image:Zürichsee.jpg|Ufenau island Image:Lake Zurich Tiefenbrunnen.jpg|Lake at Tiefenbrunnen, Zurich Image:Halbinsel Au.jpg|Au peninsula Image:Zuerichsee Jul2002.jpg|Lake Zurich showing a sailing boat, a popular pastime on the lake Image:Ufenau - Martinskapelle & Peter und Paul IMG 0865.jpg|'Ufenau' island: 'St. Martinskapelle' at the left side.
