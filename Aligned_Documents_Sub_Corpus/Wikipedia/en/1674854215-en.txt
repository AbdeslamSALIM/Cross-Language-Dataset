Degeneriaceae is the botanical name for a family of flowering plants. Such a family has been recognised by more than a few taxonomists, at least over the past few decades.The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, of 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Magnoliales in the clade magnoliids. The family consists of one genus only, Degeneria, of one or two species, trees, found on Fiji.External linksDegeneriaceae in L. Watson and M.J. Dallwitz (1992 onwards).
