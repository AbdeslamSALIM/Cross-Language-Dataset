He currently plays for Chelsea in the English Premier League. He is a central midfielder and plays as a deep-lying playmaker for the Black Stars, the Ghana national football team but is employed all over the pitch at Chelsea due to his versatility. He is the most expensive African footballer of all-time.Club careerBorn in Accra to Ghanaian parents Aba Gyandoh and James Essien, Essien began his career in a local club in his native Ghana, called Liberty Professionals FC after graduating from St Augustine College. He broke through when he played in the 1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship in New Zealand. This led to considerable attention from European scouts.SC BastiaIn July 2000, French club SC Bastia signed Essien. At Bastia, he did not command a regular place in the team, playing at right back, left back and in central defence. Then because of an injury to one of his teammates, he was given a temporary opportunity to play in central midfield. Essien flourished in this new role. Soon he was compared to Frenchman Patrick Vieira because of his ability to go from box to box. In 2002/2003 season he helped Bastia qualify for the UEFA Cup. He scored six goals that season. He became physically stronger and a harder tackler. Soon Paris Saint-Germain, Olympique Lyonnais and Olympique de Marseille made offers for him. He was not only popular in France, but also in England.Olympique LyonnaisPSG made the best offer and Bastia accepted it, but Essien rejected the contract, and instead agreed terms with Lyon who paid Bastia €7.8 million. At Lyon, Essien played a more defensive midfield role, featuring regularly in the Lyon team that won the third and fourth of their current string of seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles. He was also voted the 2005 Player of the Year by France's National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP).It was announced on 14 August 2005 that Lyon and Chelsea had agreed a £24m fee for the Ghanaian, finally ending one of the longest running transfer sagas in recent English football history. Essien is now Chelsea's second most expensive signing after the club signed Ukraine forward and captain Andriy Shevchenko from A.C. Milan on 22 May, 2006 in a £30m deal.ChelseaIt was Sir Alex Ferguson who spotted this young lad and offered 12$m. Chelsea having known this and with the immense money power overbid for a record 17$m. The transfer went through on 19 August, purportedly for a slightly reduced fee of £24.4m (€38M) nevertheless breaking Chelsea's previous record transfer fee, which they achieved the previous season by paying £24m for Olympique Marseille's Didier Drogba. He made his debut against Arsenal F.C. on August 21, wearing the number 5 on his shirt. He soon cemented his place in José Mourinho's side, starting the majority of the league games since his debut. He made an assist in his full debut against West Bromwich Albion F.C., and he replaced the injured Claude Makélélé in the defensive midfield role against Sunderland A.F.C. in the 2&ndash;0 win on September 10, 2005. The Chelsea midfield looks to have been strengthened by the powerful, athletic Essien, who could well form part of the Chelsea midfield with Frank Lampard for years to come. Essien has had amazing goals in the past, such as his cracker of a goal against Arsenal.On 15 December, he was handed a 2-match ban by UEFA for a controversial tackle on Dietmar Hamann, which resulted in his suspension from Chelsea's UEFA Champions League second round tie with eventual European champions F.C. Barcelona. Chelsea lost the two-legged tie, 3&ndash;2 on aggregate. Essien apologised to Hamann for the challenge (Hamann publicly accepted the apology) and insists that while he desires to be perceived as a player who 'unsettles' opponents, he is not a malicious or unsporting player. In January 2006, Essien was himself stretchered off the field, the victim of a poor challenge from West Ham United captain Nigel Reo-Coker, which sidelined him for three weeks.Essien scored his first goal for Chelsea in March 2006, in a 2&ndash;1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur. His second goal came on 17 April 2006 against Everton with a powerful strike after an assertive burst through the defensive line. Essien ended his debut season in England with two goals, both in the Premier League. However, the arrival of midfielders Michael Ballack from Bayern München and John Obi Mikel from Lyn Oslo brought stiffer competition for places at Chelsea.On September 12 2006, Essien scored his first UEFA Champions League goal for Chelsea in a 2&ndash;0 victory over Werder Bremen of Germany. Undeniably his most memorable strike for Chelsea was the powerful, curling equalizer against Arsenal on December 10, 2006 from approximately 35 yards. The spectacular strike sent the home crowd into uproar. The match ended in a 1&ndash;1 draw, with Essien receiving the Man of the Match award. Later in the same season Essien scored an equally dramatic late winner in the Champions League quarter-final against Valencia at the Mestalla. Running down the wing from his position at right-back he smashed an effort past Santiago Cañizares' at his near post to send Chelsea through to the semi-finals with a 1&ndash;2 victory on the night, and 2&ndash;3 win on aggregate. It was his first match back in the team after several weeks out with a knee injury. Later in a post-match interview, when asked how he felt about the win, he said he thought his team deserved the three points, despite it being a knockout game.On 15 May 2007, Essien was voted as Chelsea Player of the Year for the 2006&ndash;07 Season by the fans, becoming the first African to receive the honour. His goal against Arsenal was also voted as Chelsea Goal of the Season 2006&ndash;07.His transfer from Olympique Lyonnais to Chelsea in August 2005 is one of those about which the Stevens inquiry report in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents Pinhas Zahavi and Barry Silkman .On August 13 2007, Essien grabbed the winner with his first goal of the 2007&amp;ndash;08 Premier League campaign, as Chelsea defeated Birmingham City, to set an English record for unbeaten league matches at home &ndash; eclipsing Liverpool's previous top-flight record of 63, which Bob Paisley's team set between 1978 and 1981. Essien has been at the centre of transfer speculation linking him with a move to Real Madrid, in a move that may involve Royston Drenthe going the other way.Essien was nominated for the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year Award on October 12, 2006. One week later, he was nominated for the 2006 Ballon d'Or. He was also nominated for the 2005 FIFA World Player of the Year Award as well.

'Personally, the player who I think has been fantastic is Essien. He's brilliant,' he said. 'Because of injury he's often had to play at centre back, right back and sometimes even as a makeshift right winger. 'He's an individual that will play a big part if Chelsea win the 2007 FA Cup. 'Cristiano Ronaldo is a great player but in my opinion Essien could also have been named Player of the Season.' http://www.metro.co.uk/sport/football/article.html?in_article_id=49390&amp;in_page_id=43"The first things that people see about Michael is his energy and tackling, and they classify him as a holding midfielder, a destroyer type of player. What they don't often realise is that he can also be very dangerous going forward. His positioning to receive the ball is very good, and he knows when and where to place a pass." &ndash; Former Lyon manager Paul Le Guen on his former player."Essien is a great player. He can play every position in midfield. Where he is perfect in choices. In football, the most difficult thing is to choose well, and in every situation he chooses well. He presses, stays in position, passes long, passes short, first touch, two touches. He controls the pace of the game, fast or slow. He is midfield multifunctional, he is dynamic and strong. The boy has incredible physical power, he is super resistant with great speed and unending tactical abilities." &ndash; Former Chelsea F.C.
