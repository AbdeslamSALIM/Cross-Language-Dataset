Her family name Ripoll is Catalan. She spent much of her youth in Barranquilla, a city located in northern Colombia. Shakira is widely noted for her keen intellect and is reported to have an IQ of 140.Shakira wrote her first poem, entitled "La Rosa De Cristal" ("The Crystal Rose") when she was only four years old. As she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a typewriter, and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got her wish at age seven and continued writing poetry. These poems eventually evolved into songs. At the age of eight, after an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident, Shakira wrote her first song entitled "Tus gafas oscuras" ("Your dark glasses"). The inspiration came from her father, who for years after the accident wore dark glasses, to hide his grief.When Shakira was four, her father took her to a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the doumbek, a traditional drum used in Arabic music and which typically accompanied belly dancing. Before she knew it, Shakira was dancing on the table, as restaurant patrons responded by clapping enthusiastically. It was then that Shakira said she knew she wanted to be a performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in the second grade was rejected for the school choir because her vibrato was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded "like a goat".&quot;Shakira: 'I don't hate Britney'&quot;. BBC News. March 24, 2002. Retrieved January 22, 2007.

Contemporary Musicians, Volume 33. 2002. Retrieved February 5, 2007. It was at about this time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career. During a flight from Barranquilla to Bogotá, Ariza convinced Sony Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a hotel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of "a lost cause". Vargas, not daunted, was still convinced that Shakira had talent, and set up an audition in Bogotá. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira's performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.Career1991-1994: ''Magia &amp; Peligro''Shakira's debut album, Magia, was recorded with Sony Music in 1991, when she was only fourteen years old. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially, selling fewer than a thousand copies. After the poor acclaim of Magia, Shakira's label urged her back into the studio to release a follow up with more hit songs, to give the album potential. The album Peligro was released in 1993, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than Magia, though it was also considered a commercial failure, due to Shakira's refusal to advertise it. Although little known outside of her native Colombia, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile's Viña del Mar International Song Festival in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges. Shakira performed the ballad "Eres" ("You Are") and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was then 20-year-old Ricky Martin. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high school. In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV Series "The Oasis", loosely based in the Armero tragedy in 1985.1995–2000: ''Pies descalzos'' and ''¿Dónde están los ladrones?''Shakira originally recorded the song ¿Dónde Estás Corazón? (later released on her album Pies Descalzos) for the compilation album "Nuestro Rock" in 1995, released exclusively in Colombia. ¿Dónde Estás Corazón? was the only hit off the album. This allowed Sony to give Shakira a third attempt at making an album. Shakira returned to recording in 1995 with Luis F. Ochoa, using musical influences from a number of countries and an Alanis Morissette-oriented persona which affected some of her next albums,Freedom du Lac, Josh. &quot;In Any Language, a Whole Lotta Shakira Goin' On&quot;.

Pies Descalzos sold over five million copies, prompting the release of a remix album, titled simply The Remixes. The Remixes also included Portuguese versions of some of her best-known songs, which were recorded as a result of her success in the Brazilian market, where Pies Descalzos sold nearly one million copies.Her fourth album, ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? was released in 1998. She began to gain more fans in non-Spanish-speaking countries like Turkey, France, Switzerland, Canada, and especially the United States. Eight of the album's eleven tracks became singles, including "Ciega, Sordomuda", "Moscas En La Casa", "No Creo", "Inevitable", "Tú", "Si Te Vas", "Octavo Día", and the world-famous "Ojos Así". The latter two songs won Shakira one Latin Grammy each. Shakira's first live album, MTV Unplugged, was composed of "Estoy Aquí" and all the songs from ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? except Que Vuelvas.For this album Shakira received several Platinum certifications and plaques.In March 2000, Shakira embarked on her Tour Anfibio, a two-month tour of Latin America and the United States. In August 2000, she won an MTV Video Music Award in the now-defunct category of People's Choice - Favorite International Artist.2001–2004: ''Laundry Service''In 2001, upon the success of ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? and MTV Unplugged, Shakira began working on a crossover album to English. Collaborating with Gloria Estefan, she wrote and recorded English versions of the tracks from ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones?. However, she later decided against using translations of older songs for the album and worked for over a year on new material for the album. Around this time, Shakira also released four songs for Pepsi and for her promotion in the English markets: "Ask for More", "Pide Mas", "Knock on My Door" and "Pideme El Sol". In November 24, 2001, Laundry Service was released, although Shakira chose to exclude the four Pepsi songs. Although it was created with the intent of selling to an English language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album also featured four Spanish songs, including "Que Me Quedes Tú" (hope that you remain (for me)). Some critics claimed that Shakira's English skills were too weak for her to write in it.

In mid-April, Shakira filmed a video for the song in Miami, which was then premiered via the internet on May 7.

"Hips Don't Lie", the second single released from the album, became Shakira's first number one single on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

Although she is listed on the writing credits for the verses, the chorus was taken from Wyclef's earlier song "Dance Like This".InfluenceShakira is influenced in part by her Arabic heritage, which was a major inspiration for her breakthrough world hit "Ojos Así". Shakira is also influenced by well-known rock groups such as Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, resulting in her performance of "Back in Black" during her Tour of the Mongoose. She also cites her parents as major roles in her musical style.Tours1997: Tour Pies Descalzos2000: Tour Anfibio2002–2003: Tour of the Mongoose2006–2007: Oral Fixation TourDiscography  Studio albums1995: Pies Descalzos1998: Dónde Están Los Ladrones?2001: Laundry Service2005: Fijación Oral Vol. 12005: Oral Fixation Vol. 22009: Upcoming Studio AlbumSoundtracks2007: Love in the Time of Cholera (EP)Live albums2000: MTV Unplugged2004: Live &amp; Off the Record2007: Oral Fixation TourCompilation albums1997: The Remixes2002: Grandes Éxitos2002: Colección de Oro2006: Oral Fixation Volumes 1 &amp; 2See alsoList of Shakira awardsWhite peopleWhite Latin AmericanColombian peopleList of Lebanese peopleNotesReferencesOral Fixation World Tour 2006 (info) http://www.shakiralatina.net/?go=tour/2006VH1 Driven: Shakira (article) http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/96614/episode_about.jhtmlVH1 Driven: Shakira (video) http://www.shakiramedia.com/video/detail/765Book: Woman Full Of Grace by Ximena Diego http://www.ebookmall.com/ebooks/shakira-woman-full-of-grace-diego-ebooks.htmPareles, Jon (Nov. 14, 2005).
