James, Robert Barnard | website = http://www.agathachristie.com Agatha Mary Clarissa, Lady Mallowan, DBE (née Miller; 15 September 1890 &ndash; 12 January 1976), commonly known as Agatha Christie, was an English crime writer of novels, short stories and plays. She also wrote romances under the name Mary Westmacott, but is best remembered for her 80 detective novels and her successful West End theatre plays. Her works, particularly featuring detectives Hercule Poirot or Miss Jane Marple, have given her the title the 'Queen of Crime' and made her one of the most important and innovative writers in the development of the genre.Christie has been called—by the Guinness Book of World Records, among others — the best-selling writer of books of all time and the best-selling writer of any kind, along with William Shakespeare. Only the Bible is known to have outsold her collected sales of roughly four billion copies of novels.Agatha Christie gets a clue for filmmakers - Entertainment News, Michael Fleming, Media - Variety&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; UNESCO states that she is currently the most translated individual author in the world with only the collective corporate works of Walt Disney Productions surpassing her. Christie's books have been translated into (at least) 56 languages.Her stage play, The Mousetrap, holds the record for the longest initial run in the world, opening at the Ambassadors Theatre in London on 25 November 1952, and as of 2008 is still running after more than 23,000 performances. In 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's highest honor, the Grand Master Award, and in the same year, Witness for the Prosecution was given an Edgar Award by the MWA, for Best Play. Most of her books and short stories have been filmed, some many times over (Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile and 4.50 From Paddington for instance), and many have been adapted for television, radio, video games and comics.In 1968, Booker Books, a subsidiary of the agri-industrial conglomerate Booker-McConnell, bought a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited, the private company that Christie had set up for tax reasons. Booker later increased its stake to 64%. In 1998, Booker sold its shares to Chorion, a company whose portfolio also includes the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.Chorion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Biographyin Torquay.]] Agatha Christie was born as Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller in Torquay, Devon, in the United Kingdom. Her parents were Frederick Alvah Miller, a rich American stockbroker, and Clarissa Margaret Boehmer, the English daughter of a British army captainMorgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (Page 2) Collins, 1984 ISBN 0-00-216330-6. She never claimed United States citizenship. Christie had a sister, Margaret Frary Miller (1879 – 1950), called Madge, eleven years her senior, and a brother, Louis  Miller (1880 – 1929), called Monty, ten years older than Christie. Her father died when she was eleven years old. Her mother taught her at home, encouraging her to write at a very young age. At the age of 16, she went to Mrs Dryden's finishing school in Paris to study singing and piano.Christie Bio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Her first marriage, an unhappy one, was in 1914 to Colonel Archibald Christie, an aviator in the Royal Flying Corps. The couple had one daughter, Rosalind Hicks. They divorced in 1928, two years after Agatha discovered her husband was having an affair. It was during this marriage that she published her first novel in 1920, The Mysterious Affair at Styles.During World War I she worked at a hospital and then a pharmacy, a job that influenced her work. Many of the murders in her books are carried out with poison.DisappearanceIn late 1926, Christie's husband revealed that he was in love with another woman, Nancy Neele, and wanted a divorce. On 3 December 1926, the couple quarrelled, and Archie Christie left their house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, to spend the weekend with his mistress at Godalming, Surrey. That same evening, Christie disappeared from her home, leaving behind a letter for her secretary saying that she was going to Yorkshire; she also sent a letter to the Deputy Chief Constable of Surrey Police saying that she feared for her life. When her car was found at Newland's Corner, near Guildford, Surrey, police dredged a nearby lake and conducted a search of the surrounding countryside. Her disappearance excited great interest in the press, though the novelist Edgar Wallace speculated that her disappearance was an attempt to spite her husband and that she would be found alive and well in London.Eleven days after her disappearance, Christie was identified as a guest at the Hydropathic Hotel (now the Hydro hotelThe Harrogate Hydropathic hotel, nowadays the Old Swan Hotel, was also known as the Swan Hydro, because of its location on Swan Road, on the site of an earlier Old Swan Hotel. A Brief History of Harrogate ), Harrogate, Yorkshire, where she was registered as 'Mrs Teresa Neele', from Cape Town. Christie gave no account of her disappearance, two doctors having diagnosed her as suffering from amnesia, and opinion remains divided as to the reasons for her disappearance. One suggestion is that she had suffered a nervous breakdown, brought about by a natural propensity for depression, exacerbated by her mother's death earlier that year and by her husband's infidelity. Many people at the time believed the disappearance to be a publicity stunt, and public sentiment was predominantly negative and Edgar Wallace's suggestion that the disappearance was an attempt to embarrass her husband continues to find support, even to the extent of suggestions that Christie was trying to make people believe her husband had killed her in order to punish him for his infidelity.Adams, Cecil, Why did mystery writer Agatha Christie mysteriously disappear? The Chicago Reader, 4/2/82. http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_390.html Accessed 5/19/08.Second marriage and later lifeIn 1930, Christie married the archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan. Mallowan was 14 years younger than Christie, and a Roman Catholic, while she was of the Anglican faith. Their marriage was happy in the early years, and endured despite Mallowan's many affairs in later life, notably with Barbara Parker, whom he married in 1977, the year after Christie's death.Christie's travels with Mallowan contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East. Other novels (such as And Then There Were None) were set in and around Torquay, Devon, where she was born. Christie's 1934 novel, Murder on the Orient Express was written in the Hotel Pera Palace in Istanbul, Turkey, the southern terminus of the railway. The hotel maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author. The Greenway Estate in Devon, acquired by the couple as a summer residence in 1938, is now in the care of the National Trust. Christie often stayed at Abney Hall in Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts. She based at least two of her stories on the hall: The short story The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding, which is in the story collection of the same name, and the novel After the Funeral. "Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all the servants and grandeur which have been woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Styles, Chimneys, Stoneygates and the other houses in her stories are mostly Abney in various forms."Agatha Christie: A Readers Companion - Vanessa Wagstaff and Stephen Poole, Aurum Press Ltd. 2004.

ISBN 1 84513 015 4.[[Image:AgathaChristie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Agatha Christie's room at the Hotel Pera Palace, where she wrote Murder on the Orient Express.]]In 1971 she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire.Agatha Christie died on 12 January 1976, at age 85, from natural causes, at Winterbrook House in the north of Cholsey parish, adjoining Wallingford in Oxfordshire (formerly Berkshire). She is buried in the nearby St. Mary's Churchyard in Cholsey.Christie's only child, Rosalind Hicks, died on 28 October 2004, also aged 85, from natural causes. Christie's grandson, Mathew Prichard, was heir to the copyright to some of his grandmother's literary work (including The Mousetrap) and is still associated with Agatha Christie Limited.Hercule Poirot and Miss MarpleAgatha Christie's first novel The Mysterious Affair at Styles was published in 1920 and introduced the long-running character detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of Christie's novels and 54 short stories.Her other well known character, Miss Marple, was introduced in The Murder at the Vicarage in 1930, and was based on women like Christie's grandmother and her "cronies"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7612000/7612534.stm.During World War II, Christie wrote two novels intended as the last cases of these two great detectives, Hercule Poirot and Jane Marple, respectively. These have been identified as ''Curtain'' and Sleeping Murder. Both books were sealed in a bank vault for over thirty years, and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the film version of Murder on the Orient Express in 1974.Like Arthur Conan Doyle with Sherlock Holmes, Christie was to become increasingly tired of her detective, Poirot. In fact, by the end of the 1930s, Christie confided to her diary that she was finding Poirot “insufferable," and by the 1960s she felt that he was "an ego-centric creep." However, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and what the public liked was Poirot.In contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However it is interesting to note that the Belgian detective’s titles outnumber the Marple titles by more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while The Murder at the Vicarage remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s.Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording, recently re-discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: "Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady."http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7612000/7612534.stmPoirot is the only fictional character to have been given an obituary in The New York Times, following the publication of Curtain in 1975.Following the great success of Curtain, Christie gave permission for the release of Sleeping Murder sometime in 1976, but died in January 1976 before the book could be released. This may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Marple series — for example, Colonel Arthur Bantry, husband of Miss Marple's friend, Dolly, is still alive and well in Sleeping Murder despite the fact he is noted as having died in books published earlier. It may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died. Miss Marple fared better than Poirot, since after solving the mystery in Sleeping Murder she returns home to her regular life in St. Mary Mead.On an edition of Desert Island Discs in 2007, Brian Aldiss claimed that Agatha Christie told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter, and then decided who the most unlikely suspect was. She would then go back and make the necessary changes to "frame" that person. BBC Radio 4 - Factual - Desert Island Discs -Brian Aldiss&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; The evidence of Christie's working methods, as described by successive biographers, belies this claim.FormulaAlmost all of Agatha Christie’s books are whodunits, focusing on the English middle and upper classes. Usually, the detective either stumbles across the murder or is called upon by an old acquaintance, who is somehow involved. Gradually, the detective interrogates each suspect, examines the scene of the crime and makes a note of each clue, so readers can analyse it and be allowed a fair chance of solving the mystery themselves. Then, about halfway through, or sometimes even during the final act, one of the suspects usually dies, often because they have inadvertently deduced the killers identity and need silencing. In a few of her novels, including Death Comes as the End and Ten Little Indians, there are multiple victims. Finally, the detective organises a meeting of all the suspects and slowly denounces the guilty party, exposing several unrelated secrets along the way, sometimes over the course of thirty or so pages. The murders are often extremely ingenious, involving some convoluted piece of deception. Christie’s stories are also known for their taut atmosphere and strong psychological suspense, developed from the deliberately slow pace of her prose.Twice, the murderer surprisingly turns out to be the narrator of the story, in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night.On four occasions, Agatha Christie lets the murderer escape justice (and in the latter three stories, implicitly almost approves of the murder), in The Witness for the Prosecution (short story version), Murder on the Orient Express, Curtain and The Unexpected Guest. On a fifth occasion (Taken at the Flood), Poirot exculpates the perpetrator of manslaughter.Critical receptionAgatha Christie was revered as a master of suspense, plotting and characterisation by most of her contemporaries and, even today, her stories have received glowing reviews in most literary circles. Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox was an admitted fan of her work, once saying that nobody can write an Agatha Christie novel but the authoress herself.In popular cultureChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television:By Vanessa Redgrave in the 1979 film AgathaBy Hilda Gobbi in a 1980 Hungarian film, Kojak BudapestenBy Peggy Ashcroft in a 1986 TV play, Murder by the BookBy Esme Lambert in The Dead Zone episode "Unreasonable Doubt", transmitted on 14 July 2002.By Olivia Williams in a 2004 BBC television program entitled Agatha Christie: A Life in PicturesBy Aya Sugimoto in a 2006 episode of a Japanese television series called Hyakunin no Ijin in 2006.By Fenella Woolgar in "The Unicorn and the Wasp", a 2008 episode of the BBC television series Doctor Who.By Michelle Trout in the film Lives and Deaths of the Poets (2009).The play Murder By Indecision parodies Christie with the character Agatha Crispy.List of worksThe books of the "Middle Period" (representing the years 1934 to 1946) are often regarded, especially by the critic Robert Barnard, as Christie's finest works.NovelsYearpublishedTitleDetectives1920The Mysterious Affair at StylesHercule PoirotArthur HastingsChief Inspector Japp1922The Secret AdversaryTommy and Tuppence1923The Murder on the Links]]''Hercule PoirotArthur Hastings1924The Man in the Brown SuitAnne BeddingfeldColonel Race1925The Secret of ChimneysSuperintendent Battle1926The Murder of Roger AckroydHercule Poirot1927The Big Four]]Hercule PoirotArthur HastingsChief Inspector Japp1928The Mystery of the Blue TrainHercule Poirot1929The Seven Dials MysteryBill EversleighSuperintendent Battle1930The Murder at the VicarageMiss Marple1931The Sittaford Mysteryalso Murder at HazelmoorInspector Narracott1932Peril at End HouseHercule PoirotArthur HastingsChief Inspector Japp1933Lord Edgware Diesalso Thirteen at DinnerHercule PoirotArthur HastingsChief Inspector Japp1934Murder on the Orient Expressalso Murder in the Calais CoachHercule Poirot1934Why Didn't They Ask Evans?also The Boomerang ClueBobby JonesFrankie Derwent1935Three Act Tragedyalso Murder in Three ActsHercule Poirot1935Death in the Cloudsalso Death in the AirHercule PoirotChief Inspector Japp1936The A.B.C.

Almost all of these were written for publication in fiction magazines with over half of them first appearing in the 1920s. They were then published in book form in various collections, some of which were identical in the UK and US (e.g., The Labours of Hercules) and others where publication took place in one market but not the other.Twelve of the stories which were published in The Sketch magazine in 1924 under the sub-heading of The Man who was No. 4 were further joined into one continuous narrative in the novel The Big Four in 1927. Four further stories, The Submarine Plans (1923), Christmas Adventure (1923), The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest (1932) and The Second Gong (1932), were expanded into longer narratives by Christie (respectively The Incredible Theft, The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding, The Mystery of the Spanish Chest and Dead Man's Mirror although the shorter versions of all four have also been published in the UK).Only one short story remains unpublished in the UK in book form: Three Blind Mice (1948) on which a Christie placed a moratorium whilst the stage play based on the story, The Mousetrap, was still running in the West End.In the US, the story Christmas Adventure has not been published in book form.The main collections in both markets are:1924 Poirot Investigates (short stories: eleven in the UK, fourteen in the US)1929 Partners in Crime (fifteen short stories; featuring Tommy and Tuppence)1930 The Mysterious Mr. Quin (twelve short stories; introducing Mr. Harley Quin)1932 The Thirteen Problems (thirteen short stories; featuring Miss Marple, also known as The Tuesday Club Murders in the US)1933 The Hound of Death (twelve short stories - UK only)1934 The Listerdale Mystery (twelve short stories - UK only)1934 Parker Pyne Investigates (twelve short stories; introducing Parker Pyne and Ariadne Oliver, also known as Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective in the US)1937 Murder in the Mews (four novella-length stories; featuring Hercule Poirot, also known as Dead Man's Mirror in the US)1939 The Regatta Mystery and Other Stories (nine short stories - US only)1947 The Labours of Hercules (twelve short stories; featuring Hercule Poirot)1948 The Witness for the Prosecution and Other Stories (eleven short stories - US only)1950 Three Blind Mice and Other Stories (nine short stories - US only)1951 The Under Dog and Other Stories (nine short stories - US only)1960 The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding (six short stories - UK only)1961 Double Sin and Other Stories (eight short stories - US only)1971 The Golden Ball and Other Stories (fifteen short stories - US only)1974 Poirot's Early Cases (eighteen short stories, also known as Hercule Poirot's Early Cases in the US)1979 Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories (eight short stories - UK only)1991 Problem at Pollensa Bay and Other Stories (eight short stories - UK only)1997 The Harlequin Tea Set (nine short stories - US only)1997 While the Light Lasts and Other Stories (nine short stories - UK only)In addition, various collections have been published over the years which re-print short stories which have previously appeared in other collections e.g. [[Surprise! Surprise!|''Surprise, Surprise!]] (1965 in the US). On occasion, in among the reprinted material, these collections have sometimes contained the first book printing of an individual story e.g. ''The Market Basing Mystery in the UK version of Thirteen for Luck! (1966) which later appeared in the same market in Poirot's Early Cases.Novels written as Mary Westmacott1930 Giant's Bread1934 Unfinished Portrait1944 Absent in the Spring1948 The Rose and the Yew Tree1952 A Daughter's a Daughter1956 The BurdenPlays1930 [[Black Coffee (play)|''Black Coffee]]''1943 [[And Then There Were None (1943 play)|''And Then There Were None]]''1945 Appointment with Death1946 Murder on the Nile/Hidden Horizon1951 The Hollow1952 The Mousetrap1953 Witness for the Prosecution1954 Spider's Web1956 A Daughter's a Daughter (Written in the late 1930s.
