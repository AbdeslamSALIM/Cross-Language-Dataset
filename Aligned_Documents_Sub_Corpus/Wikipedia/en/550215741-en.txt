He was trained as a naval officer. On 9 January 1938, Paul married Frederika of Hanover at Athens. They had three children:Sophia, Queen of Spain (born 1938)Constantine II, King of the Hellenes (born 1940)Irene, Princess of Greece and Denmark (born 1942)From 1917 to 1920, Paul lived in exile with his father, Constantine I. From 1923 to 1935, and again from 1941 to 1946, he lived in exile again, this time with his brother, George II. During most of World War II, when Greece was under German occupation, he was with the Greek government-in-exile in London and Cairo. From Cairo, he broadcast messages to the Greek people.ReignPaul returned to Greece in 1946. He succeeded to the throne in 1947, on the death of his brother, George II, during the Greek Civil War (between Greek Communists and the non-communist Greek government). In 1947 he was unable to attend the wedding of his first cousin, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh to the future Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom as he was suffering from typhoid fever.Van der Kiste, John (1994). Kings of the Hellenes. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Alan Sutton Publishing. ISBN 0-7509-0525-5 p.177By 1949 the Civil War was effectively over, with the communist insurgents ceasing the majority of their operations, and the task of rebuilding the shattered north of the country began.Van der Kiste, p.179In the 1950s Greece recovered economically, and diplomatic and trade links were strengthened by Paul’s state visits abroad. He became the first Greek monarch to visit a Turkish Head of State. However, links with Britain became strained over Cyprus, where the majority Greek population favored union with the homeland, which Britain, as the colonial power, would not endorse. Eventually, Cyprus became an independent state in 1960.Van der Kiste, p.180In December 1959 Prince Maximillian of Bavaria presented the coronation regalia of King Otto of Greece to the King. It had been almost 100 years since they were last in Greece.Meanwhile, republican sentiment was growing in Greece. Both Paul and Frederika attracted criticism for their interference in politics,Woodhouse, C.M. Modern Greece: A Short History, Mackays of Chatham, Kent 1998, p.283, Clogg, Richard: A Concise History of Greece, Cambridge University Press, 1992, p.153 frequent foreign travels, and the cost of maintaining the royal family. Paul responded by economising and donated his private estate at Polidendri to the state.Van der Kiste, p.182–183In 1959 he had an operation for cataract, and in 1963 an emergency operation for appendicitis. In late February 1964 he underwent a further operation for stomach cancer, and died about a week later in Athens.Van der Kiste, p.183-184The Greek monarchy would only outlive him by nine years.AncestryReferences      Paul of Greece Paul of Greece Category:People from Athens Category:Greek monarchs Category:Greek princes Category:Danish princes Category:House of Glücksburg Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Bailiffs Grand Cross of the Order of St John Category:Order of George I Category:Orthodox monarchs Category:Burials at Tatoi Palace Royal Cemeterybg:Павлос I ca:Pau I de Grècia cs:Pavel I.
