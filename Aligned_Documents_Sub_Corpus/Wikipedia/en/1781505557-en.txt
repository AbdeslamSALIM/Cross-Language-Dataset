Biophysics (also biological physics) is an interdisciplinary science that employs and develops theories and methods of the physical sciences for the investigation of biological systems. Studies included under the umbrella of biophysics span all levels of biological organization, from the molecular scale to whole organisms and ecosystems. Biophysical research shares significant overlap with biochemistry, nanotechnology, bioengineering and systems biology.Molecular biophysics typically address biological questions that are similar to those in biochemistry and molecular biology, but the questions are approached quantitatively. Scientists in this field conduct research concerned with understanding the interactions between the various systems of a cell, including the interactions between DNA, RNA and protein biosynthesis, as well as how these interactions are regulated. A great variety of techniques are used to answer these questions.Fluorescent imaging techniques, as well as electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are often used to visualize structures of biological significance. Direct manipulation of molecules using optical tweezers or AFM can also be used to monitor biological events where forces and distances are at the nanoscale. Molecular biophysicists often consider complex biological events as systems of interacting units which can be understood through statistical mechanics, thermodynamics and chemical kinetics. By drawing knowledge and experimental techniques from a wide variety of disciplines, biophysicists are often able to directly observe, model or even manipulate the structures and interactions of individual molecules or complexes of molecules.In addition to traditional (i.e. molecular) biophysical topics like structural biology or enzyme kinetics, modern biophysics encompasses an extraordinarily broad range of research. It is becoming increasingly common for biophysicists to apply the models and experimental techniques derived from physics, as well as mathematics and statistics, to larger systems such as tissues, organs, populations and ecosystems.Focus as a subfieldBiophysics often does not have university-level departments of its own, but has presence as groups across departments within the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, medicine, pharmacology, physiology, physics, and neuroscience. What follows is a list of examples of how each department applies its efforts toward the study of biophysics. This list is hardly all inclusive. Nor does each subject of study belong exclusively to any particular department. Each academic institution makes its own rules and there is much overlap between departments.Biology and molecular biology - Almost all forms of biophysics efforts are included in some biology department somewhere. To include some: gene regulation, single protein dynamics, bioenergetics, patch clamping, biomechanics.Structural biology - Ångstrom-resolution structures of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, and complexes thereof.Biochemistry and chemistry - biomolecular structure, siRNA, nucleic acid structure, structure-activity relationships.Computer science - Neural networks, biomolecular and drug databases.Computational chemistry - molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking, quantum chemistryBioinformatics - sequence alignment, structural alignment, protein structure predictionMathematics - graph/network theory, population modeling, dynamical systems, phylogenetics.Medicine and neuroscience - tackling neural networks experimentally (brain slicing) as well as theoretically (computer models), membrane permitivity, gene therapy, understanding tumors.Pharmacology and physiology - channel biology, biomolecular interactions, cellular membranes, polyketides.Physics - biomolecular free energy, stochastic processes, covering dynamics.Many biophysical techniques are unique to this field. Research efforts in biophysics are often initiated by scientists who were traditional physicists, chemists, and biologists by training.Topics in biophysics and related fieldsAnimal locomotionBioacousticsBiochemical systems theoryBiofilmsBiological membranesBioenergeticsBiomechanicsBiomineralisationBionicsBiophotonicsBiosensor and BioelectronicsCell divisionCell membranesCell migrationCell signallingChannels, receptors and transportersCryobiologyDynamical systemsElectrophysiologyEnzyme kineticsEvolutionEvolutionarily stable strategyEvolutionary algorithmsEvolutionary computingEvolutionary theoryGame theoryGravitational biologyMathematical biologyMedical biophysicsMetabolic control analysisMicroscopyMolecular biophysicsMolecular motorsMorphogenesisMuscle and contractilityNegentropyNeural encodingNeuroimagingNucleic acidsOrigin of LifePhospholipidsProteinsPunctuated equilibriumRadiobiologySensory systemsSignalingSpectroscopy, imaging, etc.Supramolecular assembliesSystems biologySystems neuroscienceTensegrityTheoretical biologyFamous biophysicistsLuigi Galvani, discoverer of bioelectricityHermann von Helmholtz, first to measure the velocity of nerve impulses; studied hearing and visionAlan Hodgkin & Andrew Huxley, mathematical theory of how ion fluxes produce nerve impulsesGeorg von Békésy, research on the human earBernard Katz, discovered how synapses workHermann J.
