  Änglagård is a currently defunct Swedish progressive rock band, with influences including Cathedral, King Crimson, Genesis, Trettioåriga Kriget, Schicke Führs Fröhling & Van der Graaf Generator. The band was established in 1991 by Tord Lindman (guitars and vocals) and Johan Högberg (bass guitar), and broke up in 1994. They combined vintage analog sounds with a modern classical approach to composing and arranging. Hybris, the debut release, and the follow-on instrumental Epilog of 1994, were both voted "album of the year" in polls of progressive rock fans (http://rec.music.progressive). In 2003 the band briefly reformed (without founding member Lindman), performing new material at several performances, including NEARfest.MembersLast line-upJonas Engdegård &ndash; GuitarsThomas Johnson &ndash; Keyboards (including Mellotron, Hammond organs and Moogs)Anna Holmgren &ndash; FluteJohan Brand (born Högberg) &ndash; BassMattias Olsson &ndash; Drums and percussionPast membersTord Lindman &ndash; Guitars and vocalsDiscographyStudio albumsHybris (1992)Epilog (1994)Live albumsBuried Alive (1996)External linksUnofficial site containing a lot of informationPercussionist Mattias Olssons studio siteThieves' Kitchen - keyboard player Thomas Johnson's current band based in the UKAnglagard Anglagardit:Änglagård de:Änglagård es:Änglagård fr:Änglagård he:אנגלגארד nl:Änglagård pl:Änglagård ru:Änglagård fi:Änglagård sv:Änglagård (musikgrupp)
