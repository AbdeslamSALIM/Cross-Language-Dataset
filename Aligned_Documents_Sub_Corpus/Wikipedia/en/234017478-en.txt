EconomyThe economy is based on agriculture and tourism. Since the 1950s there has been a development in the cultivation of the Red onion of Tropea, nowadays appreciated both in the domestic and in the foreign markets.During the last 20 years, the export of this product, together with other commercial activities, has favoured the local economy. These activities are helped by the favourable position of the village, which is served by a railway line, by the SS18 road, by the A3 motorway (8 km) and by Lamezia Terme International Airport (25 km).GeographyCampora is situated on the Tyrrhenian coast, and since the 1950s it has grown on a small cliff plain dominating a flat area next to the beaches. The nearby hills are exploited for high quality production of wine and oil. The view from the hills spaces from the gulf of Lamezia Terme to the Stromboli volcano, whose smoke is visible on clear sunny days. The Aeolian Islands can be easily reached from Campora harbour.Historical buildingsA 14th century large tower is the only notable building. The upper part of the tower is decorated with corbels. This tower is nicknamed U Turriune in the local dialect. Recently, the harbour (2002) and Saint Francis of Paola square have been added. Francis of Paola is the local patron saint and is celebrated from September 1 to September 3. During the celebrations, which attract numerous pilgrims from the nearby villages, there is a procession where the statue of the saint is carried on the shoulders along the streets (sometimes accompanied by a cart decorated with flowers and ex-voto).HamletsThe territory of Campora San Giovanni is divided in the following hamlets:AuguratoCarratelliCologniCozzaCuccuvagliaFravitteGallo (southern part)ImbelliMaranoMarinellaMirabelliOlivaPiana CavalloPiana MauriPrincipessaRibesRubanoVillanovaLocal cuisineTypically of the Calabrian cuisine, it derives from the agricultural and fishing tradition.
