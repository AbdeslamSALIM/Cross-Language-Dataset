It was discovered by Fabian von Bellingshausen off West Antarctica on January 21 1821. It takes its name after the Russian emperor Peter I (the Great). Ola Olstad made the first successful landing on February 2 1929 and claimed the island for Norway. The other Antarctic territory claimed by Norway is Queen Maud Land. Peter I Island is the only Antarctic claim area under the Antarctic Treaty that is not a sector, and the only claim area in the otherwise unclaimed sector between 90°W and 150°W, just west of the Chilean Antarctic Claim.GeographyThe island has an area of 243 km² and reaches a height of 1755 metres on Lars Christensen Peak, which is a volcano. It is not known whether it is extinct or not, for the upper part is apparently unmodified by glaciation. It lies approximately 450 km north of Eights Coast. It is surrounded by pack ice except for a brief period in late summer, and is 95% glaciated.HistoryThe amateur radio prefix for the island is 3Y, and the island hosts an occasional DX-pedition. As one of the most difficult entities to contact for the popular DX Century Club award, these generate intense levels of traffic.See alsoSub-antarctic islandsList of islands of NorwayReferencesExternal links2006 Peter I Island amateur radio expedition (3YØX)1994 Peter I Island amateur radio expedition (3YØPI)1987 Peter I Island amateur radio expedition (3Y1EE, 3Y2GV) Category:Peter I Island Category:Volcanoes of Antarctica Category:Volcanoes of the Southern Ocean Category:Mountains of Antarctica Category:Shield volcanoesaf:Peter I-Eiland ca:Illa Pere I da:Peter I's Ø de:Peter-I.-Insel et:Peeter I saar el:Νησί του Πέτρου Α' es:Isla Pedro I fr:Île Pierre Ier id:Pulau Peter I it:Isola Pietro I he:פטר הראשון (אי) hu:I.
