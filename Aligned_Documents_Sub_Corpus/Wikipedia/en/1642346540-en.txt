Santo Stefano d'Aveto borders the following municipalities: Bedonia, Borzonasca, Ferriere, Rezzoaglio, Tornolo.GeographySanto Stefano d'Aveto is located about 75 km northeast of Genoa, in the Aveto Valley near the Aveto torrent. The town is part of the Mountain Community of the Aveto, Graveglia, and Sturla valleys, and together with another four Ligurian towns make up the Aveto Natural Regional Park.HistoryThe town was likely founded during prehistoric times, and the first mention of this town was during the 2nd century BC, where at the foot of Monte Penna the final battle between the Romans and Ligurians took place. In the 12th century, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa conferred the fief of Santo Stefano d'Aveto upon the Malaspina family, who then constructed the ponderous castle. The fief were then passed on to the Fieschi family and later to the Doria family, all related by an elaborate intermarriage network of noble families. Main sightsMalaspina Castle (13th century), currently in ruin, but undergoing limited restoration. The castle is located off the central piazza of the town, and features a highly irregular polygonal base.The sanctuary of the Madonna of Guadalupe is the town church, on the grounds of which is found the town cemetery. Among the relics it holds is a bronze medallion of Christopher Columbus mounted on the main door http://columbus.vanderkrogt.net/it/santostefanodaveto.html.

This cheese is a far cry from the mass-produced confections found in the grocery store. It is produced by a small collection of families, and made in the identical fashion for centurieshttp://www.montagna.org/node/4538. The cheese itself is produced from unpasteurized bovine whole milk principally from the Bruno-alpina or Cabannina cattle races, coagulated with veal rennet, either in paste or powder form, at about 35° Celsius, mixing for 35 minutes, breaking apart large curds until the mixture is curdled to the size of rice. Salt is also added to the curd.The mixture is then placed in a round form measuring 10 centimeters high and 13-15 centimeters in diameter. The cheese in this form weighs about 8-12 kilograms. The crust is thin, elastic, compact, and edible. Inside, the cheese has a yellowish color like wheat. After aging for about two months, the cheese is ready for the table, and provides a delicate flavor, slightly bitter, becoming more intense with greater aging.MushroomsMushrooms, gathered in the wild, are a very popular delicacy of the town. There exists a long-standing tradition among the men in the town to hunt and gather mushrooms, but to never reveal the source. This tradition, however, has received the attention of the government, and the gathering of mushrooms is now strictly regulated http://www.valdaveto.net/documento_284.html.TransportationSanto Stefano d'Aveto is served by Strada Provinciale 654 della Val di Nure (SP-654), which connects it to Rezzoaglio. The town is not directly reachable by autostrada, or major highway.Another prominent use of the local, winding roads is the Val d'Aveto Rally, featuring automobile races annually since 1975.The nearest train station to the North is located in Piacenza; the nearest train station to the south is located in Chiavari.
