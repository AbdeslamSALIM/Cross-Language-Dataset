Originally founded by the Greeks as Hyele in ancient Magna Graecia around 538&ndash;535 BC, it is best known as the home of the philosophers Parmenides and Zeno of Elea, as well as the Eleatic school of which they were a part. The site of the Acropolis of ancient Elea, once a promontory (castello a mare meaning castle on the sea) and now inland, was renamed in the Middle Ages Castellammare della Bruca.HistoryAccording to Herodotus: in 545 BC Ionian Greeks fled Phocaea, in modern Turkey, besieged by the Persians. After some wanderings (8 to 10 years) at sea, they stopped in Reggio Calabria where, probably, they were joined by Xenophanes who was at the time at Messina, and then moved North along the coast and founded the town of Hyele, later renamed Ele, and then, eventually, Elea. The location is nearly at the same latitude as Phocaea. (Cca. 1' 20" North) Elea was not conquered by the Lucanians, but eventually joined Rome in 273 BC and was included in ancient Lucania.Ruins of Velia[[Image:Velia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Porta Rosa]] , Italy. The Porta Rosa was the main street of Elea. It is paved with limestone blocks, with a gutter for the drainage of rain water.]] Remains of the city walls, with traces of one gate and several towers, of a total length of over three miles, still exist, and belong to three different periods, in all of which the crystalline limestone of the locality is used. Bricks were also employed in later times; their form is peculiar to this place, each having two rectangular channels on one side, and being about 1.5 in. square, with a thickness of nearly 4 in. They all bear Greek brick-stamps. There are some remains of cisterns on the site, and, various other traces of buildings.ReferencesExternal links Cilento National Park websiteCategory:Settlements established in the 6th century BC Category:Ancient Greek cities Category:Colonies of Magna Graecia Category:Phocaean colonies Category:Ionian colonies in Magna Graecia Category:Roman towns and cities in Magna Grecia Category:World Heritage Sites in Italy Category:Frazioni of the Province of Salerno Category:Cilento Category:Frazioni of Italyar:إيليا (مدينة) ca:Vèlia co:Elea de:Elea es:Velia eo:Elajo fr:Élée it:Elea-Velia hu:Velia nl:Elea no:Elaia pl:Velia ru:Элея sk:Elea sh:Velia (grad) fi:Elea sv:Elea
