 André Breton (in French ) (February 19, 1896 &ndash; September 28, 1966) was a French writer, poet, and surrealist theorist, and is best known as the main founder of surrealism. His writings include the Surrealist Manifesto of 1924, in which he defined surrealism as pure psychic automatism.BiographyBorn into modest origins in Tinchebray (Orne) in Normandy, he studied medicine and psychiatry. During World War I he worked in a neurological ward in Nantes, where he met the spiritual son of Alfred Jarry, Jacques Vaché, whose anti-social attitude and disdain for established artistic tradition influenced Breton considerably. Vaché committed suicide at age 24 and his war-time letters to Breton and others were published in a volume entitled Lettres de guerre (1919), for which Breton wrote four introductory essays.From Dada to Surrealism]] In 1919 Breton founded the review Littérature with Louis Aragon and Philippe Soupault. He also connected with Dadaist Tristan Tzara. In 1924 he was instrumental to the founding of the Bureau of Surrealist Research.In The Magnetic Fields (Les Champs Magnétiques), a collaboration with Soupault, he put the principle of automatic writing into practice. He published the Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, and was editor of La Révolution surréaliste from 1924. A group coalesced around him &mdash; Philippe Soupault, Louis Aragon, Paul Éluard, René Crevel, Michel Leiris, Benjamin Peret, Antonin Artaud, and Robert Desnos.Anxious to combine the themes of personal transformation found in the works of Arthur Rimbaud with the politics of Karl Marx, Breton joined the French Communist Party in 1927, from which he was expelled in 1933. During this time, he survived mostly off the sale of paintings from his art gallery.Under Breton's direction, surrealism became a European movement that influenced all domains of art, and called into question the origin of human understanding and human perceptions of things and events.In 1938 Breton accepted a cultural commission from the French government to travel to Mexico. After a conference held at the National Autonomous University of Mexico about surrealism, Breton stated after getting lost in Mexico City (as no one was waiting for him at the airport) "I don't know why I came here. Mexico is the most surrealist country in the world".However, visiting Mexico provided the opportunity to meet Trotsky. Breton and other surrealists sought refuge via a long boat ride from Patzcuaro to the surreal town of Erongaricuaro. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo were among the visitors to the hidden community of intellectuals and artists. Together, Breton and Trotsky wrote a manifesto Pour un art révolutionnaire indépendent (published under the names of Breton and Diego Rivera) which called for "complete freedom of art", which was becoming increasingly difficult in the world situation of the time.1940sBreton was again in the medical corp of the French Army at the start of World War II. The Vichy government banned his writings as "the very negation of the national revolution"Franklin Rosemont Andre Breton and the First Principles of Surrealism, 1978,ISBN 0-904383-39-X. and Breton sought refuge in the United States and the Caribbean in 1941. Breton made the acquaintance of Martinican writer Aimé Césaire, and later penned the introduction to the 1947 edition of Césaire's Cahier d'un retour au pays natal. During his exile in New York City, he met Elisa, the Chilean woman who would become his third wife.In 1944, he and Elisa traveled to Gaspésie in Québec, Canada, where he wrote Arcane 17, a book which expresses his fears of World War II, describes the marvels of the Rocher Percé and the northeastern end of North America, and celebrates his newly found love with Elisa.Later lifeBreton returned to Paris in 1946, where he intervened against French colonialism (for example as a signatory of the Manifesto of the 121 against the Algerian war) and continued, until his death, to foster a second group of surrealists in the form of expositions or reviews (La Brèche, 1961-1965). In 1959, Andre Breton organized an exhibit in Paris.André Breton died in 1966 at 70 and was buried in the Cimetière des Batignolles in Paris.WorksHis works include the case studies Nadja (1928) and Mad Love (L'Amour Fou) (1937).Selected works:MONT DE PIÉTE, 1919LES CHAMPS MAGNÉTIQUES, 1920 - The Magnetic FieldsMANIFESTE DU SURRÉALISME, 1924 - The Surrealist ManifestoLES PAS PERDUS, 1924 - The Lost StepsPOISSON SOLUBLE, 1924 - Soluble FishUN CADAVRE, 1924 - A CorpseLEGITIME DÉFENSE, 1926 - Legitimate DefenseLE SURRÉALISME ET LE PEINTURE, 1926 - Surrealism and PaintingNADJA, 1928 - NadjaL'IMMACULÉE CONCEPTION, 1930 - The Immaculate ConceptionSECOND MANIFESTE DU SURRÉALISME, 1930 - The Second Manifesto of SurrealismRALENTIR TRAVAUX, 1930 - Slow Down WorksLA RÉVOLVER Á CHEVEUX BLANCS, 1932 - The Revolver Has White HairLES VASES COMMUNICANTS, 1932 - The Communicating VesselsLE MESSAGE AUTOMATIQUE; 1933 - The Automatic MessageQU'EST-CE LE QUE LE SURRÉALISME,1934 - What Is SurrealismL'AIR ET L'EAU, 1934 - The Air and The WaterPOINT DU JOUR, 1934 - Not of the DayPOSITION POLITIQUE DU SURRÉALISME, 1935 - The Political Position of SurrealismNOTES SUR LA POÉSIE, 1936 (with Paul Éluard) - Notes on PoetryL'AMOUR FOU, 1937 - Mad LoveEARTHLIGHT, 1937DICTIONNAIRE ABRÉGE DU SURRÉALISME, 1938 (with Paul Éluard) - Abridged Dictionary of SurrealismFATA MORGANA, 1940ANTHOLOGIE DE L'HUMOUR NOIR, 1940 - Anthology of Black HumorARCANE 17, 1945 - Arcane 17JEUNES CERISIERS GARANTIS CONTRE LES LIÈVRES, 1946 - Young Cherry Trees Secured against HaresODE À CHARLES FOURIER, 1947 - Ode to Charles FourierYVES TANGUY, 1947POÈMES 1919-48, 1948LA LAMPE DANS L'HORLOGE, 1948 - The Lamp in the ClockMARTINIQUE, CHARMEISE DE SERPENTS, 1948ENTRETIENS, 1952 - DiscussionsLA CLÉ DES CHAMPS, 1953 - The Key of the FieldsFAROUCHE À QUATRE FEUILLES, 1954 (with Lise Deharme, Julien Gracq, Jean Tardieu) - Wild to Four LeavesLES MANIFESTES DU SURREALISME, 1955 - The Manifestoes of SurrealismL'ART MAGIQUE, 1957 - The Magic ArtCONSTELLATIONS, 195* LE LA, 1961SELECTED POEMS, 1969PERSPECTIVE CAVALIÈRE, 1970WHAT IS SURREALISM?

He was particularly interested in materials from the northwest coast of North America. When faced with a financial crisis in 1931, most of his collection (along with his friend Paul Eluard's) was auctioned off. He subsequently rebuilt the collection, which was preserved by family members from the time of his death until 2003, at which time his books, art, and ethnographic materials were auctioned by Calmels Cohen.ReferencesAndré Breton: Surrealism and Painting - edited and with an introduction by Mark Polizzotti.Manifestoes of Surrealism by André Breton, translated by Richard Seaver and Helen R.
