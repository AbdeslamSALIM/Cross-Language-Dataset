The county was formed on 1 April, 1970, comprising the former counties of Odense and Svendborg. The county was abolished effective January 1, 2007, when it merged into Region Syddanmark (i.e. Region South Denmark).The county employed around 20,000 people working in more than 160 institutions located all over Funen.InsigniaFunen County's coat of arms showed three connected gold hop leaves on a field of red, representing three former counties of Odense, Svendborg and Assens. The choice of hop leaves comes from Funen native Hans Christian Andersen's song "I Danmark er jeg født" ("In Denmark I was born"), where he refers to Funen as "Æblegård og humlehave" (Apple farm and hop garden).For common daily usage, a more modern and IT-friendly version was used. In this version, the background was green and the hop leaves white and much less detailed. Alternate versions had a red or, on occasion, a black background.The coat of arms was registered in 1976.List of County MayorsFromToCounty MayorApril 1, 19701974Social Liberal]])19741993Social Democrat]])19932001Social Liberal]])20012005Conservative]])January 2, 2006December 31, 2006Venstre]])Municipalities (1970-2006)Municipal reform in 2006/2007On 1 January 2007, The Danish Municipal Reform replaced the traditional counties with five new regions and cut the number of municipalities to 98.
