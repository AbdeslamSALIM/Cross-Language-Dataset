         Yuriy Mikhailovich Borzakovskiy (, born 12 April, 1981) is a Russian middle distance athlete specializing in the 800 metres.Early lifeBorzakovskiy was born at Kratovo, in the Moscow oblast.Athletic careerBorzakovskiy's first major international success was a victory at the 2000 European Indoor Championships when he was only 18 years old. At the 2000 Summer Olympics he reached the 800m final, in which he made a tactical error and finished only sixth. In 2001 he won the World Indoor title over 800&nbsp;m but decided not to participate in the World Championships in Edmonton. On August 24th 2001, Borzakovskiy posted a time of 1:42.47 minutes. That currently stands as the 6th fastest time in history over that distance. In addition, Borzakovskiy was ranked No.1 in the world in that year. In 2002, Borzakovskiy ran the 400&nbsp;m at the European Championships in Munich but lost in the early stages. The following season he picked up a silver medal over 800&nbsp;m at the World Championships in Paris.Borzakovskiy's greatest achievement was his victory in the 800&nbsp;m race at the Athens Olympics in 2004. By this point, he was well known for sitting back until about the last 200 metres and then using a great kick to catch up and win, reminiscent of the tactics of Great Britain's Steve Cram. At the Olympics he employed the same strategy, using this 'late charge' to come from behind in the last 150 meters to pass Wilson Kipketer, who was leading with only 20 metres to go, and take the victory.In the 2005 World Championships he took silver in the 800&nbsp;m competition, overtaking everyone but Bahrain's Rashid Ramzi on the final straight. At the 2006 World Indoor Championships he won a bronze medal. Borzakovskiy won a bronze medal at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka. The final ran at a very slow pace and he was boxed in on the final lap which slowed down his sprint in the last 100m.In 2008 he made an impressive comeback by posting a time of 1:42.79 minutes, his first time under 1:43 since 2001. He made the Olympic team at the Beijing Olympics but unexpectedly failed to qualify for the 800&nbsp;m final finishing only third in his semifinal heat.External links    André Bucher|title=Men's 800 metres Best Year Performance|years=2001|after= Wilson Kipketer    Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Russian athletes Category:Middle distance runners Category:Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Russia Category:Olympic gold medalists for Russia da:Jurij Borzakovskij de:Juri Michailowitsch Borsakowski et:Juri Borzakovski es:Yuri Borzakovski fr:Yuriy Borzakovskiy it:Jurij Michajlovič Borzakovskij nl:Joeri Borzakovski ja:ユーリー・ボルザコフスキー no:Jurij Borzakovskij pl:Jurij Borżakowski ru:Борзаковский, Юрий Михайлович fi:Juri Borzakovski sv:Jurij Borzakovskij zh:尤里·博尔扎科夫斯基
