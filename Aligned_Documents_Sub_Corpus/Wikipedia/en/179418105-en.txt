This opening is uncommon at the top level of over the board play, but in correspondence chess some players are devoted to it.Latvian Gambit analyzed by correspondence chess players, Wikichess.It was formerly known as the Greco Counter Gambit. The original name commemorated the Italian player Gioachino Greco (1600-1634), who contributed to the early theory. The new name 'Latvian Gambit' was made official by the FIDE Congress of 1937. The name was a tribute to the Latvian players, notably Karlis Betins, who analyzed it in the early part of the 20th century. The opening is characterized by the following moves which give it the appearance of a King's Gambit with the colours reversed.1. e4 e52.
