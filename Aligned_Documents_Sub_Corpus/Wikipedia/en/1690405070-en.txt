The footballers won the East Bavarian championship just three years later in 1933, but then afterwards toiled in anonymity in the local lower level leagues until 1993 when they won the Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V) title, followed by the Oberliga Bayern (IV) championship two years later, which advanced the club to the Regionalliga Süd (III). In 2002-03, the team played its way into the Second Bundesliga where they competed until being relegated at the end of the 2006-07 campaign.Wacker earned a seventh place finish in the Regionalliga in 2007-08, which qualifies the team for the new 3rd Liga next season.Reserve teamThe Wacker Burghausen II team played in the Bayernliga (IV) from 2005 to 2007, making Burghausen one of the few clubs to have had both first and second teams play at this level. The reserve team finished 6th in the Landesliga Süd (V) in the 2007-08 season and will remain in this league for the coming season.Recent seasonsWacker BurghausenYearDivisionPosition1999-2000Regionalliga Süd (III)4th2000-01Regionalliga Süd13th2001-02Regionalliga Süd1st ↑2002-032nd Bundesliga (II)10th2003-042nd Bundesliga10th2004-052nd Bundesliga9th2005-062nd Bundesliga8th2006-072nd Bundesliga17th ↓2007-08Regionalliga Süd (III)7th ↑2008-093rd Liga (III)Wacker Burghausen IIYearDivisionPosition1999-2000Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern (VI)5th2000-01Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern2nd ↑2001-02Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V)13th2002-03Landesliga Bayern-Süd10th2003-04Landesliga Bayern-Süd3rd2004-05Landesliga Bayern-Süd1st ↑2005-06Oberliga Bayern (IV)13th2006-07Oberliga Bayern18th ↓2007-08Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V)6th2008-09Landesliga Bayern-Süd (VI)HonoursRegionalliga Süd (III) champions: 2002Oberliga Bayern champions (IV): 1995Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V) champions: 1993Retired numbers11  Marek Krejčí, FW, 2004-2007Current squadAs of 21 July, 2008                             For recent transfers, see List of German football transfers summer 2008.External linksOfficial team website (football)Official team website (general)The Abseits Guide to German Soccereufo.de European club profileshttp://www.wackerfans.de Fansite    Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1930Category:German football clubs Category:Bavarian football clubs Category:SV Wacker Burghausenaf:SV Wacker Burghausen bar:SV Wagga Burghausen de:Wacker Burghausen es:SV Wacker Burghausen fr:SV Wacker Burghausen it:Wacker Burghausen hu:SV Wacker Burghausen nl:SV Wacker Burghausen ja:SVヴァッカー・ブルクハウゼン no:SV Wacker Burghausen pl:SV Wacker Burghausen sv:SV Wacker Burghausen zh:布格豪森足球俱乐部
