There are two major dialects: Rälik (western) and Ratak (eastern).SoundsConsonantsMarshallese has 22 consonants (five of which are written with digraphs), plus a supplementary velar central approximant consonant (often not written in the current orthography):PrimaryBilabialDentalPalatalVelarSecondarypal.]]vel.]]pal.]]vel.]]pal.]]plainlab.]]Nasal]]m m̧ n ņ ņw &nbsp;n̄ n̄w Plosive]]p b j t &nbsp;&nbsp;k kw Rhotic]]&nbsp;r d dw &nbsp;&nbsp;Approximant&nbsp;l ļ ļw y h or  w Marshallese has a number of consonants with contrasting secondary articulations:palatalized consonantsvelarized consonantslabialized-velarized consonantsThe velarized bilabial stop is phonetically voiced.VowelsMarshallese has four vowel phonemes each with several allophones:Marshallese vowelSimple realisationsMain orthographiesheightphonemeunroundedroundedunroundedroundedfrontbackfrontbackHigh(close)/ɨ/iɯuiUpper Mid(near-close)/ɘ/ɪɤ(long)ʊi (or )oū (or )Lower Mid(open-mid)/ɜ/eʌ(short)oeo̧ (or )ō (or )Low(open)/ɐ/ɛɑɔā (or )Marshallese vowels are not specified along the front-back and rounded-unrounded dimensions, but on the height and ATR dimensions (see the IPA classification of vowels in the table on the right). This means that a given vowel phoneme will have several different phonetic realizations.For example, the high vowel phoneme  may alternately be pronounced as , , , , , , , , , depending on the context:Specifically, vowels next to palatized consonants become front unrounded (, , , ),vowels next to velarized consonants become back unrounded (, , , ),and vowels next to labialized consonants become back rounded (, , , ).When between two consonants of different types (e.g., a velarized consonant and a labialized consonant), the vowels become diphthongs, beginning with the surface form found next to the preceding consonant, and ending with the surface form found next to the following consonant (e.g., in the case of a vowel between a velarized and labialized consonant, the diphthongs would be , , , :Consonantssecondaryarticulations(m,p,n,j,r,l,y)(m̧,b,ņ,t,d,ļ,h)(ņw,dw,ļw,n̄w,kw,w)/Cʲ_Cˠ//Cˠ_Cʲ//Cˠ_Cˠʷ//Cˠʷ_Cˠ//Cʲ_Cˠʷ//Cˠʷ_Cʲ/Vowelrealisationfrontunroundedbackunroundedbackroundedfront and backunroundedbackrounded and unroundedcomplexPhonemesimple vowel allophonesdiphthong allophones (close)iɯui͡ɯɯ͡iɯ͡uu͡ɯi͡uu͡i (near-close)ɪɤʊɪ͡ɤɤ͡ɪɤ͡ʊʊ͡ɤɪ͡ʊʊ͡ɪ (open-mid)eʌoe͡ʌʌ͡eʌ͡oo͡ʌe͡oo͡e (open)ɛɑɔɛ͡ɑɑ͡ɛɑ͡ɔɔ͡ɑɛ͡ɔɔ͡ɛSyllable and phonotacticsStressOrthographyMarshallese underwent a change of orthography in recent times. However, most people still use the old orthography. It is written in a form of the Latin alphabet with unusual diacritic combinations. There are different alphabetic systems in use by Marshallese speakers depending on religious affiliation, due to many schools being run by church groups. Each teacher uses his/her preferred method of teaching language. As a result, children who attend Catholic schools tend to use the same spellings because the teachers are trained by a small group of Maryknoll Sisters. Students in public schools vary their spelling from island to island, based upon what their teachers learned about language and spelling.Here is the (current) alphabet (note that letters with a macron are usually represented with a tilde in printed texts, eg, ō becomes õ):Base letterPhonology&nbsp;Letter with cedillaPhonology&nbsp;Letter with macronPhonologyaA/ɐ/ ɛ/ɐ/ ɑ&nbsp;ā (or )Ā (or )/ɐ/ ɔbB/bˠ/&nbsp;&nbsp;dD/r̪ˠ/&nbsp;&nbsp;eE/ɜ/ e&nbsp;&nbsp;iI/ɨ/ i/ɘ/ ɪ&nbsp;&nbsp;j (or )J (or )/j/ ʒ/j/ j&nbsp;&nbsp;kK/k/&nbsp;&nbsp;lL/l̪ʲ/ļ (or )Ļ (or )/l̪ˠ/&nbsp;mM/mʲ/m̧ (or )M̧ (or )/mˠ/&nbsp;nN/n̪ʲ/ņ (or )Ņ (or )/n̪ˠ/n̄ (or  or )N̄ (or  or )/ŋ/oO/ɘ/ ɤ (long)o̧ (or )O̧ (or )/ɜ/ ʌ (short)ō (or )Ō (or )/ɜ/ opP/pʲ/&nbsp;&nbsp;rR/r̪ʲ/&nbsp;&nbsp;tT/t̪ˠ/&nbsp;&nbsp;uU/ɨ/ ɯ/ɨ/ u&nbsp;ū (or )Ū (or )/ɘ/ ʊwW/w//ˠʷ/&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, the unusual combinations of letters with combining macrons are replaced by vowels with diaeresis and by  (or by an  letter), and the combining cedilla is replaced by , or underlined letters (or letters with combining macron below).Finally, the velar approximant  may be seen written as h/H or  (adding one more letter to the alphabet). And some orthographies make distinctions between allophones of the same palatal central approximant  phoneme, i.e. between j/J  and y/Y  (adding another letter to the alphabet).Grammar One Marshallese word is , which means both hello and good-bye. It also means love. The literal (although outdated) translation means "you are a rainbow." It is also used as a term to show sympathy. (Compare Hawaiian .) This word may also be written  and .Cardinal NumbersThis includes the cardinal numbers one through ten in the Rälik dialect.

Not only are there multiple orthographies in common use, but spelling is inconsistent within an orthography. For example,  (no or not) is sometimes spelled  and  is sometimes spelled .Text examplesModern orthographyHere is the Hail Mary in Marshallese Unicode.
