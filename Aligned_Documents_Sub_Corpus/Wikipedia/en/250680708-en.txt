.]]on a rock outside the Potala Palace in Tibet.]] Om mani padme humPronunciation of the mantra as chanted by a Tibetan refugee: Wave Format and Real Audio Format.  (Derived from the Sanskrit, Devanagari ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ, IAST ) is probably the most famous mantra in Buddhism, the six syllabled mantra of the bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteshvara (Tibetan Chenrezig, Chinese Guanyin). The mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteshvara.The Dalai Lama is said to be an incarnation of Chenrezig or Avalokiteshvara, so the mantra is especially revered by his devotees and it is commonly carved onto rocks and written on paper which is then inserted into prayer wheels to increase its effects.Transliterations]] In English the mantra is variously transliterated, depending on the schools of Buddhism as well as individual teachers.Possible spellings and their romanizations include:Tibetan: ཨོཾ་མ་ཎི་པ་དྨེ་ཧཱུྃ་ Om Mani Peme Hung [or Hum]Devanagari: ॐ मणि पद्मे हूँ; IAST: Chinese 唵嘛呢叭咪吽, pinyin Ǎn Mání Bāmī Hōng (due to changes over time in pronunciation, this transcription has been adopted in favor of the transliteration found in the Karandavyuha Sutra, 唵麼抳缽訥銘吽 Ǎn Mání Bōnàmíng hōng)Korean Hangul 옴 마니 파드메 훔 Om Mani Padeume Hum or 옴 마니 반메 훔 Om Mani Banme HumJapanese Katakana オンマニハツメイウン On Mani Hatsumei UnMongolian: Ум маани бадми хум or Um maani badmi khumVietnamese: Úm ma ni bát ni hồng or Án ma ni bát mê hồngMeaningMantras may be interpreted by practitioners in many ways, or even as mere sequences of sound whose effects lie beyond strict meaning.The middle part of the mantra, , is often interpreted as "jewel in the lotus," Sanskrit  "jewel, gem, cintamani" and the locative of  "lotus", but according to Donald Lopez it is much more likely that  is in fact a vocative, not a locative, addressing a bodhisattva called , "Jewel-Lotus"- an alternate epithet of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.Lopez, 331; the vocative would have to be feminine The  is straightforward as the sacred syllable prefixed to many mantras, and the  is an exclamation or interjection frequently employed in mantras.Lopez also notes that the majority of Tibetan Buddhist texts have regarded the translation of the mantra as secondary, focusing instead on the correspondence of the six syllables of the mantra to various other groupings of six in the Buddhist tradition.Lopez, 130 For example, in the Chenrezig Saddhana, Tsangsar Tulku Rinpoche expands upon the mantra's meaning, taking its six syllables to represent the purification of the six realms of existence:Tsangsar Tulku Rinpoche, Chenrezig sadhanaSyllableSix ParamitasPurifiesSamsaric realm]]ColoursSymbol of the Deity(Wish them) To be born inOm]]MeditationPride / BlissDevas]]WhiteWisdomPerfect Realm of PotalaMaPatienceJealousy / Lust for entertainmentAsuras]]GreenCompassionPerfect Realm of PotalaNiDisciplinePassion / desireHumans]]YellowBody, speech, mindquality and activityDewachenPadWisdomIgnorance / prejudiceAnimals]]BlueEquanimityin presence of Protector (Chenrezig)MeGenerosityPoverty / possessivenessPretas (hungry ghosts)]]RedBlissPerfect Realm of PotalaHumDiligenceAggression / hatredNaraka]]BlackQuality of Compassionin presence of the Lotus Throne (of Chenrezig)Karandavyuha Sutra definitionThe first known description of the mantra appears in the Karandavyuha Sutra (Chinese: 佛說大乘莊嚴寶王經 (Taisho Tripitaka 1050) &lt;/ref&gt;; English: Buddha speaks Mahayana Sublime Treasure King Sutra), which is part of certain Mahayana canons such as the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]].  In this sutra, [[Shakyamuni Buddha]] states, &quot;This is the most beneficial mantra. Even I made this aspiration to all the million Buddhas and subsequently received this teaching from Buddha Amitabha.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khandro.net/practice_mantra.htm Khandro.net: Mantras]&lt;/ref&gt;H.H. the 14th Dalai Lama's definition"It is very good to recite the mantra Om mani padme hum, but while you are doing it, you should be thinking on its meaning, for the meaning of the six syllables is great and vast... The first, Om ... symbolizes the practitioner's impure body, speech, and mind; it also symbolizes the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha...""The path is indicated by the next four syllables. Mani, meaning jewel, symbolizes the factors of method: (the) altruistic intention to become enlightened, compassion, and love....""The two syllables, padme, meaning lotus, symbolize wisdom...""Purity must be achieved by an indivisible unity of method and wisdom, symbolized by the final syllable hum, which indicates indivisibility...""Thus the six syllables, om mani padme hum, mean that in dependence on the practice of a path which is an indivisible union of method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech, and mind into the pure exalted body, speech, and mind of a Buddha..."-- H.H. Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama, "Om Mani Padme Hum"Gyatso, Tenzin. Om Mani Padme HumGen Rinpoche's definition"The mantra Om Mani Päme Hum is easy to say yet quite powerful, because it contains the essence of the entire teaching. When you say the first syllable Om it is blessed to help you achieve perfection in the practice of generosity, Ma helps perfect the practice of pure ethics, and Ni helps achieve perfection in the practice of tolerance and patience. Pä, the fourth syllable, helps to achieve perfection of perseverance, Me helps achieve perfection in the practice of concentration, and the final sixth syllable Hum helps achieve perfection in the practice of wisdom."So in this way recitation of the mantra helps achieve perfection in the six practices from generosity to wisdom. The path of these six perfections is the path walked by all the Buddhas of the three times. What could then be more meaningful than to say the mantra and accomplish the six perfections?"&mdash; Gen Rinpoche, Heart Treasure of the Enlightened OnesGen Rinpoche, Heart Treasure of the Enlightened Ones. ISBN 0-87773-493-3Karma Thubten Trinley's definition"These are the six syllables which prevent rebirth into the six realms of cyclic existence. It translates literally as 'OM the jewel in the lotus HUM'. OM prevents rebirth in the god realm, MA prevents rebirth in the Asura (Titan) Realm, NI prevents rebirth in the Human realm, PA prevents rebirth in the Animal realm, ME prevents rebirth in the Hungry ghost realm, and HUM prevents rebirth in the Hell realm." &mdash;Karma Thubten TrinleyUsage in Japanese Shingon BuddhismThe Six-Syllable Mantra is also a popular mantra for use in Japanese Shingon, or esoteric, Buddhism. The Shingon monk, Myoe, used this mantra as part of his daily regimen for himself and his disciples at Kozanji monastery. Historical records show that monks often chanted this along with the Mantra of Light.VariationAs Bucknell, et. al (1986: p.15) opine, the complete Avalokiteshvara Mantra includes a final Hrīh (hrih, pronounced "heRee"), which is iconographically depicted in the central space of the syllabic mandala as seen in the ceiling decoration of the Potala Palace.AuthenticationAs mentioned above, the mantra is originated from Karandavyuha Sutra in Chinese Buddhist canon. However, some other buddhist scholars argue that the mantra practiced in Tibetan buddhism has been based on the Sadhanamala published in the twelveth century BibliographyTeachings from the Mani retreat, Chenrezig Institute, December 2000 (2001) by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, ISBN-13: 978-1891868108, Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive downloadableBucknell, Roderick & Stuart-Fox, Martin (1986).
