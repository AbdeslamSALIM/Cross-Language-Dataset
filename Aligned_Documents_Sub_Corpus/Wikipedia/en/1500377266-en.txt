Retrieved on 22 April 2007.O'Sullivan's father, Ronald John O'Sullivan, who owns a chain of Soho sex shops, is serving a life sentence for murder on the Isle of Sheppey, having been convicted in 1992 of murdering the bodyguard of Charlie Kray, brother of the Kray twins, the previous year. The trial judge gave a recommendation that he serve 18 years due to a claimed racial element to the killing, something he denied. The elder O'Sullivan had been in a Chelsea nightclub, and according to police embarked on an unprovoked attack during which he stabbed Kray's bodyguard and his brother. In recent years, his family has claimed he acted in self-defence, but at his trial he had claimed not to have been there at all. A 2003 sentence review accepted that Ronald is not, and was not, racist, but found that the murder was a particularly vicious one and kept the 18-year term unchanged. Ronald stabbed the victim and his injured brother a considerable number of times with a knife that the prosecution stated he had brought along with him to the club. Ronnie claimed in his autobiography that his father picked up the knife from the side of the bar in the club during the course of a row over a drinks bill so as to defend himself. In 1996, O'Sullivan's Sicilian mother, Maria Antoinetta O’Sullivan, served seven months of a year-long jail sentence for tax evasion."Snooker ace’s mum drops her bid to open sex shop", Camden New Journal, 19 February 2004.
