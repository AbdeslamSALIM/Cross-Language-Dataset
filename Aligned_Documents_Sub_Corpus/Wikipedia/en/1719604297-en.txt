(EP),  (BP); abbreviated to CPLP) is the intergovernmental organization for friendship among lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) nations where Portuguese is an official language. The Portuguese-speaking countries are home to more than 223 million people located across the globe. The CPLP nations have a combined area of about .The formation and member statesThe CPLP was formed in 1996 with seven countries: Portugal, Brazil, a former colony in South America, and five former colonies in Africa — Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and São Tomé and Príncipe. East Timor joined the community in 2002 after gaining independence.The CPLP is a bloc in the process of construction and the societies of the eight member nations have little knowledge of each other. One of the unique features of the CPLP is that its members are linked by a common language and shared cultural features, which form a bridge among countries separated by great distances and on different continents.In 2005, during a meeting in Luanda, the ministers of culture of the eight countries declared the May 5 as the Lusophone Culture Day (Dia da Cultura Lusófona in Portuguese).In July 2006, during the Bissau summit, Equatorial Guinea and Mauritius were admitted as Associate ObserversCPLP Associate Observers in CPLP Official website along with 17 International associations and organizations considered as Consultative Observers. In 2008, Senegal was admitted as Associate Observer.MembersCountryStatusYear joinedOfficial languageContinentPopulationmember1996Portuguese]]Europe10,584,344member1996Portuguese]]South America186,757,608member1996Portuguese]]Africa15,941,000member1996Portuguese]]Africa21,397,000member1996Portuguese]]Africa499,796member1996Portuguese]]Africa1,586,000member1996Portuguese]]Africa157,000member2002Portuguese]] and TetumAsia1,115,000associate member2006Portuguese]], Spanish and FrenchAfrica1,014,999associate member2006English]]Africa1,264,866associate member2008French]]Africa11,658,000Officially interested countries and regionsCountry/RegionInterested StatusOfficial languageContinentPopulationReferencePossible date of discussionassociate memberCatalan]]Europe71,822http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:cfV5KGWiv8sJ:www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/Print.aspx%3Fguid%3D%257BE2D69151-3BA0-4340-A9FE-55413C2530C7%257D+Andorra+Marrocos+Macau+Filipinas+CPLP&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;gl=ptAngola Luandaassociate memberArabic]]Africa33,757,175http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:cfV5KGWiv8sJ:www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/Print.aspx%3Fguid%3D%257BE2D69151-3BA0-4340-A9FE-55413C2530C7%257D+Andorra+Marrocos+Macau+Filipinas+CPLP&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;gl=ptAngola Luandaassociate memberFilipino]] and EnglishAsia90,500,000http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:cfV5KGWiv8sJ:www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/Print.aspx%3Fguid%3D%257BE2D69151-3BA0-4340-A9FE-55413C2530C7%257D+Andorra+Marrocos+Macau+Filipinas+CPLP&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;gl=ptAngola LuandaGalicia Galiciaassociate memberGalician]] and SpanishEurope2,783,100http://noticias.sapo.pt/lusa/artigo/540e9ba4b19eb7b555b54b.htmlPending Spanish Government approvalmemberPortuguese]], Chinese (Cantonese)Asia520,400http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:cfV5KGWiv8sJ:www.portugal.gov.pt/Portal/Print.aspx%3Fguid%3D%257BE2D69151-3BA0-4340-A9FE-55413C2530C7%257D+Andorra+Marrocos+Macau+Filipinas+CPLP&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=5&amp;gl=ptPending Chinese Government approvalMalacca Malaccaassociate memberMalay]]Asia733,000http://noticias.sapo.pt/lusa/artigo/540e9ba4b19eb7b555b54b.htmlPending Malaysian Government approvalIndia Goaassociate memberKonkani]]Asia1,400,000http://noticias.sapo.pt/lusa/artigo/540e9ba4b19eb7b555b54b.htmlPending Indian Government approvalassociate memberCroatian]]Europe4,453,500http://dn.sapo.pt/2008/07/16/nacional/venezuela_ucrania_e_croacia_querem_d.html2012 - IX CPLP Summitassociate memberRomanian]]Europe22,246,862http://dn.sapo.pt/2008/07/16/nacional/venezuela_ucrania_e_croacia_querem_d.html2012 - IX CPLP Summitassociate memberUkranian]]Europe46,372,700http://dn.sapo.pt/2008/07/16/nacional/venezuela_ucrania_e_croacia_querem_d.html2012 - IX CPLP SummitWhen the CPLP was formed, Equatorial Guinea asked for observer status. Equatorial Guinea was a Portuguese colony from the 15th to 18th centuries and has some territories where Portuguese-based creole languages are spoken and cultural connections with São Tomé and Príncipe and Portugal are felt. Also, the country has recently cooperated with Portuguese-speaking African countries and Brazil at an educational level. At the CPLP summit of July 2004, in São Tomé and Príncipe, the member states agreed to change the statutes of the community to accept states as associate observers. Equatorial Guinea is in discussion for full membership.http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/6459784.html&lt;/ref&gt;Mauritius, which was unknown to Europeans until the Portuguese sailed there and has strong connections with Mozambique, also obtained associate observer status in 2006.SummitsSummitCountryCityYearI CPLP SummitLisbon1996II CPLP SummitPraia1998III CPLP SummitMaputo2000IV CPLP SummitBrasilia2002V CPLP SummitSão Tomé2004VI CPLP SummitBissau2006VII CPLP SummitLisbon2008VIII CPLP SummitLuanda2010The importance of the CPLPcountries.]] The Portuguese-speaking countries are home to more than 223 million people located across the globe but having cultural similarities and a shared history. The CPLP nations have a combined area of about , which is larger than Canada.Since its formation, the CPLP has helped to solve problems in São Tomé and Príncipe and in Guinea-Bissau, because of coups d'etat in those countries. These two problems were solved, and in fact, have helped these two countries to take economic reforms (in the case of São Tomé) and democratic ones (in the case of Guinea-Bissau).The leaders of the CPLP believe that peace in Angola and Mozambique as well as East Timor's independence will favour the further development of the CPLP and a strengthening of multilateral cooperation.Since many children in rural areas of Lusophone Africa and East Timor are out-of-school youth, the education officials in these regions seek help from Portugal and Brazil to increase the education to spread Portuguese fluency (like establishing Instituto Camões language center branches in main cities and rural towns), as Portuguese is becoming one of the main languages in Southern Africa, where it is also taught in Namibia and South Africa.In many developing Portuguese-speaking nations, Portuguese is the language of government and commerce which means that Portuguese speaking people from African nations can work and communicate with others in different parts of the world, especially in Portugal and Brazil, where the economies are stronger. Many leaders of Portuguese-speaking nations in Africa are fearful that language standards do not meet the fluency required and are therefore making it compulsory in schools so that a higher degree of fluency is achieved and young Africans will be able to speak a world language that will help them later in life.The CPLP SystemThe Organization’s Executive Secretariat is responsible for designing and implementing the CPLP's projects and initiatives. It is located in Lisbon, Portugal. The Executive Secretary has a two-year mandate, and can be re-elected only once.The CPLP's guidelines and priorities are established by biannual Conference of Heads of State and the Organization’s plan of action is approved by the Council of Foreign Ministers, which meets every year.There are also monthly meetings of the Permanent Steering Committee that follow specific initiatives and projects.The CPLP is mainly financed by its eight member states.The CPLP flag has now eight wings, not seven, to reflect East Timor's membership.Executive SecretariesNameTook OfficeLeft OfficeCountryMarcolino Moco17 July 1996July 2000AngolaDulce Maria PereiraJuly 20001 August 2002BrazilJoão Augusto de Médicis1 August 2002April 2004BrazilZeferino Martins (Interim)April 2004July 2004MozambiqueLuís de Matos Monteiro da FonsecaJuly 2004PresentCape VerdeMain initiativesCPLP's HIV-Aids Programme &ndash; designed to help the 5 African member statesCentre for the Development of Entrepreneurial Skills &ndash; being established in Luanda, AngolaCentre for the Development of Public Administration &ndash; being established in Maputo, MozambiqueCentre for East-Timorese Official LanguagesConference on Malaria &ndash; to be held in São Tomé and PríncipePortuguese Language CensusDigital School and UniversityElectoral Mission to Guinea-Bissau (East Timor’s President, the Nobel Prize laureate, José Ramos-Horta is CPLP's Representative to the Electoral Process)Emergency Project for the Support of Institution Rebuilding in Guinea-BissauRebuilding East Timor’s Justice and Public AdministrationCombating Poverty and Starvation"Felino" manoeuvres - annual combined manoeuvres of the Armed Forces of CPLP's countriesThe CPLP Movie festivalReferencesSee alsoLusophone musicCPLP GamesLusophony GamesTV CPLPFlag of the Community of Portuguese Language CountriesLusitanicFrancophonieCommonwealth of NationsLatin UnionPortuguese EmpireGeographic distribution of the Portuguese languagePortuguese-speaking African countries (PALOP)List of countries where Portuguese is an official languageCommonwealth of Independent StatesExternal links Official site of the CPLPEquatorial Guinea makes Portuguese an official language, and applies for membership of CPLP, Yahoo News 2007-07-13 Seminário da CPLP &ndash; Culture and Development of the CPLP Africanidade The African countries of the CPLPELO Economic relations between the EU and the CPLPUCCLA Unity of the Capital Cities of Portuguese language* Category:Portuguese language Category:Foreign relations of Brazil Category:Foreign relations of Portugal Category:Lusophone culture Category:International organizationsals:CPLP ast:Comunidá de Países de Llingua Portuguesa bar:Gmeinschaft vo de Portugiesischsprechadn Lända bs:Zajednica država portugalskog govornog područja bg:Общност на португалоезичните държави ca:Comunitat de Països de Llengua Portuguesa cs:Společenství portugalsky mluvících zemí da:Sammenslutningen af portugisisksprogede lande de:Gemeinschaft der Portugiesischsprachigen Länder es:Comunidad de Países de Lengua Portuguesa eo:Komunumo de portugallingvaj landoj eu:Lusofonia fr:Communauté des pays de langue portugaise gl:Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa ko:포르투갈어 사용국 공동체 hy:Պորտուգալալեզու Երկրների Համագործակցություն hr:Zajednica država portugalskog govornog područja id:CPLP it:Comunità dei Paesi di Lingua Portoghese he:קהילת המדינות הדוברות פורטוגזית nl:Gemeenschap van Portugeessprekende landen ja:ポルトガル語諸国共同体 no:Samveldet av portugisiskspråklige land nn:Samveldet av portugisiskspråklege land pl:Wspólnota Państw Portugalskojęzycznych pt:Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa ru:Содружество португалоязычных стран sl:Skupnost držav portugalskega jezika sh:Zajednica država portugalskog govornog područja fi:Portugalinkielisten maiden yhteisö tet:Komunidade Rain Ne'ebé Ko'alia Lia-Portugés uk:Cпівдружність португаломовних країн zh:葡萄牙语国家共同体
