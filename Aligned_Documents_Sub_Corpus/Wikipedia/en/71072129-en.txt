Albanian is also spoken by communities in Greece, along the eastern coast of southern Italy, and on the island of Sicily. Additionally, speakers of Albanian can be found elsewhere throughout the latter two countries resulting from a modern diaspora, originating from the Balkans, that also includes Scandinavia, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States.ClassificationAlbanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language constitutes its own branch of the Indo-European language family.Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from IllyrianOf the Albanian Language - William Martin Leake, London, 1814.ANCIENT ALBANIA INHABITED BY ILLYRIANS-Chapter 36 : Turmoil In The Balkans - Romania, Bulgaria, Albania and Greece Part Three - Albaniawhile others, claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, may have formed a sprachbund; see Thraco-Illyrian.)Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o'' has fallen to ''a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives.Other linguists link Albanian with Greek and Armenian, while placing Germanic and Balto-Slavic in another branch of Indo-European.http://books.google.com/books?id=yfZZX1qjpvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA111,M1 Mallory, J.

It is also an official language of Montenegro where it is spoken in the municipalities with ethnic Albanian populations.DialectsAlbanian can be divided into three dialects: Gheg and Tosk with a transitional dialect zone between them.Gjinari, Jordji. Dialektologjia shqiptareThe Shkumbin river is roughly the dividing line, with Gheg spoken north of the Shkumbin and Tosk south of it. The Gheg literary language has been documented since 1462. Until the Communists took power in Albania, the standard was based on Gheg. Although the literary versions of Tosk and Gheg are mutually intelligible, many of the regional dialects are not.Gheg is divided into four sub-dialects: Northwest Gheg, Northeast Gheg, Central Gheg, and Southern Gheg. Northwest Gheg is spoken in all of Montenegro, Lezhë, Mirditë, Pukë and Shkodër. Northeast Gheg is spoken in all of Kosovo, Has, Kukës and Tropojë. Central Gheg is spoken in Debar, Gostivar, Krujë, Peshkopi, Mat, Struga and Tetovo. Southern Gheg is spoken in Durrës, Elbasan, Kavajë and Tiranë,The transitional dialects are spoken in Cërrik, Dumresë, Polisit, Lushnjë, Rajcë, Shpatit, Sulovë and Vërçës. They have features of both Tosk and Gheg, including the rhotacism of Tosk and the nasal vowels of Gheg.Tosk is divided into five sub-dialects: Northern Tosk, Labërisht, Çam, Arvanitika and Arbërisht. Northern Tosk is spoken in Berat, Fier, Gramsh, Kolonjë, Korçë, Ohrid, Pogradec, Prespa and Vlorë. Labërisht is spoken in Delvinë, Dukat, Gjirokastër and Sarandë. Çam is spoken in extreme southern Albania such as Xarrë and northern Greece. Arvanitika is spoken in southern Greece by the Arvanites. Arbërisht is spoken by the Arbëreshë, descendants of 15th and 16th century immigrants in southeastern Italy, in small communities in the regions of Sicily, Calabria, Basilicata, Campania, Molise, Abruzzi, and Puglia. Tosk sub-dialects are spoken by most members of the large Albanian immigrant communities of Ukraine, Turkey, and Egypt.Gheg and Tosk differ mainly by:rhotacism - Gheg has n'' where Tosk has ''rlate Proto-Albanian ā + tautosyllabic nasal  Gheg low-central or low-back vowel;  Tosk mid-central, or low-front-to-central vowelProto-Albanian ō''  ''uo  Gheg vo, Tosk vainfinitival use of verbal adjective preceded in Gheg by me and in Tosk by për tëdifference in lexemes, noun plurals, suppletion of the aorist system of the verbSubdialects may vary based on:retention or loss of final schwa (-ë)devoicing of final voiced segmentstreatment of intervocalic and final njtreatment of clusters of nasal + voiced stopdevelopment of anaptyctic homorganic stops after nasals that follow a stressed vowel and precede unstressed ''-ël'' or ''-ër''treatment of vowel clusters ie, ye, and uatreatment of stressed /e/ before a nasalNotable phonological and lexicological differences between Tosk and GhegStandard formTosk formGheg formTranslationShqipëriShqipëriShqypni/ Shipni/ ShqipniAlbanianjënjënji/njâ/njoa/onenëntënëntë/nëndënândë/nant/nonnineështëështëâsht/osht/âisbëjbëjbâj/bojdoemëremërêmënnamepjekuripjekuripjekunimaturitygjendjegjëndjegjêndjesituationzogzokzogbirdmbretmbretmretkingpër të punuarpër të punuarme punue/me punauto workrërërërërânë/zallsandqenëqënëkênë / kânëbeen (part.)dëllinjëenjëbërshêjuniperbaltëbaltëbâltë / lloçmudcimbidhmashëdanëthongssysy/sisy/söeye( ˆ ) denotes nasal vowels, which are a common feature of Gheg.SoundsStandard Albanian has 7 vowels and 29 consonants. Gheg uses long and nasal vowels which are absent in Tosk. Another peculiarity is the mid-central vowel "ë" reduced at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the penultimate syllable.Consonants&nbsp;Bilabial]]Labio-dental]]Dental]]Alveolar]]Post-alveolar]]Palatal]]Velar]]Glottal]]Nasal]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plosive]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affricate]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fricative]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trill]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flap]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximant]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IPA]]DescriptionWritten asPronounced as inpVoiceless bilabial plosiveppenbVoiced bilabial plosivebbattVoiceless alveolar plosivettandVoiced alveolar plosiveddebtcVoiceless palatal plosiveqt ouɟVoiced palatal plosivegjd oukVoiceless velar plosivekcargVoiced velar plosiveggotsVoiceless alveolar affricatectsdzVoiced alveolar affricatexdstʃVoiceless postalveolar affricateçchindʒVoiced postalveolar affricatexhjetθVoiceless dental fricativeththinðVoiced dental fricativedhthenfVoiceless labiodental fricativeffarvVoiced labiodental fricativevvansVoiceless alveolar fricativessonzVoiced alveolar fricativezzipʃVoiceless postalveolar fricativeshshowʒVoiced postalveolar fricativezhsionhVoiceless glottal fricativehhatmBilabial nasalmmannAlveolar nasalnnotɲPalatal nasalnjSpanish]] seorjPalatal approximantjyeslAlveolar lateral approximantlleanɫVelarized alveolar lateral approximantllllrAlveolar trillrrSpanish]] hieoɾAlveolar taprSpanish]] aoNotes:The palatal stops  and  have no English equivalent, so the pronunciation guide is approximate.

It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.The ll sound is a velarised lateral, close to English dark L.The contrast between flapped r'' and trilled ''rr is the same as in Spanish. English does not have either of the two sounds phonemically (but tt in butter is pronounced as a flap r in most American dialects).The letter ç'' can be spelt ''ch on American English keyboards, both due to its English sound.

There are 5 declensions with 6 cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative and vocative), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words. The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns and there are numerous cases of syncretism. The equivalent of a genitive is formed by using the prepositions i/e/të/së with the dative.The following shows the declension of the masculine noun mal (mountain):Indefinite SingularIndefinite PluralDefinite SingularDefinite PluralNominativemal (mountain)male (mountains)sqi|mali (the mountain)malet (the mountains)Accusativemalmalesqi|malinmaletGenitivesqi|malii/e/të/së malevesqi|maliti/e/të/së maleveDativesqi|malimalevesqi|malitmaleveAblativesqi|malimaleve/maleshsqi|malitmaleveThe following table shows the declension of the feminine noun vajzë (girl)Indefinite SingularIndefinite PluralDefinite SingularDefinite PluralNominativevajzë (girl)vajza (girls)vajza (the girl)vajzat (the girls)AccusativevajzëvajzavajzënvajzatGenitivei/e/të/së vajzei/e/të/së vajzavei/e/të/së vajzësi/e/të/së vajzaveDativevajzevajzavevajzësvajzaveAblativevajzevajzave/vajzashvajzësvajzaveThe definite article is placed after the noun as in many other Balkan languages, for example Romanian and Bulgarian.The definite article can be in the form of noun suffixes, which vary with gender and case.For example in singular nominative, masculine nouns add ''-i'', or those ending in -g/-k, take ''-u'' (to avoid palatalization):mal (mountain) /  (the mountain);libër (book) / libri (the book);zog (bird) / zogu (the bird).Feminine nouns take the suffix ''-(j)a'':veturë (car) / vetura (the car);shtëpi (house) / shtëpia (the house);lule (flower) / lulja (the flower).Neuter nouns take ''-t''.Albanian has developed an analytical verbal structure in place of the earlier synthetic system, inherited from Proto-Indo-European. Its complex system of moods (6 types) and tenses (3 simple and 5 complex constructions) is distinctive among Balkan languages. There are two general types of conjugation. In Albanian the constituent order is subject verb object and negation is expressed by the particles nuk or s' in front of the verb, for example:Toni nuk flet anglisht "Tony does not speak English" ;Toni s'flet anglisht "Tony doesn't speak English" ;Nuk e di "I do not know" ;S'e di "I don't know".In imperative sentences, the particle mos is used :Mos harro "do not forget!".However, with verbs in the non-active form (forma joveprore), the verb is often in sentence-initial position :Parashikohet një ndërprerje "An interruption is anticipated".VocabularyCognates with IllyrianSee Illyrian languagesbrisa, "husk of grapes"; cf. Alb bërsí "lees, dregs; mash" (Vladimir Orel (2000) links the word to an unattested Vulgar Latin *''melettum'', which must be a borrowing from NW Greek mélitta. There is no real reason to posit Vulgar Latin mediation. J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams (1997) have the word as a native development, from *''melítiā'', a form also considered to underly Greek mélissa; however, this form gave Albanian mjalcë "bee", which is a native word and derivative of mjaltë "honey" (.brukë "tamarisk" The word fat has both the meaning of "fate, luck" and "groom, husband". This may indicate two separate words that are homophones, one derived from Gothic and the other from Latin fātum; although, Orel (2000) sees them as the same word. Similarly, compare Albanian shortë "fate; spouse, wife" which mirrors the dichotomy in meaning of fat but is considered to stem from one single source - Latin sortem "fate".gomar "donkey, ass" Calvert Watkins, "The Indo-European Linguistic Family: Genetic and Typological Perspectives", in Anna Giacalone Ramat and Paolo Ramat, eds., The Indo-European Languages (London: Routledge, 1998) 38. Albanian has proven to be distinct from the other two groups as this vowel shift is only part of a larger push chain that affected all long vowels.William Labov, Principles of Linguistic Change, vol. 1: Internal Factors (Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1994) 42. Albanian does share with Balto-Slavic two features: a lengthening of syllabic consonants before voiced obstruents and a distinct treatment of long syllables ending in a sonorant.E.P. Hamp, "Albanian", in Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics (Oxford, UK: Persamon Press, 1994) 66-7. However, Albanian is best known for its singular conservatism, having retained the distinction between active and middle voice, present and aorist, three series of tectal consonants before front vowels (e.g., palatals, velars, and labio-velars), and initial PIE *''h4'' as an h''.J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams, "Albanian", in ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture (London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1997) 9.Other linguists link Albanian with Greek and Armenian in a southern group.Albanian is considered to have its closest linguistic affinity to and to have evolved from an extinct Paleo-Balkan language, usually taken to be either Illyrian or Dacian. See also Thraco-Illyrian and Messapian language.===Historical presence and location=== The origin of the ethnonym Albanian is of some dispute. It appears for the first time in the 2nd c. AD in Late Greek as Albanoí (later Byz Gk Arbanitai) and thereafter in similar forms, including obsolete Albanian arbër/''arbën'' "Albanian"; however, these last two stem directly from Vulgar Latin *''Albanus'', most likely borrowed from Greek Albanoí; the adjective too, arbëresh/''arbënesh'', are derived from Latin albanensis. This same name appears in Slavic and was used to name the town of Labëri "Laberia", from South Slavic labanĭja, from earlier *''olbanĭja''.While it is considered established that the Albanians originated in the Balkans, the exact location from which they spread out is hard to pinpoint. Despite varied claims, it seems that the Albanians came from slightly farther north (Kosovo) and inland (Northwest Skopje) than would suggest the present borders of Albania, with a homeland concentrated in the mountains. The purely linguistic reasons are listed below.  divides the areas of the Balkans which were under Latin(North) and Greek(South) influence.]]First, Albanian has few early Greek borrowings, most of which are from the Northwest dialect, probably via the islands off the coast of Albania, e.g. WGk (Doric) mākhaná gave Alb mokër "mill" and WGk drápanon gave Alb drapër "sickle".Similarly, the Illyrian coast is not a likely source since Albanian has no inherited nautical or indigenous seafaring terminology, and has instead supplemented this absence with subsequent borrowing from Latin or Greek or recent metaphorical lexical creations.Third, toponyms along the coast, in contrast with native penultimate accent (ex: mbësë "niece" Category:Languages of Albania Category:Languages of Kosovo Category:Languages of Skopje Category:Languages of Italy Category:Languages of Serbia Category:Languages of Montenegro Category:Languages of Greece Category:Languages of Turkey Category:Albanian language Category:Indo-European languagesaf:Albanees als:Albanische Sprache ar:لغة ألبانية an:Idioma albanés arc:ܠܫܢܐ ܐܠܒܢܝܐ ast:Albanés az:Alban dili bn:আলবেনীয় ভাষা be:Албанская мова be-x-old:Альбанская мова bs:Albanski jezik br:Albaneg bg:Албански език ca:Albanès ceb:Pinulongang albanes cs:Albánština cy:Albaneg da:Albansk (sprog) de:Albanische Sprache et:Albaania keel el:Αλβανική γλώσσα es:Idioma albanés eo:Albana lingvo eu:Albaniera fa:زبان آلبانیایی fo:Albanskt mál fr:Albanais gd:Albàinis gl:Lingua albanesa ko:알바니아어 hy:Ալբաներեն hi:अल्बेनियन भाषा hsb:Albanšćina hr:Albanski jezik io:Albaniana linguo id:Bahasa Albania is:Albanska it:Lingua albanese he:אלבנית jv:Basa Albania ka:ალბანური ენა kw:Albaynek ku:Zimanê albanî la:Lingua Albanica lv:Albāņu valoda lt:Albanų kalba li:Albanees hu:Albán nyelv mk:Албански јазик ms:Bahasa Albania nl:Albanees ja:アルバニア語 no:Albansk nn:Albansk språk oc:Albanés nds:Albaansche Spraak pl:Język albański pt:Língua albanesa ksh:Allbanish (Shprooch) ro:Limba albaneză ru:Албанский язык se:Albánagiella sco:Albanie leid sq:Gjuha shqipe simple:Albanian language sk:Albánčina sl:Albanščina sr:Албански језик sh:Albanski jezik fi:Albanian kieli sv:Albanska th:ภาษาแอลเบเนีย tr:Arnavutça uk:Албанська мова ur:البانوی zh:阿尔巴尼亚语
