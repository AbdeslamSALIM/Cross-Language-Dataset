He quickly made his way through the youth and reserve teams and was a key member of Jordi Gonzalvo's FC Barcelona B team that won promotion to the Segunda División.His progression through the teams earned him a first team debut on August 18 1998 in the Super Cup final, in which he scored against RCD Mallorca. He quickly went on to become a key member of Louis van Gaal's title winning team.Although he is most used as an central midfielder, he is also capable of playing as a defensive midfielder.

His importance to the team was summed up by Aragonés when he said, "People say it is a gamble to take Xavi with us, but I say it would be a crazy gamble to leave him at home."http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/060618/1/7ucb.html&lt;/ref&gt; Xavi was named Man of the Match in Spain's first match against Ukraine and played in all of Spain's other three matches, before they were knocked out by the experienced French team in the second round.During the Euro 2008, Xavi played a vital role in Spain's successful campaign.
