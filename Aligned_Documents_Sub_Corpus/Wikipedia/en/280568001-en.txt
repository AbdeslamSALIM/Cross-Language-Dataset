The Treaty of Meerssen or Mersen in 870 was an agreement of the division of the Carolingian Empire by the surviving sons of Louis I, Charles II of the West Franks and Louis the German of East Franks, signed at the town of Meerssen, north of Maastricht, which is now in the Netherlands. Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor, who ruled Northern Italy and the Kingdom of Provence, sought a piece of the partition, with the support of Pope Hadrian II but was denied. The treaty replaced the Treaty of Verdun. The Kingdom of Lotharingia - a band of territory stretching from the Jura mountains in modern Switzerland to the North Sea - was divided between Charles II and Louis the German, in 869, after the death of their nephew Lothar II, King of Lotharingia. The north of Lotharingia was under Danish Viking control and was only divided between West Francia and East Francia on paper.Category:Franks Category:History of the Germanic peoples Meerssen Meerssen Category:870 in law Category:9th century in Francebg:Меерсенски договор ca:Tractat de Meerssen de:Vertrag von Meersen es:Tratado de Meerssen eu:Mersengo Hitzarmena fr:Traité de Meerssen it:Trattato di Mersen lb:Traité vu Meerssen nl:Verdrag van Meerssen ja:メルセン条約 pl:Traktat w Meerssen pt:Tratado de Meersen ro:Tratatul de la Meerssen ru:Мерсенский договор sv:Fördraget i Meerssen zh:墨爾森條約
