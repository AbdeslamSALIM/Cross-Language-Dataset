Rihanna spent the week of the 2007 Grammy Awards with singer, songwriter and Def Jam label mate Ne-Yo for the follow-up. He had co-written her ballad-driven "Unfaithful", and she had vocal lessons with him for the new album. In addition to him, she collaborated with Evan and Carl, record producer Sean Garrett and Norwegian production team Stargate, with whom she had previously worked. Rihanna also booked Timbaland, will.i.am and J.R. Rotem in the studio to work with her. Most of the album tracks were recorded in Los Angeles, California, and, parallel to the recording sessions of her second studio album, A Girl Like Me, Rihanna was almost done recording late in February 2007.Rihanna herself stated that the album is greatly inspired by Brandy's 2004 album Afrodisiac: "That album I listen to all day, all night. When I was in the studio that was the album that I listened to all the time and I really admired that every song was a great song. You could listen to the entire album. And I was like, 'You know what? I have to make an album like this'".'' Rihanna on embracing her '&amp;#39;Bad'&amp;#39; side | Rihanna | SUMMER MUSIC Q&amp;A | Music | The EW 100 | Entertainment Weekly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The genre of the new album is a slightly new direction for the singer, favouring uptempo dance numbers. It followed her club-natured melodies and, like its predecessor, includes R&amp;B and ballads. In an interview surrounding the album's theme, Rihanna claimed, "You feel different every album, and at this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo songs. I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time." During an interview on UK radio station Capital FM, Rihanna explained the meaning and reasoning behind the album title:  "Bad is not sleazy. Bad has its own term to every individual and in my case it just means I've gotten a little rebellious on the album, broken out of my shell and I'm taking risks... Michael Jackson "Bad" kind of way".http://www.capitalfm.com/, retrieved May 24 2007 PromotionAppearancesRihanna made formal appearances around the United Kingdom, including a performance in Preston.
