His single most famous result is a proof, in joint work with British mathematician Ben J. Green, that there exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers (the Green–Tao theorem). Tao is currently a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles.In August 2006, he was awarded the Fields Medal,IMU Prizes 2006 29 August 2006 widely considered the top honor a mathematician can receive. Just one month later, in September 2006, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on May 18, 2007.Personal lifeTao was a child prodigy..&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 24, he was promoted to full professor at UCLA and remains the youngest person ever appointed to that rank by the institution. Both of his parents are Cantonese Chinese by ethnicity. His parents are first generation immigrants from Hong Kong to Australia.Wen Wei Po, Page A4, 24 August 2006. His father, Billy Tao (Chinese name Xiangguo ; Cantonese Yale: tòuh jeuhng gwok; Pinyin: Táo Xiàngguó) is a pediatrician, and his mother is a Physics and Mathematics graduate from The University of Hong Kong, formerly a secondary school teacher of Mathematics in Hong Kong. Oriental Daily, Page A29, 24 August 2006. She was reportedly also an exceptional mathematician.His father told the press that at the age of two, during a family gathering, Tao taught a 5-year-old child mathematics and English. According to Smithsonian Online Magazine, Tao taught himself arithmetic by the age of two. When asked by his father how he knew numbers and letters, he said he learned them from Sesame Street.Apple Daily, Page A4, 24 August 2006. Aside from English, Tao speaks Cantonese, but does not write Chinese. He currently lives with his wife and son in Los Angeles, California. He has two brothers.Child prodigyTao exhibited extraordinary mathematical abilities from an early age, attending university level mathematics courses at the age of nine. He is one of only two children in the history of the Johns Hopkins' Study of Exceptional Talent program to have achieved a score of 700 or greater on the SAT math section while just 8 years old (he scored a 760).Radical acceleration in Australia: Terence Tao Gross, M. Retrieved 31 August 2006 In 1986, 1987, and 1988, Tao was the youngest participant to date in the International Mathematical Olympiad, first competing at the age of ten, winning a bronze, silver, and gold medal respectively. He won the gold medal when he just turned thirteen and remains the youngest gold medallist in the tournament's history. At age 14, Tao attended the Research Science Institute. He received his bachelor's and master's degrees (at the age of 17) from Flinders University under Garth Gaudry. In 1992 he won a Fulbright Scholarship to undertake postgraduate study in the United States. From 1992 to 1996, Tao was a graduate student at Princeton University under the direction of Elias Stein, receiving his Ph.D. at the age of 20.It's prime time as numbers man Tao tops his Field Stephen Cauchi, 23 August 2006. Retrieved 31 August 2006. He joined the faculty at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1996.Research and awardsHe received the Salem Prize in 2000, the Bôcher Prize in 2002, and the Clay Research Award in 2003, for his contributions to analysis including work on the Kakeya conjecture and wave maps. In 2005 he received the American Mathematical Society's Levi L. Conant Prize with Allen Knutson, and in 2006 he was awarded the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize.In 2004, Ben Green and Tao released a preprint proving what is now known as the Green-Tao theorem. This theorem states that there are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of prime numbers. The New York Times described it this way:  For this and other work, he was awarded the Australian Mathematical Society Medal in 2005.In 2006, at the 25th International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid, he became one of the youngest, the first Australian, and the first UCLA faculty member ever to be awarded a Fields Medal. An article by New ScientistNewScientist.com, Prestigious Fields Medals for mathematics awarded, 22 August 2006. writes of his ability:Tao was a finalist to become Australian of the Year in 2007.National Australia Day Committee, 2007 Australian of the Year Finalists, retrieved 2007-01-27.In 2008 Tao received the Alan T. Waterman Award, which recognizes an early career scientist for outstanding contributions in their field. In addition to a medal, Waterman awardees also receive a $500,000 grant for advanced research.National Science Foundation, Alan T.
