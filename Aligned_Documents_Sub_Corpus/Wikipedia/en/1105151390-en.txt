 intl             = yesInfineon Technologies AG (, ) was founded in April 1999 when the semiconductor operations of parent company, Siemens AG, were spun off to form a separate legal entity. As of September 30, 2007 Infineon has about 43,000 employees worldwide, 6000 of them involved in research and development. In the 2007 financial year, the company achieved sales of US$11.66 billion. In 2007 a 14.6% rise in projected calendar year revenues saw Infineon taking 10th place in iSuppli's global semiconductor sales ranking, thus gaining five places from 2006.On May 1, 2006, Infineon's Memory Products division was carved out as a distinct company called Qimonda AG. It employs about 13,500 people worldwide. Qimonda has been listed on the NYSE.The markets of Infineon TechnologiesInfineon Technologies AG, Neubiberg near Munich, Germany, offers semiconductor and system solutions for automotive, industrial and multimarket sectors, for applications in communication, as well as memory products through its subsidiary Qimonda. With a global presence, Infineon operates through its subsidiaries in the USA from Milpitas, California in the Asia-Pacific region from Singapore and in Japan from Tokyo.Infineon has a number of facilities in Europe. Infineon's high power segment is in Warstein (Germany), Villach (Austria) and Cegléd (Hungary). It also runs R&amp;D centers in France, Singapore, Romania, Taiwan & Banglore, India & fabrication units in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia & China.Infineon is listed on the DAX 30 index of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol: IFX).What Infineon meansThe name Infineon combines the English word "infinity" (Latin word "infinitas") with "eon," the ancient Greek word for eternity, in an attempt to call to mind the idea of unlimited potential.Product linesInfineon's main product lines are ICs in the following areas:Communications (wired and wireless)VoIP productsISDN productsMobile Phone ProductsEthernet over VDSL 10Base-S productsAutomotive, Industrial & MultimarketPower ICs, Coolset, CoolMOSDC-DC power management ICs & AC-DC power management ICsSense and Control products, TPMS (SensoNor)SmartcardsTriCore, C166 and 8-Bit Micro-controllersMemory Products - Now with QimondaDRAMInfineon also has an HPS (High Power Segment). The front-end of this production is in Warstein (GER), the back-end is in Cegléd (Hungary). Thyristors, diodes and IGBTs are manufactured here.[[iPhone|Apple iPhone]] chipsThe Apple iPhone contains baseband processor (PMB8876 S-Gold 2 multimedia engine with EDGE functionality) and GSM RF transceiver chips supplied by Infineon[http://www.techonline.com/product/underthehood/200001814 "Under the Hood: Inside the Apple iPhone", TechOnline]July 01, 2007.AutomotiveDuring the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijng in August, Chinese automobile manufacturer Chang'an Motors will supply a number of hybrid-drive cars as taxis for the athletes and spectators.

As a result, Samsung is to pay $300 million fine, Hynix was to pay $185 million in 2005, Infineon: $160 million in 2004.

AENEON is a DRAM memory family of Infineon and fits into standard PCs and notebooks.AENEON targets whitebox (non-brand) PC and notebook manufacturers world wide, as well as the European retail segment and end users (web shop). AENEON DRAM memory focuses the "price-performance" segment.Price advantages are obtained due to a limited product portfolio (only unbuffered and SO-DIMM), and due to outsourced module assembly. The DRAM components, however, are "Made by Infineon".NotesExternal linksInfineon websiteInfineon Stock on NYSEAENEON website&quot;Infineon CEO Ziebart steps down; Bauer takes over&quot;, ReutersInfineon HybridPACK  Category:Companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Category:Companies of Germany Category:Technology companies Category:Semiconductor companies Category:Companies established in 1999 Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Semiconductors Category:Electronics companies of Germany Category:Multinational companiesde:Infineon es:Infineon fr:Infineon Technologies ko:인피니온 테크놀로지스 id:Infineon Technologies it:Infineon Technologies nl:Infineon ja:インフィニオン・テクノロジーズ no:Infineon Technologies pl:Infineon ro:Infineon pt:Infineon Technologies ru:Infineon Technologies AG fi:Infineon Technologies sv:Infineon zh:英飞凌
