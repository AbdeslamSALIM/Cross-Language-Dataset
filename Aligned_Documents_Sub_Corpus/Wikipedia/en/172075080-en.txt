The term "Fabergé egg" has become a synonym of luxury and the eggs are regarded as masterpieces of the jeweller's art.HistoryCarl Fabergé and his goldsmiths designed and constructed the first egg in 1885. It was commissioned by Czar Alexander III of Russia as an Easter surprise for his wife Maria Fyodorovna.http://www.mieks.com/Faberge2/1885-Hen-Egg.htm Article on the first Hen eggOn the outside it looked like a simple egg of white enamelled gold, but it opened up to reveal a golden yolk. The yolk itself had a golden hen inside it, which in turn had a tiny crown with a ruby hanging inside, reminiscent of the matryoshka nesting dolls.Empress Maria was so delighted by this gift that Alexander appointed Fabergé a "Court Supplier" and commissioned an Easter gift each year thereafter, stipulating only that it be unique and contain a surprise. His son, Nicholas II of Russia continued the tradition, annually presenting an egg each spring to his wife Alexandra Fyodorovna as well as his then-widowed mother.From 1885, the eggs were produced almost every year. Once an initial design was approved, the work was carried out by an entire team of artisans under Peter Carl Fabergé, among them Michael Perkhin, Henrik Wigström and Erik August Kollin.The Imperial eggs enjoyed such fame that Fabergé made some 15 known eggs for private clients. Among them is a series of 7 eggs made for the industrialist Alexander Kelch. In addition, 8 eggs were made. They are not as extravagant as the Imperial eggs, and are not as original, often repeating designs that originated with the Imperial eggs.List of Fabergé Imperial Easter eggs1885 Hen1886 Hen with Sapphire Pendant†1887 Blue Serpent Clock1888 Cherub with Chariot†1889 Necessaire†1890 Danish Palaces1891 Memory of Azov1892 Diamond Trellis1893 Caucasus1894 Renaissance1895 Rosebud1895 Twelve Monograms1896 Revolving Miniatures1896 Alexander III Portraits†1897 Coronation1897 Doweger (or Pelican)1898 Lilies of the Valley1898 Mauve†1899 Bouquet of Lilies Clock1899 Pansy1900 Trans-Siberian Railway1900 Cockerel1901 Basket of Wild Flowers1901 Gatchina Palace1902 Clover Leaf1902 Empire Nephrite†1903 Peter the Great1903 Royal Danish†1904 No eggs known1905 No eggs known1906 Moscow Kremlin1906 Swan1907 Rose Trellis1907 Cradle with Garlands1908 Alexander Palace1908 Peacock1909 Standart Yacht1909 Alexander III Commemorative†1910 Colonnade1910 Alexander III Equestrian1911 Fifteenth Anniversary1911 Bay Tree1912 Czarevich1912 Napoleonic1913 Romanov Tercentenary1913 Winter1914 Mosaic1914 Grisaille1915 Red Cross with Triptych1915 Red Cross with Imperial Portraits1916 Steel Military1916 Order of St. George1917 Karelian Birch1917 Constellation''† Indicates missing eggOther Imperial eggs1885-1889 Resurrection1899-1903 Spring FlowersList of Fabergé Kelch eggs1898 Kelch Hen1899 Twelve Panel1900 Pine Cone1901 Apple Blossom1902 Rocaille1903 Kelch Bonbonnière1904 Kelch ChanticleerOther Fabergé eggs1885-1891 Blue Enamel Ribbed1899-1903 Scandinavian1902 Duchess of Marlborough1902 Rothschild1907 Youssoupov1914 Nobel Ice1917 NightUnknown date Lapis LazuliLocation of eggsLocation of the Fabergé eggsNumberImperial:54Viktor Vekselberg collection, (Russia) (formerly Forbes)11Kremlin Armory Museum]], (Moscow, Russia)10USA]])5USA]])3UK]])3Edouard and Maurice Sandoz Foundation]], (Switzerland)2USA]])2USA]])2Cleveland Museum of Art, (Cleveland, Ohio, USA)1Albert II of Monaco]] collection, (Monte-Carlo, Monaco)1Russian National Museum, (Moscow, Russia)1Fersman Mineralogical Institute, (Moscow, Russia)1Private Collection4Location Unknown8Kelch:7Viktor Vekselberg collection, (Russia) (formerly Forbes)2UK]])1Private Collection4Others:8Viktor Vekselberg collection, (Russia) (formerly Forbes)2Cleveland Museum of Art, (Cleveland, Ohio, USA)1Edouard and Maurice Sandoz Foundation]], (Switzerland)1Russian National Museum, (Moscow, Russia)1Private Collection3Of the sixty-nine known Fabergé eggs, only sixty-one have survived to the present day.
