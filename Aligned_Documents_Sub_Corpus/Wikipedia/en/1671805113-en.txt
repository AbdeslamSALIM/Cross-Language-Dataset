The Asian Games, also called the Asiad, is a multi-sport event held every four years among athletes from all over Asia. The games are regulated by the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) under the supervision of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Medals are awarded in each event, with gold for first place, silver for second and bronze for third, a tradition which started in 1951.Competitors are entered by a National Olympic Committee (NOC) to represent their country of citizenship. National anthems and flags accompany the medal ceremonies, and tables showing the number of medals won by each country are widely used. In general only recognised nations are represented, but a few non-sovereign countries are allowed to take part. The special case of Taiwan was handled by having it compete as Chinese Taipei, due to the political status of Taiwan.The first Asian games were held at New Delhi in 1952,which again hosted it in 1982The 15th Asian Games were held in Doha, Qatar from December 1 to December 15, 2006. The 16th Asian Games will be held in Guangzhou, China from November 12, 2010 to November 27, 2010.HistoryFar Eastern Championship Games The Asian Games owes its origins to small Asian multi-sport competitions. The Far Eastern Championship Games were created to show unity and cooperation among three nations: Empire of Japan, the Philippine Islands and the Republic of China. The first games were held in Manila in 1913. Other Asian nations participated after it was organized. It was discontinued in 1938 when Japan invaded China, which led to the expansion of World War II in the Pacific.Formation of the Asian GamesAfter World War II, a number of Asian countries became independent. Many of the new independent Asian countries wanted to use a new type of competition where Asian dominance should not be shown by violence and should be strengthened by mutual understanding. In August 1948, during the 14th Olympic Games in London, Indian IOC representative Guru Dutt Sondhi proposed to sports leaders of the Asian teams the idea of having discussions about holding the Asian Games. They agreed to form the Asian Athletic Federation. A preparatory committee was set up to draft the charter for the Asian amateur athletic federation. In February, 1949, the Asian athletic federation was formally formed and used the name Asian Games Federation. It was decided to hold the first Asian Games in 1951 in New Delhi, the capital of India. They added that the Asian Games would be regularly held once every four years.Reorganization of the FederationIn 1962, the Federation had a disagreement over the inclusion of Republic of China and Israel. Asian Games host Indonesia opposed the participation of Republic of China (due to the existence of People's Republic of China) and Israel. In 1970, South Korea dropped its plan to host the games due to security threats from North Korea, forcing previous host Thailand to administer the games in Bangkok using the funds of South Korea. In 1973, the Federation had another disagreement after U.S. and other countries formally recognized the People's Republic of China and Arab nations' opposition to Israel. In 1977, Pakistan dropped its plan to host the games due to conflicts with Bangladesh and India. Thailand offered to help and the games were held in Bangkok.  The Asian NOCs decided to revise the constitution of the Asian Games Federation. A new association, named Olympic Council of Asia, was created in November 1981. India was already scheduled to host the 1982 Games and OCA decided not to drop the old AGF timetable. OCA formally supervised the games starting from the 1986 Asian Games in South Korea.In the succeeding games, Taiwan (Republic of China) was readmitted but OCA decided to follow the standards of the IOC for Taiwan to use the name Chinese Taipei. The OCA also agreed to permanently exclude Israel as its member and requested that the country join European competitions.ExpansionIn the 1994 Asian Games, despite opposition from other nations, OCA admitted the former Soviet republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan.In 2006 Australia was refused entry by OCA President Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd Al-Sabah, suggesting that Australia's move from Oceania to Asia would be unfair to the smaller Oceania states.Cricket will be introduced in the 2010 Asian Games.List of Asian GamesYearGamesHost CityCountryWinner (gold)2nd (gold)3rd (gold)1951I]]New DelhiJapanIndiaIran|19251954II]]ManilaJapanPhilippines|1919South Korea1958III]]TokyoJapanPhilippines|1919South Korea1962IV]]JakartaJapanIndonesiaIndia1966V]]BangkokJapanSouth KoreaThailand1970VI]]1BangkokJapanSouth KoreaThailand1974VII]]TehranIran|1964'''JapanIran|1964China1978VIII]]2BangkokJapanChinaSouth Korea1982IX]]New DelhiChinaJapanSouth Korea1986X]]SeoulChinaSouth KoreaJapan1990XI]]BeijingChinaSouth KoreaJapan1994XII]]HiroshimaChinaJapanSouth Korea1998XIII]]BangkokChinaSouth KoreaJapan2002XIV]]BusanChinaSouth KoreaJapan2006XV]]DohaChinaSouth KoreaJapan2010XVI]]GuangzhouTBATBATBA2014XVII]]IncheonTBATBATBA1 Originally to be hosted by South Korea  2 Originally to be hosted by PakistanList of sportsThese are the sports that have been and will be played at the Asian Games, with the years they played.
