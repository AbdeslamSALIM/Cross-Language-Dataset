 Nienburg is a district (Landkreis) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Diepholz, Verden, Soltau-Fallingbostel, Hanover and Schaumburg, and by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (district of Minden-Lübbecke).HistoryFrom the early Middle Ages to the end of the 16th century this region was the heart of the County of Hoya. The ruling family became extinct in 1582, and the central and southern parts of the county were annexed by the Lüneburg branch of the duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1705 the area of Nienburg and Hoya became subordinate to Hanover.In 1866 the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia. The Prussian government established the districts of Nienburg and Stolzenau, which were merged in 1932.GeographyThe district is roughly located between Bremen and Hanover. The Weser River enters the district in the south, coming from North Rhine-Westphalia, and runs north towards Bremen.Coat of armsThe coat of arms displays:Towns and municipalitiesTownsSamtgemeinden1seat of the Samtgemeinde; 2townExternal linksOfficial website (German)Non-Official website (German)General Nienburger Internet meeting place (German) Category:Districts of Lower Saxonyde:Landkreis Nienburg/Weser es:Distrito de Nienburg/Weser eo:Distrikto Nienburg fr:Arrondissement de Nienburg/Weser id:Nienburg (distrik) nl:Nienburg (district) pl:Powiat Nienburg (Weser) pt:Nienburg (distrito) ro:Nienburg/Weser (district) ru:Ниэнбург-на-Везере (район) sv:Landkreis Nienburg zh:宁堡县
