Ranunculus repens (Creeping Buttercup) is a flowering plant in the buttercup family, native to Europe, Asia and northwestern Africa.Flora Europaea: http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/cgi-bin/nph-readbtree.pl/feout?FAMILY_XREF=&amp;GENUS_XREF=Ranunculus&amp;SPECIES_XREF=repens&amp;TAXON_NAME_XREF=&amp;RANK=Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?30841 Ranunculus repens]It is a herbaceous, stoloniferous perennial plant growing to 50 cm tall. It has both prostrate running stems, which produce roots and new plants at the nodes, and more or less erect flowering stems. The basal leaves are divided into three broad leaflets 1.5–8 cm long, shallowly to deeply lobed, borne on a 4–20 cm long petiole; leaves higher on the stems are smaller, with narrower leaflets. Both the stems and the leaves are finely hairy. The flowers are bright golden yellow, 2–3 cm diameter, usually with five petals. The fruit is a cluster of achenes 2.5–4 mm long. Creeping buttercup has three-lobed dark green, white-spotted leaves that grow out of the node. It grows in fields and pastures and prefers wet soil.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989).

The taste of buttercups is acrid, so cattle avoid eating them. The plants then take advantage of the cropped ground around it to spread their stolons. Creeping buttercup also is spread through the transportation of hay. Contact with the sap of the plant can cause skin blistering.Plants for a Future: [http://www.pfaf.org/database/plants.php?Ranunculus+repens Ranunculus repens]References Category:Ranunculaceae Category:Invasive plant species Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Estonia Category:Flora of the United Kingdom Category:Medicinal plantsda:Lav Ranunkel de:Kriechender Hahnenfuß es:Ranunculus repens fr:Renoncule rampante gd:Buidheag (luibh) lv:Ložņu gundega lt:Šliaužiantysis vėdrynas hu:Kúszó boglárka nl:Kruipende boterbloem nds-nl:Krupende botterbloeme pl:Jaskier rozłogowy fi:Rönsyleinikki sv:Revsmörblomma uk:Жовтець повзучий
