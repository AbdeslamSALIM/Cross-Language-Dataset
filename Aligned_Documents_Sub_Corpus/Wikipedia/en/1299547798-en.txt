She graduated from Great Neck Village School in June 2006, having transferred into the school from Great Neck North High School in her sophomore year. Her father is Jewish but she was raised in her mother's Catholic religion. She wanted to be Tracy Turnblad when she saw Hairspray on Broadway. She tried out for the part then, but was told she was too young. Coincidentally, she was born the same year the original Hairspray film was released.She later earned the nickname Courageously Fat Nikki Bonsklia from the director/choreographer of Hairspray, Adam Shankman. On August 1, 2008, Blonsky and her father were arrested after they were involved in a brawl in the departure lounge of Providenciales International Airport, Turks and Caicos Islands with the family of Bianca Golden, a former contestant of America's Next Top Model. Blonsky and Golden were both charged with actual bodily harm, while Blonsky's father was charged with grievous bodily harm. Blonsky was later released on bail.&lt;/ref&gt; An unsubstantiated video clip,&lt;/ref&gt; purportedly taken immediately following the confrontation, has surfaced which contains a supposed eye-witness claiming Bianca Golden was responsible for starting the confrontation. Bianca Golden went public telling Tyra Banks, live on her Talk Show, that Nikki Blonsky uttered the expletive nigger multiple times along with her family and sat on her face in order to smother her.CareerAwardsBlonsky was honored in the 13th Annual Critics' Choice Awards for her role as Tracy Turnblad in Hairspray in 2007 (Best Young Actress).
