They are members of the Central Division of the Western Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). They play their home games at Sommet Center, formerly known as Gaylord Entertainment Center and Nashville Arena.Franchise historyHockey in NashvilleHockey first appeared in Middle Tennessee in 1962 the form of the Eastern Hockey League's Dixie Flyers. One of the first tenants of the Municipal Auditorium, the Dixie Flyers played for nine seasons before folding in 1971. A decade later, Nashville Sounds owner Larry Schmittou made a second attempt at minor league hockey in Nashville when he brought the Nashville South Stars to town for the 1981-82 season. While featuring Bob Suter (Miracle on Ice team member and father of Nashville Predator Ryan Suter) as well as several of the parent club Minnesota North Stars' prospects, the franchise folded after just two seasons. In 1989, the ECHL Nashville Knights, perhaps the most popular of the minor league franchises, came to town. Coached by Predators assistant Peter Horachek, the Knights featured a potent offense that in 1994 set an ECHL record with 16 goals in one game.In 1995, rumors began to circulate that the New Jersey Devils would be relocating to the planned Nashville Arena.HOCKEY; Fans Caught Between Devils and Nashville - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Nashville offered a $20 million relocation bonus to any team that would relocate,1995 N.H.L.

A month later, Leipold named former Washington Capitals general manager David Poile as the franchise's first general manager. "NHL Expansion Franchise Nashville Chooses Poile For GM".Boston Globe. July 10, 1997 Portland Pirates head coach Barry Trotz was named the franchise's first head coach on August 6.Nashville Predators Timeline - Sports News Story - WSMV Nashville&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;On September 25, 1997, Leipold and team president Jack Diller held a press conference where they unveiled the franchise's new logo, a saber-toothed cat. The logo was a reference to a tooth and leg bone found in a cave in August 1971, during the excavation for the construction of the First American building in downtown Nashville. The 10,000 year old Smilodon fossils were believed to be from one of the last of the species.Once the logo was unveiled, the franchise held a vote among fans to choose a name. Three candidates were culled from 75: Ice Tigers, Fury and Attack. Leipold added his own submission to the vote, Predators. On November 13, Leipold revealed at a press conference that his submission had won out and that the new franchise would be known as the Nashville Predators..As of January, however, the Predators were still at least 6,000 tickets short of the NHL imposed 12,000 season ticket goal. Rumors began to circulate that the team would move before the first puck ever hit the ice. One rumor had Leipold trading franchises with the Edmonton Oilers, with the Oilers moving to Nashville and the Nashville expansion franchise moving to Houston, Texas. Leipold shot this rumor down, "There is no chance".PLUS: N.H.L. - NASHVILLE; Owner Denies Franchise Swap - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.When awarded a franchise, the Predators got a very lucrative deal.

Three nights later, on October 13, they defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 for their first win. Forward Andrew Brunette scored the first goal on a play that was reviewed by the video goal judge.Summary of seasons1998-99 seasonThe Predators, in their first year of existence, finished second-last in the Western Conference with a 28-47-7 record, ahead of the Vancouver Canucks.1999-00 seasonThe Predators finished with an almost identical record to the previous season (28-47-7-7) and finished last in the West behind the Calgary Flames. During a game versus the New York Islanders on February 20, 2000, the Predators scored four goals in 3 minutes and 38 seconds.2000-01 seasonThe Predators opened with two games in Japan against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Each team won a game in front of the largest crowds ever to see a hockey game in Japan. Backed by the goaltending duo of Mike Dunham and Tomas Vokoun, Nashville finished the season in tenth place in the West, 10 points out of a playoff spot with a 34-36-9-3 record, for 80 total points.2001-02 seasonA highlight of the season for the Predators was recording their 100th victory as a franchise on December 6, 2001. With that win, Nashville became the second-fastest expansion team of the 1990s to reach the 100-win plateau. The team was especially unlucky in overtime, finishing with a 28-41-13-0 record - good for 69 points and a 15th spot in the West.2002-03 seasonIn 2002-03, coach Barry Trotz broke the record for most games coached by the original coach of an expansion team (392 games). Nashville finished the season with a 27-35-13-7 record for 74 points, putting them well out of contention in the Western Conference in 14 place.2003-04 seasonThe Predators, under coach Barry Trotz, finished eighth in the Western Conference and made their first trip to the playoffs. The Detroit Red Wings beat them in six games in the quarterfinal.The 2004-05 season was locked out by a labour dispute between the owners and players.2005-06 seasonIn 2005-06, the Predators set an NHL record by winning their first four games by one goal each (although two of those were shootout victories, which would have been tie games in previous seasons). They also became only the fourth NHL franchise to start the season 8-0; the last time a team did so was the Toronto Maple Leafs, who set the mark with a 10-0 start in 1993. The Predators set the franchise mark for wins in a season with a 2-0 shutout of the Phoenix Coyotes on March 16, 2006. In that match, Chris Mason became the ninth goaltender to score a goal. By the end of the season, the Predators had accumulated 106 points&mdash;their first 100-point season&mdash;and clinched home ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs for the first time in team history. They finished the season with an NHL-best 32-8-1 record at home.In the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Predators faced the San Jose Sharks in the Western Conference Quarterfinals. The Sharks beat them in five games.2006-07 seasonThe Predators acquired veteran center Jason Arnott from free agency on July 2, 2006. Arnott and David Legwand led the team in goals with 27 each. Late in the season the Predators traded two former first round draft picks Scottie Upshall and Ryan Parent, plus their first-round pick and a third-round pick in the 2007 draft, to the Philadelphia Flyers for five-time NHL all-star Peter Forsberg.The Predators finished the season in fourth place in the Western Conference with 110 points, a franchise record. They were defeated by the San Jose Sharks in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs Western conference quarter-finals for the second year in a row, losing the series 4 games to 1, for the second straight season.They had the third best season overall behind the Buffalo Sabres, and the Detroit Red Wings.2007-08 seasonAfter having their roster decimated during the off-season, multiple potential buyers, and rumours of the franchise potentially moving hounding the team until almost mid-season, the Predators were not expected to have a successful year. Chris Mason, former backup goaltender to Tomas Vokoun (who was traded to the Florida Panthers) had a shaky season, and shared netminding duties with Dan Ellis. Ellis, who was signed from the Dallas Stars before the season began had a 233:39 long shutout streak (5th longest in league history) nearing the end of the season that helped Nashville squeak into the eighth playoff spot with 91 points.The Predators met the President's Trophy winning (and eventual Stanley Cup winners) Detroit Red Wings in the first round of the playoffs, and were defeated 4 games to 2 - their fourth straight first round knockout.Sale of the Predators and aftermathOn May 23, 2007, Craig Leipold was reported to have reached a tentative agreement to sell the team to the Chairman and Co-CEO of Research In Motion, Jim Balsillie.Balsillie attempting to buy Predators, tsn.ca, May 23, 2007 At the time, Leipold indicated that the team would play the 2007-08 season in Nashville but that the future of the team after that was not clear.Nashville Predators Being Sold, newschannel5.com, May 23, 2007 Balsillie had long been rumored to be interested in placing another team in Southern Ontario.

Kansas City's chances for the NHL's Predators get boost Kansas City Star, 28 June 2007. in late June 2007. The National Post of Canada, citing anonymous sources, reported that Nashville Predators owner Craig Leipold plans to sell the team to San Jose venture capitalist William “Boots” Del Biaggio, who wanted to relocate the club to Kansas City’s new Sprint Center for the 2008-09 season. Del Biaggio, who has a contract with Anschutz Entertainment Group to own an NHL club in Sprint Center, had made an offer reported to be for about $190 million for the Predators. In 2005, he had an agreement to purchase the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the club backed out of the deal after it won the NHL draft lottery and took Sidney Crosby with the first overall pick.  Balsillie’s brazen move of taking season-ticket deposits in Hamilton while the Predators still have a lease to play in Nashville upset NHL owners and commissioner Gary Bettman and reportedly caused Leipold to have second thoughts about selling to Balsillie. Although a ticket drive in selling corporate suites was underway in Kansas CityKansas City back in the running for Preds, www.TheSpec.com, June 28, 2007, it did not include season tickets like Balsille's move. Later that day, Leipold denied rumours that he was dealing exclusively with Del Biaggio, stating that he is open to all bids and that a deal with Basillie was still possible.Predators owner says open to all bids, www.reuters.ca, June 28, 2007 The Globe and Mail reported on July 4, 2007, a group of 30 investors became the third party to make a bid to purchase the franchise and keep the team in Nashville Nashville consortium throws hat into ring to buy franchise The Globe and Mail, 4 July 2007.On July 19, 2007, a group of local business owners known as Our Team Nashville held a rally at the Sommet Center to encourage fans to buy season tickets in order to help the Predators meet the attendance figures needed to keep the team in Nashville. They drew approx 7,500 fans and sold the equivalent of 726 full season tickets during the rallyNashville Predators - News: Local supporters stage successful ticket rally - 07/20/2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;. The rally was heavily supported by WGFX 104.5 "The Zone" sports radio in Nashville.On August 1, 2007, the group who has intentions to keep the team in Nashville received a letter of intent from Craig Leipold.http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2957518.&lt;/ref&gt; After protracted negotiations with the city of Nashville, the local group headed by David Freeman reached an agreement with Nashville Mayor Karl Dean, and the NHL Board of Governors approved the sale on November 29, 2007. Changes to the lease with the city that were deemed necessary by the ownership to keep the team viable were eventually passed on April 15th, 2008Nashville Predators - News: Metro Council Approves Preds Lease - 04/15/2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.The sale of the Predators to the Tennessee-based group was made possible after Del Biaggio agreed to enter into a partnership with the locally-based buyers. Under the terms of the agreement, Del Biaggio and a minority partner acquired about 27% of the club. Del Biaggio is said to have obtained significant concessions from his new partners and the league in exchange for his involvement, including:The right to buy out the other owners if the club incurred significant losses.The right to sell his stake to the other owners if and when the club became financially stable.The right to claim his share of any profits combined with full immunity from any cash calls that might be necessary.It was widely assumed that Del Biaggio's long term goal remained the ownership of a club in Kansas City whether this team be the Predators, another existing team or an expansion franchise.In June 2008 Del Biaggio ran into legal trouble over a multitude of unpaid loans, culminating in him filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.National Post story on Del Biaggio bankruptcy Furthermore, it is alleged that Del Biaggio acquired the loans he used to buy his stake in the team through fraudulent means, prompting an FBI investigation and possible criminal charges.Globe and Mail story on the Del Biaggio criminal investigation While these developments effectively end any chance of Del Biaggio moving the Predators to Missouri (or putting any other team there), it might also compromise the viability of the ownership group, whose ability to absorb significant losses without Del Biaggio's help has been questioned.Local group buying Preds makes a concession of its own Of most immediate concern might be a $9.8 million payment that Del Biaggio had promised to pay as part of the collateral the team owners agreed to put up when they got the new lease agreement. The Metro Sports Authority has given the team's remaining owners until August 4, 2008 to come up with the outstanding balance, although the deadline could be extended. Preds get extra time to plug $9.8M holeUnder United States bankruptcy law a trustee must be appointed sell Del Biaggio's assets, including his stake in the Predators to pay off his creditors. One report indicated that, perhaps as a last ditch attempt to avoid bankruptcy Del Biaggio solicited an offer from Balsillie to buy his stake in the team at a "significant premium".National Post story on Del Biaggio's negotiations with Balsillie That deal was said to have collapsed after the NHL and/or the local group either blocked it outright or at least insisted on the annulment of all concessions given to Del Biaggio prior to any transfer of the stake to Balsillie.Major North American sports leagues are expected to exercise "due diligence" before allowing anyone to acquire a large stake in a franchise, so Del Biaggio's bankruptcy is considered to be a serious public relations setback for the league. NHL turns down money for bankruptcyTurning blind eye leaves NHL with another shiner Furthermore, the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings affects the rights of the league and the other Predators owners to block the sale of Del Biaggio's stake to the highest bidder, especially if Del Biaggio's debts cannot be satisfied via the sale of other assets. Depending on the circumstances, the constitution and by-laws of the NHL could be superseded if a bankruptcy court determined that the league was trying to enforce its rules in a manner detrimental to the creditors' interests. Any concessions Del Biaggio had from the other owners might be considered "assets" that the bankruptcy court would expect to be transferred unmolested to the buyer of his stake.Team InformationThe team practices at Centennial Sportsplex. For the 2007-08 season, the Predators updated their jerseys with new striping. The logo was left unchanged, and the colors were left unchanged. Nashville was added to the 'away' jerseys above the logo.Fan TraditionsFans of the Nashville Predators have modified a tradition of the Detroit Red Wings to show their support: on occasion, a fan will throw a catfish onto the ice. The TennesseanTennessean.com, Catfish hunters: Fans throw a curve at Preds newspaper in Nashville cites the first instance of this on October 30, 2003. At least four catfish were thrown onto the ice after the first Nashville goal on November 13, 2003. Section 303 is a section of notoriously fervent fans at the Sommet Center colloquially known as "The Cellblock". The group refers to themselves as "the loudest section of the loudest arena in the NHL". While no reports of relative sound pressure levels have been cited by the group, the section's predetermined motivating and demoralizing chants towards the home and visiting teams respectively can be heard from many locations within the arena.The entirely fan-based organization has been recognized by the Predators' front office. A large banner was produced by the front office for posting on the wall behind the section. The organization maintains a website where chants tailored to the opponent can be reviewed before the game. The group also makes available merchandise through CafePress that reflects the Cellblock's brazen and supportive attitude.The mascot of the Predators is Gnash, a blue saber-toothed cat. The character introduced in 1998 quickly set new standards in the NHL for entertainment. His trademark is incredible stunts: very fast rappels, zip lines and a pendulum swing that takes him under the scoreboard and just inches off the ice.Season-by-season recordlogo.]] This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Predators.
