 The Frankfurt Galaxy was an American football team based in Frankfurt, Germany, playing in NFL Europa. They were one of only two original NFL Europa teams remaining when the league folded, and were the only one still in its original city. They played in Commerzbank-Arena, formerly known as Waldstadion.In 1991, the Galaxy was a founding member of the World League of American Football (WLAF). They hosted the first ever WLAF game against the London Monarchs at Waldstadion on March 23, 1991 and scored the first ever WLAF points with a safety, but lost the game.When the World League resumed in 1995, the Galaxy, the Monarchs, and Barcelona Dragons were the only former WLAF teams that continued playing. Both of these other have since folded, which made the Galaxy the oldest pro football team outside of the NFL and CFL.Frankfurt won the World Bowl four times in 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2006, but had been unable to defend it, as they also lost four times, in 1996, 1998, 2004, and 2007.The Galaxy head coaches:1991-1992 Jack Elway (John Elway's father)1995-1997 Ernie Stautner1998-2000 Dick Curl2001-2003 Doug Graber2004-2007 Mike JonesSeason-By-Season |- | colspan="6" align="center" | Frankfurt Galaxy (WLAF) |- |1991 || 7 || 3 || 0 || 3rd European Division || -- |- |1992 || 3 || 7 || 0 || 2nd European Division || -- |- |1993 || colspan="5" rowspan="2" valign="middle" align="center" | Did Not Play |- |1994 |- | colspan="6" align="center" | Frankfurt Galaxy (World League) |- |1995 || 6 || 4 || 0 || 2nd League || Won World Bowl III (Admirals) |- |1996 || 6 || 4 || 0 || 2nd League || Lost World Bowl IV (Claymores) |- | colspan="6" align="center" | Frankfurt Galaxy (NFL Europe) |- |1997 || 4 || 6 || 0 || 6th League || -- |- |1998 || 7 || 3 || 0 || 2nd League || Lost World Bowl VI (Fire) |- |1999 || 6 || 4 || 0 || 2nd League || Won World Bowl VII (Dragons) |- |2000 || 4 || 6 || 0 || 5th League || -- |- |2001 || 3 || 7 || 0 || 6th League || -- |- |2002 || 6 || 4 || 0 || 3rd League || -- |- |2003 || 6 || 4 || 0 || 1st League || Won World Bowl XI (Fire) |- |2004 || 7 || 3 || 0 || 2nd League || Lost World Bowl XII (Thunder) |- |2005 || 3 || 7 || 0 || 5th League || -- |- |2006 || 7 || 3 || 0 || 2nd League || Won World Bowl XIV (Admirals) |- | colspan="6" align="center" | Frankfurt Galaxy (NFL Europa) |- |2007 || 7 || 3 || 0 || 2nd League || Lost World Bowl XV (Sea Devils) |- !Totals || 85 || 72 || 0 |colspan="2"| (including playoffs) Notable players See also: Category:Frankfurt Galaxy players Mario Bailey - WR (1995-2000) Jake Delhomme - QB (1999) Mark Dixon - G (1998) Patrick Gerigk - WR (1999) Werner Hippler - TE (1995, 1997-2000) Damon Huard - QB (1998) Paul Justin - QB (1995) Lewis Kelly - T (2002) Ralf Kleinmann - K (1995-2000, 2003-2004) Martin Latka - RB (2004-2007) Frank Messmer - DL (1995-1997) Andy McCullough - WR (1999, 2001) Craig Ochs - QB (2006) Steve Pelluer - QB (1996-1997) Mike Perez - QB (1991-1992) Ingo Siebert - RB (1995-1998) Paul Spicer - DE (2001) James Taylor - CB (2005-2007) Bernard Tobias - CB (1995-1998)] Pat Barnes - QB (1998-1999) J.
