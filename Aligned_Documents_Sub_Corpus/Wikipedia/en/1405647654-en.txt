Together with Allan Maxam he developed a new DNA sequencing method. His approach to the first synthesis of insulin lost out to Genentech's approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources.In 1979, Gilbert was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Frederick Sanger. Following year he was awarded the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Frederick Sanger and Paul Berg. Gilbert and Sanger were recognized for their pioneering work in devising methods for determining the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid. Walter Gilbert also first proposed the term RNA world hypothesis for the origin of life, for a concept first proposed by Carl Woese in 1967. He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up company Biogen and was the first chairman on the board of directors. He is also a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at The Scripps Research Institute. Dr. Gilbert is currently the chairman of the Harvard Society of Fellows.In the late 1980s, Walter Gilbert expressed skepticism about the role of HIV in AIDS; more recently he has said that he regards the success of drugs developed since then as a proof of the argument that HIV causes AIDS.Moment of Science: Well, someone has to do it&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;ReferencesExternal linksNobel Prize autobiographyThe Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize Category:1932 births Category:Members of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:American biochemists Category:American physicists Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Living people Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:People from Boston, Massachusetts Category:Harvard Fellowsar:ولتر غيلبرت ca:Walter Gilbert cs:Walter Gilbert de:Walter Gilbert es:Walter Gilbert fr:Walter Gilbert id:Walter Gilbert it:Walter Gilbert sw:Walter Gilbert nl:Walter Gilbert ja:ウォルター・ギルバート oc:Walter Gilbert pl:Walter Gilbert pt:Walter Gilbert ro:Walter Gilbert fi:Walter Gilbert sv:Walter Gilbert zh:沃特·吉爾伯特
