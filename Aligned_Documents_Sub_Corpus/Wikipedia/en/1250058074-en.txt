Automatic for the People is the eighth album by the American alternative rock band R.E.M., released in 1992. The album was a critical and commercial success, with three top 40 hits in the U.S. and UK. The album was a big hit on both sides of the Atlantic. It was the band's first widespread popular album in the UK - placing at number 1 for 4 non-consecutive weeks (1992 and 1993) - and on the album charts for 179 weeks  In America it reached number 2 and remained on the album charts for 75 weeks . The album's extremely successful performance in Britain foreshadowed how the band would later become more popular in the UK than in their homeland.DetailsAutomatic for the People continues the folk/country rock/classical pop elements of Green and Out of Time but with fewer pop elements and a generally more sombre tone overall. U2's Bono called it 'the greatest country record never made.'[http://www.glidemagazine.com/Articles/52618/R.E.M.-Live.html Handler, Shane, R.E.M. Live, Glide Magazine.]The album name refers to the motto of Athens, Georgia eatery "Weaver D's Delicious Fine Foods." The photograph on the front cover is not related to the restaurant: it shows a star ornament that was part of the sign for the Sinbad Motel on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami, near Criteria Studios, where the bulk of the album was recorded. The motel is still there, but the star is gone. The slanted support where it was once attached is still there on the roof of the Sinbad. The interior jacket shows a two - three story circular platform that was the sign for the old Bon Aire Motel on the former Motel Row on Miami Beach. The Bon Aire and other motel row establishments have mostly been demolished for new high rise condominiums. The album was also recorded in New Orleans.Arriving on the heels of the previous year's breakthrough album, Out of Time, Automatic for the People entered the U.S. charts at #2, selling over four million copies, and spent several weeks at #1 in the United Kingdom as well. Despite not having toured after the release of Out of Time, R.E.M. again declined to tour in support of this album. In the UK, it was the second-best selling album of 1993 behind only Meat Loaf's comeback album Bat Out of Hell II.Automatic for the People had six singles released, tied with Monster for the most from any R.E.M. album. Many of Automatic for the People's songs proved to be very popular: "Drive," "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite," "Everybody Hurts," "Nightswimming," "Find the River," and the Andy Kaufman tribute "Man on the Moon", which would become the title of the comedian's 1999 biographical movie starring Jim Carrey. "Drive", the album's opening track and first single, was not included on the band's hits collection In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003, nor was final single (and final track) "Find the River." However, four tracks from Automatic for the People were included, more songs than from any of their other albums.John Paul Jones, the bassist of Led Zeppelin, in his string arrangement role, scored the strings for "Drive," "The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite," "Everybody Hurts," and "Nightswimming."In 2005, Warner Bros. Records issued a two-disc edition of Automatic for the People which includes a CD, a DVD-Audio disc containing a 5.1-channel surround sound mix of the album done by Elliot Scheiner, and the original CD booklet with expanded liner notes.Critical acclaimMostly acoustic and typified by its dark lyrics (many of which ruminate on mortality, death and those departed), Automatic for the People is generally considered to be among R.E.M.'s best albums, and one of the finest popular music releases of the 1990s. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1993.In 1997 Automatic for the People was named the 18th greatest album of all time in a 'Music of the Millennium' poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 2006, ''Q'' magazine readers placed it at number 7. Packaging and artworkThe front cover of the album shows a greyed-out photograph of a Miami motel sign placed over an embossed image, which is also included inside the album's booklet distorted on a white background. The back cover features a photograph of an old building with the track listing written over at the same angle that the building is viewed from. Other photographs feature the band members on a beach.Track listingAll songs written by Bill Berry, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe."Drive" – 4:31"Try Not to Breathe" – 3:50"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite" – 4:06"Everybody Hurts" – 5:17"New Orleans Instrumental No. 1" – 2:13"Sweetness Follows" – 4:19"Monty Got a Raw Deal" – 3:17"Ignoreland" – 4:24"Star Me Kitten" – 3:15"Man on the Moon" – 5:13"Nightswimming" – 4:16"Find the River" – 3:50PersonnelBill Berry – drums, percussion instrument, keyboards, bass, vocalsPeter Buck – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, bassMike Mills – bass, keyboards, vocalsMichael Stipe – vocalsAdditional personnelScott Litt – harmonica, contrabass clarinetJohn Paul Jones – orchestral arrangementsAll of the musicians below play on tracks 1, 3, 4 & 11George Hanson – conductorKnox Chandler – celloKathleen Kee – celloDaniel Laufer – celloElizabeth Murphy – celloDenise Berginson-Smith – violinLonnie Ditzen – violinPatti Gouvas – violinSandy Salzinger – violinSou-Chun Su – violinJudy Taylor – violinPaul Murphy – viola (lead)Reid Harris – violaHeidi Nitchie – violaDeborah Workman – oboeTechnical personnelScott Litt – producer, mixing engineerClif Norrell – recording engineer, mixing engineerGeorge Cowan – second engineer (Bearsville)Andrew Roshberg – second engineer (Miami)John Keane – recording engineer (Athens)Mark Howard – second engineer (New Orleans)Ted Malia – second engineer (Atlanta)Ed Brooks – second engineer (Seattle)Tod Lemkuhl – second engineer (Seattle)Stephen Marcussen – mastering engineer (Precision Mastering)Mark "Microwave" Mytrowitz – technical assistanceChartsAlbumYearChartPeakPosition1992Billboard 200]]2 1992UK Album Chart1 SinglesYearSongChartPeakPosition1992"Drive"Billboard Modern Rock Tracks]]1 1992"Drive"Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks]]2 1992"Drive"Billboard Top 40 Mainstream]]23 1992"Drive"Billboard Hot 100]]28 1992"Drive"UK Singles Charts11 1992"Ignoreland"Billboard Modern Rock Tracks5 1992"Ignoreland"Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks4 1992"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"Billboard Modern Rock Tracks24 1992"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks28 1992"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"UK Singles Charts17 1993"Everybody Hurts"Billboard Modern Rock Tracks21 1993"Everybody Hurts"Billboard Top 40 Mainstream13 1993"Everybody Hurts"Billboard Hot 10029 1993"Everybody Hurts"UK Singles Charts6 1993"Man on the Moon"Billboard Modern Rock Tracks2 1993"Man on the Moon"Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks4 1993"Man on the Moon"Billboard Top 40 Mainstream9 1993"Man on the Moon"Billboard Hot 10030 CertificationsOrganizationLevelDateBPI – UKGold BPI – U.K.Platinum CRIA – CanadaGold CRIA – CanadaPlatinum RIAA – U.S.Gold RIAA – U.S.Platinum RIAA – U.S.2 X Platinum RIAA – U.S.3 X Platinum BPI – U.K.2 X Platinum CRIA – Canada2 X Platinum BPI – U.K.3 X Platinum BPI – U.K.4 X Platinum BPI – U.K.5 X Platinum RIAA – U.S.4 X Platinum BPI – U.K.6 X Platinum CRIA – Canada7 X Platinum References  Category:1992 albums Category:R.E.M. albums Category:Albums produced by Scott Litt Category:Albums released on DVD-Audio Category:English-language albums Category:Warner Bros.
