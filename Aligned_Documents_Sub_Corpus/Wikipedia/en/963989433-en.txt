Leucine (abbreviated as Leu or L) is an α-amino acid with the chemical formula HO2CCH(NH2)CH2CH(CH3)2. It is an essential amino acid, which means that humans cannot synthesise it. Its codons are UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, and CUG. With a hydrocarbon side chain, leucine is classified as a hydrophobic amino acid.BiosynthesisAs an essential amino acid, leucine is not synthesized in animals, hence it must be ingested, usually as a component of proteins. It is synthesized in plants and microorganisms via several steps starting from pyruvic acid. The initial part of the pathway also leads to valine. The intermediate α-ketovalerate is converted to α-isopropylmalate and then β-isopropylmalate, which is dehydrogenated to α-ketoisocaproate, which in the final step undergoes reductive amination.

Leucine is utilized in the liver, adipose tissue, and muscle tissue. In adipose and muscle tissue, leucine is used in the formation of sterols, and the combined usage of leucine in these two tissues is seven times greater than its use in the liver.Food additiveAs a food additive L-Leucine has E number E641 and is classified as a flavour enhancer.See alsoPhoto-reactive leucineReferencesExternal linksLeucine biosynthesisLeucine content in foodComputational Chemistry WikiLeucine prevents muscle loss in ratsLeucine helps regulate appetite in ratsCombined ingestion of protein and free leucine with carbohydrate increases postexercise muscle protein synthesis in vivo in male subjectsCategory:Proteinogenic amino acids Category:Ketogenic amino acids Category:Branched-chain amino acids Category:Essential amino acids ca:Leucina cs:Leucin da:Leucin de:Leucin es:Leucina eo:Leŭcino fr:Leucine ko:류신 hr:Leucin id:Leusina it:Leucina he:לאוצין lv:Leicīns lb:Leucin lt:Leucinas mk:Леуцин nl:Leucine ja:ロイシン no:Leucin oc:Leucina pl:Leucyna pt:Leucina ru:Лейцин sk:Leucín fi:Leusiini sv:Leucin tr:Lösin uk:Лейцин vls:Leucine zh:亮氨酸
