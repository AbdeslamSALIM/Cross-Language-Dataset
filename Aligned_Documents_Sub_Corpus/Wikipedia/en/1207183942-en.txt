-, , -, Jaguar]]Nissan MotorsportToyota Team EuropeTeam Bentley1990)1990)Martin Brundle (born June 1, 1959 in King's Lynn, Norfolk) is a British former racing driver from England, known as a Formula One driver and as an ITV Sport F1 commentator.Martin contested the British Formula Three Championship with Ayrton Senna in 1983, finishing a close second, and the two progressed to Formula One the next year. Bad luck prevented Brundle from achieving a victory at the top level of single seaters, but he has been hugely successful in other disciplines. He was the 1988 World Sportscar Champion, with a record points haul, and won the 1990 Le Mans 24 hour Race for Jaguar in an XJR-12.CareerEarly Formula One careerHis Formula One career began with Tyrrell in 1984. He put in a number of aggressive and fast drives, finishing fifth in his first race and then second at Detroit. At the Dallas Grand Prix, Brundle broke his ankles in a crash during a practice session. Then Tyrrell were disqualified from the world championship for 1984 due to a technical infringement, wiping his achievements from that season from the record books. For the next two seasons he remained with Tyrrell, but without a works engine supply the team would struggle against the works engine teams. In 1987 he switched to Zakspeed, but managed only two points, the car unable to compete with the frontrunners. These two points were the only ones in the teams history.Sportscars and BrabhamFour years of racing for underfunded teams led him to seek a new challenge. In 1988 he won his world sports car title, but also guested for Williams at the Belgian Grand Prix, after Nigel Mansell was struck down with chickenpox. In 1989 he returned to F1 full-time with the returning Brabham squad, but the former champions were unable to recapture their early 1980s success and Brundle opted to move back into the sports car arena for 1990. The Le Mans victory came that year and rejuvenated his career, but still a top-line race seat in Formula One eluded him. As well as contesting races in sports prototypes, Brundle also contested the American IROC series in 1990, taking a victory at the temporary circuit at Burke Lakefront Airport (the only IROC victory for a British driver) and coming 3rd in the overall standings. In 1991 he rejoined Brabham, but the squad had fallen even further down the grid and results were sparse.Later careerSeasoned observers noticed Brundle's drives into the points in the uncompetitive Brabham Yamaha in 1991, which was the last Point Finish for the Brabham Team. This helped Martin get a 1992 switch to Benetton, with whom he would finally claim a recognised podium finish and consistent points finishes with some gritty drives.In 1992 he had a productive season, with a strong finish to the year. He came close to a win at Canada, where having overtaken Schumacher and closing on leader Gerhard Berger, the transmission failed. He never outqualified team-mate Michael Schumacher, but made up places with excellent starts (sixth to third at Silverstone) outracing the German at Imola, Montreal, Magny-Cours, Silverstone and Monza . At Spa, Brundle went by when Schumacher went off the track. Schumacher noticed blisters on his team-mate's tyres on his return to the circuit and came in for slicks, a move that won him the race. Had Brundle not been distracted he would have pitted as planned at the end of that lap, with victory the most likely result.Brundle found himself dropped from Benetton for 1993, Italian Riccardo Patrese taking his place. He came very close to a seat with world champions Williams, but in the end Damon Hill got the drive instead. Still in demand within F1, Martin raced for Ligier in 1993. More points finishes and a fine third at Imola were achieved in a car without active suspension.For 1994 Brundle was in the frame for the vacant McLaren seat alongside Mika Häkkinen. McLaren were hopeful of re-signing Alain Prost,who had retired at the end of 1993 after winning his fourth championship title, but decided not to renege on his retirement in March, and Martin got the drive, beating out McLaren test driver Philippe Alliot. He was confirmed less than two weeks before the season-opening 1994 Brazilian Grand PrixMotorsport information for March 1994&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.Joining the team was a case of bad timing in many ways. McLaren were on a downturn and throughout 1994 were unable to win. The team's Peugeot engines were unreliable, as was to be expected from a debuting engine supplier. At Silverstone Brundle's engine appeared to explode just as the starting lights turned green. In reality the culprit was a clutch that cracked spilling its lubricants on top of hot engine causing a spectacular fire. Nevertheless, when the car was reliable, Martin put in strong performances that season, most notably at Monaco where he finished second to Schumacher.Having had poor luck and with Nigel Mansell signed to McLaren for 1995, Brundle once more raced for Ligier that year, although not for the full season. To appease Mugen-Honda he had to share the second seat with Aguri Suzuki, a move denounced by many commentators and fans. He impressed however, a strong fourth at Magny-Cours and what would be his last F1 podium at Spa, the highlights. In 1996 he teamed up with Rubens Barrichello at Jordan and enjoyed a good season, despite a slow start and a spectacular crash at Melbourne's inaugural GP, with regular points, fourth his best result. He finished Fifth in the 1996 Japanese Grand Prix, which was his last Grand Prix in Formula 1.Martin achieved 9 podiums, and scored a total of 98 championship points, with a best championship finish of 6th in 1992. He was especially strong on street circuits and similarly slow-speed, twisty courses — Monaco, Adelaide and the Hungaroring each produced 4 points finishes for him.Post Formula OneBrundle had hoped to stay in F1 beyond 1996, but could not find a seat. He was offered a seat at Sauber in 1997 following the dropping of Nicola Larini, but decided against it. Brundle did however return to Le Mans. Drives for Nissan, Toyota and Bentley impressed, but a second victory failed to materialise. Brundle's last Le Mans outing came in 2001, after which he focused on his role with the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC).Having largely retired from motor racing, Brundle is now highly regarded as a commentator on British television network ITV, who he joined when they began Formula One coverage in 1997, initially alongside Murray Walker, and since 2002 James Allen He draws on his experience to provide depth to his commentary, in a similar way to the 'color commentators' on American TV. He is also the presenter of features (e.g. "F1 Insight" analysis segments, track guides and "grid walks") for the network's F1 coverage, which have often involved doing test runs in current and historical racecars.Brundle has won the RTS Television Sports Award for best Sports Pundit in 1998, 1999, 2005 and 2006. In 2005 the judges described him as: "...an outstanding operator at the very peak of his game – with an extraordinary ability to simplify and entertain in an often complex sport. He also exhibited a fearless authority on some of the most sensitive issues – not least his gimlet-eyed pursuit of Formula one boss Bernie Ecclestone on the grid at Indianapolis".'' http://www.rts.org.uk/servedoc.asp?filename=WinPress.doc  The production company responsible for ITV's F1 coverage, North One Television, also won the Sports Innovation Award for its Insight features, presented by Brundle. Discussing the return of Formula One to the BBC in 2009, The Times described Brundle "as the greatest TV analyst in this or any other sport."Brundle first commentated on F1 during the 1989 Belgian Grand Prix on the BBC. Having retired from the race, Brundle was asked by the BBC to enter the commentary box alongside Murray Walker as regular BBC commentator James Hunt failed to show up. Brundle was also part of the 1995 BBC commentary team whenever Aguri Suzuki was driving the Ligier-Mugen Honda such as the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix.In September 2008 Brundle denied that he had signed a deal with the BBC to commentate for next years coverage although announced that he would love the chance to go to the BBC and said that discussions were on going.With Steve Rider busy covering the England versus Kazakhstan 2010 FIFA World Cup Group 6 qualification match, Brundle will co-commentate and present coverage of the 2008 Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji Speedway.Presently, he is also David Coulthard's manager, and co-owns a management company, 2MB Sports Management, alongside Mark Blundell. Their clients include McLaren test driver Gary Paffett and British Formula Three champion Mike Conway.Brundle took the wheel of a Jaguar F1 car for the Formula One demonstration in London prior to the 2004 British Grand Prix and drove a BMW Sauber during a demonstration in 2006. Also in 2006, Brundle drove a 2005 Red Bull Racing car around Silverstone as part of ITV's 'F1 Insight' feature. This was followed up in 2007 with Brundle and colleague Blundell both driving Williams F1 cars to demonstrate overtaking.In 2004 he released his first book 'Working the Wheel'. The title is a reference to his 1996 crash in Melbourne.His sports car prowess led to an invitation to the 1990 International Race of Champions, a three-race series in 1990 because of the switch to Dodge cars, where he won the second round at Cleveland's Burke Lakefront Airport during the Champ Car event, albeit with eleven drivers racing as opposed to the series standard of twelve participants.In 2008 he came out of retirement to drive in the Formula Palmer Audi Championship alongside his son Alex, who is a series regular. He scored three top-eight finishes from the three races in which he took part.Criticism of Max Mosley and the FIAIn September 2007 he suggested that the treatment of McLaren "had the feel of a witch hunt" in his Sunday Times column. As a result of these comments Martin Brundle and the Sunday Times have received a French writ from Max Mosley and the FIA for libel. In the same column on 9 December 2007 he accused the FIA of double standards and of issuing the writ at the same time as clearing Renault of spying as a warning to other journalists: The timing of the writ is significant, in my view, given the FIA’s decision to find Renault guilty of having significant McLaren designs and information within their systems, but not administering any penalty. It is a warning sign to other journalists and publications to choose their words carefully over that decision. I’m tired of what I perceive as the "spin" and tactics of the FIA press office, as are many other journalists. I expect my accreditation pass for next year will be hindered in some way to make my coverage of F1 more difficult and to punish me. Or they will write to ITV again to say that my commentary is not up to standard despite my unprecedented six Royal Television Society Awards for sports broadcasting. So be it. Brundle also asserted his right to voice his opinion about Formula One: As a former Formula One driver, I have earnt the right to have an opinion about the sport, and probably know as much about it as anybody else. I have attended approaching 400 grands prix, 158 as a driver. I have spilt blood, broken bones, shed tears, generated tanker loads of sweat, tasted the champagne glories and plumbed the depths of misery. I have never been more passionate about F1 and will always share my opinions in an honest and open way, knowing readers will make up their own minds. In March 2008 Brundle voiced his opinion regarding the position of Max Mosley following the News of The World's allegation that Mosley had engaged in sexual acts with five prostitutes in a scenario that involved Nazi role-playing; saying "It's not appropriate behaviour for the head of any global body such as the FIA." In April Brundle argued: "The specific detail of the scandal surrounding him is largely irrelevant, in my view. The sporting regulation he has used over the years to keep teams in check relates to bringing the sport into disrepute. If you live by the sword, you die by the sword. Sitting on the fence on this issue for any of us inside the sport is not an option. We must condone or condemn the situation he finds himself in. Mosley's position as president is untenable.Pikey probeMartin Brundle was the subject of 14 complaints to Ofcom and 22 to ITV, for using the term "Pikeys" during ITV's coverage of the 2008 Canadian Grand Prix. In a pre-race live interview with Bernie Ecclestone, Brundle referred to 'pikeys' making repairs to the surface at turn 10 of the track by laying down fresh tarmac. ITV later apologised for the incident.The word is considered insulting by the traveller community. The Oxford English Dictionary traced its use to 1837 by The Times, referring to "strangers harvesting in the Isle of Sheppey". Later that century it meant a "turnpike traveller" or vagabond. Laterly, it has become a derogatory term for Irish travellers and Gypsies. news.bbc.co.uk, How offensive is the word 'pikey'? mirror.co.uk, Formula 1 commentator in 'pikey' Ofcom probe.Brundle and ITV were later cleared by Ofcom, as Brundle was not aware of the racial or cultural implications of the word, and ITV did apologise and explain the situation to him.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7555728.stmComplete Formula One results(key)YearEntrantChassisEngine1234567891011121314151617WDCPoints1984]]Tyrrell Racing Organisation]]*Tyrrell]] 012Cosworth V8BRADSQRSADSQBELDSQSMRDSQFRADSQMONDNQCANDSQUSEDSQUSADNQGBR]]GER]]AUT]]NED]]ITA]]EUR]]POR]]-01985Tyrrell Racing OrganisationTyrrell]] 012Cosworth V8BRA8PORRetSMR9MON10CAN12USARetGER10AUTDNQ-0Tyrrell]] 014Renault]] V6 t/cFRARetGBR7NED7ITA8BEL13EURRetRSA7AUSNC1986Data General Team TyrrellTyrrell]] 014Renault V6 t/cBRA5ESPRetSMR811th8Tyrrell]] 015MONRetBELRetCAN9USARetFRA10GBR5GERRetHUN6AUTRetITA10PORRetMEX11AUS41987West Zakspeed Racing861]]Zakspeed Straight-4 t/cBRARet18th2871]]SMR5BELRetMON7USARetFRARetGBRNCGERNCHUNRetAUTDSQITARetPORRetESP11MEXRetJPNRetAUSRet1988]]Canon]] Williams TeamWilliams]] FW12Judd]] V8BRA]]SMR]]MON]]MEX]]CAN]]USA]]FRA]]GBR]]GER]]HUN]]BEL7ITA]]POR]]ESP]]JPN]]AUS]]-01989]]Motor Racing Developments]]BT58]]Judd]] V8BRARetSMRRetMON6MEX9USARetCANDNPQFRADNPQGBRRetGER8HUN12BELRetITA6POR8ESPRetJPN5AUSRet20th41991Motor Racing Developments LtdBT59Y]]Yamaha V12USA11BRA1215th2BT60Y]]SMR11MON]]EXCANRetMEXRetFRARetGBRRetGER11HUNRetBEL9ITA13POR12ESP10JPN5AUSDNQ1992Camel Benetton FordBenetton]] B191BFord V8RSARetMEXRetBRARet6th38Benetton]] B192ESPRetSMR4MON5CANRetFRA3GBR3GER4HUN5BEL4ITA2POR4JPN3AUS31993]]Gitanes Blondes]]JS39]]Renault]] V10RSARetBRARetEURRetSMR3ESPRetMON6CAN5FRA5GBR14GER8HUN5BEL7ITARetPOR6JPN9AUS67th131994]]Marlboro]] McLaren PeugeotMP4/9]]Peugeot V10BRARetPACRetSMR8MON2ESP11CANRetFRARetGBRRetGERRetHUN4BELRetITA5POR6EURRetJPNRetAUS37th161995]]Gitanes Blondes]]JS41]]Mugen Honda]] V10BRA]]ARG]]SMR]]ESP9MONRetCANRetFRA4GBRRetGER]]HUNRetBEL3ITARetPOR8EUR7PAC]]JPN]]AUSRet13th71996B&H]] Total Jordan PeugeotJordan 196Peugeot V10AUSRetBRA1211th8Total]] Jordan PeugeotARGRetEUR6SMRRetMONRetESPRetCAN6FRA8GBR6GER10HUNRetBELRetITA4POR9JPN5- Tyrrell were disqualified from the entire world championship for 1984 due to a technical infringement.PersonalMartin has a son, Alex, who in 2006 competed in the Formula Palmer Audi Autumn Trophy http://www.pitpass.com/fes_php/pitpass_news_item.php?fes_art_id=30381 and a brother, Robin, who previously competed in Touring Cars and took part in the 2006 Goodwood circuit revival event.http://www.lynstjames.com/detail.aspx?nws_lKey=22ReferencesExternal linksMartin Brundle at itv.comQuotes as an [[ITV] commentator]          Category:English racecar drivers Category:English Formula One drivers Category:International Race of Champions drivers Category:British Formula Three Championship drivers Category:British sports broadcasters Category:Motorsport announcers Category:People from King's Lynn Category:Segrave Trophy recipients Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:BRDC Gold Star winnersbg:Мартин Брандъл de:Martin Brundle et:Martin Brundle es:Martin Brundle fr:Martin Brundle it:Martin Brundle lv:Martins Brandls hu:Martin Brundle nl:Martin Brundle ja:マーティン・ブランドル pl:Martin Brundle pt:Martin Brundle ro:Martin Brundle ru:Брандл, Мартин sl:Martin Brundle fi:Martin Brundle sv:Martin Brundle
