  A regulation is a legislative act of the European Union which becomes immediately enforceable as law in all member states simultaneously. Regulations can be distinguished from directives which, at least in principle, need to be transposed into national law. Under the European Constitution regulations would have become known as "European laws" but this proposal has since been dropped.Legal basisThe legal basis for the enactment of regulations is article 249 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and, as such, regulations only apply within the European Community pillar of the European Union.Article 249In order to carry out their task and in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, the European Parliament acting jointly with the Council, the Council and the Commission shall make regulations and issue directives, take decisions, make recommendations or deliver opinions.A regulation shall have general application. It shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.A directive shall be binding, as to the result to be achieved, upon each Member State to which it is addressed, but shall leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods.A decision shall be binding in its entirety upon those to whom it is addressed.Recommendations and opinions shall have no binding force.Legal effectRegulations are in some sense equivalent to "Acts of Parliament of the Union", in the sense that what they say is law. As such, regulations constitute one of the most powerful forms of European Union law and a great deal of care is required in their drafting and formulation.When a regulation comes into force it overrides all national laws dealing with the same subject matter and subsequent national legislation must be consistent to and made in the light of the regulation. While member states are prohibited from obscuring the direct effect of regulations, it is common practice to pass legislation dealing with consequential matters arising from the coming into force of a regulation.See alsoList of European Union directivesCategory:European Union directivesEuropean Union lawEUR-LexEudraLexExternal linksUK House of Commons: Report of the EU Legislative Process and scrutiny by national parliaments.EUR-Lex, European Union Law datebase.Regulationde:Verordnung (EG) et:Määrus (Euroopa) es:Reglamento Comunitario Europeo fr:Règlement de l'Union européenne it:Regolamento dell'Unione Europea lb:Europäescht Reglement nl:Verordening (EG) ja:規則 (EU) pl:Rozporządzenie (Unia Europejska) sk:Nariadenie (EÚ) sv:EU-förordning tr:Topluluk tüzükleri (Avrupa birliği)
