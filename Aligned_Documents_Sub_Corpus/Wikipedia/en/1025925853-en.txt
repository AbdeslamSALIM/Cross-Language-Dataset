The official name of this canton in French is République et Canton de Genève. Like some other Swiss cantons (Ticino, Neuchâtel, Jura) this canton calls itself a republic, as part of the Swiss confederation.The canton of Geneva is located in the southwestern corner of Switzerland and is considered one of the most cosmopolitan areas of the country.

The canton is practically isolated from other cantons of Switzerland. The canton is bordered only by Vaud. The adjoining French  are Ain (to the North) and Haute-Savoie (to the South). The current boundaries of the canton were established in 1815. As of 2007 the population of the canton is 447,584.ReligionAs home of Calvin's Reformation the canton of Geneva has traditionally been a Protestant Christian stronghold. However, over the latter part of the 20th century the proportion of Catholics rose, in large part due to immigration from Southern Europe, and now they outnumber Protestants in the canton. However, the canton is still officially considered Protestant. The surrounding regions of France are mostly Roman Catholic.EconomyThe city of Geneva dominates the economy of the canton. It is a center of commerce, trade and finance. A great number of Swiss banks are located in Geneva, particularly in the area of private banking. The service industry is most significant in Geneva where there are headquarters of a number of international corporations and organizations, such as the United Nations and the International Labor Organization. The city of Geneva is of international significance also as a financial center. Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine.Precision machinery and instruments are other branches where the economy of the canton of Geneva is strong. This is also reflected in the tradition of watchmaking in Geneva.International organizationsInternational Red Cross, since 1864League of Nations, 1919International Labour Organization, 1919European headquarters of the United Nations, 1945European Organization for Nuclear Research CERN, 1954International Telecommunication Union ITU, 1865World Trade Organization WTO, 1995International Organization for Migration, or IOMIATAEducationThe main educational institution is the University of Geneva, founded in 1559 by Calvin.

During the Napoleonic wars, Geneva was occupied and annexed to France. After its liberation in 1813, Geneva joined the Swiss Confederation in 1815 as the 22nd canton, having been enlarged by French and Savoyard territories at the Vienna Congress.On 9 October 2005, the elections to the Great Council gave an increased majority to the right.
