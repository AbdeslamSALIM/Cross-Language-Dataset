Amiens Sporting Club (Amiens SC) is a French soccer club based in Amiens, currently playing in Ligue 2, the second highest tier of the French football league.HistoryAmiens Athlétic Club was set up in 1901 by a group of players from the Association du Lycée d'Amiens, French schoolboy champions in 1902, 1903 and 1904. AAC crushed their very first opponents, Saint-Quentin, 13-0 a few months after its creation. In April 1902 the Comité de Picardie de l'U.S.F.S.A was established by the then president of the AAC (Henri-Frédéric Petit). AAC dominated the early USFSA league for the first 12 seasons. In 1909 the club got a new ground, at the Henry Daussy park, allowing an attendance of more than 1000. In 1933 the club got its first professional section, later abandoned in 1952, before becoming professional again in 1993. Since the early days, AAC has undergone two name changes: In 1961 to Sporting Club d'Amiens, and in 1989 as Amiens Sporting Club.Current squadAs of 26 August 2008.Effectif                           Notable playersSee also Category:Amiens SC playersPaul NicolasGérald BaticleTeddy BertinPierre MankowskiManagerial historyReferencesExternal links Official website Official ASC Blog ASCforever (fans &amp; forum)TrophiesRunner-up in France's Division 3: 1974, 1978, 2001Champion of DH Nord : 1924, 1927, 1957, 1963Champion of DH Picardie : 1920, 1921Champion of USFSA Picardie : 1903, 1904, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914Finalist of the Coupe de France : 2001   Category:French football clubs Category:Amiens SCbr:Amiens Sporting Club Football de:SC Amiens es:Amiens Sporting Club Football fr:Amiens Sporting Club Football it:Amiens SC lt:Amiens SC Football nl:Amiens SC ja:アミアンSC pl:Amiens SC pt:Amiens Sporting Club Football fi:Amiens SC sv:Amiens SC
