, Sewing (1898)]]     ]]Sewing or stitching is the fastening of cloth, leather, furs, bark, or other flexible materials, using needle and thread. Its use is nearly universal among human populations and dates back to Paleolithic times (30,000 BC). Sewing predates the weaving of cloth.Sewing is used primarily to produce clothing and household furnishings such as curtains, bedclothes, upholstery, and table linens. It is also used for sails, bellows, skin boats, banners, and other items shaped out of flexible materials such as canvas and leather.Most sewing in the industrial world is done by machines. Pieces of a garment are often first tacked together. The machine has a complex set of gears and arms that pierces thread through the layers of the cloth and semi-securely interlocks the thread.Some people sew clothes for themselves and their families. More often home sewers sew to repair clothes, such as mending a torn seam or replacing a loose button. A person who sews for a living is known as a seamstress (from seams-mistress) or seamster (from seams-master), dressmaker, tailor, or garment worker."Plain" sewing is done for functional reasons: making or mending clothing or household linens. "Fancy" sewing is primarily decorative, including techniques such as shirring, smocking, embroidery, or quilting.Sewing is the foundation for many needle arts and crafts, such as applique, canvas work, and patchwork.While sewing is often seen as a low-skill job, the task of designing good-looking three-dimensional shapes from non-stretching two-dimensional fabric generally requires extensive hands-on knowledge of the design and principles of mathematical manifolds. Flat sheets of fabric with holes and slits cut into the fabric can curve and fold in 3D space in extensively complex ways that require a high level of skill and experience to manipulate into a smooth, ripple-free design. Aligning and orienting patterns printed or woven into the fabric further complicates the design process. Once a clothing designer with these skills has created the initial product, the fabric can then be cut using templates and sewn by manual laborers or machines.Seam allowanceSeam allowance is the area between the edge of the fabric and the line of stitching. It is usually 1.5 cm away from the edge of the fabric.Occupations requiring sewingBookbinderCobblerCorsetierDraperDressmakerGloverHatterMillinerParachute riggerQuilterSailmakerSeamstressTailorTaxidermistUpholstererSewing tools and accessoriesstitching awlbobbinbodkindress formdressmaker's or tailor's shearsmeasuring tapeneedlepatternpattern weightspinpincushionrotary cutterscissorsseam rippersewing tabletailor's chalkthimblethread/yarntracing papertracing wheelwax, often beeswaxsewing boxNotions (objects sewn into garments or soft goods) Closuresbucklebutton (buttons can be sew-through or have shanks.)togglechinese frogeyehookhook-and-loop tape (often known by brand name Velcro)snapzippertiesFinishing and embellishmentbeaded fringe &amp; trimelasticpiping/cording/weltingeyeletgrommetheadinginterfacingrivettrims (fringe, beaded fringe, ribbons, lace, sequin tape)List of stitchesThe two main stitches that sewing machines make of which the others are derivatives are lockstitch and chain stitch.back tackbackstitch - a sturdy hand stitch for seams and decorationbasting stitch (or tacking) - for reinforcementblanket stitchblind stitch (or hem stitch) - a type of slip stitch used for inconspicuous hemsbuttonhole stitchchain stitch - hand or machine stitch for seams or decorationcross-stitch - usually used for decoration, but may also be used for seamsdarning stitchembroidery stitchhemming stitchlockstitch - machine stitch, also called straight stitchoverhand stitchoverlockpad stitchpadding stitchrunning stitch - a hand stitch for seams and gatheringsailmakers stitchslip stitch - a hand stitch for fastening two pieces of fabric together from the right side without the thread showingstretch stitchtopstitchwhipstitch (or oversewing or overcast stitch) - for protecting edgeszig-zag stitchSee alsoHaberdasherSewing machine==References==Singer: The New Sewing Essentials by The Editors of Creative Publishing International ISBN 0-86573-308-2External links
