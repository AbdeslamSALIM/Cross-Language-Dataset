 Johann David Wyss (March 4, 1743 - January 11, 1818) is best remembered for his book The Swiss Family Robinson. It is said that he was inspired by Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, but wanted to write a story in from which his own children would learn, as the father in the story taught important lessons to his children. The Swiss Family Robinson was first published in 1812 and translated into English two years later. It has since become one of the most popular books of all time.The book was edited by his son, Johann Rudolf Wyss, a scholar who wrote the Swiss national anthem. Another son, Johann Emmanuel Wyss, illustrated the book.External links  Wyss, Johann David Wyss, Johann David Wyss, Johann David Wyss, Johann David Wyss, Johann Davidcs:Johann David Wyss da:Johann David Wyss de:Johann David Wyss es:Johann David Wyss fr:Johann David Wyss nl:Johann David Wyss ja:ヨハン・ダビット・ウィース no:Johann David Wyss pl:Johann David Wyss
