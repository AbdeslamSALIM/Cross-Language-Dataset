A pair will rear one brood per season, with both male and female providing parental care for the young.This species is migratory, and mostly winters on the southern Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Mexico and the United States.The American Avocet forages in shallow water or on mud flats, often sweeping its bill from side to side in water as it seeks its crustacean and insect prey.Protected statusThe American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana) is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/intrnltr/mbta/mbtandx.html==References==  Database entry includes justification for why this species is of least concernO'Brien, Michael, et al.
