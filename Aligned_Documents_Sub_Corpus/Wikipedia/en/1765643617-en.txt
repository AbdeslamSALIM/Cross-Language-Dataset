The album is a mishmash of previously recorded tracks. The songs either appeared as singles, had been omitted from the American versions of Aftermath and Between the Buttons, were collected from studio sessions dating back several years, or are simply reissues of songs recently released on other albums.Three tracks had never been released. "My Girl" from the Out of Our Heads and Between the Buttons sessions, and "Ride On, Baby" and "Sittin' On A Fence" from the Aftermath sessions.The title refers to the album's cover, with flower stems underneath the portrait of each band member. Bassist Bill Wyman claims that Mick Jagger and Keith Richards deliberately arranged the stem of Brian Jones's flower so that it had no leaves, as a prank. He later stated that "I didn't get the joke". The portraits are from the UK version of Aftermath.Flowers reached #3 in the US during the late summer of 1967 and went gold. In August 2002 it was remastered and reissued on CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.Track listingAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted."Ruby Tuesday" – 3:17A January 1967 single release also featured on the US edition of Between the Buttons"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?" – 2:34A September 1966 single release"Let's Spend the Night Together" – 3:36A January 1967 single release also featured on the US edition of Between the Buttons"Lady Jane" – 3:08Originally released on Aftermath in 1966"Out of Time" – 3:41An abridged edit of the version originally released on the UK edition of Aftermath in 1966"My Girl" (Smokey Robinson/Ronald White) – 2:38Previously unreleased.
