Sillamäe is a town in Ida-Viru County in the northern part of Estonia, on the southern coast of the Gulf of Finland.During the Soviet regime in Estonia, Sillamäe was a closed town mainly because of the chemical factory in there which produced fuel rods and nuclear materials for the Soviet nuclear power plants and weapon facilities. At first, uranium was mined in the same location, later it was imported from various locations from the Eastern Bloc, mainly Czechoslovakia. Uranium ore from the Bihor mine operated by Sovromcuarţ (one of the SovRoms operated jointly by the Soviet Union and Romania) was also processed at Sillamäe.Diehl Rumors are that the first Soviet nuclear bomb was created from the uranium mined at Sillamäe.Near the city, there is located a beach and a spa (Toila and Narva-Jõesuu), used during the Soviet period for Communist Party members and leaders.In 2005, a port was opened in Sillamäe. In 2006 a regular ferry service was established between Sillamäe and Kotka, Finland.DemographicsNotesExternal linksOfficial website (available in Estonian, Russian and English)Sillamäe Web (available in Estonian, Russian and English)Peter Diehl, "Uranium Mining in Europe", 1995.
