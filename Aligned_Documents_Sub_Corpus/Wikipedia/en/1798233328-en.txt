Along with André Derain and Henri Matisse he is considered one of the principal figures in the Fauve movement, a group of modern artists who from 1904 to 1908 were united in their use of intense color.Freeman, Judi, et al. The Fauve Landscape, pp.13–14. Abbeville Press, 1990. ISBN 1-55859-025-0Life[[Image:Vlaminck-TheCircus.jpg|thumb|Maurice de Vlaminck. The Circus, 1906]] Maurice de Vlaminck was born in Paris to a family of musicians. His father taught him to play the violin.Melikian, Souren. &quot;Vlaminck: Expressing mood with color&quot;, International Herald Tribune, 11 July 2008. Retrieved 13 July 2008. He began painting in his late teens. In 1893, he studied with a painter named Henri Rigalon on the Ile de Chatou.Freeman, page 319. In 1894 he married Suzanne Berly. The turning point in his life was a chance meeting on the train to Paris towards the end of his stint in the army. Vlaminck, then 23, met an aspiring artist, André Derain, with whom he struck up a life-long friendship. When Vlaminck completed his army service in 1900, the two rented a studio together for a year before Derain left to do his own military service. In 1902 and 1903 he wrote several mildly pornographic novels illustrated by Derain.Freeman, p.319. He painted during the day and earned his livelihood by giving violin lessons and performing with musical bands at night.In 1911, Vlaminck traveled to London and painted by the Thames. In 1913, he painted again with Derain in Marseille and Martigues. In World War I he was stationed in Paris, and began writing poetry. Eventually he settled in the northwestern suburbs of Paris. He married his second wife, Berthe Combes, with whom he had two daughters. From 1925 he traveled throughout France, but continued to paint primarily along the Seine, near Paris.Vlaminck died in Rueil-la-Gadelière on October 11, 1958.Artistic career)'' 1903]]Two of Vlaminck's groundbreaking paintings, Sur le zinc (At the Bar) and L'homme a la pipe (Man Smoking a Pipe) were painted in 1900.For the next few years Vlaminck lived in or near Chatou, painting and exhibiting alongside Derain, Matisse, and other Fauvist painters. At this time his exuberant paint application and vibrant use of color displayed the influence of Vincent van Gogh. Sur le zinc called to mind the work of Toulouse-Lautrec and his portrayals of prostitutes and solitary drinkers, but does not attempt to probe the sitter's psychology—a break with the century-old European tradition of individualized portraiture. According to art critic Souren Melikian, it is "the impersonal cartoon of a type." In his landscape paintings, his approach was similar. He ignored the details, with the landscape becoming a mere excuse to express mood through violent color and brushwork. An example is Sous bois, painted in 1904. The following year, he began to experiment with "deconstruction," turning the physical world into dabs and streaks of color that convey a sense of motion. His paintings Le Pont de Chatou (The Chatou Bridge), Les Ramasseurs de pommes de terre (The Potato Pickers), La Seine a Chatou (The River Seine at Chatou) and Le Verger (The Orchard) exemplify this trend.Artistic influencesVlaminck's compositions show familiarity with the Impressionists, several of whom had painted in the same area in the 1870s and 1880s. After visiting a van Gogh exhibit, he declared that he "loved van Gogh that day more than my own father".Freeman, pp.15-21 From 1908 his palette grew more monochromatic, and the predominant influence was that of Cézanne. His later work displayed a dark palette, punctuated by heavy strokes of contrasting white paint.Notes and referencesExternal linksMaurice de Vlaminck on artnetMaurice de Vlaminck - Biography Category:1876 births Category:1958 deaths Category:French painters Category:French printmakers Category:Fauvismbs:Maurice de Vlaminck ca:Maurice de Vlaminck de:Maurice de Vlaminck es:Maurice de Vlaminck eo:Maurice de Vlaminck fr:Maurice de Vlaminck hr:Maurice de Vlaminck io:Maurice de Vlaminck it:Maurice de Vlaminck he:מוריס ולאמנק hu:Maurice de Vlaminck nl:Maurice de Vlaminck ja:モーリス・ド・ヴラマンク mk:Морис Вламинк no:Maurice de Vlaminck oc:Maurice de Vlaminck pl:Maurice de Vlaminck pt:Maurice de Vlaminck ro:Maurice de Vlaminck ru:Вламинк, Морис де sr:Moris Vlamenk sv:Maurice de Vlaminck
