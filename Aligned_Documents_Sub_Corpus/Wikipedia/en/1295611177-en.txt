The two main bodies consisted of the Confederación Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol (CCCF) founded in 1938 (consisting of Central America and most of the Caribbean) and the North American Football Confederation (NAFC) founded in 1946 (consisting of United States, Mexico, Canada, and Cuba). Each confederation held their own competitions, the CCCF Championship and the NAFC Championship. The CCCF held 10 championships from 1941-1961, Costa Rica winning seven (1941, ’46, ’48, ’53, ’55, ’60, ’61), and one each by El Salvador (1943), Panama (1951) and Haiti (1957). The NAFC held two championships, in 1947 and 1949, won each time by Mexico.CONCACAF was founded in its current form in 1961 after the merging of NAFC and CCCF and thus resulted in a single competition being held for the continent, however the first official national team competition was not held until more than two years had passed, with El Salvador being selected as the first hosting country (1963). The CONCACAF Campeonato de Naciones, as it was called, was then held every two years from 1963-1971. The second edition (1965) held in Guatemala, saw Mexico defeat the host in the final of a six-team tournament. The 1967 competition was held in Honduras and saw a third different champion crowned, Guatemala. Costa Rica won their second title as hosts in 1969, knocking off Guatemala, while two years later, Mexico won their second championship as the tournament moved to the Caribbean for the first time, held in Trinidad & Tobago. In 1973, the tournament kept the same format of six teams in one site playing a single round-robin, but now there were bigger stakes attaches: the Confederation’s berth in the FIFA World Cup finals. In Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the host country pulled off a shocking upset by winning the tournament and claiming a spot in West Germany 1974.With the Campeonato de Naciones doubling as the final World Cup qualifying tournament, the next two editions were held in Ciudad de México and Tegucigalpa, Honduras in 1977 and 1981, respectively, the host country came away as champion and grabbed the spots on offers each time. In 1985 and 1989, the winner of the World Cup qualifying tournament was again crowned Confederation champion. Canada and Costa Rica were named champions in ’85 and ’89, respectively, but without ever lifting a trophy.In 1990, CONCACAF again created a tournament as its showpiece event to crown the regional champion. The event was named the CONCACAF Gold Cup, with the USA hosting the first competition in 1991. The host country was the inaugural champion of the eight-team tournament. Mexico dominated the remainder of the decade, winning three consecutive CONCACAF Gold Cup titles in 1993, 1996 and 1998. In the 1996 edition, the Gold Cup field included its first guest team, inviting the defending FIFA World Cup Champions Brazil.Starting with the 2000 Gold Cup, the tournament field was increased to twelve teams. Canada made history winning their first major international honour in more than 100 years of football.The most recent CONCACAF Gold Cup was contested in the United States from June 6 to June 24, 2007 where the hosts successfully defended their title beating Mexico in the final 2-1 in Chicago; Canada and Guadeloupe shared third-place.Since the formation of the Gold Cup in 1991, the CONCACAF Championship has been won four times by Mexico and the United States, and once by Canada.Tournament resultsCONCACAF ChampionshipYearHostFinal Group RankWinnerRunner-up3rd Place4th PlaceDetails]]''El SalvadorCosta Rica'''El SalvadorNetherlands Antilles|1959HondurasDetails]]''GuatemalaMexico|1934'''GuatemalaCosta RicaEl SalvadorDetails]]''HondurasGuatemala'''Mexico|1934HondurasTrinidad and TobagoDetails]]''Costa RicaCosta Rica'''GuatemalaNetherlands Antilles|1959MexicoDetails]]''Trinidad and TobagoMexico'''Haiti|1964Costa RicaCubaDetails]]'' (1)Haiti|1964Haiti|1964'''Trinidad and TobagoMexicoHondurasDetails]]'' (1)MexicoMexico'''Haiti|1964El SalvadorCanadaDetails]]'' (1)HondurasHonduras'''El SalvadorMexicoCanadaDetails]]'' (1)No Fixed VenueCanada'''HondurasCosta RicaEl SalvadorDetails]]'' (1)No Fixed VenueCosta Rica'''USATrinidad and TobagoGuatemalaCONCACAF Gold CupYearHostFinalThird Place MatchWinnerScoreRunner-up3rd PlaceScore4th PlaceDetails]]''United StatesUSA'''AET]]&PSHondurasMexico2–0Costa RicaDetails]]''United States  & Mexico'''4–0USACosta Rica1-1 AET(2)Details]]''United StatesMexico'''2–0Brazil''USA3–0GuatemalaDetails]]''United StatesMexico'''1-0USABrazil''1-0JamaicaDetails]]''United StatesCanada'''2–0Colombia''Peru''3]]''')Details]]''United StatesUSA'''2–0Costa RicaCanada2–1South Korea''Details]]''United States & Mexico'''ASDET]]Brazil''USA3–2Costa RicaDetails]]''United StatesUSA'''AET]]&PSPanamaColombia''3]]''')Details]]''United StatesUSA'''2–1MexicoCanada3]]''')(invited teams in italics) 1 No formal tournament was held.
