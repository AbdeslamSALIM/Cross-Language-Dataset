Acid jazz (also known as groove jazz in USA) is a musical genre that combines elements of jazz, funk and hip-hop, particularly looped beats. It developed the UK over the 1980s and 1990s and could be seen as tacking the sound of jazz-funk onto electronic dance/pop music. Acid jazz has also experienced minor influences from soul music, house music and disco.While acid jazz often contains various types of electronic composition (sometimes including sampling or live DJ cutting and scratching), it is just as likely to be played live by musicians, who often showcase jazz interpretation as part of their performance. The compositions of groups such as The Brand New Heavies and Incognito often feature chord structures usually associated with jazz music. The Heavies in particular were known in their early years for beginning their songs as catchy pop and rapidly steering them into jazz territory before "resolving" the composition and thus not losing any pop listeners but successfully "exposing" them to jazz elements in "baby steps".The acid jazz "movement" is also seen as a "revival" of jazz-funk or jazz fusion or soul jazz by leading DJs such as Norman Jay or Gilles Peterson or Patrick Forge, also known as "rare groove crate diggers".Origins in UKThe sound and clubs that went with it arose out of Southern England's rare groove scene of the late seventies and early eighties and various other alternative groups, including the London mod scene. It is distinguished from the Northern Soul scene (then popular in the South of England with clubs such as the 100 Club in Oxford Street) but still portrayed various similarities.The name came into common parlance with the Acid Jazz label but in reality the scene had existed in disparate forms and without a distinguishing name for some time beforehand. Journalists at the time appeared very confused by the genre and made various attempts to connect it to the London mod scene (by links with various former members of that scene, prominently Eddie Piller and the James Taylor Quartet &mdash; Taylor having formerly been Hammond Player for sixties garage band The Prisoners). Infamously, ID magazine ran an article on Acid Jazz Mods which irritated both mods and "acid jazz fans" in equal amounts.The scene always had two halves, those who liked the original jazz and soul recordings and those who followed the new bands signed by labels like Acid Jazz. It is the former who still probably support their music, many of the early bands having fallen well by the wayside. Attempts to integrate the music with hip hop and jungle are now regarded by many as misguided attempts to keep the music fresh whilst leading it a long way from its starting point, attempts that were regarded with disdain by many.An important gauge of the UK scene and the creation of the genre are to be found in the UK's Straight No Chaser magazine. Similarly, clothing labels like Duffer of St George were closely associated with the scene, although the "right outfit" was never essential.Disc jockeys Gilles Peterson and Chris Bangs are generally credited with coining the term acid jazz at a 1987 'Talkin' Loud Sayin Something' session. At the time, this was Peterson's regular Sunday afternoon club at Dingwalls in Camden, London.In his Radio 1 biography, Peterson describes how the term acid jazz came about. "We put on this old 7-inch by Mickey and the Soul Generation which was a rare groove record with a mad rock guitar intro and no beat. I started vary speeding it so it sounded all warped. Chris Bangs got on the microphone and said, 'If that was acid house, this is acid jazz'. That's how acid jazz started, just a joke!"BBC Radio 1 website, Gilles Peterson: Biography, (accessed 21 Mar 07) Most notable British acid jazz bands of 1990's included Brand New Heavies, Incognito, James Taylor Quartet, Jamiroquai (also classified as funk and disco) and US3 (also classified as jazz rap), as well as dozens of less commercially successful artists. Later, Repercussions who had a top hit, Promise me nothing. According to the book The Techno Primer, the 1993 album Road to Freedom by Young Disciples was "very influential" in the genre, as the band "set the tone for this movement."&lt;/ref&gt; Other more recent groups who have produced music in this genre include Mother Earth and Down to the Bone.Few record labels have specialized in acid jazz; some include "Acid jazz records", "Ninja tune", and "Mo'wax".International sceneIn the United States notable acid jazz groups have included Groove Collective and Brooklyn Funk Essentials; although during the 1990s the major contributions from the US to jazz fusion were predominantly in jazz-house (from labels such as 8 Ball Records) and jazz-rap, particularly by artists such as A Tribe Called Quest, Black Sheep, De la Soul, and the Jungle Brothers.From Japan, notable artists included DJ Krush, Gota and United Future Organization who released 'I Love my Baby: My Baby Loves Jazz' as well as a cover of Van Morrison's 'Moondance'; another prominent artist from Japan was the female vocalist, Monday Michiru.Acid jazz scene developed in Eastern Europe as well, with bands like Skalpel from Poland and Moscow Grooves Institute from Russia.Key artists Brand New HeaviesBrooklyn Funk EssentialsCorduroyCount BasicDigable PlanetsDJ KrushD*NoteD'InfluenceErik TruffazFunki PorciniGallianoGilles PetersonGroove CollectiveIncognitoJames Taylor QuartetJamiroquaiJazzanovaRonny JordanUnited Future OrganizationUS3Young DisciplesOther notable artists AzymuthBernard &quot;Pretty&quot; PurdieBirdBlue SixBonoboClazziquaiDirections In GrooveDJ GreyboyDodge City ProductionsDown to the BoneDreamlinDrizaboneD'SoundDZihan &amp; KamienFive Point PlanFreak PowerFour 80 EastGreyboy AllstarsGroove SquaredGota YashikiHeavyshiftHerbertJaga JazzistJazzholeJazztronikKoopKruder &amp; DorfmeisterKyoto Jazz MassiveLiquid SoulLos Amigos InvisiblesMarius KahanMark FarinaMelvin SparksMojackMoodymannMondo GrossoMonday MichiruMother EarthMukiNoel McKoyNicola ConteNujabesOmar Lye-FookPaolo Achenza TrioPaul MoranPhil DavisPrafulReuben WilsonRADShilts (Paul Weimar)SkalpelSmoke CitySnowboySoulstanceSoundscape UKSound Tribe Sector 9 (STS9)S-Tone Inc.The Cinematic OrchestraThievery CorporationVibraphonicXploding PlastixYoung DisciplesSee alsoAcid Jazz RecordsNu-jazzJazz rapBroken beatMichael Franti &amp; SpearheadTrip hopJazz-FunkSoul jazzJazz fusionDeep FunkNinja TuneGrooveraList of electronic music genresReferencesExternal linksAcid Jazz Portal'What Is Acid Jazz?' feature, 1988 by Chris HuntAcid-Jazz@UCSD.edu List ArchiveThe Acid Jazz Channel (over 2000 jazz and acid jazz vids that play continuously.)Acid Jazz BlogAcid Jazz ListeningCategory:Jazz genres * Category:Music genresca:Acid Jazz cs:Acid jazz de:Acid Jazz es:Acid jazz fa:جاز اسیدی fr:Acid jazz ko:애시드 재즈 id:Acid jazz it:Acid jazz he:אסיד ג'אז ka:ასიდ-ჯაზი nl:Acid jazz ja:アシッドジャズ no:Acid jazz pl:Acid-jazz pt:Acid jazz ru:Acid jazz fi:Acid jazz sv:Acid jazz uk:Ейсид-джаз zh:酸爵士
