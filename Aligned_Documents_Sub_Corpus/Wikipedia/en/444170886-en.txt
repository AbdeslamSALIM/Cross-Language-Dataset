It is also a suburb of Rome, which is 25&nbsp;km distant. It is bounded by other communes of Rome, Castel Gandolfo, Rocca di Papa, Ariccia and Ardea.HistoryAlbano is located in the area in which, according to the legend, Aeneas's son, Ascanius, founded Alba Longa. Today the coat of arms of Albano still sport the white (Latin: Alba) boar dreamt by Ascanius before the founding of the city. Alba Longa was one of the main cities of the Latins and, again according to the legend, the birthplace of Romulus and Remus, the mythical founders of Rome.Alba Longa acquired importance when the Appian Way was built nearby, and the Romans built numerous villas in the area. One of the most magnificent was that of emperor Domitian. In the 3rd century emperor Septimius Severus had a military camp, called Castra Albana,(Albano Barracks) built nearby to house a Roman legion of the central army reserve. It was an important military city that extended from the top of the hills descending to the Appian Way.Today's Albano developed from this settlements, as it is showed the main streets, which still follow the ancient decumanus and cardo. Remains of the large baths built by Septimius' son, Caracalla, are still visibile.During the Early Middle Ages the city was abandoned, regaining importance only in the 12th century for its strategic position across the Appian Way, but on 1170 the Commune of Rome Army destroyed the town. After it became a possession of the Savelli family, who resided there until 1697: it was thenceforth a Papal possession, the Popes maintaining today a villa in the communal territory.In the 18th century Albano became the summer residence of numerous Roman families, and the population increased substantially.Main sightsThe Tomb of the Curiazi and Orazi at Vth mile of Appian Way is a monumental construction of peperino stone, in original with five conical columns, only two preserved.The Pretorian Gate, it is the most important and impressive evidence of the encampment of the Parthian Legion (Legio II Parthica).The St Peter ChurchThe Church of the St Mary of the star and Catacombs.
