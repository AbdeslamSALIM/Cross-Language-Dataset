Edelman for determining the exact chemical structure of an antibody. Using an enzyme called papain, he broke the blood's immunoglobin into pieces, making them easier to study. He also looked into how the blood's immunoglobins react with cellular surfaces.He died in a road accident near Winchester, Hampshire and is survived by his wife and five children.ReferencesExternal linksBritannica InformationNobel Prize Biography Category:1917 births Category:1985 deaths Category:People from Newton-le-Willows Category:Alumni of the University of Liverpool Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:English Nobel laureates Category:English physiologists Category:English biochemists Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Road accident deaths in England Category:English Methodistsca:Rodney Robert Porter de:Rodney R.
