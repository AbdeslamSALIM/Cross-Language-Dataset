He was secretary general of the FDP (liberals) from 1978 to 1982.

Following this, Romanian journalists accused him of meddling in Romanian politics.In October 2006 he accused European Union officials of being impossible to control, stating inter alia the purported impossibility of firing Directors-General (the highest grade in the EU civil servants structure).
