He became the first Formula One driver to achieve 200 Grand Prix starts when he appeared at the 1990 British Grand Prix, and the first to achieve 250 starts at the 1993 German Grand Prix. Patrese entered 257 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix and started 256 races making him the second most experienced F1 driver in history, after Rubens Barrichello. In 2005 he returned to racing in the inaugural season of the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired F1 drivers.Formula One careerShadow and ArrowsPatrese was born in Padua, Veneto. He made his debut in 1977 with the Shadow racing team at the Monaco Grand Prix when the team were forced to change drivers mid-season. Later that year team-leader Jackie Oliver left Shadow to form the Arrows team, taking Patrese with him. Shadow took Arrows to court, arguing that the design of the Arrows car was so similar to their own that Arrows had stolen it. The court agreed, forcing Arrows to redesign their car, which they did in just six weeks. thumb|left|220px|Patrese driving a Shadow in 1977. In 1978 Patrese very nearly won Arrows' second race, the South African Grand Prix, until engine failure forced him to retire 15 laps from the end. Later that year, Patrese was involved in a pile-up when he came together with James Hunt and other drivers' cars at the start of the Italian Grand Prix. One of the other drivers involved was Ronnie Peterson, who, although his injuries were not in themselves life-threatening, died from an embolism the following day. Although Patrese was never officially blamed for the accident, Hunt led a fierce campaign against him and succeeded in having Patrese banned from the next race. TV replays suggested that it was Hunt who had caused the accident, but Hunt never accepted this and later continued to criticise Patrese when commentating on F1 races for BBC TV.BrabhamIn 1982 Patrese moved to Brabham and gained a lucky win at that year's Monaco Grand Prix when there were five leaders including Andrea de Cesaris and then Didier Pironi who both ran out of fuel whilst leading the final lap. A second win followed in 1983 at the South African Grand Prix. He also crashed out late in the race while leading at San Marino, but in a season which saw his team-mate Nelson Piquet claim his second Drivers' Championship title, Patrese finished a distant ninth. It would be seven years before he made another visit to the top step of the podium.Alfa Romeoin 1985.]] A move to Alfa Romeo in 1984 delivered two lacklustre seasons resulting in eight world championship points and a single visit to the podium at his home Grand Prix.Return to BrabhamIn 1986 Patrese returned to Brabham, but by now the team was a spent force and would never again take a driver to victory in a grand prix. Two more winless seasons followed despite the team's BMW engine being considered at the time to be the most powerful on the grid. Despite the trials of uncompetitive machinery, Patrese never publicly criticised the team and earned respect throughout the sport for his professionalism.Williamsat the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix.]]Toward the end of the 1987 season, Patrese was given the chance to revitalise what seemed to be a declining career when the Williams driver Nigel Mansell was injured whilst qualifying for the Japanese Grand Prix. With the help of Brabham owner Bernie Ecclestone, Patrese was drafted in to replace Mansell for the season's finale in Australia.Patrese impressed the Williams management sufficiently to be signed by them as Nelson Piquet's replacement for the 1988 season. However, 1988 saw Williams struggling with an uncompetitive car powered by non-turbocharged Judd engines and it was not until the following year and the arrival of Renault engines that Patrese and his team-mate Thierry Boutsen were able to challenge for race points. Patrese achieved an impressive 3rd place in the 1989 drivers championship, despite taking no wins. Patrese finally won his third Grand Prix at the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix and finished that year's Drivers' Championship in seventh place.at the 1991 Monaco Grand Prix.]]In 1991 Nigel Mansell returned to Williams and, together with Patrese, the team became genuine contenders for both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. Two wins in Mexico and Portugal gave Patrese his most competitive F1 season thus far and a respectable third place behind Championship contenders Mansell and Ayrton Senna.BenettonWilliams dominated F1 in 1992 and Patrese continued to deliver in his role of second driver to Nigel Mansell, moving out of the way for Mansell while leading comfortably at that year's French Grand Prix. Patrese took a single win at the Japanese Grand Prix and visited the podium eight other times. With Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell all desperately trying to sign for Williams, Patrese's position looked to be under threat and he signed for Benetton before the end of the year. Ironically, only Prost was able to agree terms with Williams for 1993 and would probably have been happy to have Patrese as a team-mate.RetirementWhile Williams continued to dominate F1 in 1993, Patrese found it difficult to live with his prodigiously talented new team-mate Michael Schumacher and before the end of the season Benetton informed Patrese that he was "free to seek an alternate drive". As most teams already had drivers signed for 1994, Patrese opted for retirement and brought the longest F1 career in history to a conclusion.In 2002, as thanks for his years of service to Williams, Patrese was invited to test the team's latest F1 car.In 2005 he returned to racing in the inaugural season of the Grand Prix Masters formula for retired F1 drivers. He finished third behind his former team-mate Nigel Mansell and Emerson Fittipaldi in the sole 2005 race at Kyalami, South Africa. His 2006 season was less successful with a 10th place finish at Losail in Qatar and a 6th at Silverstone.Patrese's record of 257 Grand Prix entries stood for 15 years, surviving the Schumacher era when Michael Schumacher retired on 250 race entries. Rubens Barrichello finally overhauled Patrese's total, recording his 258th Grand Prix entry at the 2008 Turkish Grand Prix. As part of the "handover", Patrese tested a Honda RA107 at Jerez on September 9 (Barrichello drives for Honda).Complete Formula One World Championship results(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position / Races in italics indicate fastest lap)YrEntrantChassisEngine1234567891011121314151617WDCPoints1977]]Shadow Racing Team]]Shadow]] DN8Cosworth V8ARG]]BRA]]RSA]]USW]]ESP]]MON9BELRetSWE]]FRARetGBRRetGER10AUT]]NED13ITARetUSA]]CAN10JPN620th11978Arrows Racing TeamFA1]]Cosworth V8ARG]]BRA10RSARetUSW6MON6BELRetESPRetSWE2FRA8GBRRetGER912th11A1]]AUTRetNEDRetITARetUSA]]CAN41979Warsteiner Arrows Racing TeamA1]]Cosworth V8ARGDNSBRA9RSA11USWRetESP10BEL5MONRetCANRet20th2A2]]FRA14GBRRetGERRetAUTRetNEDRetITA13USARet1980]]Arrows Racing Team]]A3]]Cosworth V8ARGRetBRA6RSARetUSW2BELRetMON8FRA9GBR9GER9AUT14NEDRetITARetCANRetUSARet9th71981]]Arrows Racing Team]]A3]]Cosworth V8USWRetBRA3ARG7SMR2BELRetMONRetESPRetFRA14GBR10GERRetAUTRetNEDRetITARetCANRetLVS1111th101982Parmalat Racing TeamBT50]]BMW]] Straight-4RSARetBELRetNED15GBRRetFRA14GERRetAUTRetSUI5ITARetLVSRet10th21BT49D]]Cosworth V8BRARetMON1USERetCAN2BT49C]]USW3SMR]]1983Fila SportBT52]]BMW Straight-4BRARetUSW10FRARetSMR13MONRetBELRetUSERetCANRet9th13BT52B]]GBRRetGER3AUTRetNED9ITARetEUR7RSA11984]]Benetton]] Team Alfa RomeoAlfa Romeo]] 184TAlfa Romeo]] V8BRARetRSA4BELRetSMRRetFRARetMONRetCANRetUSERetUSARetGBR12GERRetAUT10NEDRetITA3EUR6POR813th81985Benetton Team Alfa RomeoAlfa Romeo]] 185TAlfa Romeo V8BRARetPORRetSMRRetMONRetCAN10USERetFRA11GBR9-0Alfa Romeo]] 184TGERRetAUTRetNEDRetITARetBELRetEUR9RSARetEURRet1986Motor Racing Developments Ltd.BT55]]BMW Straight-4BRARetESPRetSMR6MONRetBEL8CANRetUSE6FRARetGERRetHUNRetAUTRetITARetPORRetMEX13AUSRet17th2BT54]]GBRRet1987Motor Racing Developments Ltd.]]BT56]]BMW]] Straight-4BRARetSMR9BELRetMONRetUSE9FRARetGBRRetGERRetHUN5AUTRetITARetPORRetESP13MEX3JPN1113th6Canon]] Williams TeamWilliams]] FW11BHonda]] V6AUS91988]]Canon]] Williams TeamWilliams]] FW12Judd]] V8BRARetSMR13MON6MEXRetCANRetUSERetFRARetGBR8GERRetHUN6BELRetITA7PORRetESP5JPN6AUS411th81989Canon Williams TeamWilliams]] FW12CRenault V10BRARetSMRRetMON15MEX2USA2CAN2FRA3GBRRetGER4HUNRetBELRetITA4ESP53rd40Williams]] FW13PORRetJPN2AUS31990]]Canon]] Williams RenaultWilliams]] FW13BRenault]] V10USA9BRA13SMR1MONRetCANRetMEX9FRA6GBRRetGER5HUN4BELRetITA5POR7ESP5JPN4AUS67th231991]]Canon]] Williams TeamWilliams]] FW14Renault]] V10USARetBRA2SMRRetMONRetCAN3MEX1FRA5GBRRetGER2HUN3BEL5ITARetPOR1ESP3JPN3AUS53rd531992]]Canon]] Williams TeamWilliams]] FW14BRenault]] V10RSA2MEX2BRA2ESPRetSMR2MON3CANRetFRA2GBR2GER8HUNRetBEL3ITA5PORRetJPN1AUSRet2nd561993Camel Benetton FordBenetton]] B192BFord V8RSARetBRARet5th20Benetton]] B193EUR5FRA10GBR3GER5HUN2BEL6ITA5POR16JPNRetAUS8Benetton]] B193BSMRRetESP4MONRetCANRetReferences External linksRiccardo Patrese Official WebsiteRiccardo Patrese: The Italian Hero        Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:People from Padua Category:Italian racecar drivers Category:Italian Formula One drivers Category:Alfa Romeo Formula One drivers Category:European Formula Two Championship drivers Category:European Formula Three Championship drivers Category:Grand Prix Masters drivers Category:Monaco Grand Prix winnersbg:Рикардо Патрезе ca:Riccardo Patrese cs:Riccardo Patrese de:Riccardo Patrese es:Riccardo Patrese fr:Riccardo Patrese hr:Riccardo Patrese id:Riccardo Patrese it:Riccardo Patrese lv:Rikardo Patrēze hu:Riccardo Patrese nl:Riccardo Patrese ja:リカルド・パトレーゼ pl:Riccardo Patrese pt:Riccardo Patrese ro:Riccardo Patrese ru:Патрезе, Рикардо sl:Riccardo Patrese fi:Riccardo Patrese sv:Riccardo Patrese
