  .]]      In Assyrian and Babylonian mythology, Pazuzu was the king of the demons of the wind, and son of the god Hanbi. He also represented the southwestern wind, the bearer of storms and drought.IconographyPazuzu is often depicted as a combination of animal and human parts. He has the body of a man, the head of a lion or dog, eagle-like taloned feet, two pairs of wings, a scorpion's tail, and a serpentine penis. He is often depicted with his right hand pointing upward.MythologyPazuzu is the god of the southwest wind known for bringing famine during dry seasons, and locusts during rainy seasons. Recent research suggests Pazuzu may have been associated with a cold, northeasterly wind. Pazuzu was said to be invoked in amulets which combat the powers of the malicious goddess, and hated rival, Lamashtu, who was believed to cause harm to mother and child during childbirth. Although Pazuzu is, himself, an evil spirit, he drives away other evil spirits, thus protecting humans against plagues and misfortunes.ReferencesExternal linksThe Demon of the South-West WindOriental Institute of Chicago figure of PazuzuCategory:Mesopotamian legendary creatures Category:Mesopotamian mythologyca:Pazuzu cs:Pazúzu de:Pazuzu el:Παζούζου es:Pazuzu fr:Pazuzu (mythologie) it:Pazuzu hu:Pazuzu nl:Pazuzu ja:パズズ pl:Pazuzu (demon) pt:Pazuzu fi:Pazuzu sv:Pazuzu tr:Pazuzu
