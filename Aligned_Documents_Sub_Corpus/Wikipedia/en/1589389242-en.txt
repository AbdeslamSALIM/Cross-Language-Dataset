 The English Electric Canberra is a first-generation jet-powered light bomber manufactured in large numbers through the 1950s. It proved to be highly adaptable, serving in such varied roles for tactical bombing, photographic, electronics, and meteorological reconnaissance. The Canberra remained in service with the Royal Air Force until 23 June 2006, 57 years after its first flight.Design and developmentThe Canberra had its origins in 1944 as a replacement for the unarmed high speed, high altitude de Havilland Mosquito bomber. Several British aircraft manufacturers submitted proposals. Among the companies shortlisted to proceed with development studies was English Electric, a well-established industrial manufacturer with very little aircraft experience. A desperate need for bombers arose during the early years of World War II, when English Electric began to build the Hampden under licence.The new English Electric design team was headed by former Westland chief designer W. E. W. Petter. The aircraft was named Canberra after the capital of Australia by Sir George Nelson, chairman of English Electric, because Australia was the first export customer for the aircraft. Ransom, Stephen & Fairclough, Robert (1987) English Electric Aircraft and their Predecessors Putnam ISBN 0-85177-806-2 In May 1945 a contract was signed, but with the post-war military reductions, the prototype did not fly until May 1949. It was a simple design, looking like a scaled-up Gloster Meteor with a shoulder wing. The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low aspect ratio wings was broken only by the tubular engine nacelles.Although jet-powered and of all-metal construction, the Canberra design philosophy was very much in the Mosquito mould, i.e. provide room for a substantial bomb load, fit two of the most powerful engines available, and wrap it in the smallest, most aerodynamic package possible. Rather than devote space and weight to defensive armament &mdash; which historically could not overcome purpose-designed fighter aircraft &mdash; the Canberra was designed to fly fast and high enough to avoid air-to-air combat entirely.Basic designThe Canberra is an all-metal aircraft. The fuselage is of semi-monocoque construction with a pressurized nose compartment. Each crew member has a Martin-Baker ejection seat, except for the B(I)8 and export versions of the B(I)8, where the navigator has to rely on a conventional escape hatch and parachute. The fuselage contains two bomb bays with conventional clamshell doors (a rotating door was implemented on the Martin-built B-57 Canberra). The wing is of single-spar construction with the spar passing through the fuselage. Outside of the engine nacelles, the wing has a leading edge sweep of 4° and trailing edge sweep of -14°. Controls are conventional with ailerons, four-section flaps, and airbrakes on top and bottom surfaces of the wings.It is designed for a crew of two, under a fighter-style canopy, but delays in the development of the intended automatic radar bombsight resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position in the nose. Wingspan and length were almost identical at just under 20 metres, maximum takeoff weight a little under 25 tonnes. Thrust was provided by a pair of 30 kN axial flow Rolls-Royce Avon turbojets.Prototypes and first flightsIn the autumn of 1945, Air Ministry specification B.3/45 requested production of four prototypes. Although construction began in early 1946, the first aircraft flew only on 13 May 1949. In the interim, the Air Ministry had already ordered 132 production aircraft in bomber, reconnaissance, and training variants. The prototype proved vice-free and required only a few modifications. A new glazed nose had to be fitted to accommodate a bombardier because the advanced bombing avionics were not ready for production, the engines were upgraded to more powerful Avon R.A.3s, and the distinctive teardrop-shaped fuel tanks were fitted under the wingtips.The resultant Canberra B.2 first flew on 21 April 1950, and entered squadron service with Royal Air Force (RAF) 101 Sqn in May 1951. In a testament to the aircraft's benign handling characteristics, the transition program consisted of only 20 hours in the Gloster Meteor and three hours in the dual-control Canberra trainer. With a maximum speed of 470 kt (871 km/h), a standard service ceiling of 48,000 ft (14,600 m), and the ability to carry a 3.6 tonne payload, the Canberra was an instant success. It was built in 27 versions which equipped 35 RAF squadrons, and were exported to Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Ethiopia, France, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Peru, Rhodesia, South Africa, Sweden, Venezuela and West Germany.Other manufacturersIn the United States where the US Air Force needed to replace the B-26 Invader, 403Donald 1986, p18 Canberras were manufactured under licence by Martin as the B-57 Canberra in several versions. While these were initially almost exactly the same as the English Electric pattern aircraft, later models had a series of substantial modifications. In Australia, the Government Aircraft Factory (GAF) built 48 for the Royal Australian Air Force, broadly similar to the British B.2 but with a modified leading edge, increased fuel capacity and room for three starter cartridges (although in practice, all three cartridges would sometimes fire, leading to the triple starter units being loaded singly.Wilson, Stewart, (1989) Lincoln, Canberra and F-111 in Australian Service. Aerosplace Publications Pty Ltd ISBN 0-9587978-3-8In the United Kingdom, the demand for Canberras exceeded English Electric's ability to supply airframes, and so Handley Page and Short Brothers manufactured them under licence.Barnes and James 1989, p.508. 901 Canberras were manufactured in the UK, total worldwide Canberra production being 1,352.Operational historythumb|right|A [[Government Aircraft Factory|GAF Canberra photographed at Avalon (near Melbourne) in early 2003.]] thumb|right|The Temora Aviation Museum's Canberra photographed at [[Nowra, New South Wales|Nowra Air Show 6 May 2007.]] Canberras remained in front-line service with major air forces throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and continued to serve as bombers and reconnaissance aircraft with minor air forces through the 1980s and 1990s. In the UK, the PR9 variant remained in service with 39 (1PRU) Squadron until July 2006 for tactical reconnaissance and photographic mapping, seeing service in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and, as recently as June 2006, in Afghanistan. The only Canberras remaining in active service are two American-built B-57s operated by NASA for high altitude research.The Canberra played a part in many conflicts, being employed as a bomber by the RAF during the Suez Crisis; by the UK, New Zealand, and Australia in the Malayan Emergency; by the United States and Australia in Vietnam; by Ethiopia against Eritrea and then Somalia during the 1970s; by both Rhodesia and South Africa in their respective Bush Wars and by Argentina in the Falklands War.The Canberra was the backbone of the Indian Air Force for bombing raids and photo reconnaissance. It was first used in 1962 by the IAF as part of the UN campaign against the breakaway Katanga republic in Africa. During the Indo-Pakistani Wars of the 1960s and 1970s, the Canberra was used by both sides. The most audacious use of the bomber was in the "Raid on Badin" during the Second Kashmir War, when the Indian Air Force sent in the Canberra to bomb a vital Pakistani radar post in West Pakistan. The raid was a complete success with the radars in Badin being badly damaged and put out of commission.The Kashmir War, 1965: Raid on Badin - Air Combat Information Group In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 they flew a very important sortie hitting the Karachi oil tanks, helping the Indian Navy to carry out their missile boat attacks.WHAT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; On 21 May 1999, prior to the commencement of the Kargil War, the Air HQ of the Indian Air Force assigned a Canberra PR57 aircraft on a photographic mission near the LOC (Line of Control), where it took a severe blow from a FIM-92 Stinger infrared homing missile on the starboard engine and with only one operational engine left it still managed to return to base. The Canberras were finally retired by the IAF after 50 years of service on 11 May 2007.Canberra B-57: IAF's 'Wild Weasel' retires after 50 years of serviceDuring the Vietnam War, GAF Canberras from 2 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force were valued because of their optical bombsights; these meant they could carry out bombing raids from higher altitudes, often with total surprise. More modern bombers and attack aircraft either used less-accurate electronic targeting equipment and/or dive bombing tactics, which risked greater losses to Viet Cong and North Vietnamese anti-aircraft fire.The Swedish Air Force purchased two Canberras from the RAF in 1960 and had these modified to T11s by Boulton Paul. The aircraft were secretly modified in Sweden to espionage aircraft for eavesdropping on primarily Soviet, Polish and East German military radio transmissions, although this was not publicly admitted until ten years later. The Canberras were given the designation Tp52, and taken into service as 'testing aircraft', until they were replaced by two Tp85 Caravelles in 1971.van der Aart 1985, p22The Argentine Air Force received 10 B.62 and 2 T.64 trainers at the beginning of the 1970s. During the 1982 Falklands War, eight of them were deployed to Trelew, (a distance of 670 mi (1,080 km) from the islands) to avoid congestion on the closer southern airfields. From May 1 to June 14, they made 35 sorties, 25 of them at night against ground troops. Two aircraft were lost, one to a RN Sea Harrier using a AM9L Sidewinder Air-to-air missile on the 1st May 1982 (Lt. Ibanez and Lt. Gonzalez ejected but were not rescued) and another to ship-launched Sea Dart missile on the 13th June 1982 (the pilot, Capt. Pastran, ejected safely but Capt. Casado was killed).The Canberra could fly at a higher altitude than any other bomber right through the 1950s and set a world altitude record of 70,310 ft (21,430 m) in 1957.The RAF's three-seat trainer Canberra T4s flew their last flights at RAF Marham in September 2005 because of the retirement of the photo-reconnaissance Canberras on 23 June 2006. In the twilight of their service these had been operational over Afghanistan. Sources indicate that there is no prospective replacement for the Canberra for future reconnaissance work such as that over Afghanistan.ClosureA ceremony to mark the closure of No. 39 (PRU) Sqn took place at RAF Marham on Friday 28 July 2006. The ceremony included a flypast by a Canberra PR9 on its last ever sortie. RAF Canberras made their final flights on 31 July when three were delivered to their new home with Delta Jets at Kemble. They have been purchased by private agencies and will be kept serviceable pending developments which might include contract work.After the Canberra left RAF service, the other full-time military operator, the Indian Air Force, announced the withdrawal of the Canberra from combat service from March 2007. The last Canberras operated by the Indian Air Force have retired after a 50 year career. Other Canberras are retained by the Air Force of Peru and several ex-RAF machines and RB-57s are flying in the US for research and mapping work.About ten airworthy Canberras are in private hands today, and are a popular feature at flying displays.Flight records set by Canberras1951 - first non-stop transatlantic crossing by a jet.NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston website1952 - first double transatlantic crossing by a jet.1953 - height record - FAI World Records1955 - height record - &quot;Centennial of Flight&quot; web-site1957 - height record - &quot;Centennial of Flight&quot; web-siteFAI World RecordsCanberra B.2 (WK163) with a Napier Double Scorpion rocket motor in AugustVariantsSee B-57 Canberra article for the US-built variants.English Electric A.1The first Canberra prototype.Canberra B.1Pre-production prototype, 4 built.Canberra B.2First production version, crew increased to 3 with addition of bomb aimer, Avon R.A.3 engines with 6,500 lbf (28.91 kN) of thrust, wingtip fuel tanks. 418 built by English Electric (208), Avro (75), Handley Page (75) and Short Brothers &amp; Harland (60) including 8 for export (Australia, United States and Venezuela)Canberra PR.3Photo-reconnaissance version of B.2, 36 built.Canberra T.4First trainer variant with dual controls, 75 built including 7 for export.Canberra B.5Prototype of second-generation Canberra with fuel tanks in the wings and Avon R.A.7 engines with 7,490 lbf (33.32 kN) of thrust, one built.Canberra B.6Production version based on B.5. 1 ft (0.3 m) fuselage stretch, could be fitted with a belly pack with 4x 20 mm Hispano cannon for strafing. 106 built by English Electric (57) and Short Brothers & Harland (49), includes 12 for export.Canberra B.6RCRC= Radio Countermeasures - Specialist ELINT version only 4 produced.
