, Havant, Hampshire.]]  street letter box from c.1850]] A post box (British English and others, also written postbox), (in the U.S. and Canada, collection box, mailbox, or drop box) is a physical box intended for use by the general public in order to collect outgoing mail (mail sent to a destination). The term Post box can also refer to a private letter box for incoming mail.Varieties of post boxes (for outgoing mail) include:Lamp boxPillar boxWall boxLudlow wall boxHistory of post boxesEuropeIn 1653, the first post boxes are believed to have been installed in Paris, France. By 1829, post boxes were in use throughout France.In Britain the first pillar post boxes were erected in Jersey in 1852. Roadside wall boxes first appeared in 1857 as a cheaper alternative to pillar boxes, especially in rural districts. In 1853 the first pillar box on the British mainland was erected at Botchergate, Carlisle. In 1856 Richard Redgrave of the Department of Science and Art designed an ornate pillar box for use in London and other large cities. In 1859 the design was improved, and this became the first National Standard pillar box. Green was adopted as the standard colour for the early Victorian post boxes. Between 1866 and 1879 the hexagonal Penfold post box became the standard design for pillar boxes and it was during this period that red was first adopted as the standard colour. The first boxes to be painted red were in London in July 1874, although it would be nearly 10 years before all the boxes had been repainted.The first public letter boxes (post boxes) in Russia appeared in 1848 in St. Petersburg. They were made of wood and iron. Because these boxes were lightweight and easy to steal, they disappeared frequently; later boxes were made of cast iron and could weigh up to 45 kilograms.North AmericaThe United States Post Office Department began installing public mail collection boxes in the 1850s outside post offices and on street corners in large cities. Collection boxes were initially mounted on lamp-posts. As mail volume grew, the Post Office Department gradually replaced these small boxes with larger models. The four-footed, free-standing U.S. Mail collection box was first suggested in 1894, following the successful use of such designs in Canada, and quickly became a fixture on U.S. city street corners. Unlike Canadian mailboxes, which were painted redCanadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, History In A Box: Red Forever!, Civilisation.ca. http://www.civilisations.ca/cpm/histbox/canad_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, U.S. mail collection boxes were originally painted a dark green to avoid confusion with emergency and fire equipment, then to red and blue in the 1950s, and finally, all-blue with contrasting lettering. The coming of the automobile also influenced U.S. mailbox design, and in the late 1930s, an extension chute or 'snorkel' to drive-up curbside collection boxes was adopted.  "Snorkel" collection boxes for drive-through access]]Types of post boxesSome postal operators have different types of post boxes for different types of mail, such as, regular post, air mail and express mail, for local addresses (defined by a range of postal codes) and out-of-town addresses, or for post bearing postage stamps and post bearing a postage meter indicator.Some countries have different coloured postboxes; in countries such as Australia, Portugal, and Russia, the colour indicates which type of mail a box is to be used for, such as 1st and 2nd class post. However, in Germany and parts of Sweden, because of postal deregulation, the different colours are for the different postal services. For example, in Germany, yellow is for Deutsche Post (the incumbent) and blue for the private companies, such as, Morgenpost Briefservice in Germany. Other nations use a particular colour to indicate common political or historical ties.Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, Colour, A Postal Symbol, Civilisation.ca. http://www.civilisations.ca/cpm/histbox/couleu_e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;Post boxes or mailboxes located outdoors are designed to keep mail secure and protected from weather. Some boxes have a rounded or slanted top or a downturned entry slot to protect mail from rain or snow. Locks are fitted for security, so mail can be retrieved only by official postal employees, and the box will ordinarily be constructed so as to resist damage from vandalism, forcible entry, or other causes. Bright colours are often used to increase visibility and prevent accidents and injuries. Entry openings are designed to allow the free deposit of mail, yet prevent retrieval via the access slot by unauthorised persons.ClearancePost boxes are emptied ("cleared") at times usually listed on the box in a TOC, Times of Collection, plate affixed to the box. In metropolitan areas, this might be once or twice a day. Busy boxes might be cleared at other times to avoid overflowing, and also to spread the work for the sorters. Extra clearances are made in the period leading up to Christmas, to prevent boxes becoming clogged with mail.Since 2005, most Royal Mail post boxes have had the time of only the last collection of the day listed on the box, with no indication of whether the box is cleared at other times earlier in the day. The reason given for this by the Royal Mail is that they needed to increase the font size of the wording on the "plate" listing the collection times to improve legibility for those with poor sight and that consequently there was insufficient room for listing all collection times throughout the day. Some post boxes may indicate the next collection time by a metal 'tab' or dial that can be changed while the box is open. The tab displays a day or number, each number corresponding to a different time shown on the plate.Terrorismfrom the 1996 bomb]] During 1939 a number of bombs were put in postboxes by the IRA as part of their S-Plan campaign. When the IRA bombed the Arndale shopping centre in Manchester, UK in 1996 just about the only thing that survived unscathed was a Victorian pillar box dating from 1887 (A type A Jubilee pillar).In 1952, a number of post boxes were attacked in Scotland in a dispute over the title adopted by the British monarch and displayed in cypher on the boxes. This included at least one which was blown apart with an explosive device.In the United States of America, nearly 7,000 USPS collection boxes were removed following the aftermath of the September, 11, 2001 terrorist attack and the 2001 anthrax attacks in which letters containing anthrax spores were placed in public collection boxes. Since that time, a decrease in first-class mail volume and the onset of online bill payment processing has resulted in lower demand for collection box service in the U.S. Colours  RedArgentinaAustraliaBelgiumCanadaDenmarkGibraltarGreece (express post)HungaryIcelandIndiaIsle of ManIsraelItaly (domestic post)KoreaJapanJerseyMacauMalaysiaMaltaNetherlands - surviving heritage and PTT boxesNew ZealandNorway (national and international mail)PolandPortugalRomaniaSpain (express mail)SingaporeSouth AfricaThailandUnited KingdomAll Royal Mail / GPO post boxes were painted BS 538 Post Office Red between 1874 and 1969. With the introduction of the K8 Telephone kiosk in 1969, a new "red" colour was adopted for GPO street furniture, designated B.S. 539 Post Haste Red. After British Telecom and Royal Mail were split by the British Government, BT continued to use BS539 exclusively, whilst Royal Mail use both BS538 and BS539 in a seemingly random way. Prior to 1859 there was no standard colour although there is a document in the BPMA archive indicating that optionally, the lettering and Royal cypher could be picked out in white or black. In 1859, a bronze green colour became standard until 1874. It took ten years for every box to be repainted during this period).

Exceptions are the Anonymous pillar boxes of 1879–87, where the cypher was omitted, and all boxes for use in Scotland manufactured after 1952 (including replicas of the 1866 Penfold design) which show the Queen's Crown of Scotland instead of the Royal Cypher for Elizabeth II. Private boxes emptied by Royal Mail do not have to carry a cypher. Royal Mail postboxes manufactured since 1994 carry the wording "Royal Mail", normally above the aperture (lamp boxes) or on the door (pillar boxes). Before this date all post boxes, with the exception of the Anonymous pillar boxes, carried the wording "Post Office".United States &mdash; the United States Postal Service (USPS) eagle logo, except that boxes for Express Mail use the USPS Express Mail logo.Gallery of Post Boxes from around the world Image:RoyalMailPostBoxMansfieldCollegeHiraV.jpg|British Edward VII Type A pillar box of 1902 by A.Handyside of Derby in front of Mansfield College, Oxford image:French-post.jpg|French Post Box at Dinard airport Image:Ile de Bréhart Boîte aux lettres 20546.jpg|French Post Box at Ile de Bréhat Image:PortugalPostBoxes.jpg|Post Boxes in Lisbon, Portugal (1st class mail in blue and 2nd class in red) image:Indian_Post_Box.jpg|Post Box of Indian Postal Service Image:PBO007.gif|VR pillar box in Kilkenny, Ireland, painted green with obvious door repair Image:Anpost.jpg|Irish Lamp Box erected by An Post Image:Cassetta posta italiana.jpg|Italian domestic Post Box image:Post1.jpg|Japanese Post Box at the Osaka Central Post Office image:Thailand-post.jpg|Thailand Post Box, Bangkok image:pbalson_20060527_IMG_3615.JPG|U.S. Post Box in front of the Post Office in Conneaut, Ohio image:Wall_box_in_phone_kiosk.jpg|Post box incorporated into a Type K4 telephone kiosk, introduced in 1927. 10 survive in the UK of this design by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott which also incorporates two stamp vending machines.
