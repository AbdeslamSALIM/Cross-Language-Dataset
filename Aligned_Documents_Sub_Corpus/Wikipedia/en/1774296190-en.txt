 The United Nations Charter is the treaty that forms and establishes the international organization called the United Nations.Introductory Note It was signed at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco, California, United States, on June 26, 1945, by 50 of the 51 original member countries (Poland, the other original member, which was not represented at the conference, signed it later). It entered into force on October 24, 1945, after being ratified by the five permanent members of the Security Council&mdash;the Republic of China (later replaced by the People's Republic of China), France, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (later replaced by the Russian Federation), the United Kingdom, and the United States&mdash;and a majority of the other signatories.As a Charter, it is a constituent treaty, and all members are bound by its articles. Furthermore, the Charter states that obligations to the United Nations prevail over all other treaty obligations. Most countries in the world have now ratified the Charter. One notable exception is the Holy See, which has chosen to remain a permanent observer state and therefore is not a full signatory to the Charter. http://www.holyseemission.org/short_history.htmlOrganization of the documentThe Charter consists of a preamble and a series of articles grouped into chapters.Chapter I sets forth the purposes of the United Nations, including the important provisions of the maintenance of international peace and security.Chapter II defines the criteria for membership in the United Nations.Chapters III-XV, the bulk of the document, describe the organs and institutions of the UN and their respective powers.Chapters XVI and Chapter XVII describe arrangements for integrating the UN with established international law.Chapters XVIII and Chapter XIX provide for amendment and ratification of the Charter.The following chapters deal with the enforcement powers of UN bodies:Chapter VI describes the Security Council's power to investigate and mediate disputes;'Chapter VII ' describes the Security Council's power to authorize economic, diplomatic, and military sanctions, as well as the use of military force, to resolve disputes;Chapter VIII makes it possible for regional arrangements to maintain peace and security within their own region;Chapters IX and Chapter X describe the UN's powers for economic and social cooperation, and the Economic and Social Council that oversees these powers;Chapters XII and Chapter XIII describe the Trusteeship Council, which oversaw decolonization;Chapters XIV and Chapter XV establish the powers of, respectively, the International Court of Justice and the United Nations Secretariat.Chapters XVI through Chapter XIX deal respectively with XVI: miscellaneous provisions, XVII: transitional security arrangements related to World War II, XVIII: the charter amendment process, and XIX: ratification of the charter.Purposes of the United NationsChapter 1, Article 1 of the UN Charter states:The Purposes of the United Nations areTo maintain international peace and security, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace;To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion;
