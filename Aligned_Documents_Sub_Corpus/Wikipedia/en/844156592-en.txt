Old Irish is the name given to the oldest form of the Irish language, or, rather, the Goidelic languages, for which extensive written texts are possessed. It was used from the 6th to the 10th centuries, when it gave way to Middle Irish.A still older form of Irish is known as Primitive Irish. Fragments of Primitive Irish, mainly personal names, are known from inscriptions on stone written in the Ogham alphabet. These inscriptions date from about the 4th to the 6th centuries. Primitive Irish is still very close to Common Celtic, the ancestor of all Celtic languages.Old Irish first appears in the margins of Latin religious manuscripts as early as the 6th century. A large number of early Irish literary texts, though recorded in manuscripts of the Middle Irish period (such as Lebor na hUidre and the Book of Leinster), are essentially Old Irish in character.Old Irish is the ancestor of Modern Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx (spoken on the Isle of Man). However, it is quite distinct from these. Broadly speaking, the grammar and sound systems of the modern languages are simpler than those of Old Irish.Contemporary Old Irish scholarship is still greatly influenced by the works of a small number of scholars active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, among them Rudolf Thurneysen (1857-1940) and Osborn Bergin (1873-1950). Their books are viewed as required material for any enthusiast of Old Irish even today.PhonologyConsonantsThe consonant inventory of Old Irish is shown in the chart below.  represent fortis sonorants whose precise articulation is unknown, but which were probably longer, tenser, and generally more strongly articulated than their lenis counterparts . Like Modern Irish, Old Irish exhibits contrasts between "broad" (velarized) and "slender" (palatalized) consonants.&nbsp;Labial]]Dental]]Alveolar]]Velar]]Glottal]]Nasalbroad&nbsp;slender&nbsp;Plosivebroad&nbsp;slender&nbsp;FricativebroadslenderNasalized fricativebroad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slender&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approximantbroad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slender&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lateralbroad&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slender&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some details of Old Irish phonetics are not known.  may have been pronounced  or , as in Modern Irish.  may have been the same sound as  and/or .  and  may have been pronounced  and  respectively. The difference between  and  may have been that the former were trills while the latter were flaps.VowelsThe inventory of Old Irish monophthongs is:&nbsp;ShortLongClose]]Mid]]Open]]The distribution of short vowels in unstressed syllables is a little complicated. All short vowels may appear in unstressed final open syllables (an open syllable is one with no coda consonant), after both broad and slender consonants. The front vowels  and  are often spelled ae and ai after broad consonants, which might indicate a retracted pronunciation here, perhaps something like  and . All ten possibilities are shown in the following examples:sga|''marba''  "kill" (1 sg. subj.)sga|''léicea''  "leave" (1 sg. subj.)sga|''marbae''  "kill" (2 sg. subj.)sga|''léice''  "leave" (2 sg. subj.)sga|''marbai''  "kill" (2 sg. indic.)sga|''léici''  "leave" (2 sg. indic.)sga|''súlo''  "eye" (gen.)sga|''doirseo''  "door" (gen.)sga|''marbu''  "kill" (1 sg. indic.)sga|''léiciu''  "leave" (1 sg. indic.)In unstressed closed syllables (that is, those with a syllable coda), the quality of a short vowel is almost entirely predictable by whether the surrounding consonants are broad or slender. Between two broad consonants, the vowel is , as in   "vengeance" (nom.). Between a slender and a broad consonant the vowel is , as in   "law" (nom./acc.). Before a slender consonant the vowel is , as in   "vengeance" (acc./dat.), and   "law" (gen.). The chief exceptions to this pattern are that  frequently appears when the following syllable contained an *ū in Proto-Celtic (for example,   "law" (dat.)
