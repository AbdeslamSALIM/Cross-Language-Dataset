  The Gulf of Ob (also known as Ob Bay) (, Obskaya guba) is an immense bay of the Arctic Ocean in Northern Russia, at the head of which is the mouth of the Ob River.This Gulf flows into the Kara Sea between the Yamal and the Gydan peninsulas. It is is about 1,000&nbsp;km (600&nbsp;mi) long and varies from about 50&nbsp;km (30&nbsp;mi) to 80&nbsp;km (50&nbsp;mi) in width, running generally north and south. It is relatively shallow, with an average depth from ten to twelve metres which restricts heavy sea transport. The Taz Estuary is an eastern side-branch formed by the Taz River.==Islands== There are several islands near the mouth of the Ob, at the beginning of the estuary, like Khaley. All these islands are close to the shore and they are generally flat and low-lying. They are protected wetlands under Ramsar. Further north, except for a few islands located close to the shore, like Khalevigo and Nyavigo, the Gulf of Ob is free of islands until it meets the Kara Sea.Economic importanceVery large gas and oil deposits have been discovered in this region. Oil and gas from the wells are sent South via pipeline and rail transport. The Yamburg gas field was in 2001 considered to be one of the largest in the world, and lies between the southern portion of the gulf and the Taz Estuary to the east.External linksIslands at the mouth of the ObProtected wetlandsA very thorough paper about this region  Category:Gulfs of Russia Category:Gulfs of the Arctic Ocean Category:Kara Sea Category:Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrugde:Obbusen es:Golfo del Obi fr:Golfe de l'Ob ko:오비 만 nl:Obboezem ja:オビ湾 no:Obbukta nn:Obbukta pl:Zatoka Obska ru:Обская губа tr:Obi Körfezi
