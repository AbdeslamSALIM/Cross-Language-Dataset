According to Forbes Magazine's list of "America's Wildest Weather Cities," Springfield is the city with the most varied weather in the nation.HistoryDuring the Civil War, Missouri was divided and a number of battles were fought in the Ozarks. Springfield itself saw a short but violent clash in 1863. Following the Civil War, Springfield saw some growth from Westward expansion. In 1865 the first “quick draw” duel of Old West fame took place on the town square when Wild Bill Hickok killed Davis Tutt Jr. The first train of the Atlantic-Pacific Railway, which became the St Louis-San Francisco Railway or "Frisco," arrived in 1870. This led to rapid growth and for many decades Springfield prospered as an important railway junction.In 1906, a mob broke into the town jail and lynched three African-American men, Horace Duncan, Fred Coker, and Will Allen. They were hanged and burned by a mob over 2,000 strong without trial in the town square. This event sparked a mass exodus of African-Americans from the area, who still remain an extreme minority. A small plaque on the south-east corner of the square is the town's only reminder. The men were hung on the town square from a tower which held a replica of the Statue of Liberty. In the immediate aftermath, two commemorative coins were minted celebrating the lynching.National Register of Historic PlacesAbou Ben Adhem Shrine MosqueChrist Episcopal ChurchGillioz TheaterJefferson Street FootbridgeLanders TheatreSpringfield National CemeteryLindberg's TavernStone ChapelWilson's Creek National BattlefieldWalnut Street Historical District http://www.walnuthistoricdistrict.com/Home.htmlNameThe origin of the name Springfield remains unclear. Writing in 1883 the historian R. I. Holcombe states, "The town took its name from the circumstance of there being a spring under the hill, on the creek, while on top of the hill, where the principal portion of the town lay, there was a field." He goes on to note, "This version of the origin of the name is disputed by the editor of the Springfield Express, Mr. J. G. Newbill, who, in the issue of his paper, November 11, 1881, says: 'It has been stated that this city got its name from the fact of a spring and field being near by just west of town. But such is not a correct version. When the authorized persons met and adopted the title of the "Future Great" of the Southwest, several of the earliest settlers had handed in their favorite names, among whom was Kindred Rose, who presented the winning name, "Springfield," in honor of his former home town, Springfield, Robertson county, Tennessee.'" http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/history/holcombe/grch29pt1.html The most common view is that the city was named for Springfield, Massachusetts. One story is that a man named James Wilson, who lived in the then unnamed city, offered free whiskey to everyone who would vote for naming it after his home town of Springfield, Massachusetts.Dark, Phyllis & Harris.
