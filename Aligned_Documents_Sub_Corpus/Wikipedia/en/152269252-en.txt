After that he travelled through France, Germany and Austria to broaden his education.In 1730 he returned to Poland and began work on a new edition of Polish law, the Volumina legum.From 1736 he taught at the Collegium Resoviense in Rzeszów. In 1740 he founded the Collegium Nobilium, an elite Warsaw school for sons of the gentry (szlachta). Thereafter he reformed Piarist education in Poland, in accordance with his educational program, the Ordinationes Visitationis Apostolicae... (1755). His reforms became a landmark in the 18th-century struggle to modernize the Polish education system.Early on, Konarski was associated politically with King Stanisław Leszczyński; later, with the Czartoryski "Familia" and King Stanisław August Poniatowski. He participated in the latter's famous "Thursday dinners." Stanisław August caused a medal to be struck in Konarski's honour, with his likeness and the motto, from Horace, Sapere auso ("Dare to know!"). Konarski argued very strongly that the right of veto that had traditionally been exercised by the Polish Nobility was not law but a custom.His heart is buried in an urn in the Piarist church in Cracow. His bust can be seen at the entrance to the crypt of this church placed on Świętego Jana Street.http://forumakad.pl/archiwum/2002/02/images/000_1s.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesSee alsoHistory of philosophy in Poland  Category:1700 births Category:1773 deaths Category:Polish academics Category:Polish political writers Category:Polish poets Category:Polish dramatists and playwrights Category:Polish religious leaders an:Estanislao Konarski frp:Stanislas Konarski co:Stanislao Konarski de:Stanisław Konarski es:Estanislao Konarski fr:Stanislas Konarski fy:Stanislaus Konarski fur:Stanislaw Konarski gl:Stanisław Konarski it:Stanislao Konarski lmo:Stanislao Konarski nl:Stanisław Konarski nap:Stanislao Konarski nrm:Stanislas Konarski oc:Estanislao Konarski pms:Stanisław Konarski pl:Stanisław Konarski (pisarz) pt:Estanislau Konarski sc:Stanislao Konarski scn:Stanislau Konarski simple:Stanislas Konarski vec:Stanislao Konarski wa:Stanislas Konarski
