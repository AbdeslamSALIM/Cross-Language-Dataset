It features the breakthrough single "Light My Fire", extended with a substantial instrumental section omitted on the single release, and the lengthy song "The End" with its Oedipal spoken-word section. The Doors credit the success of their first album to being able to work the songs out night after night at the Whisky a Go Go or the London Fog. "Alabama Song" was originally written and composed by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill for their opera Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny (Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny); "Back Door Man" was a Howlin' Wolf cover. "The End"'s Oedipal climax was first performed live at the Whisky A Go Go and The Doors were thrown out as a result of lead vocalist Jim Morrison screaming "kill the father and fuck the mother." CensoredThe songs "Break on Through (To the Other Side)" and "The End" were both released censored with the album. During "Break on Through" the part where Jim Morrison sings "She gets, she gets" was originally recorded as "She gets high." The interlude singing part near the end of "The End" was censored and taken out. It included Jim using the word fuck over and over. Subsequent releases of the album have both of the original parts intact, although 1980s compact disc reissues appear to keep the verses censored. The band accepted this censorship but would supposedly refuse later to reword "Light my Fire" in the infamous Ed Sullivan Show ("Girl we couldn't get much higher"), although according to Ray Manzarek, while singing this song, Jim Morrison simply forgot to replace the word.LegacyThe album's dark tone and frontman Jim Morrison's sexual charisma and wild lifestyle influenced much of rock and roll to come.The album is generally thought of as the band's best work, in addition to being one of the greatest debut albums by any band. It's also considered to be one of the quintessential albums of the counterculture movement/Social Revolution. In 1998 ''Q'' magazine readers voted The Doors the 93rd greatest album of all time; in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 60.
