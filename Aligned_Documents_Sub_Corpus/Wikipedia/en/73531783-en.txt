It is named for its large ears. The Bat-eared Fox has tawny fur with black ears, legs and parts of the face. It averages 55 cm in length (head and body), with ears 13 cm long. It is the only species in the genus Otocyon.The teeth of the Bat-eared Fox are much smaller than teeth of other canid species. This is an adaptation to its insectivorous diet, insects making up 80% of its food intake. the Bat-eared Fox visits termite hills, follows locust swarms or stay close to herds of zebras or antelopes in order to feed on the insects landing on their excrements. In addition to insects, the Bat-eared Fox eats rodents, birds and eggs, and sometimes fruits.The Bat-eared Fox is mainly a nocturnal animal that lives in small groups consisting of a couple and their young. The pairs live in dens and raise the pups (two to five) together. Mated pairs are very social and are monogamous, although it is unknown if they mate for life.Due to its unusual teeth, the Bat-eared Fox was once considered as a distinct subfamily of canids (Otocyoninae). However, according to more recent examinations, it is more closely related to the true foxes of the genus Vulpes. Other research places the genus as an outgroup which is not very closely related to foxes. The Bat-eared Fox is an old species that was widely distributed in the Pleistocene era. In that time, it even lived in parts of West and South Asia.SubspeciesThere are two recognized subspecies of this fox:Otocyon megalotis megalotis - South Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, South AfricaOtocyon megalotis canescens - Ethiopia, SomaliaReferences   Category:Foxes Category:Carnivores of Africa Category:Fauna of East Africa Category:Mammals of Kenya Category:Fauna of Tanzania Category:Fauna of South Africa Category:Fauna of Angola Category:Fauna of Botswana Category:Fauna of Ethiopia Category:Fauna of Zambia Category:Fauna of Namibiaaf:Draaijakkals bg:Дългоуха лисица cs:Pes ušatý da:Øreræv de:Löffelhund es:Otocyon megalotis fr:Renard à oreilles de chauve-souris it:Otocyon megalotis he:שועל אוזנן lt:Didžiaausė lapė hu:Lapátfülű róka nl:Grootoorvos ja:オオミミギツネ no:Ørehund pl:Otocjon pt:Otócion ru:Большеухая лисица fi:Korvakoira sv:Afrikansk öronhund tr:İri kulaklı tilki zh:大耳狐
