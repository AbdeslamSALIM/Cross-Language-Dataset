It can be recognized by its prominent beard. It also sometimes has tassels on its tail. It is primarily found in Southeast Asia—Sumatra, Borneo, the eastern Philippines—where it inhabits rainforests and mangrove forests. The Bearded Pig lives in a family. It can reproduce from the age of 18 months, and can be cross-bred with other species in the family Suidae. There are about 25 members of this species in U.S zoos. The San Diego Zoo was the first zoo in the Western Hemisphere to breed them. The London Zoo is the only U.K zoo to currently house the species.SubspeciesThere are two subspecies of this pig:Sus barbatus barbatusWestern Bearded Pig (Sus barbatus oi)External linksSus barbatus by Nicole Knibbe in University of Michigan Museum of ZoologyPigs, Peccaries and Hippos Status Survey and Action Plan (1993) Chapter 5.5 by Julian O.
