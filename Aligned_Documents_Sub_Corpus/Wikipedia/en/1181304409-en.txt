 Lingala is a Bantu language spoken throughout the northwestern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo-Kinshasa) and a large part of the Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), as well as to some degree in Angola and the Central African Republic. It has over 10 million speakers. It is classed C.36D under the Guthrie system for classifying Bantu languages and C.40 under the SIL system.HistoryLingala originated from Bobangi, a language that was spoken along the Congo River between Lisala and Kinshasa. Bobangi functioned as a regional trade language before the creation of the Congo Free State. In the last two decades of the 19th century, after King Leopold II of Belgium stimulated the exploration and occupation of the area, Bobangi came into wider use. The language was learned and influenced by intermediaries and interpreters of the Westerners and brought to the area from other parts of central and east Africa (e.g., Zanzibar, Comoros and the Tanganyikan inland). The colonial administration, in need of a common language for the region, started to use the language for missionary and administrative purposes, calling it Bangala to set it apart from the old Bobangi. Naturally, the language developed the typical characteristics of a common vernacular: compared to local Bantu languages, its sentence structure, |word structure and sounds are much simplified, and its speakers liberally borrow words and constructs from other languages they happen to know.Around the turn of the century, CICM missionaries started a project to 'purify' the language in order to make it 'pure Bantu' again. Meeuwis (1998:7) writes:Missionaries, such as the Protestant W. Stapleton and later, and more influentially, E. De Boeck himself, judged that the grammar and lexicon of this language were too poor for it to function properly as a medium of education, evangelization, and other types of vertical communication with the Africans in the northwestern and central-western parts of the colony (..). They set out to 'correct' and 'expand' the language by drawing on lexical and grammatical elements from surrounding vernacular languages.Meanwhile, the importance of Lingala as a vernacular has kept growing together with the size and importance of its main center of use, Kinshasa; e.g. Lingala has spread with the popularity of soukous music, which originates from Kinshasa.In East Africa Soukous Music is also referred to as Lingala. This is mainly because the Lyrics are written and sung in the Lingala language. It is not uncommon to find Soukousradio stations and clubs (soukousradio.com) referring to themselves as Lingala stations.NameThe name Lingala first appears in a written form in a publication by the C.I.C.M. missionary Egide De Boeck (1903). It avoids confusion: the Bangala (lit. "river people") are a specific tribe of people who live alongside the Congolese riverReference-weeks1909, while many more people use Lingala as a first, second or third language.Characteristics and usageLingala has many loans from French even in its basic vocabulary. There is also some Portuguese influence, such as in the words for butter (mántéka), table (mésa), shoes (sapátu), and some English or Dutch influences; for instance, the word for milk (míliki) or book (búku).Le grand Dzo : nouveau dictionnaire illustré lingala-français / Adolphe Dzokanga. - 3e éd. Bonneuil sur Marne : A. Dzokanga, 1995 In practice, the extent of borrowing varies widely with speakers, and with the occasion; e.g. Congolese rebels now use cryptic forms of the language to pass messages undecipherable by Western intelligence agencies.VariationsThe Lingala language can be divided in several dialects or variations. The major variations are considered to be Standard Lingala, Spoken Lingala, Kinshasa Lingala and Brazzaville Lingala.Standard Lingala (called lingala littéraire or lingala classique in French) is mostly used in educational and news broadcastings on radio or television, in religious services in the Catholic Church and is the language taught as a subject at all educational levels. Standard Lingala is historically associated with the work of the Catholic Church and missionaries. It has a seven-vowel system  with an obligatory tense-lax vowel harmony. It also has a full range of morphological noun prefixes with mandatory grammatical agreement system with subject-verb, or noun-modifier for each of class. Standard Lingala is largely used in formal functions.Spoken Lingala (called lingala parlé in French) is the variation mostly used in the day-to-day lives of Lingalaphones. It has a full morphological noun prefix system, but the agreement system is more lax than the standard variation, i.e. noun-modifier agreement is reduced to two classes. Regarding phonology, there is also a seven-vowel system but the vowel harmony is not mandatory. This variation of Lingala is historically associated with the Protestant missionaries' work. Spoken Lingala is largely used in informal functions, and the majority of Lingala songs use Spoken Lingala over other variations.Kinshasa Lingala and Brazzaville Lingala are the dialects from the capitals of both Congos. They are both heavily influenced by other Bantu languages as well as French (the official language of both countries). They both have lots of borrowed words from those languages, as well as a simplified phonology and grammar.SoundsVowelsFrontBackCloseClose-midOpen-midOpenIPAExample (IPA)Example (written)MeaningNoteslilálaorangekulutuoldest childelongifacemobálimasculinepronounced slightly higher than the cardinal , realized as todaymoneyáwahereVowel harmonyLingala words show vowel harmony to some extent.

There are two tones possible, the normal one is low and the second one is high.Tonal morphologyTense morphemes carry tones.koma (komL-a : write) inflected givessimple present L-aL :nakoma naL-komL-aL (I write)subjunctive H-aL :nákoma naH-komL-aL (I would write)present:nakomí naL-komL-iH (I have been writing)sepela (seLpel-a : enjoy) inflected givessimple present L-aL :osepela oL-seLpelL-aL (you-SG enjoy)subjunctive H-aL :ósepéla oH-seLpelH-aH (you-SG would enjoy)present L-iH:osepelí oL-seLpelL-iH (you-SG have been enjoying)GrammarNoun class systemLike all Bantu languages, Lingala has a noun class system in which nouns are classified according to the prefixes they bear and according to the prefixes they trigger in sentences. The table below shows the noun classes of Lingala, ordered according to the numbering system that is widely used in descriptions of Bantu languages.classnoun prefixexampletranslation1mo-mopésiservant2ba-bapésiservants3mo-mokílatail4mi-mikílatails5li-lilobaword6ma-malobawords7e-elokójar, stone bottle8bi-bilokójars, stone bottles9m-/n-ntabagoat10m-/n-ntabagoat (pl.)9aØsánzámoon10aØsánzámoon (pl.)11lo-lolemotongue14bo-bosotodirt15ko-kotálato see/seeingIndividual classes pair up with each other to form singular/plural pairs, sometimes called 'genders'. There are seven genders in total. The singular classes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 take their plural forms from classes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, respectively. Additionally, many household items found in class 9 take a class 2 prefix (ba) in the plural: lutu  balutu 'spoon', mesa  bamesa 'table', sani  basani 'plate'. Words in class 11 usually take a class 10 plural. Most words from class 14 (abstract nouns) do not have a plural counterpart.Class 9 and 10 have a nasal prefix, which assimilates to the following consonant. Thus, the prefix shows up as 'n' on words that start with t'' or ''d, e.g. ntaba 'sheep', but as 'm' on words that start with b'' or ''p (e.g. mbisi 'fish'). There is also a prefixless class 9a and 10a, exemplified by sánzá  sánzá 'moon(s) or month(s)'. Possible ambiguities are solved by the context.Noun class prefixes do not show up only on the noun itself, but serve as markers throughout the whole sentence. In the sentences below, the class prefixes are underlined. (There is a special verbal form 'a' of the prefix for class 1 nouns.)molakisi molai yango abiki (CL1.teacher CL1.tall that CL1:recovered) That tall teacher recoveredbato bakúmisa Nkómbó ya (CL2.people CL2.praise name of You) (Let) people praise Your name (a sentence from the Lord's Prayer)Only to a certain extent, noun class allocation is semantically governed. Classes 1/2, as in all Bantu languages, mainly contain words for human beings; similarly, classes 9/10 contain many words for animals. In other classes, semantical regularities are mostly absent or are obscured by many exceptions.Verb inflections and morphologyVerbal extensionsThere are 4 morphemes modifying verbs. They are added to some verb root in the following order :Reversive (-ol-)e.g.: kozinga to wrap and kozingola to developCausative (-is-)e.g. : koyéba to know and koyébisa to informApplicative (-el-)e.g. : kobíka to heal (self), to save (self) and kobíkela to heal (someone else), to save (someone)Passive (-am-)e.g. : koboma to kill and kobomama to be killedReciprocal or stationary (-an-, sometimes -en-)e.g. : kokúta to find and kokútana to meetTense inflectionsThe first tone segment affects the subject part of the verb, the second tone segment attaches to the semantic morpheme attached to the root of the verb.present perfect (LH-í)simple present (LL-a)recurrent present (LL-aka)undefined recent past (LH-ákí)undefined distant past (LH-áká)future (L-ko-L-a)subjunctive (HL-a)Writing systemLingala is more a spoken language than a written language, and has several different writing systems. Most of those are ad hoc. Due to the low literacy of Lingala speakers in Lingala (in the Congo-Brazzaville literacy rate in Lingala as a first language is between 10% to 30%), its popular orthography is very flexible and varies from one Congo to the other. Some orthographies are heavily influenced by the French language orthography; including double S, ss, to transcribe s (in Congo-Brazzaville); ou for u (in Congo-Brazzaville); i with umlaut, aï, to transcribe  or ; e with acute accent, é'', to transcribe e; ''e to transcribe , o with acute accent, ó, to transcribe  or sometimes o in opposition to o transcribing o or ; i or y can both transcribe j. The allophones are also found as alternating forms in the popular orthography; sango is an alternative to nsango (information or news); nyonso, nyoso, nionso, nioso (every) are all transcriptions of .In 1976 the Société Zaïroise des Linguistes (Zairian Linguists Society) adopted a writing system for Lingala, using the open e  and the open o  to write the vowels  and , and sporadic usage of accents to mark tone. Also, the limitations of input methods prevents Lingala writers from easily using the  and  and the accents. For example, it is almost impossible to type Lingala according to that convention with a common English or French keyboard. The convention of 1976 reduced the alternative orthography of characters but did not enforce tone marking. The lack of consistent accentuation is lessened by the disambiguation due to context.The popular orthographies seem to be a step ahead of any academic based orthography. Many Lingala books, papers, even the translation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and more recently, Internet forums, newsletters, and major websites, such as Google's Lingala, do not use Lingala specific characters (ɛ and ɔ). Tone marking is in most literary works.AlphabetThe Lingala language has 35 letters and digraphs. The digrams each have a specific order in the alphabet, for example mza will be expected to be ordered before mba, because the digram mb follows the letter m''. The letters ''r and h are rare but present in borrowed words. The accents indicate the tones :no accent for default tone, the low toneacute accent for the high tonecircumflex for descending tonecaron for ascending toneVariantsExampleaAá â ǎnyama, matáta, sâmbóle, libwǎbBbísócCcilubadDeEé ê ěkomeka, mésa, kobêngafFlifútagGkogángagbGbgbagbahHbo'h'lu (bohrium)iIí î ǐwápi, zíko, tî, esǐkKkokomalLkolálamMkokómambMbkolámbampMplímpanNlínondNdndekongNgndéngénkNknkámánsNsntNtntabanyNynyamanzNznzalaooó ô ǒmoto, sóngóló, sékôpprRmala'r'íyasSkopésatTtatáuUúbutú, koúmavVkovándawWkáwayYkoyébazZkozalaSampleThe Lord's PrayerTatá wa bísó, ozala o likoló,bato bakúmisa Nkómbó ya ,bandima bokonzi bwa , mpo elingo ,basálá yangó o nsé,lokóla bakosalaka o likolóPésa bísó  biléi bya ,límbisa mabé ma bísó,lokóla bísó tokolimbisaka baníngá.Sálisa bísó tondima masɛ́nginyá tê,mpe bíkisa bísó o mabé.See alsoSwadesh list of Lingala wordswiktionary Lingala Swadesh ListBibliographyEdama, Atibakwa Baboya (1994) Dictionnaire bangála - français - lingála.
