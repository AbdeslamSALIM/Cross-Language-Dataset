He turned professional in 1996, and his most significant achievement has been to reach the Australian Open men's singles final in 2001, where he was defeated by Andre Agassi, defeating the then-unseeded but future number one Roger Federer and former number one Yevgeny Kafelnikov on his way to the final. While playing he often wears a bandana and sunglasses. The sunglasses have been medically prescribed for Clement because of severe eye problems he has encountered through his life which had nearly left him blind as a child.Clément has been ranked as high as 10th in the world in singles and as high as 24th in doubles, where he has often partnered with fellow Frenchmen Sébastien Grosjean and Michael Llodra. He has won four ATP singles titles (Lyon 2000, Metz 2003, Marseille 2006, Washington 2006), and five doubles titles. In September 2005 he defeated Great Britain's Andy Murray in the U.S. Open tournament.In March 2006, Clément ended his two and a half year period of not winning an ATP singles title by capturing the Marseille Open, defeating world number 2 Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals and Mario Ančić in the finals. In August 2006, Clément won his first ATP title in the United States, defeating Murray in straight sets in the final of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic.In July 2007, Arnaud Clément and Michael Llodra won the men's double title at Wimbledon, beating World N. 1 and number one seeds defending champions Bob and Mike Bryan, thus winning his first Grand Slam doubles title (Llodra had won two previous titles with Fabrice Santoro, making it his third Grand Slam title). He and Llodra were ecstatic and celebrated by throwing their shirts, rackets and towels into the crowd.Clément was selected to represent one of the world's best-known and most important fashion label, Lacoste. He was seen from May 2004 onwards in a pan-European print and TV campaign alongside the Danish pop singer Natacha Thomas. The advert was directed and shot by Bruno Aveillan, who in the course of his career has already filmed top stars such as Monica Bellucci, Claudia Schiffer, Marcel Desailly, Zinedine Zidane and Gisele Bündchen.At only 13 months old Clément was diagnosed with unilateral coloboma, meaning the condition only effects one eye, at that time Clément was only given a 40/60 % chance of having healthy eyesight for the rest of his life, throughout his tennis career Clément has worn sunglasses to protect his eyes.In July 2008, Arnaud Clément and Rainer Schüttler, both in their early 30s, played against each other in a Wimbledon quarterfinal singles match. Because of rain delays and darkness, play was suspended over a period of two days. Eventually, the match went in favor of Schüttler. The match went five sets and over five hours combined within the two playing days. The fifth set's score was 8-6. Finishing in 5:12, this match is the second longest gentleman's singles match in the history of Wimbledon.Santoro-Clement MatchAt Roland Garros 2004, Fabrice Santoro defeated Clément 6–4, 6–3, 6–7, 3–6, 16-14 in six hours and 33 minutes. It is the longest singles match in male professional tennis history.Grand Slam singles finalRunner-up (1)'''Year'''Championship'''Opponent in Final'''Score in Final2001Australian OpenUSA Andre Agassi6–4, 6–2, 6–2Grand Slam men's doubles finalsWin (1)'''Year'''Championship'''Partnering'''Opponents in Final'''Score in Final2007Wimbledon]]France Michaël LlodraUSA Bob Bryan Mike Bryan6–7(5), 6–3, 6–4, 6–4Runner-up (1)'''Year'''Championship'''Partnering'''Opponents in Final'''Score in Final2008Australian OpenFrance Michaël LlodraISR Jonathan Erlich Andy Ram7–5, 7–6(4)Career finalsSinglesLegend (Singles)Grand Slam (0)Tennis Masters Cup (0)ATP Masters Series (0)ATP Tour (4)Challengers (0)WinsNo.DateTournamentSurfaceOpponent in the finalScore1.November 6 2000Lyon]], FranceCarpet (I)AUS Patrick Rafter7–62, 7–652.September 29 2003Metz]], FranceHard (I)CHI Fernando González6–3, 1–6, 6–33.February 13 2006Marseille]], FranceHard (I)CRO Mario Ančić6–4, 6–24.July 31 2006Washington, D.C.]], U.S.HardGBR Andy Murray7–63, 6–2Runner-upsNo.DateTournamentSurfaceOpponent in the finalScore1.November 24 1997Réunion Island, FranceHardSWE Jan Apell6–4, 7–62.February 8, 1999Marseille]], FranceHard (i)FRA Fabrice Santoro6–3, 4–6, 6–43.January 29, 2001Australian OpenHardUSA Andre Agassi6–4, 6–2, 6–24.June 24, 2002's-Hertogenbosch]], NetherlandsGrassNED Sjeng Schalken3–6, 6–3, 6–25.June 23, 2003's-Hertogenbosch]], NetherlandsGrassNED Sjeng Schalken6–3, 6–46.October 13, 2003Lyon]], FranceCarpetGER Rainer Schüttler7–5, 6–37.April 26, 2004Aix-en-Provence, FranceClayFRA Fabrice Santoro1–6, 7–65, 6–38.June 23, 2007Nottingham]], United KingdomGrassCRO Ivo Karlović3–6, 6–4, 6–4DoublesLegend (Doubles)Grand Slam (1)Tennis Masters Cup (0)ATP Masters Series (2)ATP Tour (8)WinsNo.DateTournamentSurfacePartnerOpponents in the finalScore1.April 10 2000Casablanca]], MoroccoClayFRA Sébastien GrosjeanGER Lars Burgsmüller   Andrew Painter7–64, 6–22.February 11 2002Marseille]], FranceHard (I)FRA Nicolas EscudéFRA Julien Boutter   Max Mirnyi6–4, 6–33.March 8 2004Indian Wells, Califonia]], U.S.HardFRA Sébastien GrosjeanZIM Wayne Black   Kevin Ullyett6–3, 4–6, 7–54.October 11 2004Metz]], FranceHard (I)FRA Nicolas MahutCRO Ivan Ljubičić   Uros Vico6–2, 7–685.October 25 2004St. Petersburg]], RussiaCarpet (I)FRA Michaël LlodraSVK Dominik Hrbatý   Jaroslav Levinský6–3, 6–26.October 23 2006Lyon]], FranceCarpet (I)FRA Julien BenneteauCZE František Čermák   Jaroslav Levinský6–2, 36–7, 10–77.October 30 2006Paris]], FranceCarpet (I)FRA Michaël LlodraFRA Fabrice Santoro   Nenad Zimonjić7–64, 6–28.February 12 2007Marseille]], FranceHard (I)FRA Michaël LlodraBAH Mark Knowles   Daniel Nestor7–5, 4–6, 10–89.June 25 2007Wimbledon]]''', United KingdomGrassFRA Michaël LlodraUSA Bob Bryan   Mike Bryan56–7, 6–3, 6–4, 6–410.October 1 2007Metz]] FranceHard (I)FRA Michaël LlodraPOL Mariusz Fyrstenberg   Marcin Matkowski6–1, 6–411.October 5 2008Metz]], FranceHard (I)FRA Michaël LlodraPOL Mariusz Fyrstenberg   Marcin Matkowski5–7, 6–3, 10–8External linksClément Recent Match ResultsClément World Ranking History Category:1977 births Category:French tennis players Category:Living people Category:People from Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur Category:Tennis players at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Tennis players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic tennis players of Francear:ارنو كليمان cs:Arnaud Clément da:Arnaud Clément de:Arnaud Clément es:Arnaud Clément fr:Arnaud Clément hi:आर्नॉद क्लेमाँ it:Arnaud Clément hu:Arnaud Clément mr:आर्नॉ क्लेमेंट nl:Arnaud Clément ja:アルノー・クレマン no:Arnaud Clément pl:Arnaud Clément ro:Arnaud Clément sk:Arnaud Clément sv:Arnaud Clément zh:阿诺·克莱芒
