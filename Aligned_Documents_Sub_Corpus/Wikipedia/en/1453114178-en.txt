The eighteen municipios of Sinaloa are home to approximately 2,425,675 inhabitants. The coastal plain is a narrow strip of land that stretches along the length of the state and lies between the ocean and the foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental Range, which dominates the eastern part of the state. Sinaloa is traversed by many rivers, which carve broad valleys into the foothills. The largest of these rivers are the Culiacán, Fuerte, and Sinaloa.CultureCulturally, it is known for a style of music known as banda, and corrido is also popular. It is the only place in the continent where the ancient ball game of Mesoamerica is still played, in a handful of small, rural communities not far from Mazatlán. The ritual ball game was central in the society, religion and cosmology of all the great Mesoamerican cultures including the Mixtecs, Aztecs, and Maya. The Sinaloa version of the ball game (the consensus is that it is very faithful indeed to the original game) is called ulama. There are efforts to avoid the extinction of this (at least) 3,500-year old unique tradition by supporting the communities and children that still play it. http://www.ulama.freehomepage.comDemographicsThe state capital of Sinaloa is Culiacán. Other large cities in Sinaloa with airports that serve as points of entry include Mazatlán, a tourist resort, and Los Mochis, an agricultural center.EconomyThe main productive activities of Sinaloa are agriculture, fishing, livestock breeding, commerce and industry. The products obtained from these activities are used for both local and national consumption. Agriculture produces tomatoes, beans, corn, wheat, sorghum, potatoes, soybeans, sugarcane and squash. Sinaloa is one of the most prominent states in Mexico in terms of agriculture, and additionally has one of the largest fishing fleets.Illegal DrugsMany of the illegal drugs that come into the United States and other countries come out of Sinaloa, ranging from marijuana and meth to crack cocaine. In May 2008, the Mexican government dispatched roughly 30,000 troops to control drug-related crime. An estimated 1,000 deaths over the prior year were related to Cartel activity, including Alfredo Beltran Leyva aka El Mochomo, and Ramon Arellano Felix.WeatherSinaloa has a warm climate on the coast side, moderate-warm in the valleys and lower mountainskirts, moderate-cold in small mountains and cold in the high ones.
