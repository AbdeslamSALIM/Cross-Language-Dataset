It was formerly known as Lyallpur. Faisalabad is the third largest city in Pakistan with an estimated 2006 population of 2.6 million (city proper). The entire district had a population of about 5.4 million in 1998General statistics of Faisalabad. It is an important industrial centre located in the Punjab province, west of Lahore. The city-district of Faisalabad is bound on the north by the districts of Gujranwala and Sheikhupura, on the east by Sahiwal, on the south by Toba Tek Singh and on the west by Jhang.HistoryFaisalabd was once part of ancient district Jhang and Sandalbar, a 50-square kilometre part mainly consisted of thick forests and wild tribes. The vast tract from Shahdara to Shorekot, Sangla Hill to Toba Tek Singh, is traditionally called Sandalbar. It has been a land of freedom fighters and great lovers - famous among Sikhs and other faiths.The great freedom fighters, such as Bhagat Singh - came from Bange village, nine kilometres from Jaranwala. The legendary love hero, Mirza Jutt, was born in Moza Danabad, seven kilometres from Jaranwala.The present day city was founded by the British Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab, Sir Charles James Lyall for whom it was originally named Lyallpur. Prior to the British making the area into an urban center, it largely consisted of various villages. However, the construction of various canals allowed the area to be irrigated. After the founding of the city, people were invited to the city with promises of land if they were to work it. This allowed the city to grow rapidly.The city of Lyallpur came into being in 1880 with the city centre designed by Captain Poham Young, to imitate the Union Flag with eight roads radiating from a large clock tower in the centre to eight separate bazaars.In 1895, the rail link between Wazirabad and Lyallpur was completed. As the progress of colonisation stepped up Lyallpur was given the status of a tehsil of Jhang District and its administration carried on in tents on the old Theh (Mound) of Pucca Mari near Tariqabad. The majestic Clock Tower of Lyallpur was constructed out of the funds raised by the Sikh Zamindars who collected it at a rate of Rs. 18 per square of land. The fund thus raised was handed over to the Municipal Committee which undertook to complete the project.In 1902, the population of the town had exceeded 4,000. A considerable number of houses and shops to cater to the ordinary needs of the population had constructed. In 1903, decision to have an agricultural college was made. In the very next year, 1904, the new district of Lyallpur was constituted comparing of Tehsils of Lyallpur, Samundri and Toba Tek Singh with a subtehsil at Jaranwala which later turned into a full fledged Tehsil. In 1906, the District Headquarters began to function at Lyallpur and all the bazars and mohallas within the bounds of circular road were nearing completion and city began to spread outside the circular road. The Town Committee which has come into being in 1904, was upgraded as Municipal Committee in 1909 and Deputy Commissioner was declared to be the lst Chairman. In 1916, the grain market saw its shops surging with customers. In the same year the civil Hospital was expanded. With the advent of the World War II, the political awakening sprinkled its influence over the city. Revolutionary meetings were held. Fiery speeches were made. Slogans were written on the walls.In 1943, Mohammed Ali Jinnah came to Lyallpur and addressed a gathering of over 2 million in Dhobi Ghat Grounds. When Pakistan was accepted as an independent unit, the Muslims of Lyallpur held special prayers and distributed sweets and food among the poor on March 3, 1947.The city grew into a strong industrial and agricultural centre and on independence of Pakistan it was a major urban area. After independence, the city of Lyallpur marched rapidly on the path of progress. The city which had so far been known for its grain market, became a great commercial and industrial centre. The population of the city which in 1901 hardly touched the figure of a few thousands soared up to millions. Medical and educational level was lifted up. In 1977, the name of the city was changed to Faisalabad, after the name of the late king of Saudi Arabia, Shah Faisal-bin-Abdul Aziz. In 1985, the city was upgraded as a division with the districts of Faisalabad, Jhang and Toba Tek Singh.GovernmentFaisalabad city-district formerly comprised six sub-divisions; Faisalabad City, Faisalabad Sadr, Chak Jhumra, Jaranwala, Samundri, and Tandlianwala.
