Flag ratio: 2:3 -- Flag of Guernsey]]  Flag ratio: 1:2 -- Civil ensign of Guernsey]]The present flag of Guernsey was adopted in 1985 and consists of the red cross of St. George with an additional gold cross within it. The change was prompted by confusion at international sporting events over competitors from Guernsey and England using the same flag.Le Conte, David, Designing the Flag, Review of the Guernsey Society, Spring 1996, Vol LII No 1 It was designed by the Guernsey Flag Investigation Committee chaired by the then Deputy Bailiff Graham Dorey and first flew in the island on 15th February, 1985. The gold cross represents Duke William of Normandy, who, it is claimed, had such a cross on his flag in the Battle of Hastings, given to him by Pope Alexander II.Nicolls, Bruce, A New Flag for Guernsey, Review of the Guernsey Society, Winter 1985, Vol XLI No 3 A red ensign with the cross in the fly is used as civil ensign.Historical flagsThe previous flag of Guernsey was the St George's Cross. Guernsey was permitted to use it in 1936 for its state flag. However, there is evidence to suggest the existence of a previous Guernsey flag, used in the mid-19th century. This was a St George's cross on a blue-and-white chequered field, with the Union Flag in canton. Further details of its use and official status remain sketchy, however.Bailiwick of Guernsey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;  Image:Flag of England.svg| 1936–1985 flag Image:Old Flag of Guernsey.svg| 19th Century Flag ReferencesExternal links   Category:National symbols of Guernsey Guernsey be-x-old:Сьцяг Гернсі bs:Zastava Guernseya cs:Vlajka Guernsey cy:Baner Ynys y Garn da:Guernseys flag de:Flagge Guernseys el:Σημαία του Γκέρνσεϊ es:Bandera de Guernsey eu:Guernseyko bandera fr:Drapeau de Guernesey hr:Zastava Guernseya bpy:গুৱেরেনসির ফিরালহান he:דגל גרנזי hu:Guernsey zászlaja nl:Vlag van Guernsey no:Guernseys flagg pl:Flaga Guernsey pt:Bandeira de Guernsey ru:Флаг Гернси sq:Flamuri i Guernsey sk:Vlajka Guernsey sr:Застава Гернзија sh:Zastava Guernseya fi:Guernseyn lippu sv:Guernseys flagga th:ธงชาติเกิร์นซีย์
