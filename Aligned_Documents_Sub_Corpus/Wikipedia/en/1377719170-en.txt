The Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities is a prize given out annually by the Templeton Foundation. Established in 1972, it is awarded to a living person who, in the estimation of the judges, best exemplifies "trying various ways for discoveries and breakthroughs to expand human perceptions of divinity and to help in the acceleration of divine creativity."The prize is named after Sir John Templeton, an American-born British entrepreneur and businessman, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1987 for his philanthropic efforts. Until 2001 the name of the prize was Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion. It has typically been presented by Prince Philip in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.The monetary value of the prize (795,000 GBP or approx. 1.4 million US dollars in 2006) is adjusted so that it exceeds that of the Nobel Prizes. The prize is, as of 2006, the largest single annual financial prize award given to an individual for intellectual merit.Prize winners1973 - Mother Teresa of Calcutta1974 - Frère Roger, founder of the Taizé Community1975 - Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, President of India1976 - Leon Joseph Cardinal Suenens1977 - Chiara Lubich, founder of the Focolare Movement1978 - Prof. Thomas Torrance1979 - Rev.
