  An exclamation mark or exclamation point is a punctuation mark: ! It is usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or high volume, and often marks the end of a sentence.In typesetting or printing (and therefore when spelling text out orally), the exclamation mark is called a screamer or a bang. "Bang" is also common in computer programming slang. Less common names in publishing include "gasper" and "startler".Truss, Lynne. Eats, Shoots & Leaves, 2003. p. 136. ISBN 1-592-40087-6.HistoryThe exclamation point was introduced into English printing in the 1400, and was known as the "note of admiration" until the mid 1600s.Eats, Shoots & Leaves, p. 137 In German orthography, the sign made its first appearance in the Luther Bible in 1797 Wolfgang Mathias, Cologne University (2002).The mark was not featured on standard manual typewriters before the 1970s. Instead, one typed a full stop, backspaced, and then typed an apostrophe.Truss, Lynne. Eats, Shoots & Leaves, 2003. p. 135. ISBN 1-592-40087-6.UsageA sentence ending in an exclamation mark is either an actual exclamation ("Wow!", "Boo!"), a command ("Stop!"), or is intended to be astonishing in some way ("They were the footprints of a gigantic hound!"). However, exclamation marks can also be placed mid-sentence and function like a comma ("There was a loud bang! at the door.")Casually, exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis ("That's great!!!"), but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal composition.Effective use of emailOverly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing, as it distracts the reader and reduces the mark's meaning. Some authors however, most notably Tom Wolfe, are known for unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In comic books, the constant appearance of exclamation marks is common; see Comics, below.For information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark, see the discussion of spacing after a full stop.One study has shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do. Gender and the Use of Exclamation Points in Computer-Mediated Communication: An Analysis of Exclamations Posted to Two Electronic Discussion Lists&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;LanguagesThe exclamation mark is common to languages using the Latin alphabet, although usage varies slightly between languages. The exclamation mark is also used in languages with other scripts, such as Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Chinese, Korean and Japanese.FrenchIn French, the exclamation mark is used to mark orders or requests: viens ici ! ("English: come here"). Like the question mark (?), colon (:) and semi-colon (;), the exclamation mark takes a preceding space.GermanIn German, the exclamation mark has several specific uses for which English employs other forms of punctuation:In the salutation line of a letter, for which English uses a comma: Lieber Hans! (English: "Dear Hans,") In this case, the first word of the following sentence begins with a capital letter. However, usage of a comma, as in English, is both also acceptable and far more common.On signs, not just those warning of danger as discussed below, the exclamation mark is used to emphasize the sign's content: Betreten verboten! (English: "No trespassing")At the end of an imperative sentence: Ruf mich morgen an! (English: "Call me tomorrow.")SpanishIn the Spanish language, a sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an inverted exclamation mark (the same also applies to the question mark):¿Estás loco? ¡Casi la mataste! (English: "Are you crazy?! You almost killed her!")For informal written communications, however, usage of inverted question and exclamation marks has become less common.PhoneticsIn Khoisan languages, and the International Phonetic Alphabet, the exclamation mark is used as a letter to indicate the postalveolar click sound (represented as q in Zulu orthography). In Unicode, this letter is properly coded as U+01C3 () and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol U+0021 (!) to allow software to deal properly with word breaks.The exclamation mark has sometimes been used as a phonetic symbol to indicate that a consonant is ejective. More commonly this is represented by an apostrophe, or a superscript glottal stop symbol ().InterrobangThere is a punctuation mark intended to combine the functions of a question mark and an exclamation mark in English called interrobang, which resembles those marks superimposed over one another ("") but the sequence of "?!" or "!?" is used more often.Proper namesAlthough exclamation marks are, as a standard, part of a complete sentence and not the spelling of individual words, they appear in many proper names, especially in commercial advertising. Prominent examples include the Web service Yahoo! and the game show Jeopardy!. The titles of the musicals Oklahoma!, Oliver! and Oh! Calcutta! and the movie Airplane! also contain exclamation marks. Writer Elliot S! Maggin started spelling his name that way in the seventies.Place namesThe English town of Westward Ho!, named after the novel by Charles Kingsley, is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. There is a town in Quebec called Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, which is spelled with two exclamation marks.WarningsExclamation marks are used to emphasize a precautionary statement.On warning signs, an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to a warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. A common type of this warning is a yellow triangle with a black exclamation mark, but a white triangle with a red border is common on European road warning signs.Use in various fieldsMathematicsIn mathematics the symbol represents the factorial operation. The expression n''! means "the product of the integers from 1 to ''n". For example, 4! (read four factorial) is 4 &times; 3 &times; 2 &times; 1 = 24. (0! is defined as 1, which is a neutral element in multiplication, not multiplied by anything.)ComputersIn computing, the exclamation mark corresponds to ASCII character 33 (21 in hexadecimal). It is therefore found in Unicode at 0021. The inverted exclamation mark is found in ISO-8859-1, 9 and 15 at position 161 (A1HEX) and therefore in unicode at U+00A1.Several computer languages use "!" for various meanings, most importantly for logical negation; e.g. A&nbsp;!=&nbsp;B means "A is not equal to B", and !A means "the logical negation of A" (also called "not A"). In this context, the exclamation is named the bang character; other programmers call it a shriek or screech. Invented in the US, it is claimed that bang is from Unix and shriek from Stanford or MIT; however, shriek is found in the Oxford English Dictionary dating from the 1860s. In the BBC BASIC programming language (and BCPL) it is called a pling and is used to reference a 32-bit word.Plings are also used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an "appfolder": a folder that when double clicked executes a program file inside called !Run. Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the application needs to run. The appfolder can be viewed as a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer) and !Sprites (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if !Boot cannot be found) also start with a pling.Early e-mail systems also used the exclamation point as a separator character between hostnames for routing information, usually referred to as "bang path" notation.In the IRC protocol, a user's nickname and ident are separated by an exclamation point in the hostmask assigned to him or her by the server.In the Geek Code version 3, "!" is used before a letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases, it has an alternate meaning, such as G! denoting a geek of no qualifications, !d denoting not wearing any clothes, P! denoting not being allowed to use Perl, and so on. They all share some negative connotations however.When computer programs display messages that alert the user, an exclamation mark may be shown alongside it to indicate that the message is important and should be read. This often happens when an error is made, or to obtain user consent for hazardous operations such as deleting data.In UNIX shell and Perl scripting, "!" is usually used after a "#" in the first line of a script to tell the OS what program to use to run the script. This is usually called a "hashbang" or shebang.Internet cultureIn recent Internet culture, especially where leet is used, an excessive way of expressing exclamation in text is seen as !!!!!!111. This notation originates from the eagerness to add multiple exclamation marks but failing to hit the shift key–1 combination (to produce the mark on most keyboard layouts) properly. Later this behavior has evolved into a sign of recognition for certain Internet cultures who now intentionally add 1''s after their expressions either to ridicule people who do it without purpose or as a sign of recognition towards others who also are familiar with the behavior. As a further pun to this development of linguistics, some add literal ''one''s such as ''!!!!!one!11 to explicitly state that their use of 1''s was intentionally typed, since ''one is fairly unlikely to be typed by accident.FandomIn fandom, "!" is used to signify a defining quality in a character, as in romantic! Draco from Harry Potter fandom. Almost always the character in question is a canon character, and most often the quality is one that is unusual, or non-canon. Occasionally, the "!" notation will describe a physical appearance thought to trigger certain reactions, as in shirtless!Vaughn from Alias, or to clarify the current persona of a character, such as armor!Al from Fullmetal Alchemist. The origin of this usage is unknown, although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures, for example, "Football Player! Leonardo", "Rockstar! Raphael", and "Breakdancer! Michaelangelo". http://www.godawful.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=13374&amp;highlight=exclamationMusicA music group, based in Sacramento, California and New York City, NY has utilized the exclamation point to spell its name: !!!. The band's name is pronounced as "any syllable repeated three times"; the most frequent alpha respelling is "chk chk chk", pronounced as "Chick Chick Chick". Other pronunciations include "Pow Pow Pow" and "Bang Bang Bang". It is less often referred to as "Exclamation point exclamation point exclamation point", as that has proven too verbose.In the popular music game In the Groove 2 there is a song called "!", which fans have dubbed 'Bang' rather 'Exclamation Mark/Point'.Comics[[Image:Action252.jpg|thumb|This Action Comics cover from 1959 ends every sentence with an exclamation mark or question mark. Often, few or no periods would be used in the entire book.]] Some comic books, especially superhero comics of the mid-20th century, routinely use the exclamation mark instead of the period. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech, inline with the other hyperboles common in comic books. A portion of the motivation, however, was simply that a period might disappear in the printing process used at the time, whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was a printing glitch.In comic books and comics in general, a large exclamation mark is often used in the proximity of a character's head to indicate surprise. A question mark can similarly be used to indicate confusion. This practice also appears in some computer and video games.Chess In chess notation &quot;!&quot; denotes a good move and &quot;!!&quot; denotes an excellent move. Likewise, in some chess variants such as large board Shogi variants, "!" is used to record pieces capturing by stationary feeding or burning.BaseballExclamation marks or asterisks can be used on scorecards to denote a "great defensive play." http://baseball-almanac.com/score2b.shtmlSarcasmIn writing and often subtitles, especially in British English, a (!) symbol (an exclamation mark within brackets) implies that a character has made an obviously sarcastic comment eg: "Ooh, a sarcasm detector. Oh, that's a really useful'' invention(!)''"See alsoQuestion markInterrobangReferencesExternal linksU+0021 Exclamation Mark &mdash; Decode UnicodeCategory:Punctuation Category:Typographyar:علامة التعجب ca:Signe d'exclamació cs:Vykřičník da:Udråbstegn de:Ausrufezeichen et:Hüüumärk es:Signos de exclamación eo:Krisigno eu:Harridura-marka fa:علامت تعجب fr:Point d'exclamation gd:Clisg-phuing gl:Signo de admiración ko:느낌표 hr:Uskličnik it:Punto esclamativo he:סימן קריאה kk:Леп белгісі lv:Izsaukuma zīme lt:Šauktukas ln:Elembo ya ligángisi hu:Felkiáltójel nl:Uitroepteken ja:感嘆符 no:Utropstegn pl:Wykrzyknik pt:Ponto de exclamação ru:Восклицательный знак simple:Exclamation mark sk:Výkričník sl:Klicaj sh:Uskličnik fi:Huutomerkki sv:Utropstecken th:อัศเจรีย์ tr:Ünlem işareti uk:Знак оклику zh:叹号
