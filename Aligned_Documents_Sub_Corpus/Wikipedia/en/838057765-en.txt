Within a species, an ecotype is a genetically unique population that is adapted to its local environment. For example it is commonly accepted that the Tucuxi dolphin has two ecotypes - the riverine ecotype found in some South American rivers and the pelagic ecotype found in the South Atlantic Ocean. Similarly, it is accepted that the Bottlenose Dolphin has two ecotypes in the North Atlantic Ocean.The term ecotype was coined in 1922 by Swedish botanist Göte Turesson.An ecotype, as such, has no formal taxonomic standing: also see chemotype.See alsoEcoclineSubspeciesTransplant experimentReferencescategory:zoology category:botany Category:Ecologyde:Ökotyp es:Ecotipo fr:Écotype it:Ecotipo he:אקוטיפ hu:Ökotípus nl:Ecotype pl:Ekotyp ro:Ecotip sv:Ekotyp
