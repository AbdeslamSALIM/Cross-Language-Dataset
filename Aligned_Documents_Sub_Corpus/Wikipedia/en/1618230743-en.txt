 A non-disclosure agreement (NDA), also known as a confidentiality agreement, confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA), or secrecy agreement, is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential materials or knowledge the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or a trade secret. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information.NDAs are commonly signed when two companies or individuals are considering doing business and need to understand the processes used in each others business for the purpose of evaluating the potential business relationship. NDAs can be "mutual", meaning both parties are restricted in their use of the materials provided, or they can restrict the use of material by a single party.It is also possible for an employee to sign an NDA or NDA-like agreement with an employer. In fact, some employment agreements will include a clause restricting employees use and dissemination of company-owned "confidential information." NDAs are used in the IT field, and are often given directly prior to taking a certification exam.In rare cases, the contract may state that the existence of the NDA itself cannot be disclosed.   ContentSome common issues addressed in an NDA include:outlining the parties to the agreement;the definition of what is confidential, i.e. the information to be held confidential. Modern NDAs will typically include a laundry-list of types of items which are covered, including unpublished patent applications, know-how, schema, financial information, verbal representations, customer lists, vendor lists, business practices/strategies, etc;the exclusions from what must be kept confidential. Typically, the restrictions on the disclosure or use of the confidential data will be invalid ifthe recipient had prior knowledge of the materials;the recipient gained subsequent knowledge of the materials from another source;the materials are generally available to the public; orthe materials are subject to a subpoena. In any case, a subpoena would more likely than not override a contract of any sort;provisions restricting the transfer of data in violation of national security;the term (in years) of the confidentiality, i.e. the time period of confidentiality;the term (in years) the agreement is binding;permission to obtain ex-parte injunctive relief;the obligations of the recipient regarding the confidential information, typically including some version of obligations:to use the information only for enumerated purposes;to disclose it only to persons with a need to know the information for those purposes;to use appropriate efforts (not less than reasonable efforts) to keep the information secure. Reasonable efforts is often defined as a standard of care relating to confidential information that is no less rigorous than that which the recipient uses to keep its own similar information secure; andto ensure that anyone to whom the information is disclosed further abides by obligations restricting use, restricting disclosure, and ensuring security at least as protective as the agreement; andtypes of permissible disclosure - such as those required by law or court order.ReferencesSee alsoBusiness brokerForm SF-312 classified information NDAGlossary of legal terms in technologyInvention Secrecy Act (United States, 1951)Non-compete agreementExternal linksConfidentiality and Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDA) booklet edited by the UK Intellectual Property Office (300 KB pdf file)Confidentiality Agreements in IPR-Helpdesk, a web site sponsored by the European CommissionCategory:Intellectual property law Category:Legal documents Category:Employment law Category:Secrecyde:Geheimhaltungsvertrag es:NDA fr:Accord de non divulgation it:Accordo di non divulgazione nl:Geheimhoudingsverklaring ja:守秘義務 pl:Umowa poufności pt:Acordo de não divulgação sv:Sekretessavtal ko:기밀유지 협약
