It became the tallest artificial structure upon the completion of its construction on August 13, 1963. The mast was surpassed in height by 18 m (57 ft) in 1974 by the Warszawa radio mast near Konstantynów, Poland, which collapsed on August 8, 1991, making the KVLY-TV mast again the tallest structure on land. The still-under-construction Burj Dubai in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, planned for completion in 2009, has surpassed the mast as the tallest land structure. As of September 2, 2008, the website for the Burj Dubai project reported that it has reached a height of . However, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat will not recognize the Burj Dubai figures as official until that building is complete.The tower was built by Hamilton Directors and Kline Iron and Steel, and took thirty days to complete, at a cost of US$500,000.Owned by Hoak Media of Dallas, Texas, the tower broadcasts at 316 kW for television station KVLY (channel 11, an NBC affiliate) which is based in Fargo. The tower provides a broadcast area of roughly 30,000 square miles (78,000 km²) which is a radius of about 97 miles.Its height above mean sea level is 3,038 ft (926 m). Some time after its completion, the Federal Government imposed a law that states "Although there is no absolute height limit for antenna towers, both agencies have established a rebuttable presumption against structures over 2,000 feet above ground level."http://www.fcc.gov/mb/policy/dtv/lighting.html The FCC and FAA may approve a taller structure in "exceptional cases."The call letters of the television station for which it was built were originally KTHI, the "HI" referring to the height of the mast. The top is reachable by elevator or ladder.Images Image:KVLYDistance.jpg|KVLY mast from a distance of about one mile (1.6 km) Image:KVLYBase.jpeg|Base of the tower Image:KVLYPylon.jpeg|A guy-wire anchor See alsoList of mastsTallest structures in the U.S.List of the world's tallest structuresStructures of similar heightKXJB Tower (2060 ft - 627.8 m)KXTV/KOVR Tower (2049 ft - 624.5 m)External linksTower web page at KVLY-TVListing on the Skyscraper Pagehttp://www.skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?b471http://www.pbase.com/talshiarr/kvly     Category:Guyed masts Category:Towers in North Dakota Category:North Dakota media Category:Traill County, North Dakotacs:Vysílač KVLY-TV de:KVLY-Mast es:Antena KVLY-TV fr:Mât de KVLY-TV nl:KVLY-TV mast ja:KVLY-TV塔 pl:KVLY/KTHI TV Mast pt:Torre da KVLY-TV sv:KVLY-TV mast uk:Башта KVLY-TV zh:KVLY電視塔
