SOCl2 is a reactive chemical reagent used in chlorination reactions. It is a colorless, distillable liquid at room temperature and pressure that decomposes above 140 °C. SOCl2 is sometimes confused with sulfuryl chloride, SO2Cl2, but the chemical properties of these S(IV) and S(VI) compounds differ significantly. Approximately 45,000 tons/y were produced in the early 1990's.Hans-Dietrich Lauss, Wilfried Steffens “Sulfur Halides” in Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005.Properties and structureThe molecule SOCl2 is pyramidal, indicating the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the S(IV) center (in contrast, the stoichiometrically related species COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is planar). SOCl2 reacts with water to release hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide.H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + O=SCl2 → SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HClProductionThe major industrial synthesis involves the reaction of sulfur trioxide and sulfur dichloride:N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, Chemistry of the Elements, Pergamon Press, 1984.SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → SOCl2 + SO2.Other methods includeSO2 + PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → SOCl2 + POCl3SO2 + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + SCl2 → 2 SOCl2SO3 + Cl2 + 2 SCl2 → 3 SOCl2The first of the above three reactions also affords phosphorus oxychloride (phosphoryl chloride), which resembles thionyl chloride in many of its reactions.ApplicationsThionyl chloride is main used in the industrial production of organochlorine compounds, which are often intermediates in pharmaceuticals and agrichemicals.Organic chemistryThionyl chloride is used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl chlorides and alcohols  to the corresponding alkyl chlorides via an internal nucleophilic substitution.It is preferred over other reagents such as phosphorus pentachloride because the products of the thionyl chloride reactions, HCl and SO2 are gaseous, simplifying the purification of the product. Excess thionyl chloride may be removed by distillation. An example of a reaction of thionyl chloride with an alcohol is in a synthesis of bicifadine Chlorination/Cyclodehydration of Amino Alcohols with SOCl2: An Old Reaction Revisited Feng Xu, Bryon Simmons, Robert A. Reamer, Edward Corley, Jerry Murry, and David Tschaen J. Org. Chem. 2008, 73, 312-315 :Sulfonic acids react with thionyl chloride to produce sulfonyl chlorides. Likewise, thionyl chloride will transform sulfinic acids into sulfinyl chlorides and phosphonic acids into phosphoryl chlorides.Thionyl chloride will react with primary formamides to form isocyanides.Amides will react with thionyl chloride to form imidoyl chlorides. However, primary amides under heating with thionyl chloride will continue on to form nitriles.Inorganic chemistryAnhydrous metal chlorides may be obtained from hydrated metal chlorides by refluxing in freshly distilled thionyl chloride:MCln&middot;xH2O + x SOCl2 &rarr; MCln + x SO2 + 2x HClOther applicationsThionyl chloride is a component of lithium-thionyl chloride batteries as the positive active material with lithium as the negative active material. In military usage, thionyl chloride is used in the "di-di" method of producing G-series nerve agents.SafetySOCl2 is a reactive compound that can explosively release dangerous gases upon contact with water and other reagents. Industrial production of thionyl chloride is controlled under the Chemical Weapons Convention, where it is listed in schedule 3.ReferencesExternal linksUsage of thionyl chloride in Organic SynthesesNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical HazardsCategory:Chlorides Category:Thionyl compounds Category:Acyl chlorides Category:Nonmetal halides Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Inorganic sulfur compounds Category:lachrymatory agentscs:Chlorid thionylu de:Thionylchlorid es:Cloruro de tionilo fr:Chlorure de thionyle it:Cloruro di tionile nl:Thionylchloride ja:塩化チオニル pl:Chlorek tionylu pt:Cloreto de tionila ru:Тионилхлорид sv:Tionylklorid zh:氯化亚砜
