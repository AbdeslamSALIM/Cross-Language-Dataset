She holds the Belgian records for heptathlon, indoor pentathlon, and high jump, both indoors and outdoors. Great Expectations, Flanders Today, August 6, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Hellebaut is being trained by her partner, Wim Vandeven, at her club, Atletica 84. She was a professional athlete with Atletiek Vlaanderen in the period from 2001 to October 2005. From November 1, 2006 she again became a professional athlete, this time at Bloso. Currently she lives in Tessenderlo.At the 2006 European Championships and 2007 Indoor European Championships Hellebaut won the gold medal in high jump. The 2006 victory became especially notable, when just a couple of minutes later her close friend and compatriot Kim Gevaert completed a historical sprint double. The images of both athletes celebrating their victory together, wrapped in a national flag, became part of Belgian sports history.In 2007 Hellebaut set the fourth best pentathlon score of all time, but chose not to contest the European Indoor Championships because of illness, choosing instead to compete only in the high jump, which she later won. Most of the remainder of her 2007 high jump season was hampered by an ankle injury.A shoulder injury, which makes it difficult for her to throw the javelin has meant that it is unlikely Hellebaut will ever again contest a heptathlon.For the 2008 indoor season, Hellebaut returned her focus to multi-events and became world champion of pentathlon at the World Indoor Championships in Valencia, where she set a secord for the best high jump result in a women's multi-event competition, clearing 1.99 m.iaaf.org - Gevaert on top of the world in Gent - PREVIEW&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;At the 2008 Summer Olympics, held in Beijing, Hellebaut won the gold medal in the high jump, ahead of the favorite, Blanka Vlašić of Croatia, with a new outdoor personal best of 2.05 m. Her achievement represented the first-ever athletics gold medal in the Olympics for a Belgian woman, and only the second of any color, one day after Belgium won their first (Silver) medal in the 4×100m relay.International achievementsYearTournamentVenueEventResultExtra1995European Youth Olympic DaysBath]], Great-Britainhigh jump9th1.75 metres1997European Championships for JuniorsLjubljana, Sloveniaheptathlon11th5157 points1999European Championships (Ages 20-22)Göteborg]], Swedenheptathlon6th5548 points2000European Championships IndoorGhent, Belgiumpentathlon14th (injured after day one)2001World ChampionshipsEdmonton, Canadaheptathlon14th5680 points2003World ChampionshipsParis, Franceheptathlonretired after day one (ill)2004World Championships IndoorBudapest, Hungarypentathlon5th4526 points2004Summer Olympics]]Athens, Greecehigh jump12th in final round1.85 metres2005World ChampionshipsHelsinki, Finlandhigh jump6th in final round1.93 metres2006World Championships IndoorHelsinki, Finlandhigh jump6th in final round1.93 metres2006European ChampionshipsGöteborg]], Swedenhigh jumpwinner2.03 metres2006IAAF Golden League Brussels]]Brussels, Belgiumhigh jumpwinner1.98 metres2006IAAF Golden League BerlinBerlin, Germanyhigh jumpwinner2.00 metres2007Golden High Jump GalaBrussels, Belgiumhigh jumpwinner2.00 metres2007European Indoor ChampionshipsBirmingham, Englandhigh jumpwinner2.05 metres2007World Championships]]Osaka, Japanhigh jump14th in final round1.90 metres2008World Indoor Championships]]Valencia]], Spainpentathlonwinner4867 points2008Summer Olympics]]Beijing]], Chinahigh jump[[Athletics at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Women's high jump|'winner']]2.05 metresPersonal recordsEventResultYearExtra100 metres hurdles13"91 seconds200660 metres hurdles8"50 seconds2006Triple jump13.05 metres2001Shot put13.85 metres2008Javelin throw44.37 metres2001200 metres24"65 seconds2006800 metres2'14"75 seconds2006Long jump indoor6.42 metres2007Long jump outdoor6.44 metres2007High jump indoor2.05 metres2007, March 3Indoor European Championships]], Championship RecordHigh jump outdoor2.05 metres2008, August 23Summer Olympics]]Heptathlon6201 points2006, June 3Götzis, AustriaPentathlon4877 points2007Belgian recordsEventResultYearLocationPentathlon indoor4268 pointsFebruary 17, 1999Ghent, BelgiumPentathlon indoor4436 pointsFebruary 25, 2001Ghent, BelgiumPentathlon indoor4560 pointsFebruary 1, 2004Zuidbroek]], the NetherlandsPentathlon indoor4589 pointsFebruary 21, 2004Aubière, FranceHigh Jump outdoor1.95 metresJune 20, 2004Plovdiv, BulgariaHigh Jump outdoor1.95 metresAugust 27, 2004Athens, GreeceLong Jump indoor6.36 metresFebruary 19, 2006Ghent, BelgiumHigh Jump indoor1.96 metresFebruary 26, 2006Ghent, BelgiumHigh Jump indoor1.97 metresFebruary 28, 2006Tallinn, EstoniaHeptathlon outdoor6201 pointsMay 28, 2006Götzis, AustriaHigh Jump outdoor1.98 metresJune 2, 2006Oslo, NorwayHigh Jump outdoor2.00 metresJuly 8, 2006Paris, FranceHigh Jump outdoor2.00 metresJuly 15, 2006Rome, ItalyHigh Jump outdoor2.01 metresAugust 11, 2006Gothenburg, SwedenHigh Jump outdoor2.03 metresAugust 11, 2006Gothenburg, SwedenHigh Jump indoor2.00 metresJanuary 27, 2007Brussels, BelgiumLong jump indoor6.42 metresFebruary 11, 2007Ghent, BelgiumPentathlon indoor4877 pointsFebruary 11, 2007Ghent, BelgiumHigh jump indoor2.05 metresMarch 3, 2007Birmingham, EnglandHigh Jump outdoor2.05 metresAugust 23, 2008Beijing, ChinaExternal linksTia Hellebaut Official WebsiteTia Hellebaut PicturesReferences   [[Lyudmila Blonska]]|
