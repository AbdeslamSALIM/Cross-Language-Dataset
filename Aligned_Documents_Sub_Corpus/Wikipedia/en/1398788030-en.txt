  Ally McBeal is an American television series which ran on the FOX network from 1997 to 2002. The series was created by David E. Kelley, who also served as the executive producer, along with Bill D'Elia. The series starred Calista Flockhart in the title role as a young lawyer working in the fictional Boston law firm Cage, Fish and Associates with other young lawyers whose lives and loves were eccentric, humorous and dramatic.OverviewThe show focused on the romantic and personal lives of the main characters, often using legal proceedings as plot devices to contrast or reinforce a character's drama. For example, bitter divorce litigation of a client might provide a backdrop for Ally's decision to break up with a boyfriend.The show had many off-beat and frequently surreal running gags and themes, for example Ally would immediately fall over whenever she met somebody she found attractive, and the character Fish's "wattle" fetish and humorous mottos ("Fishisms") ran through the series. The show used vivid, dramatic fantasy sequences for Ally's and other characters' wishful thinking; particularly notable is the dancing baby.The show also featured regular visits to a local bar where singer and cast member Vonda Shepard regularly performed (though occasionally handing over the microphone to the characters).In the fourth season, Robert Downey Jr. joined the regular cast as Ally's boyfriend Larry Paul but was written out after the end of the season.The show was canceled after a significant ratings drop during its fifth season.CriticismDespite its success, Ally McBeal did receive some criticism from TV critics and feminists who found the title character annoying and demeaning to women, and specifically professional women,Michelle L. Hammers, "Cautionary Tales of Liberation and Female Professionalism: The Case Against Ally McBeal" Western Journal of Communication 69 2, April (2005): 168. "The ease with which McBeal's depictions of women are reincorporated into dominant masculinist discourses ... is particularly problematic for professional women. The increased danger that co-optation poses for professional women is due to the complex ways in which the discursive sedimentation that surrounds the female body, particularly as it has been traditionally sexualized and linked to emotionality, operates as a barrier to women's full and effective participation in professional spheres. Thus, McBeal operates as a cautionary tale about the dangers presented by the co-optation of postfeminist and third-wave feminist discourses as they relate to current professional discourses surrounding the female body. because of her perceived flightiness, lack of demonstrated legal knowledge, and extreme emotional instability. Perhaps the most notorious example of the debate sparked by the show was the 25 June 1998 cover story of Time magazine, which juxtaposed McBeal with three pioneering feminists and asked "Is Feminism Dead?".Episode list''Ally'' the sitcomIn 1999, at the height of the show's popularity, a half-hour version entitled Ally &quot;Ally&quot; (1999)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; began being broadcast in parallel to the main program. This innovative version, designed in a sitcom format, used re-edited scenes from the main program, as well as previously unseen footage. The intention was to further develop the plots in the comedy-drama in a sitcom style. It also focused only on Ally's personal life, cutting all the courtroom plots. The repackaged show did not catch on and was canceled partway through its initial run. While 13 episodes of Ally were shot, only 10 were broadcast.US RatingsSeasonU.S. ratingsNetworkRank11997-199815.7 millionFOX#1221998-199913.8 millionFOX#2031999-200012.4 millionFOX#3542000-200111.5 millionFOX#4552001-20029.4 millionFOX#65Main castCalista Flockhart - Ally McBealGreg Germann - Richard FishJane Krakowski - Elaine VassallPeter MacNicol - John Cage (episode 3–103; recurring otherwise)Lisa Nicole Carson - Renee Raddick (seasons 1–4; one guest appearance in series finale)Portia de Rossi - Nelle Porter (episodes 34–112; recurring previously)Lucy Liu - Ling Woo (episodes 34–96; 103; recurring otherwise)Gil Bellows - Billy Alan Thomas (episodes 1–62; recurring afterwards)Courtney Thorne-Smith - Georgia Thomas (seasons 1–3; recurring afterwards)Robert Downey Jr. - Larry Paul (season 4; uncredited appearances afterwards)Hayden Panettiere - Maddie Harrington (episodes 102–112)Vonda Shepard - herself (seasons 2–5; recurring previously)James LeGros - Mark Albert (season 4; recurring previously)Regina Hall - Corretta Lipp (season 5; recurring previously)Julianne Nicholson - Jenny Shaw (episodes 91–103)Josh Hopkins - Raymond Millbury (season 5)James Marsden - Glenn Foy (episodes 91–103)Guest starsThe singers who would perform at the bar (most often Vonda Shepard) were accompanied by a trio of back-up singers often referred to as the Ikettes.
