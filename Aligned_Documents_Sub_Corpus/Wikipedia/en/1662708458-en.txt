They represent la Comarca Lagunera, which is made up of Torreon, Gomez Palacio and Lerdo. Santos Laguna plays in the Primera División. The club's debut in Mexico's top division was in the 1988/89 tournament. They have won the league championship three times. First in the Invierno 1996 tournament, the Verano 2001 tournament and the most recent Clausura 2008 tournament. They have also reached the finals in the 1993-1994 season and the Verano 2000 tournament. By the passing years, Santos Laguna has been growing and has converted into one of the greatest teams in La Liga.Current yearsSantos Laguna started the Clasura 2007 in danger of being relegated to the second division despite buying many stars such as: Oswaldo Sanchez from Chivas de Guadalajara, Daniel Ludueña from Tecos UAG, Juan Pablo Rodriguez from Chivas de Guadalajara, Fernando Ortiz from Estudiantes, Jorge Iván Estrada from Veracruz, and welcoming the return of Vicente Matías Vuoso from Club América. The team started the season with a defeat from Monterrey. Santos Laguna continued the season playing average futbol. Not winning a single game til week 8 against Morelia, they started to play great, yet they were still on the verge of relegation, up until the last game, when Querétaro could not defeat Atlas. Along with staying another year in the 1st Division, they were also able to make "El Repechaje" against San Luis. The 1st leg, San Luis went up 2-1 at Santos Laguna's home. The 2nd leg, Santos managed advance to the quarter finals on a last minute goal by Walter Jimenez. In the quarter finals, Santos played against the "favorite to win the championship," Pachuca. Although the 1st leg and 2nd leg were both tied (at 1-1 each, 2-2 Global Aggregate), Santos ultimately lost because Pachuca were 1st place on the group table of La Liga.The start of the Apertura 2007 for Santos was a promising one, first defeating Cruz Azul 2-0 at home, Toluca 2-3 away, and Pachuca 0-1.In August 29th 2007 Santos Laguna beat Guadalajara to achieve their best start ever with 5 wins in 5 games.On June 1st 2008 Santos Laguna beat Cruz Azul (3-2 Global Aggregate) to win the Clausura 2008 trophy.
