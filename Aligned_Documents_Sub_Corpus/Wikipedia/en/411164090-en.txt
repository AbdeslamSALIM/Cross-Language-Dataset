Freire is considered one of the top sprinters in road bicycle racing, having won the World Cycling Championship on a record-equalling three occasions, along with Alfredo Binda, Rik Van Steenbergen and Eddy Merckx, and the cycling monument Milan-Sanremo on two occasions.CareerFreire became professional in 1998 at the Vitalicio Seguros team. Through the 1998 season Freire only won one race, a stage in the Vuelta a Castilla y León, and achieved eleventh place in the Paris-Tours UCI Road World Cup race. In 1999, Freire went the entire season without a major victory until the World Championships in October. Although Freire went to the World Championships in Verona seemingly only to make up the numbers of the Spanish team, he went on to take an unexpected victory. A photograph taken shortly after his win, in which he is calling his grandmother (who had no television) to tell her he had won, became famous. He spent the prize money on an elevator for his grandmother's apartment.Freire is a sprinter who, unlike many other sprinters, does not need much help from his team mates to get into good position for a win. Despite his diminutive stature, Freire is one of the most feared sprinters in the peloton. He usually draws his own plan in which he hopes the element of surprise gives him the victory. Freire sometimes gets criticized for his training ethic, since he usually rides only half the training miles in comparison with other cyclists.For the 2000 season, Freire was able to secure a contract with the Mapei cycling team. Mapei had been ranked as the best team since 1994 when Freire joined. That year he had a successful season, winning 11 races including two stages in the Vuelta a España, and a third place at the World Championships. In 2001 Freire had a modest season, winning two races and the points competition in the Vuelta a Burgos, before becoming world champion for the second time. In 2002 he was less successful, but still he won a stage in the Tour de France.In 2003, Freire moved to the Rabobank team, where in his first season he won six races. 2004 was a more successful year: Freire won Milan-Sanremo, Trofeo Luis Puig, a stage in Tirreno-Adriatico and second place overall, a stage in the Vuelta a España and for the third time, and the second time in Verona, the World Championships. Freire enjoyed an excellent start to the 2005 season winning three stages, the points classification and the GC yellow jersey at the Tirreno-Adriatico, as well as the Brabantse Pijl, Trofeo Alcudia and Trofeo Mallorca, all before the end of March. His season was then cut short, and all attempts at victory in Grand Tour stages and Classic races eliminated, due to complications arising from a saddle sore.In 2006, Freire won his second consecutive Brabantse Pijl. His stage 3 win at the Tirreno-Adriatico allowed him to wear the event's yellow jersey as the overall leader for 2 days, although Freire was unable to repeat his overall victory of 2005. At the Tour de Suisse, he survived an early break of four riders to record an impressive solo win on Stage 7.in the green jersey that he received for winning the points classification in the 2008 Tour de France]] In the 2006 Tour de France, Freire won the 5th and 9th stage, and was contesting the points classification until he was forced to retire from the race due to illness. During stage twelve, Freire was involved in a breakaway with three other riders. When Yaroslav Popovych, riding for the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, rode away for the victory, rumours spread that Freire had been ordered by his Rabobank Directeur sportif not to ride for the victory, in order to secure help from the Discovery Team in the mountains for their general classification aims. Although such rumours were rubbished by both teams, Freire was visibly upset after the stage.Freire continued his successful year by winning the Vattenfall Cyclassics, finishing ahead of German favourite Erik Zabel. This, his seventh victory of the year, means that Freire accounts for half of Rabobank’s victories in 2006. Freire's season was cut short by neck and spinal injuries, forcing him to miss both the Vuelta a España and World Championships.Freire’s career has been blighted with injury and successive return to form following his lay-offs. He has suffered from back problems, saddle sores and most recently neck problems. Freire re-signed for the Rabobank team in late 2006 until the end of 2008, rejecting overtures and a possible lucrative contract from Saunier Duval-Prodir, citing that he felt comfortable with the Dutch squad.In the 2007 Tour de France, Freire was unable to win a stage, partly because his team Rabobank was defending Michael Rasmussen's yellow jersey for a large part of the race. Freire also started in the 2007 Vuelta a España, winning 3 stages. In the 2008 Tour de France, Freire wore the green jersey from stage 8, and decided to try to keep it until Paris. He won stage 14, and was indeed able to win the green jersey for the points classification.Palmarès1998Vuelta a Castilla y León, 1 stage1999Winner, Road Race World Championship2000Vuelta a España, 2 stagesTirreno-Adriatico, 2 stagesVuelta a Aragon, 2 stagesWinner, Points classificationGiro della Provincia di Lucca, 1 stageVolta a la Comunitat Valenciana, 1 stageEscalada a Montjuïc, Part 1Trofeo Mallorca2001Winner, Road Race World ChampionshipVuelta a Burgos, 1 stageWinner, Points classificationDeutschland Tour, 1 stage win2002Tour de France, 1 stageManacor-Porto CristoCala Rajada – Cala Millor20031st, Giro della Provincia di Lucca, Overall, 2 stagesVuelta a Andalucía, 2 stagesWinner, Points classificationTirreno-Adriatico, 1 stageVolta a Catalunya, 1 stage2004Winner, Road Race World ChampionshipVuelta a España, 1 stageTirreno-Adriatico, 1 stage1st, Milan-Sanremo1st, Trofeo Luis PuigTrofeo Cala Millor – Cala Rajada20051st, Tirenno-Adriatico, 3 stagesWinner, Points classification1st, Brabantse PijlTrofeo AlcudiaTrofeo Mallorca2006Tour de France, 2 stagesTour de Suisse, 1 stageVuelta al País Vasco, 1 stageTirenno-Adriatico, 1 stage1st, Vattenfall Cyclassics1st, Brabantse Pijl2007Trofeo Mallorca1st, Vuelta a Andalucía - Overall, 2 stagesWinner, Points classification1st, Milan-Sanremo1st, Brabantse Pijl3rd, Gent-Wevelgem8th, Amstel Gold Race2nd, Vattenfall CyclassicsVuelta a España1st, Stage 21st, Stage 51st, Stage 6Gold jersey wearer (Stages 2-3)3rd, Paris-Tours2008Tirreno-Adriatico, 2 stagesWinner, Points classification1st, Gent-WevelgemTour de Suisse1st, Stage 1Tour de FranceWinner, Points Classification1st, Stage 14: Nîmes - Digne-les-BainsVuelta a España1st, Stage 11   [[Oskar Camenzind]] &lt;br \&gt;  [[Romāns Vainšteins]]  &lt;br \&gt;  [[Igor Astarloa]]|
