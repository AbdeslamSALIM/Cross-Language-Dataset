Djet, also known as Wadj, Zet, and Uadji (in Greek possibly the pharaoh known as Uenephes), c. 2920 BC, was the third Egyptian pharaoh of the first dynasty. Djet's Horus name means "Horus Cobra."Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames & Hudson Ltd, 2006 paperback, p.16Little is known about his reign, but he has become famous because of the survival, in well-preserved form, of one of his artistically refined tomb steles. It is carved in relief with Djet's Horus name, and shows that the distinct Egyptian style already had become fully developed at that time. His reign was listed in the lost or destroyed sections of the Palermo Stone.ReferencesToby A. H. Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt, Routledge, London/New York 1999, ISBN 0-415-18633-1, 73-74Toby A. H.
