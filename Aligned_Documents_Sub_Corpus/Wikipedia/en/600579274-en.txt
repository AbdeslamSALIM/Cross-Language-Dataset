It is considered vulnerable by IUCN due to habitat loss and pollution. It is very rare in captivity, with only two individuals - both in zoos in Malaysia - recorded by ISIS in early 2008.International Species Information System.

ISBN 85974 507 5 The thick fur is generally dark reddish-brown tinged grey, with a more reddish head and whitish underparts. Except for the relatively faint facial streaks, it is rather unpatterned. The legs are fairly short, and the ears are short and round. The shape of the head is atypical for a cat; the skull is fairly long, while the skull roof, as suggested by both its common and scientific name, is rather flat.IUCN Cat Specialist Group. 1996.

ISBN 967-99947-1-6 and most records are from near water. It mostly hunts for frogs, fish and crustaceans, but will also catch rats and chickens. It has relatively long premolars, and is one of the few cats that is unable to retract its claws (the others being the cheetah, fishing cat, and the Iriomote cat). These adaptions combined with its behavior have resulted in comparisons with semi-aquatic mustelids, and it is known for readily entering water. Overall, however, little is known about its wild behavior, but a gestation period of about 56 days, and a litter size of 1-2 kittens have been reported in captivity.ARKive: Flat-headed cat (Prionailurus planiceps). Accessed 2008-04-04 Captive individuals have lived for 14+ years. It is generally considered a nocturnal animal, but observations of captives suggests it is crepuscular.StatusThe Flat-headed Cat is considered vulnerable by IUCN and listed on appendix 1 by CITES. The total population is believed to be less than 10.000 adults, with no single sub-population containing more than 1.000 adults. While habitat loss and water pollution are serious threats, sightings from oil palm plantations suggests it is less specialized than generally believed. The Flat-headed Cat is fully protected throughout its natural range, except in Brunei, where this species lacks legal protection. Sightings are generally very rare.ReferencesCat, Flat-headed Category:Felinesbr:Kazh plaen e benn bg:Плоскоглава котка cs:Kočka plochočelá da:Fladhovedet kat de:Flachkopfkatze es:Prionailurus planiceps eo:Platkapa kato fr:Chat à tête plate it:Prionailurus planiceps nl:Platkopkat ja:マレーヤマネコ no:Flathodekatt pl:Kot kusy ru:Суматранская кошка fi:Litteäpääkissa sv:Platthuvudkatt th:แมวป่าหัวแบน tr:Yassıbaş kedi
