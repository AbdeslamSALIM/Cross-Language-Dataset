As their first new release under their new alliance with Virgin Records, it ended a five-year gap since their last studio album, Steel Wheels in 1989. Voodoo Lounge is also The Rolling Stones' first album without founding bassist Bill Wyman, who departed the line-up in early 1993.HistoryFollowing the release of Keith Richards' Main Offender and Mick Jagger's Wandering Spirit in 1992 and 1993 respectively, both leaders of The Rolling Stones began composing new songs in April 1993, deciding upon Don Was as co-producer for the upcoming sessions. In November, after rehearsing and recording at Ronnie Wood's house in Ireland that September, The Rolling Stones shifted their gear to Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin and began cutting Voodoo Lounge. Although not joining the band officially, Darryl Jones would be taking Bill Wyman's place as the group's regular bassist.After a period of recording in Los Angeles in the first few months of 1994, Voodoo Lounge was complete and The Rolling Stones moved onto the rehearsals for the (yet another massive, worldwide) Voodoo Lounge Tour which would begin in August. "Love Is Strong" - which was inspired by Richards' solo "Wicked As It Seems" - was released as the first single, reaching #14 in the UK. However, although "Love Is Strong" was a hit on US rock radio, it stalled on the overall US singles charts at #91, and (at least in the US) became The Rolling Stones' worst performing lead single from an album to that time. Two follow-up US singles also received strong rock radio airplay, but failed to cross over into top 40 hits: "Out of Tears" peaked at #60, and "You Got Me Rocking" fared even worse, peaking at #113. Consequently, Voodoo Lounge would be the first Rolling Stones album to not produce significant hits in America. In the UK, meanwhile, "Love Is Strong", "You Got Me Rocking", "Out Of Tears", and "I Go Wild" were all top 40 chart hits.Released in July 1994, Voodoo Lounge received strong reviews and debuted at #1 in the UK (their first chart-topper there since 1980's Emotional Rescue) and #2 in the US where it went double platinum. Many observers noted that - while the album was again considered to be calculated as a classicist piece to recall earlier triumphs - it was a much more sparse recording, contrasting with the slick sound of Steel Wheels.Producer Don Was, noted for his retro rock production sensibilities, was reportedly responsible for pushing the band towards more conventional territory in an attempt to reproduce the archetypal "Rolling Stones" sound, and moving them away from the rockabilly and African grooves they had reportedly been leaning on during the writing and early recording phases of Voodoo Lounge. The result was an essentially classicist recording that drew on the blues, R&B, and country that had informed the Stones classic late 1960s/early 1970s recordings. Although this approach pleased critics and the Stones rock-oriented fanbase, Jagger in particular expressed some dissatisfaction with Was' aesthetic, and would insist on a more diverse, contemporary production cast for the subsequent Bridges to Babylon. Nevertheless, Was (who has produced several Grammy-winning records) remains the Stones producer to this day.In early 1995, while the Voodoo Lounge Tour was still in full force (not finishing until August that year) Voodoo Lounge won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Although it is not considered to be a truly outstanding piece of work on a par with Let It Bleed or Some Girls, many observers consider Voodoo Lounge to be more of a comeback than Steel Wheels was touted to be.Track listingAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards."Love Is Strong" - 3:50"You Got Me Rocking" - 3:35"Sparks Will Fly" - 3:16"The Worst" - 2:24"New Faces" - 2:52"Moon Is Up" - 3:42"Out of Tears" - 5:27"I Go Wild" - 4:23"Brand New Car" - 4:15"Sweethearts Together" - 4:45"Suck on the Jugular" - 4:28"Blinded by Rainbows" - 4:33"Baby Break It Down" - 4:09"Thru and Thru" - 6:15"Mean Disposition" - 4:08PersonnelMick Jagger - Vocals, Backing Vocals, Electric Guitar, Harmonica, Acoustic Guitar, Maracas, CastanetsKeith Richards - Electric Guitar, Backing Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Piano, Bass, TambourineCharlie Watts - Drums, TambourineRonnie Wood - Electric Guitar, Pedal Steel Guitar, Slide Guitar, Backing Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Lap Steel GuitarChuck Leavell - Piano, Organ, Harmonium, HarpsichordDarryl Jones - BassBernard Fowler - Backing VocalsMax Baca - BassDavid Campbell - String ArrangementLenny Castro - PercussionPierre de Beauport - Acoustic GuitarFrankie Gavin - Fiddle, PennywhistleMark Isham - TrumpetLuis Jardim - Percussion, ShakerFlaco Jimenez - AccordionPhil Jones - PercussionDavid McMurray - SaxophoneIvan Neville - Backing Vocals, OrganBenmont Tench - Organ, Piano, AccordionBobby Womack - Backing VocalsChartsAlbumYearChartPosition1994UK Top 75 Albums11994The Billboard 20021994Australian ARIA Albums Chart1SinglesYearSingleChartPosition1994"Love Is Strong"UK Top 75 Singles141994"Love Is Strong"The Billboard Hot 100911994"Love Is Strong"Mainstream Rock Tracks21994"Love Is Strong"Hot 100 Singles Sales631994"You Got Me Rocking"Mainstream Rock Tracks21994"You Got Me Rocking"UK Top 75 Singles231994"Out Of Tears"Adult Contemporary311994"Out Of Tears"The Billboard Hot 100601994"Out Of Tears"Hot 100 Singles Sales471994"Out Of Tears"Mainstream Rock Tracks141994"Out Of Tears"UK Top 75 Singles361995"You Got Me Rocking"Bubbling Under Hot 1001131995"Sparks Will Fly"Mainstream Rock Tracks301995"I Go Wild"Mainstream Rock Tracks201995"I Go Wild"UK Top 75 Singles29   Category:The Rolling Stones albums Category:1994 albums Category:Virgin Records albums Category:Albums produced by Don Was Category:Albums produced by The Glimmer Twinsda:Voodoo Lounge de:Voodoo Lounge es:Voodoo Lounge fr:Voodoo Lounge it:Voodoo Lounge nl:Voodoo Lounge ja:ヴードゥー・ラウンジ no:Voodoo Lounge pl:Voodoo Lounge fi:Voodoo Lounge sv:Voodoo Lounge
