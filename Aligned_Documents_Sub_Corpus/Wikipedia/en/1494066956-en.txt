The previous year, the three had worked together, under the name of Careca, to produce a piece called "Indian Rave", which was a midly successful song. In 1995, Sash! released "It's My Life", which became a European club hit. In 1997, with Sabine Ohmes as the singer, Sash! released "Encore Une Fois". Described on Sash's biography as "the big break", it reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart, as well as reaching the top 10 of five countries' singles charts, and the top 20 of seven countries' singles charts.In the same year, Sash! produced "Ecuador", and "Stay", which both also reached #2 in the UK Singles Chart. In 1998, Sash! released "La Primavera", which reached #3, "Mysterious Times", which reached #2, and "Move Mania", which reached #8. In 1999, "Colour The World" was sold, and it reached #15. The following year, "Adelante" was released, and it reached #2. "Just Around The Hill", and "With My Own Eyes", were also released in that year, reaching #8 and #10 respectively. "With My Own Eyes" became the last single released by Sash! in the United Kingdom for at least 8 years.In 2007, Sash! released an album called '10th Anniversary', which was first sold in South Africa. The album was scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom by the end of May 2008, although this release has apparently been delayed. On June 20 2008, Sash! was ranked #168 on the DJ List. On 2008 Sash! came back with a new single "Raindrops" made together with Stunt- which is a remake of his first single "Encore Une Fois".Other projectsBesides Sash!, the trio have also produced tracks for some of their collaborators, including Sabine Ohmes in the project Encore!, and Peter Faulhammer as Martillo Vago (a Spanish transliteration of Faulhammer's last name).
