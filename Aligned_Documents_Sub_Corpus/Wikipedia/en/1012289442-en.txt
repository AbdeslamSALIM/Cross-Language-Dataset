 [[Image:Navajolang-readingAdahooniligii.jpg|275px|thumb|Reading Adahooniigii — The Navajo Language Monthly]] Navajo or Navaho (native name: Diné bizaad) is an Athabaskan language (of Na-Dené stock) spoken in the southwest United States by the Navajo people (Diné). It is geographically and linguistically one of the Southern Athabaskan languages (the majority of Athabaskan languages are spoken in northwest Canada and Alaska). Navajo claims more speakers than any other Native American or First Nation language north of the U.S.-Mexico border, with more than 100,000 native speakers, and this number has actually increased with time. During World War II, a code based on Navajo was used by code talkers to send secure military messages over radio.Current useThe Navajo language is still widely spoken by Navajos of all ages, with over half of the Navajo population speaking the Navajo language at home. Many parents still pass on the Navajo language to their children as a first language, and because of this, the Navajo are one of the very few Native American tribes that still use the native language of their tribe as a form of everyday communication. However, the language is in decline, especially in urban areas outside of reservations, as more and more younger Navajos have started to shift to the English language. Even on the reservation, Census data indicate that between 1980 and 1990 the proportion of Navajos aged 5-17 who spoke only English rose from 12% to 28%, and by 2000, the figure reached 43%.Ethnography of speakingpolite speech toward certain kinceremonial speechwar speechpuns (Sapir 1932)Regional variationvelar/nonvelar aspirationlexical differencesOrthography and pronunciationConsonantsThe consonants of Navajo in the standard orthography are listed below, followed by their pronunciation in IPA notation in brackets:  ||   || || ||   || ||   |- align="center" | aspirated | ||   || || ||   ||   || |- align="center" | ejective | ||   || || ||   || || |- align="center" ! rowspan=3| Affricates | plain | ||   || dl  ||   || || || |- align="center" | aspirated | ||   ||   ||   || || || |- align="center" | ejective | ||   ||   ||   || || || |- align="center" ! rowspan=2| Continuant | voiceless | ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   |- align="center" | voiced | ||   ||   ||   ||   ||   || |- align="center" ! colspan="2" | Nasals |   ||   || || || || || |- align="center" ! colspan="2" | Approximants | || || ||   || || ( ) || |In Navajo orthography, the letter  represents two different sounds: it is pronounced  when stem initial and  when prefixal or stem/word final. However, when  is preceded by  it is always written as  and never as  so that it will not be confused with  (e.g.  "I'm turning around", but never ). The consonant   is written as  before front vowels  and  (where it is palatalized ), as  before  (where it is labialized ), and as  before . The glottal stop  is not written at the beginning of words.For  , both the palatalization and labialization is represented in the orthography where is it written as  for the palatalized variant and  for the labialized variant. The orthography does not indicate the variants for the other consonants.VowelsThere are four basic vowel qualities in Navajo: a'', ''e, i'' and ''o. Each of these may occur asshort, as in a'' and ''e,long, as in aa and ee,nasalized, as in ą'' and ''ęę,or with one of four tones:high, as in áá and éé,low, as in aa and ee,rising, as in aá and eé orfalling, as in áa and ée.Various combinations of these features are possible, as in ą́ą́ (long, nasalized, high tone).GrammarTypologically, Navajo is an agglutinating, polysynthetic head-marking language, but many of its affixes combine into contractions more like fusional languages. The canonical word order of Navajo is SOV. Athabaskan words are modified primarily by prefixes, which is unusual for an SOV language (suffixes are expected).Navajo is a "verb-heavy" language &mdash; it has a great preponderance of verbs but relatively few nouns. In addition to verbs and nouns, Navajo has other elements such as pronouns, clitics of various functions, demonstratives, numerals, postpositions, adverbs, and conjunctions, among others. Harry Hoijer grouped all of the above into a word-class which he called particles (i.e., Navajo would then have verbs, nouns, and particles). There is nothing that corresponds to what are called adjectives in English, this adjectival function being provided by verbs.Nouns Many concepts expressed using nouns in other languages appear as verbs in Navajo. The majority of true nouns are not inflected for number, and there is no case marking. Noun phrases are often not needed to form grammatical sentences due to the informational content of the verb.There are two main types of nouns in Navajo:simple nouns andnouns derived from verbs (called deverbal nouns)The simple nouns can be distinguished by their ability to be inflected with a possessive prefix, as in || "knife" ||  || "her knife" ||  (3rd person) +  "knife" |- |  || "pack" ||  || "my pack" ||  (1st person singular) +  "pack" |Deverbal nouns are verbs (or verb phrases) that have been nominalized with a nominalizing enclitic or converted into a noun through zero derivation (that is, verbs that are used syntactically as nouns without an added nominalizer). An example of a nominalized verb is  "clock", which is derived from the verb  "it is moved slowly in a circle" and the enclitic nominalizer . Another example is the deverbal noun  "singer" (from verb  "he sings" + nominalizing enclitic ). Converted deverbal nouns include  "exit, doorway" and  "Phoenix, Arizona" — when used as verbs  may be translated into English as "something has a path horizontally out" and  as "place/space is hot". Deverbal nouns can potentially be long and complex, such as || &nbsp; || "army tank" |which is composed ofthe nominalized noun  "caterpillar tractor" (which itself is composed of noun  "car", verb  "it crawls about", and nominalizer )the noun  "cannon" (which, in turn, is composed of verb  "explosion/boom is made with it" and adjectival enclitic  "big")the postposition  "on it"the verb  "they sit up"the nominalizer PossessionPostpositions Postpositions are morphologically similar to nouns in that they are also inflected with possessive prefixes.NumeralsNavajo uses a decimal (base-10) numeral system. There are unique words for the cardinal numbers 1-10. The numerals 11-19 are formed by adding an additive "plus 10" suffix  to the base numerals 1-9. The numerals 20-100 are formed by adding a multiplicative "times 10" suffix  to the base numerals 2-10.) | rowspan="11" style="background-color: lightgrey;" | ! colspan="2" | x10 () |- ! 1 |  ||  || (11) | colspan="2" style="text-align: center;" | – |- ! 2 |  ||  || (12) ||  || (20) |- ! 3 |  ||  || (13) ||  || (30) |- ! 4 |  ||  || (14) ||  || (40) |- ! 5 |  ||  || (15) ||  || (50) |- ! 6 |  ||  || (16) ||  || (60) |- ! 7 |  ||  || (17) ||  || (70) |- ! 8 |  ||  || (18) ||  || (80) |- ! 9 |  ||  || (19) ||  || (90) |- ! 10 |  | colspan="2" style="text-align: center;" | – |  || (100) |In the compound numerals, the combining forms of the base numerals have irregular vowel and consonants changes. The numeral "1" has three forms: (used in counting "one", "two", "three", etc.) (a shortened combining form) (used in larger numbers and with a distributive plural prefix)The combining form  is used in the compound  "11". The numeral  loses the final  consonant while the final vowel in  is shortened when the  "+10" suffix is added. The suffix loses its initial  becoming  when added to  "5". Several changes occur when the  suffix is added involving a loss of the final consonant or a reduction in vowel length:                  For the cardinal numerals higher than 20 between the multiples of 10 (i.e., 21-29, 31-39, 41-49, etc.), there are two types of formations. The numerals 21-29 and 41-49 are formed by suffixing the ones digit to the tens digit, as in  "22" (postpositionobject"nullpostposition"adverbial-thematiciterativepluraldirect objectdeicticadverbial-thematicmode-aspectsubjectclassifierstemAlthough prefixes are generally found in a specific position, some prefixes change order by the process of metathesis. For example, prefix 'ʼa-' (3i object pronoun) usually occurs before 'di-', as inadisbąąs "I'm starting to drive some kind of wheeled vehicle along" [ The Navajo 4th person may be superficially compared to some of the uses of the tu-vous distinction in French and other European languages.When used as an impersonal, it may be translated into English as "one" as in béésh bee njinéego hálaʼ da jiigish "one can cut one's hand playing with knives". The "space" prefix can be translated as "area, place, space, impersonal it" as in halgai "the area/place is white" and nahałtin "it is raining". The prefix has two forms: 'ha-' and 'ho-' with 'ho-' having derived forms such as 'hw-' and 'hwi-'.An example paradigm for "to freeze" (imperfective mode) showing the subject prefixes:Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)The "classifiers" are prefixes of position 9 (the closest to the verb stem) that affect the transitivity of the verb, in that they are valence and voice markers. In spite of their misnomered name, they do not classify anything and are not related to the classificatory verb stems (which actually do classify nouns, see classificatory verbs below). There are four classifiers: '-Ø-', '-ł-', '-d-', '-l-'. The '-Ø-' classifier is the absence of a prefix, which is usually indicated by a zero morpheme.The '-ł-' classifier is a causative-transitivizing prefix of active verbs. It often can transitivize an intransitive '-Ø-' verb: yibéézh "it's boiling" (yi-Ø-béézh), yiłbéézh "he's boiling it (yi-ł-béézh); naʼniyęęsh "somethings flows about in a meandering fashion" (naʼni-Ø-yęęsh), naʼniłhęęsh "he's making it flow about in a meandering fashion" (naʼni-ł-yęęsh).The '-d-' classifier occurs in most passive, mediopassive, reflexive, and reciprocal verbs that are derived from verbs with a '-Ø-' classifier: yizéés "he's singeing it" (yi-Ø-zéés), yidéés "it's being singed" (yi-d-zéés).The '-l-' occurs in most passive, mediopassive, reflexive, and reciprocal verbs that are derived from verbs with a '-ł-' classifier: néíłtsááh "he's drying it" (ná-yi-ł-tsááh), náltsááh it's being dried" (ná-l-tsááh).Some verbs can occur with all four classifier prefixes:siʼą́ "roundish object lies in position" ('-Ø-ʼą́')haatʼą́ "roundish object was taken up & out (i.e. extracted)" ('-d-ʼą́')séłʼą́ "I keep a roundish object in position" ('-ł-ʼą́')néshʼą́ "I have my head in position" ('-l-ʼą́')In other verbs, the classifiers do not mark transitivity and are considered thematic prefixes that simply are required to occur with certain verb stems.Mode and aspect Navajo has a large number of aspectual, modal, and tense distinctions that are indicated by verb stem alternations (involving vowel and tonal ablaut and suffixation) often in combination with a range of prefixes. These are divided into seven "modes" and approximately twelve aspects and ten subaspects. (Although the term mode is traditionally used, most of the distinctions provided by the modes are in fact aspectual.) Each Navajo verb generally can occur in a number of mode and aspect category combinations.ModesNavajo has the following verb modes:ImperfectivePerfectiveProgressiveFutureUsitativeIterativeOptativeThe modes above have five distinct verb stem forms. For example, the verb meaning "to play, tease" has the following five stem forms for the seven modes:ModeStem FormImperfective-néPerfective-neʼProgressive/Future-neełUsitative/Iterative-neehOptative-néThe progressive and future modes share the same stem form as do the usitative and iterative modes. The optative mode usually has the same verb stem as the imperfective mode, although for some verbs the stem forms differ (in the example "to play, tease" above, the imperfective and the optative stems are the same).The imperfective indicates an event/action that has begun but remains incomplete. Although this mode does not refer to tense, it is usually translated into English as a present tense form: yishááh "I'm (in the act of) going/coming", yishą́ "I'm (in the act of) eating (something)". With the additional of adverbials, the imperfective can be used for events/actions in the past, present, or future. The mode is used in the second person for immediate imperatives. The imperfective mode has a distinct imperfective stem form and four different mode-aspect prefix paradigms: (1) with a ni-''' terminative prefix in position 7 as in '''nishááh "I'm in the act of arriving", (2) with a si-''' stative prefix in position 7 as in '''shishʼaah "I'm in the act of placing a SRO" in dah shishʼaah "I'm in the act of placing a SRO up" (dah "up"), (3) with no prefix in position 7, usually identified as a Ø-''' prefix, as in '''yishcha "I'm crying", (4) with either a 'yi-' transitional or 'yi-' semelfactive prefix in position 6 (and no prefix in position 7).The perfective indicates an event/action that has been completed and usually corresponds to English past tense: yíyáʼ "I went/came/arrived", yíyą́ą́ʼ "I ate (something)". However, since the perfective mode is not a tense, it can be used to refer non-past actions, such as the future (where it may be translated as English "will have" + VERB). The perfective mode has a distinct perfective stem form and four different prefix paradigms: (1) with a yí-''' perfective prefix with a high tone in position 7 as in '''yíchʼid "I scratched it", (2) with a ní-''' terminative prefix with a high tone in position 7 as in '''níyá "I arrived", (3) with a sí-''' stative prefix with high tone in position 7 as in '''sélį́į́ʼ "I roasted it", (4) with a yi-''' transitional prefix in position 6 (and 'Ø-' in position 7) as in '''yiizįʼ "I stood up".The progressive indicates an incomplete event/action that is ongoing without reference to the beginning or end of the event/action. This mode may be translated into English as BE + VERB-ing + "along": yishááł "I'm going/walking along", yishtééł "I'm carrying it along". The future mode is primarily a future tense — indicating a prospective event/action: deeshááł "I'll go/come", deeshį́į́ł "I'll eat (something)". The progressive mode has a 'yi-' progressive prefix (in position 7), the future has a 'di-' inceptive prefix (in position 6) and the 'yi-' progressive prefix.The usitative indicates a repetitive event/action that takes place customarily: yishááh "I usually go", yishdlį́į́h "I always drink (something)". The iterative is a frequentative indicating a recurrent event/action that takes place repeatedly and customarily: chʼínáshdááh "repeatedly go out" as in ahbínígo tłʼóóʼgóó chʼínáshdááh "I always (repeatedly) go outdoors in the morning" (ahbínígo "in the morning", tłʼóóʼgóó "outdoors"), náshdlį́į́h "drink (something) repeatedly" as in nínádiishʼnahgo gohwééh náshdlį́į́h "I drink coffee when I get up" (nínádiishʼnahgo "when I get up", gohwééh "coffee"). The iterative is distinguished from the usitative by a 'ná-' repetitive prefix (in position 2) and also sometimes by a '-d-' or '-ł-' classifier prefix (in position 9).The optative indicates a positive or negative desire or wish. The mode is used with the addition of adverbial particles that follow the verb, such as laanaa and lágo: nahółtą́ą́ʼ laanaa "I wish it would rain", nahółtą́ą́ʼ lágo "I hope it doesn't rain". With punctual verbs, the optative mode can be used to form a negative imperative: shinóółʼį́į́ʼ (lágo) "don't look at me!". In certain adverbial frames, the optative indicates positive or negative potential.Aspects and subaspectsThe Primary aspects:Momentaneous - punctually (takes place point in time)Continuative - indefinite span of time & movement with specified directionDurative - indefinite span of time, non-locomotive uninterrupted continuumRepetitive - continuum of repeated acts or connected series of actsConclusive - like durative but in perfective terminates with static sequelSemelfactive - single act in repetitive series of actsDistributive - distributive manipulation of objects or performance of actionsDiversative - movement distributed among things (similar to distributive)Reversative - result in directional changeConative - attempted actionTransitional - shift from one state to anotherCursive - progression in a line through time/space (only progressive mode)The subaspects:Completive - event/action simply takes placeTerminative - stopping of actionStative - sequentially durative and staticInceptive - beginning of actionTerminal - inherently terminal actionProlongative - arrested beginning or ending of actionSeriative - interconnected series of successive separate & distinct actsInchoative - focus on beginning of non-locomotion actionReversionary - return to previous state/locationSemeliterative - single repetition of event/actionNavajo modes co-occur with various aspects. For example, the verb "rain falls" can occur in the perfective mode with the momentaneous and distributive aspects: '-tsąąʼ' (perfective momentaneous), '-tsįʼ' (perfective distributive). As with the modes, different aspects have different stem forms even when in the same mode, as seen with the previous "rain falls" perfective stems. Thus, a given verb will have set of stem forms that can be classified into both a mode and an aspect category. Verb stem paradigms of mode and aspect are given below for two different verbs:+ "to curl, shrivel, contract into distorted shape"ImperfectivePerfectiveProgressive-FutureUsitative-IterativeOptativeMomentaneous-chʼííł-chʼil-chʼił-chʼił-chʼííłTransitional-chʼííł-chʼiil-chʼił-chʼił-chʼííłContinuative,Conclusive-chʼil-chʼil-chʼił-chʼił-chʼilSemelfactive-chʼił-chʼił-chʼił-chʼił-chʼiłRepetitive-chʼił––––Conative-chʼiił-chʼil-chʼił-chʼił-chʼiił+ "to smell, have an odor, stink"ImperfectivePerfectiveProgressive-FutureUsitative-IterativeOptativeMomentaneous,Diversative,Distributive-chįįh-chą́ą́ʼ-chįįł-chįįh-chą́ą́ʼContinuative-chą́ą́ʼ-chą́ą́ʼ-chį́į́ł-chį́į́h-chą́ą́ʼConclusive-chin-chą́ą́ʼ-chį́į́ł-chįįh-chą́ą́ʼSemelfactive-chįh-chįh-chįh-chįh-chįhRepetitive-chą́ą́ʼ––––Conative-chį́į́h––––Cursive––-chį́į́ł/-chį́į́h––As can be seen above, some aspect and mode combinations do not occur depending mostly upon the semantics of the particular verb. Additionally, some aspects do not occur at all with a particular verb. The patterns of verb stem alternations are very complex although there is a significant amount of homophony. A particularly important investigation into this area of the Navajo verb is Hardy (1979).Classificatory VerbsNavajo has verb stems that classify a particular object by its shape or other physical characteristics in addition to describing the movement or state of the object. These are known in Athabaskan linguistics as classificatory verb stems. These are usually identified by an acronym label. There are eleven primary classificatory "handling" verbs stems, which are listed below (given in the perfective mode):Classifier+Stem&nbsp; Label &nbsp;ExplanationExamplesSROSolid Roundish Objectbottle, ball, boot, box, etc.LPBLoad, Pack, Burdenbackpack, bundle, sack, saddle, etc.-ł-joolNCMNon-Compact Matterbunch of hair or grass, cloud, fog, etc.-láSFOSlender Flexible Objectrope, mittens, socks, pile of fried onions, etc.SSOSlender Stiff Objectarrow, bracelet, skillet, saw, etc.-ł-tsoozFFOFlat Flexible Objectblanket, coat, sack of groceries, etc.-tłééʼMMMushy Matterice cream, mud, slumped-over drunken person, etc.-nilPLO1Plural Objects 1eggs, balls, animals, coins, etc.-jaaʼPLO2Plural Objects 2marbles, seeds, sugar, bugs, etc.OCOpen Containerglass of milk, spoonful of food, handful of flour, etc.ANOAnimate Objectmicrobe, person, corpse, doll, etc.To compare with English, Navajo has no single verb that corresponds to the English word give. In order to say the equivalent of Give me some hay!, the Navajo verb níłjool (NCM) must be used, while for Give me a cigarette! the verb nítįįh (SSO) must be used. The English verb give is expressed by eleven different verbs in Navajo, depending on the characteristics of the given object.In addition to defining the physical properties of the object, primary classificatory verb stems also can distinguish between the manner of movement of the object. The stems may then be grouped into three different categories:handlingpropellingfree flightHandling includes actions such as carrying, lowering, and taking. Propelling includes tossing, dropping, and throwing. Free flight includes falling, and flying through space.Using an example for the SRO category, Navajo has'-ʼą́' "to handle (a round object)",'-neʼ' "to throw (a round object)", and'-l-tsʼid' "(a round object) moves independently".yi-/bi- alternation (animacy)Like most Athabaskan languages, Southern Athabaskan languages show various levels of animacy in its grammar, with certain nouns taking specific verb forms according to their rank in this animacy hierarchy. For instance, Navajo nouns can be ranked by animacy on a continuum from most animate (a human or lightning) to least animate (an abstraction) (Young & Morgan 1987: 65-66):humans/lightning → infants/big animals → med-size animals → small animals → insects → natural forces → inanimate objects/plants → abstractionsGenerally, the most animate noun in a sentence must occur first while the noun with lesser animacy occurs second. If both nouns are equal in animacy, then either noun can occur in the first position. So, both example sentences (1) and (2) are correct. The ''yi-'' prefix on the verb indicates that the 1st noun is the subject and ''bi-'' indicates that the 2nd noun is the subject.   &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) &nbsp;  Ashkii   at'ééd   yiníł'į́.     &nbsp;   boy   girl   yi-look     &nbsp;   'The boy is looking at the girl.'      &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) &nbsp;  At'ééd   ashkii   biníł'į́.     &nbsp;   girl   boy   bi-look     &nbsp;   'The girl is being looked at by the boy.'   But example sentence (3) sounds wrong to most Navajo speakers because the less animate noun occurs before the more animate noun:   &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) &nbsp;  * Tsídii   at'ééd   yishtąsh.     &nbsp;   &nbsp; bird   girl   yi-pecked     &nbsp;   &nbsp; 'The bird pecked the girl.'   In order to express this idea, the more animate noun must occur first, as in sentence (4):   &nbsp; &nbsp; (4) &nbsp;  At'ééd   tsídii   bishtąsh.     &nbsp;   girl   bird   bi-pecked     &nbsp;   'The girl was pecked by the bird.'   Note that although sentence (4) is translated into English with a passive verb, in Navajo it is not passive. Passive verbs are formed by certain classifier prefixes (i.e., transitivity prefixes) that occur directly before the verb stem in position 9. The ''yi-/bi-'' prefixes do not mark sentences as active or passive, but as direct or inverse.Text exampleHere is the first paragraph of a very short story in Young & Morgan (1987: 205a–205b).Diné bizaad:Free English translation:Some crazy boys decided to make some wine to sell, so they each planted grapevines and, working hard on them, they raised them to maturity.
