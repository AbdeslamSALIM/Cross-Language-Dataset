Blackmore's Night is a Renaissance-inspired folk rock band led by Ritchie Blackmore (electric guitar and acoustic guitar) and Candice Night (lyricist and lead vocals).HistoryEarlyThe origins of the band lie in 1990 when Candice Night was working at a local New York rock music radio station. She first encountered Ritchie Blackmore, then with Deep Purple, at a football game in which he was playing. The two became romantically involved and discovered that they shared a passionate interest in the Renaissance.After leaving Deep Purple in 1993 and recording the album Stranger in Us All in 1995, on which Night contributed backing vocals and some of the lyrics, Blackmore became interested in the idea of bringing Renaissance music to a contemporary audience. Night's personality and singing ability made her the natural choice as "frontwoman." In 1997 the pair were ready to launch the band, the name being a pun of their own names, and which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.Shadow of the MoonTheir debut album Shadow of the Moon was an instant success, particularly in Europe. In subsequent albums, particularly Fires at Midnight, there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, whilst maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Candice Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent in a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.The group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance Festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including 'castle tours' of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The band has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: Renaissance Night and the Italian Morning Star.They have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game located internationally.2006-PresentIn 2006, Candice performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween's "Light The Universe", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album Keeper Of The Seven Keys - The Legacy, released in the same year.On June 27, the band released its newest album called Secret Voyage.DiscographyBand membersRitchie Blackmore - guitars, mandolin, domraCandice Night - vocals, horn, fluteBard David of Larchmont - keyboardsSquire Malcolm of Lumley (Malcolm Dick) - drumsGypsy Rose - ViolinEarl Grey of Chamay - Bass, mandolin and guitarFormer membersSisters of the Moon: Lady Madeline and Lady Nancy (Madeline and Nancy Posner) - backing vocalsLord Marnen of Wolfhurst (Marnen Laibow-Koser) - violin, flute, recorderChris Devine - violin, flute, guitarCarmine Giglio - keyboardsMike Sorrentino - percussionSir Robert of Normandie (Robert Curiano) - bass, guitarsTudor Rose (Tina Chancey) - violin, fluteMick Cervino - bassistMarci GellerAdam ForgioneAlex AlexanderJessie Haynes - guitars, recorder & backing vocals www.jessiehaynes.comLady Rraine (Lorraine Ferro) - harmony vocalsBaron St JamesNotesIn 1998 "Blackmore's Kingdom" album was released by unknown group of musicians, it contains both Blackmore's Night songs and songs by Steve Tilston. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;This album is most probably re-named from Celtic Secrets that is an album by guitarist Greg Joy. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;ReferencesExternal linksOfficial Dutch Fanclub SiteOfficial WebsiteThe Official Blackmore's Night UK Fanclub WebsiteBlackmore's Night Russian Fanclub ~ Candice Night Russian PagesForo en Castellano de Blackmore's NightMorning Star: Italian Blackmore's Night Tribute BandCategory:Rock music groups Category:Folk rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1997bg:Блекморс Найт ca:Blackmore's Night cs:Blackmore's Night de:Blackmore’s Night es:Blackmore's Night fr:Blackmore's Night ko:블랙모어스 나이트 it:Blackmore's Night nl:Blackmore's Night ja:ブラックモアズ・ナイト no:Blackmore's Night pl:Blackmore's Night pt:Blackmore's Night ru:Blackmore's Night fi:Blackmore's Night sv:Blackmore's Night tr:Blackmore's Night uk:Blackmore's Night
