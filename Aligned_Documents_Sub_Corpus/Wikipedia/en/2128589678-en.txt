They are singing the song "This is Me".]] The movie begins in the home of Connie (Maria Canals Barrera), Steve (Ed Jaunz) and Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato), an aspiring young musician who is hoping to become a professional singer (Who Will I Be). Mitchie wants to attend the prestigious and expensive Camp Rock, but her parents can't afford the camp. Mitchie's mother decides to take her catering business to Camp Rock, and so Mitchie can go if she helps out in the kitchen with her mother.When Mitchie arrives at camp, she becomes friends with Caitlyn Gellar (Alyson Stoner), Lola Scott (Aaryn Doyle), Barron James (Jordan Francis), and Sander Loyer(Roshon Fegan), and meets the Camp Rock diva, Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), the daughter of pop star T.J. Tyler (Jennifer Ricci), and her so called "best friends", Peggy Warburton (Jasmine Richards) and Ella Shang (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle).Meanwhile, spoiled brat/pop star Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) is dropped off at camp by his bandmates Jason (Kevin Jonas) and Nate (Nick Jonas). Because of his bad attitude and reputation, he is assigned to be in charge of dance classes for one month at Camp Rock. As the limo was driving away Nate tells Shane that they told the press they would be recording with the winner of Final Jam, a concert at the end of the month in which each member at Camp Rock compete against each other. Later that day he's chased by obsessive fans and hides in the bushes near the mess hall. He hears Mitchie singing one of her songs (This Is Me (Acoustic Version)), though she thinks she is alone. The song reminds Shane of the music that used to inspire him. He is determined to look for the girl singing, but in vain.At an open mic concert, Mitchie listens to Lola's performance of the song, (What It Takes) and then bumps into Tess. In a desperate attempt to fit in, Mitchie lies to Tess and says that her mother is the president of Hot Tunes TV China. Tess, Peggy, and Ella are impressed, and invite Mitchie into their cabin. The following morning, Mitchie sneaks out to go help at the kitchen to clean up when Shane arrives. Not wanting to be recognized, Mitchie covers her face in flour. Shane complains to her about not being able to go near his breakfast and says that his manager sent over his food allergy list. Mitchie is openly disappointed in his behavior, and she tells him to try and be nice. Shane ditches his dance class that day, but went the next day teaching hip hop to Start the Party. Later that night, Shane goes to the campfire and listens to Tess's song, ('Too Cool ').Shane and Mitchie see each other again at the lake where he's writing a song and gets mad when he's interrupted by Mitchie. She tells him it's different but she likes the song. Shane is openly happy with Mitchie after this. He writes a song about the girl he heard singing (Gotta Find You), which is really Mitchie, unbeknownst to him. Later, Caitlyn is sent to kitchen duty after a food fight with Tess. In the kitchen, Caitlyn finds out that the cook's daughter is Mitchie. She threatens to tell everyone, but decides not to when Mitchie stands up for her when she's in another fight with Tess. Caitlyn reveals to Mitchie that she used to be best friends with Tess, but Tess didn't like competition and felt that Caitlyn was.Shane begins to search for the girl with the voice, but he can't find her. Caitlyn mentioned Shane's search to Mitchie, but Mitchie doesn't believe it could be her, saying "he Shane's never heard me sing". Eventually, Tess finds out about Mitchie and Shane's relationship, and she also finds out about Mitchie's secret. She exposes Mitchie after a surprise concert from Connect 3 (Play My Music). This breaks Shane's heart, thinking that Mitchie was only friends with Shane Gray the celebrity and that she didn't mean any of the things she said. Everyone turns against Mitchie because they realized that she lied to everyone at that camp.Later, Tess overhears Brown talking to Shane and finds out that Shane's girl is Mitchie, so she tries to prevent Mitchie from singing at the Final Jam so that Shane can't hear Mitchie sing by placing her precious charm bracelet that her mother gave her, between some of Mitchie's books in the kitchen to make it look like she stole it. Her scheme works, and Caitlyn and Mitchie are banned from all camp activities until the end of Final Jam.Right before Final Jam, Tess, Peggy, and Ella rehearse their song. After messing up, Tess criticizes them and Peggy, having had enough, drops out of the group, followed by Ella, who are both re-entering as individuals. At Final Jam, Ella joins Barron and Sander as they perform their song, (Hasta La Vista). Seconds before starting her song, (2 Stars), Tess sees her mother there. She starts out singing her song confidently, but during the middle of her performance, Tess sees her mother talking on her cell phone instead of listening to her daughter's performance. Hurt, Tess drops out of the competition by nearly falling off the stage to get her mom's attention and runs off the stage crying.A last minute addition is performed by Margaret Dupree, or Peggy. After Peggy performs (Here I Am), Tess apologizes to her and Ella, also adding that she had no idea Peggy was so good. As the judges, Shane, Nate, and Jason, are judging, Mitchie performs her song, (This Is Me). Shane hears the song and realizes that Mitchie is the girl, and he sings part of (Gotta Find You) in collaboration with Mitchie's song.Peggy ends up winning Final Jam, and Tess apologizes to Mitchie and Caitlyn as well, admitting to having told Brown that her bracelet wasn't stolen after all. Finally, the whole cast sings one song together, We Rock and the film ends with the finishing part of the song with Mitchie and Shane glancing into each others eyes romantically.In the extended ending edition, which is included in the DVD, it shows that three months later, Caitlyn built a studio in her garage. She invites Mitchie, Tess, Peggy, Ella and Lola and they record one song together (Our Time Is Here).Cast[[Image:CampRockFinale.JPG|thumb|right|The cast of Camp Rock in the "Final Jam" in the movie, performing the song We Rock.]]Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) Mitchie, a 14-year-old who dreams of being a singer.
