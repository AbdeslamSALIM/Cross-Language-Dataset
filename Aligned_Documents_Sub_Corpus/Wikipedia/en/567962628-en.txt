It is a right tributary of the Inn and is 225&nbsp;kilometres (140&nbsp;mi) in length.The river's name is derived from the German word Salz, meaning "salt". Until the 19th century shipping of salt down the river was an important part of the local economy. The shipping ended when railways replaced the old transport system.It is the main river of the Austrian state of Salzburg. The source is located in the Kitzbühel Alps near Krimml, Salzburg. From here it runs eastwards till Schwarzach im Pongau, then turns northwards and passes the cities of Hallein and Salzburg. Then it forms the border between Bavaria, Germany and Austria for almost 70&nbsp;kilometres (43&nbsp;mi). Cities on the banks in this last section include Laufen, Tittmoning and Burghausen. All these towns have border crossings. The river finally joins the Inn near Braunau.Category:Rivers of Bavaria Category:Rivers of Austria Category:Salzburgbar:Soizoch ca:Salzach cs:Salzach da:Salzach de:Salzach et:Salzach es:Salzach eo:Salzach fr:Salzach it:Salzach he:זלצך la:Salzaha lv:Zalcaha lt:Zalcachas hu:Salzach nl:Salzach nn:Salzach pl:Salzach ro:Salzach ru:Зальцах (река) sv:Salzach tr:Salzach
