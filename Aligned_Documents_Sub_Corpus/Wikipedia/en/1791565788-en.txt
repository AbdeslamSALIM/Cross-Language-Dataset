After signing with Atlantic Records it was discovered that "Mighty Joe Young" was already taken so they changed their name to Shirley Temple's Pussy.

In 1992, they released their first album, Core, and their first hit, "Sex Type Thing" led to them becoming one of the most influential bands of the grunge movement, the music genre that was spawned out of Seattle in the late eighties and became rock and roll's central movement in the early-mid 1990s. The band was widely accused of imitating bands such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Nirvana in an attempt to cash in on the scene's burgeoning popularity. Critics also pointed out that Weiland's vocal style at the time was very similar to that of Layne Staley's and Eddie Vedder's. Weiland has rejected such comparisons, however, he cites Jim Morrison Mundy, Chris &quot;Q&amp;A with Scott Wylan "Rolling Stone". February 10, 1994. and David Bowie as more influential on his vocal techniques and sound. Despite negative reviews from critics, Core was extremely successful, eventually being certified 8x platinum by the RIAA.In 1994, Weiland and STP released their second record, Purple, which saw the development of a more distinctive identity for the band. While still a clear continuation of their previous techniques, the album featured a more "classic rock" sound, and had a mixture of punk, bossa nova, and acoustic songs. Like Core, Purple was a big success for the band, spawning three hit singles and selling over 6 million copies. The year prior, STP toured with the Butthole Surfers and Weiland developed a heroin addiction, claiming Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes introduced him to heroin, which Gibby denies.

Although Tiny Music... was certified 2x platinum, the canceled tour caused the album to fall quickly off the charts.''12 Bar Blues'' (1998)With Weiland's status in the band uncertain and unpredictable, STP went on hiatus. The other members of the band created the group Talk Show with lead singer Dave Coutts. Weiland, meanwhile, adopted an androgynous look and released a solo album in 1998 called 12 Bar Blues. Weiland wrote most of the songs on the album, and collaborated with several artists, notably Daniel Lanois, Sheryl Crow, Brad Mehldau and Jeff Nolan. The album was a commercial failure but it managed to achieve some critical acclaim. It was also during this time that Weiland was caught in Manhattan buying heroin, dressed like a pimp, ending his brief tour. A previous conviction in Los Angeles, coupled with numerous probation violations, earned Weiland jail time.Back with STP (1999-2003)His period in jail had apparently helped to wean him from his habit, and once released, he rejoined Stone Temple Pilots. In 1999, the band released No. 4. The album contained the hit single "Sour Girl" which featured a strange, surreal music video with Sarah Michelle Gellar. That same year, Weiland also recorded two songs with the short-lived supergroup The Wondergirls.In November 2000, Weiland was invited to perform on the show [[VH1 Storytellers|VH1 Storytellers]] with the surviving members of The Doors.

However, the charges were eventually deferred upon the couple agreeing to counseling. Soon after, Forsberg filed for divorce but the couple eventually reconciled. Weiland's career also took a hit, with an altercation between Weiland and Dean DeLeo on the final gig of STP's Shangri-La Dee Da tour, leading to the band's official demise with much of the speculation surrounding Weiland's inability to balance personal issues.Velvet Revolver (2003-2008) After the breakup of STP, Weiland was arrested on his birthday on October 27 2003 in Hollywood, California after a traffic collision. He was charged with driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol. His charges were eventually dismissed after he successfully completed rehab and subsequent drug tests.Around this time, Weiland was asked by former Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan to lead a band with Duff and the former GNR members Slash and Matt Sorum, as well as Dave Kushner. The band used the working title "The Project", and Weiland later named the group "Black Velvet Revolver", eventually shortening the name to "Velvet Revolver."Velvet Revolver's debut album Contraband was released in June 2004 to much success. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and has sold over three million copies world-wide to date. Two of the album's songs, "Slither" and "Fall to Pieces", reached number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song "Slither" also won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal in 2005, an award Weiland had won previously with STP for the song "Plush" in 1994. That same year, Weiland appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly and performed a new solo song, "The Man I Didn't Know", a country-style ballad that deals with his relationship with his father.In 2006, Weiland launched his own record label, Softdrive Records.

Weiland also re-recorded the STP outtake "Learning to Drive", for the 2007 horror film Bug.
