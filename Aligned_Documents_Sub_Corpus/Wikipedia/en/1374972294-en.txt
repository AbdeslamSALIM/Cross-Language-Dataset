Heralded as a major comeback upon its release, the project is notable for the patching up of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards' relationship, a reversion to a more classic style of music and the launching of the band's biggest world tour at the time. It is also founding bassist Bill Wyman's final studio album with The Rolling Stones, preceding the announcement of his departure in January 1993.HistoryFollowing the release of 1986's Dirty Work, and Jagger's active pursuit of a solo career, relations between him and the Stones-committed Richards worsened considerably. While Jagger released the tepidly-received Primitive Cool in 1987, Richards recorded Talk is Cheap, his solo debut, which would be released in 1988 to rave reviews. The couple of years largely apart appeared to have healed the wounds sufficiently that they could begin contemplating resurrecting their partnership - and their band.Meeting in January 1989, just preceding The Rolling Stones' induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the chemistry between Jagger and Richards easily outshone whatever differences they had and after composing some fifty songs in a matter of weeks, Ronnie Wood, Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts were called in to begin recording what would become Steel Wheels, beckoning Undercover co-producer Chris Kimsey to perform the same role.Recording in Montserrat and London during the spring months, Steel Wheels was designed to emulate a classic Rolling Stones sound, one that forsook the uncharacteristic production and weak songwriting that - most felt - had marred much of Dirty Work and returned them squarely in the context of a guitar-centered rock group. The only real diversion would prove to be "Continental Drift", an Eastern-flavored piece, with the Master Musicians Of Jajouka, that was as much an appreciation of world music as it was a tribute to Brian Jones who had recorded with the same troupe back in 1967. With much of the past disagreements behind them, sessions for Steel Wheels went fairly harmoniously.The massive, worldwide Steel Wheels Tour was launched in late August 1989, concurrently with Steel Wheels' arrival and the release of lead single "Mixed Emotions", a partially-biographical reference to Jagger and Richards' recent woes that proved to be The Rolling Stones' last major hit single in the US, reaching #5. (listeners have noted that the song's title could be read as "Mick's Demotion" in reference to Richards' increasing role within the band.) Critical reaction was warm, with Steel Wheels reaching #2 in the UK and #3 in the US where it went double-platinum. Follow-up singles were "Rock And A Hard Place", "Almost Hear You Sigh" and "Terrifying". The mammoth Steel Wheels Tour - which finished in mid-1990 after being re-titled the Urban Jungle Tour - was an enormous financial success, cementing The Rolling Stones' return to full power. In 1990 Fox aired a 3-D television special of the Steel Wheels tour. Unlike anaglyphic 3-D which requires the familiar red & green glasses, the method used was the Pulfrich Effect which permitted full color video. The film was shot by Gerald Marks of PullTime 3-D in NYC. An IMAX film of the tour was released the next year, which still still plays sporatically at IMAX venues around the world.The album was the Rolling Stones' first digital recording. In 1994, Steel Wheels was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records.Track listingAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted."Sad Sad Sad" – 3:35"Mixed Emotions" – 4:39"Terrifying" – 4:53"Hold On To Your Hat" – 3:32"Hearts For Sale" – 4:40"Blinded By Love" – 4:37"Rock and a Hard Place" – 5:25"Can't Be Seen" – 4:10"Almost Hear You Sigh" (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards/Steve Jordan) – 4:37"Continental Drift" – 5:14"Break The Spell" – 3:07"Slipping Away" – 4:30PersonnelMick Jagger - Vocals, Backing Vocals, Electric Guitar, Acoustic Guitar, HarmonicaKeith Richards - Electric Guitar, Backing Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, Vocals, Classical GuitarCharlie Watts - DrumsRonnie Wood - Electric Guitar, Bass, Backing Vocals, Acoustic Guitar, DobroBill Wyman - BassChuck Leavell - Organ, Piano, KeyboardsMatt Clifford - Keyboards, Piano, Electric Piano, Clavinet, HarmoniumLisa Fischer - Backing VocalsBernard Fowler - Backing VocalsSarah Dash - Backing VocalsPhil Beer - Mandolin, FiddleLuis Jardim - PercussionRoddy Lorimer - TrumpetSonia Morgan - Backing VocalsTessa Niles - Backing VocalsThe Kick Horns - BrassMaster Musicians of Jajouka with Bachir Attar Farafina - African-Moroccan InstrumentsChartsAlbumYearChartPosition1989UK Top 75 Albums21989The Billboard 2003SinglesYearSingleChartPosition1989"Mixed Emotions"The Billboard Hot 10051989"Mixed Emotions"Mainstream Rock Tracks11989"Mixed Emotions"Modern Rock Tracks221989"Mixed Emotions"UK Top 100 Singles361989"Sad Sad Sad"Mainstream Rock Tracks141989"Terrifying"Mainstream Rock Tracks81989"Rock And A Hard Place"Mainstream Rock Tracks11989"Rock And A Hard Place"The Billboard Hot 100231989"Rock And A Hard Place"UK Top 100 Singles631990"Almost Hear You Sigh"Mainstream Rock Tracks11990"Almost Hear You Sigh"The Billboard Hot 100501990"Almost Hear You Sigh"UK Top 100 Singles311990"Terrifying"UK Top 100 Singles82Category:The Rolling Stones albums Category:1989 albums Category:Rolling Stones Records albums Category:Virgin Records albums Category:Albums produced by Chris Kimsey Category:Albums produced by The Glimmer Twinsda:Steel Wheels de:Steel Wheels es:Steel Wheels fr:Steel Wheels it:Steel Wheels ka:Steel Wheels nl:Steel Wheels ja:スティール・ホイールズ no:Steel Wheels pl:Steel Wheels fi:Steel Wheels sv:Steel Wheels
