Located in Yeşilköy, on the European side of the city, it is 15 km (9 mi) southwest of the city centre. The airport is named in honor of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and the first president of the Republic of Turkey. With estimated passenger traffic of 26 million for the year 2008, it is projected to be among the top 40 airports in the world in terms of total passenger traffic.TerminalsThere are three terminals, one international (Terminal A), one domestic (Terminal B) and one cargo terminal (Terminal C). Inaugurated in 2001, the international terminal is an efficient and modern terminal. After the new terminal opened, domestic flights have been moved to the old international terminal. Despite its 70's design, this new domestic terminal can handle more passengers than the more modern but smaller previous domestic terminal. Additionally, Terminal C was the so called "Hajj Terminal", dedicated only to flights to Mecca during the Hajj season to avoid overload in Terminal A. Because the new international terminal can handle more passengers now, these pilgrimage flights are moved to Terminal A, and Terminal C has been converted to a cargo terminal.The airport terminals have been operated by TAV (Tepe-Akfen-Ventures) since January 2000. TAV has invested US$600 million since 1998. In 2005 TAV won the concession agreement to operate Atatürk for 15.5 years at a record breaking amount of $3 billion, which also represents the highest figure for such a privatization project in Turkey, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Commonwealth of Independent States and North Africa. TrafficAtatürk Airport still faces capacity issues; it ranks somewhere between thirty-fifth and fortieth in the world by both cargo and passenger traffic handling over 730,000 tonnes of load (cargo+freight+mail) and over 25 million passengers in the year 2007. Given that the total passenger traffic doubled in five years (domestic traffic almost quadrupled!) in parallel with the booming Turkish economy and tourism, the city needs another airport in the metropolitan area in the next 3-5 years. Its rated capacity of 14 million international passengers per year and 10 million domestic passengers per year was barely sufficient for the demand in 2007. The Istanbul greater metropolitan area is expected to have a demand of 25 million international passengers and 25 million domestic passengers annually by the year 2015. However, introduction of high speed trains between Ankara and Istanbul in 2008, and completion of the construction of the intercity highways linking Istanbul to other cities (to Bursa, İzmir, Antalya and the Black Sea Speedway) may help decrease this demand.Atatürk shares traffic with Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, which is on the Anatolian (Asian) side of Istanbul, which had annual passenger traffic of just 3.7 million in 2007. The two airports both provide domestic and international service to the Istanbul area, but booming passenger demands (as well as the physical impossibility of expanding Atatürk Airport) suggest that a 4th airport will be required by 2007, as the Hezarfen Airport is not big enough to support international flights. This new airport is planned to be located north of Istanbul in Kemerburgaz which is close to the Levent business district.Below is the passenger data for Istanbul for the years 2002-2007:İstatistiklerStatistics(The 'total' column below exclude the number of transit passengers. For the year 2007, 2,706,614 transit passengers used Turkish airports, and about 70% of this number is through Istanbul Atatürk Airport.
