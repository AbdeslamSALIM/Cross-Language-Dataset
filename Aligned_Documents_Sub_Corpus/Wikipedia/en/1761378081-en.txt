 Lüneburg is a district in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the southeast and clockwise) the districts of Lüchow-Dannenberg, Uelzen, Soltau-Fallingbostel and Harburg, and the states of Schleswig-Holstein (District of Lauenburg) and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (District of Ludwigslust).HistoryThe history of the region has ever been influenced by the City of Lüneburg; see there for more details.The district was established after the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866.In 1993 the municipality of Amt Neuhaus joined Lower Saxony and the District of Lüneburg. This region had always been ruled by Lüneburg before the division of Germany made it a part of East Germany after 1945. It is hence one of the very few municipalities of the former East Germany that are now part of a West German state.GeographyThe district is characterised by the Lüneburg Heath (Lüneburger Heide) in the south and the riverside woodlands along the Elbe. Though most of the district is located south of the river, there is a small portion around the municipality of Amt Neuhaus on the opposite side.Coat of armsCoat of armsThe coat of arms displays:Towns and municipalitiesTownsSamtgemeinden1seat of the SamtgemeindeExternal linksOfficial Website Official Website Directory with links related to Lüneburg  Category:Districts of Lower Saxonyde:Landkreis Lüneburg es:Distrito de Lüneburg eo:Distrikto Lüneburg fr:Arrondissement de Lunebourg id:Lüneburg (distrik) nl:Lüneburg (district) pl:Powiat Lüneburg pt:Lüneburg (distrito) ro:Lüneburg (district) ru:Люнебург (район) sv:Landkreis Lüneburg zh:吕讷堡县
