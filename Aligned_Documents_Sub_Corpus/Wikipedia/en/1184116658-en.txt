Olav was born in the United Kingdom as the son of Prince Carl of Denmark and Princess Maud of the United Kingdom and given the names Alexander Edward Christian Frederik. He became Crown Prince and only heir to the throne of Norway when his father was elected King in 1905. He was the first heir to the throne of Norway to be brought up in Norway since King Olav IV of Norway and his parents made sure he was given as Norwegian an upbringing as possible. In preparation for his royal duties he attended both civilian and military schools. In 1929, he married Princess Märtha of Sweden. During World War II his leadership was much appreciated and he was appointed Norwegian Chief of Defence in 1944. Succeeding to the Throne in 1957 he enjoyed a very high level of popularity and respect throughout his reign in which he was able to balance regality and approachability. Upon his death in 1991 the Norwegian public displayed a great demonstration of mourning. At his death, his was the last surviving grandchild of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.Birth and early lifeBorn in Appleton House, Sandringham House, Sandringham, Norfolk, United Kingdom to Prince Carl of Denmark and Princess Maud, (daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), he was given the names and title of Alexander Edward Christian Frederik, Prince of Denmark. He was given the name Olav when his father became King Haakon VII of Norway in 1905.Olav was the first heir to the throne since medieval times to grow up in Norway. He graduated from the Norwegian Military Academy in 1924, and went on to study jurisprudence and economics at Balliol College, Oxford.He was an accomplished athlete. Olav jumped from the Holmenkollen ski jump in Oslo, and also competed in sailing regattas. He won a gold medal in sailing at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam and remained an active sailor into old age.On 21 March 1929 in Oslo, he married his first cousin Princess Märtha of Sweden with whom he had one son, Harald, and two daughters, Ragnhild and Astrid. As exiles during World War II, Crown Princess Märtha and the royal children lived in Washington, D.C., where she struck up a close friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt. She died in 1954, before her husband ascended the throne.World War IIAs crown prince he had received extensive military training and had participated in most major Norwegian military exercises. Because of this he was perhaps one of the most routined Norwegian military leaders. He was respected by other allied leaders for his knowledge and leadership skills. During his visit to the United States before the war he and his wife had founded a close relationship with President Roosevelt. These factors would prove to be important for the Norwegian fight against the attacking German forces.During World War II Olav stood by his father's side in resisting the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. During the campaign he was a valuable advisor both to civilian and military leaders. When the government decided to go into exile he offered to stay behind with the Norwegian people, but this was declined. He followed his father to the United Kingdom where he continued to be a key advisor to the government in exile and his father.During the war he made numerous trips to Norwegian and Allied troops both in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. He was appointed to the post of Norwegian Chief of Defence in 1944 and led the Norwegian disarmament of German occupying forces after the war. His war decorations from different nations such as the War Crosses of Norway, France, Greece and the Netherlands, the US Legion of Merit and the French Médaille Militaire are testament to the international recognition his contribution to the war against Hitler received.ReignSucceeding to the Norwegian Throne in 1957 (upon the death of Haakon VII), Olav reigned as a "People's King", and became extremely popular. He liked to drive his own cars and would drive in the regular highway lanes though he was allowed to drive in the public transportation lane. During the 1973 energy crisis Norway banned car-driving on certain weekends, but the King, not wishing to miss an opportunity to go skiing outside Oslo, took the tram. When he tried to pay for his tickets, the conductor told him that people further back had already paid for him.Article from NRK on the king Featuring a photo of the event and explanatory text . Retrieved 24 November 2006 A journalist once asked him if he was afraid to walk around unprotected, he answered, "Why should I be afraid? I have 4 million bodyguards!"—referring to the Norwegian people.For his athletic ability and role as King, King Olav V earned the Holmenkollen medal in 1968. He had a strong interest in military matters and took his role as titular Commander-in-Chief very seriously. As well as his ceremonial roles in the Norwegian Army, he also served as Colonel-in-Chief of the Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Yorkshire Regiment), the British regiment named for his grandmother Queen Alexandra.The King represented Norway extensively abroad during his reign conducting state visits to both neighbouring countries and more distant destinations such as Ethiopia.King Olav V opened the 14th World Scout Jamboree in July 1975 in the presence of 17,259 Scouts from 94 countries.During the summer of 1990, the King suffered from health problems, but recovered somewhat during Christmas the same year. An interview given by King Harald V, and hints in a biography by the retired politician Jo Benkow, mentions the possibility that King Olav suffered a great trauma during the outbreak of the first Gulf War 17 January 1991. He collapsed during the day and died in the evening. His son claimed that Olav relived the events of the Second World War, which he himself had experienced (the Nazi occupation of Norway), and really believed that the transmitted messages from the new war foreboded World War III. This, he could not bear.The night after he died (at the Royal Lodge Kongsseteren in Oslo). For several days up until the state funeral, Norway saw a great demonstration of mourning as Norwegians lit hundreds of thousands of candles in the courtyard outside the Royal Castle in Oslo, with letters and cards placed amongst them. The National Archives have preserved all these cards.Olav's son Harald V succeeded him as King.Gallery Image:Kong Haakon ankommer Norge 1905.jpg|Crown Prince Olav arrives in Norway in 1905 on his father's arm and is greeted by Prime Minister Christian Michelsen Image:Kronprins olav 1906 av a bloch.jpg|Drawing, 1906, by Andreas Bloch Image:Kongebjorka.jpeg|Crown Prince Olav and his father King Haakon VII takes shelter under some trees as the German Luftwaffe bombs Molde Image:Martha and Olav 1950.jpg|Märtha and Olav in 1950  HonoursOrders and medals War Cross with sword Medal for Outstanding Civic Achievement in gold Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Norwegian Order of St Olav (later Grand Master) Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit (Grand Master) St Olav's medal Coronation Medal of 1906 War Medal Haakon VII's 70th Anniversary Medal Haakon VII's Jubilee Medal 1905 – 1955 Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of San Martin Grand Cross of the Decoration of Honour for Merit, Norway]] Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of the Rose Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of La Merito Knight of the Elephant Grand Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog King Christian X's Freedom Medal Commemorative medal for King Christian IX's 100th birthday Commemorative medal for King Frederik VIII's 100th birthday Grand Cross of the Order of Solomon Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose Grand Cross of the Légion d'honneur Croix de guerre Médaille Militaire Grand Cross 1. class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Knight of the Garter Knight of the Thistle Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Royal Victorian Chain (Commonwealth Realms) Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (Commonwealth Realms) King George V Silver Jubilee Medal King George VI Coronation Medal Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal Grand Cross of the Order of the Saviour Grand Cross of the Order of St. George og St. Constantine War Cross 1940 Grand Cross of the Order of the Tadj Grand Cross of the Order of the Falcon Grand Cross of the Order of the Chrysanthemum Grand Cross of the Order of the Gold Lion Grand Cross of the Order of the Aztec Eagle Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion Grand Cross of the Order of the House of Orange War Cross Medaille d'Installation Solennelle 1948 Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun Grand Cross of the Order of St. Bento d'Aviz 1st class of the Order of the Star Grand Cross of the Ernestine Order (Saxony, Germany) Collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece Grand Cross Collar of the Order of Charles III Knight of the Seraphim King Gustaf V's 70th Anniversary Medal King Gustaf V's 90th Anniversary Medal Grand Cross of the Most Illustrious Order of the Royal House of Chakri Grand Cross of the Order of Independence Legion of Merit Grand Cross of the Order of the Great StarRoyal House of Norway web page on King Olav V's decorations (Norwegian) Retrieved 5 October 2007Other honours A 180 000 km² area (Prince Olav Coast) and the Prince Olav Mountains in Antarctica are named in his honour.
