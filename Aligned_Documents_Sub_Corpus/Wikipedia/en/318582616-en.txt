At least in speeches, he had opposed free trade and reached out to regional Latin American countries with left-leaning governments.Resignation as presidentNicanor Duarte announced his resignation as president Nicanor renunciara mañana from Diario ABC Color., in order to assume a position as Senator on 1 July, 2008. He presented his resignation on 23 June, 2008 to the President of the Congress of Paraguay Nicanor entrega hoy su renuncia al cargo from Diario ABC Color., Senator Miguel Abdón Saguier.Opposition and officialist members of the Paraguayan Congress immediately announced they are going to boycott Duarte's resignation by not attending the extraordinary session of the Congress, a session called in order to debate and determine whether the President's resignation is accepted or not. If Congress does not accept the resignation (or if the necessary quorum is not achieved), Duarte will have to continue his term until 15 August and will be unable to become an elected senator, becoming a non-voting senator for life instead as a former president.Paraguay's president resigns - People's Daily Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; As expected, the quorum was not reached at the extraordinary session called for this reason for 24 June 2008.Paraguayan Congress lacks quorum to vote on president's resignation : America World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Paraguayan Congress Rejects Duarte&quot;s Resignation - Prensa Latina&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;In 26 June, Congress was again called to session, at 16:00 hours (local time), however, by midday, it had been canceled again by request from officialist Colorado deputies to the Senate president, Miguel Abdon Saguier, who immediately agreed to cancel it. The decision of the Deputies was taken due to their fear of not achieving the quorum for the session again Colorados desisten de intentar que el Congreso trate la renuncia de Nicanor from Diario ABC Color..SenateSince Duarte Frutos could not occupy the seat belonging to him in 1 July, Jorge Cespedes, from the Colorado Party, was assigned and assumed as titular of the vacant seat of Duarte at the Senate. While some held positions in favour of Duarte assuming as senator, due to the sentence from the Superior Electoral Justice Tribunal, other MP's argued that Duarte's assumption as senator would illegal, and Congress president would be violating Constitution if swearing-in Duarte Frutos without the legal quorum Sin quorum, haran jurar a Nicanor from Diario ABC Color..In 26 August, an extraordinary session of Congress was called, but as expected, many MP's left the session called for that day, which was declared "empty" or abandoned by Paraguayan Congress President Enrique Gonzalez Quintana (UNACE). Nonetheless, Gonzalez Quintana proceeded to the swearing-in oath required by law, and former President Duarte Frutos, who arrived at the Legislative Palace followed by Colorado Party fellow supporters, was sworn in as senator Nicanor juro como Senador from Diario ABC Color..However, in 4 September, the Paraguayan Senate, in session to discuss resolutions on the crisis concerning Duarte Frutos tenure as senator, approved finally a bill, but with some modifications, revalidating a previous bill that had not been approved the previous session of 28 August. On the session of the 28th, Jorge Cespedes was confirmed as titular Senator, instead of Duarte Frutos, who was in turn confirmed as senador vitalicio, or senator for life, handing its seat upon Cespedes Cespedes es titular, Nicanor vitalicio from Diario ABC Color..References         Category:Presidents of Paraguay Category:1956 births Category:Living peoplear:نيكادور دوارتي فروتوس ca:Nicanor Duarte Frutos da:Nicanor Duarte Frutos de:Nicanor Duarte Frutos et:Nicanor Duarte Frutos el:Νικάνορ Ντουάρτε Φρούτος es:Nicanor Duarte Frutos fr:Nicanor Duarte Frutos gv:Nicanor Duarte Frutos gl:Nicanor Duarte Frutos ko:니카노르 두아르테 io:Nicanor Duarte Frutos id:Nicanor Duarte Frutos it:Nicanor Duarte Frutos he:ניקנור דוארטה פרוטוס lt:Nicanor Duarte Frutos mr:निकानोर दुआर्ते फ्रुतोस nl:Nicanor Duarte ja:ニカノル・ドゥアルテ no:Nicanor Duarte Frutos oc:Nicanor Duarte Frutos pl:Nicanor Duarte Frutos pt:Nicanor Duarte ru:Дуарте Фрутос, Оскар Никанор fi:Nicanor Duarte Frutos sv:Nicanor Duarte Frutos uk:Ніканор Дуарте zh:尼卡诺尔·杜阿尔特·弗鲁托斯
