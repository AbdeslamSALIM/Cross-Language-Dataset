  A rite of passage is a ritual that marks a change in a person's social or sexual status. Rites of passage are often ceremonies surrounding events such as childbirth, menarche or other milestones within puberty, coming of age, marriage, weddings, and death. Initiation ceremonies such as baptism, confirmation and bar or bat mitzvahs are considered important rites of passage. In the last centuries Western society has seen a steady decline in the usage of rites of passage. History of termTheories were developed in the 1960s by Mary Douglas and Victor Turner (The Ritual Process, 1969). Joseph Campbell's 1949 text, The Hero with a Thousand Faces and his theory of the journey of the hero were also influenced by Arnold van Gennep.According to van Gennep, rites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation. In the first phase, people withdraw from the group and begin moving from one place or status to another. In the third phase, they reenter society, having completed the rite. The liminal phase is the period between states, during which people have left one place or state but haven't yet entered or joined the next. Types and examplesRites of passage are diverse, and are often not recognized as such in the culture in which they occur. Many society rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. Adventure Education programs, such as Outward Bound, have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase (Cushing, 1998). Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the "Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage" as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.Several organizations, such as Boys to Men Mentoring Network and Rite of Passage Journeys in Bothell, Washington, provide nature based initiatory experiences that do include the incorporation phase. At the end of Rite of Passage Journeys' Coming-of-Age trips, parents arrive to work with their children for the final weekend of the experience, so that changes that occurred on the trip can be supported when the youth returns to his or her home environment.Some other examples of rites of passages in contemporary society are given in the following subsections.Coming of age rites of passageAdolescent circumcisionAustralian Schoolies WeekBar MitzvahBreechingDebutante ballDokimasiaFirst haircutGempuku among the samuraiGraduationObtaining a Driver's LicensePoy Sang LongPromQuinceañeraRuss in NorwayScarification and various other physical endurancesSevapuneru or Turmeric ceremony in South India to mark menarcheIn various tribal societies, entry into an age grade – generally gender-separated – (unlike an age set) is marked by an initiation rite, which may be the crowning of a long and complex preparation, sometimes in retreat.underwent the Jewish circumcision, here depicted on a Catholic cathedral; a liturgical feast commemorates this on New Year's Day]]Religious initiation ritesBaptismFirst Eucharist and First Confession (especially First Communion in Catholicism)ConfirmationBar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah in JudaismCircumcision, mainly in Judaism (Bris) and IslamSaṃskāra a series of Sacraments in Hinduism.Shinbyu in Theravada BuddhismRumspringa among the AmishVision quest in some Native American cultures"Quinceañera" many who celebrate include a Catholic massOther initiation ritesSecular coming of age ceremonies for non-religious youngsters who want a rite of passage comparable to the religious rituals like ConfirmationWalkaboutBatizados in Capoeira.Armed forces ritesAccoladeBaptism by fireBattlefield commission, equivalent to ennoblement for valor or knighting on the field in the ancien régimeBerserker, berserkergang - an initiatory Nordic warrior-rite; the young Scandinavian warrior of old or Viking had to symbolically transform into a bear or wolf before he could become an elite warrior (cf.

The army was historically perceived as the "natural" way to go and as a final 'school' of socialization and maturing for young men before their comeout to the real world; also it would be the first time a young man would find himself on his own and away from home.
