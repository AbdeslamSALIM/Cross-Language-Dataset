Premier Soccer League is the trading name of the National Soccer League (NSL) of South Africa, also known by its initials (PSL). The top league is the ABSA Premier League, sponsored by ABSA. The next highest league is the National First Division, which is divided into two regional streams.  The current CEO of the PSL is Norwegian Kjetil Siem who succeeded Englishman Trevor Phillips after the 06/07 season. The PSL's headquarters are located in Parktown, Johannesburg. HistoryThe PSL was founded by Kaizer Motaung, Irvin Khoza, Raymond Hack and Jomo Sono, in 1996.  Manning Rangers were the first to be crowned champions of the PSL in 1997 when the Gordon Igesund-coached side was stunning all and sundry by winning the title ahead of a number of more fancied opponents.  From 1998 to 2000 the league was dominated by Sundowns, who pulled off a hat-trick of titles.In 2001, Igesund moved to Orlando Pirates and helped the Buccaneers secure the title. The following season he moved to Cape Town-based Santos, and steered it to win the league title, thus becoming the first coach to win the championship with three different clubs.The 11 April 2001 marked a dark chapter in South African history when 43 people lost their lives and 158 others were injured in a stampede during a match between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs at an overcrowded Ellis Park Stadium.The league was reduced from 18 to 16 teams after the end of the 2001/2002 season to avoid fixture congestion, causing two teams, Ria Stars and Free State Stars, to be disbanded.In 2004, a match-fixing scandal rocked South African soccer. An investigation codenamed "Operation Dribble" was launched by the South African police in June 2004. More than 40 arrests were made, ranging from club bosses to match commissioners, referees and their assistants.Kaizer Chiefs successfully defended their league title in 2005 after they won the prestigious trophy in 2004 for the first time in a decade.The 2005/2006 season saw Mamelodi Sundowns capturing the title for the fourth time.The PSL has helped raise the standard of club soccer in South Africa, providing the sport with better media coverage and much-improved revenue through strong sponsorship deals. Sponsors include renowned brands like SABC, SAA, Vodacom, Telkom and Coca-Cola. It has also provided a platform for local players to make their mark and catch the eye of overseas clubs.In February 2007, the much-awaited launch of a Reserve League pilot project took place. The football fraternity, including newly-appointed Bafana Bafana coach Carlos Alberto Parreira had been calling for a Reserve league to strengthen domestic structures ahead of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.Norwegian Kjetil Siem will be the league's new CEO after Trevor Phillips announced his retirement from the post after numerous years.SponsorshipSince its inception in 1996, the Premier Soccer League been sponsored.
