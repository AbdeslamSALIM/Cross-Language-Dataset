  Erlangen is a Middle Franconian city in Bavaria, Germany. It is located at the confluence of the river Regnitz and its large tributary, the Untere Schwabach. Erlangen has more than 100,000 inhabitants.Erlangen is today dominated by the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and the numerous branch offices of Siemens AG, as well as a large Institute of the Fraunhofer Society. An event that still influences the city was the settlement of Huguenots after the withdrawal of the Edict of Nantes in 1685.HistoryErlangen was first mentioned officially in 1002 under the name of "villa erlangon". In 1361, the village was sold to Emperor Karl IV. Three years later, a city was built close to the village, which in 1374 got its own coining station (mint). In 1398, the municipal rights were confirmed. In 1402, the city was vested to the House of Hohenzollern as part of the principality of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (from 1603 on Brandenburg-Bayreuth), staying under their rule until 1806. During the four year Napoleonic occupation, Erlangen was the capital of the so-called "Low County" (Unterland) of the principality, encompassing the area until Neustadt an der Aisch and separated from the "High County" (Oberland) by a land corridor. In 1810 it became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, together with the rest of former Brandenburg-Bayreuth.While being part of the Brandenburg-Bayreuth, the first French Huguenot refugees arrived in Erlangen in 1686. Christian Ernst, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, built a "new town" (Neustadt) for them. In 1706, the old town (just below the site of the annual Bergkirchweih) was almost completely destroyed by a fire, but soon rebuilt. In 1812, the old and new towns were merged into one.In 1742, Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, founded a university for the residency town Bayreuth, but due to the rebelliousness of the local students, the university was transferred to Erlangen. Only later did it obtain the name of "Friedrich-Alexander-University" and become a Prussian state university. Famous students of these times were Johann Ludwig Tieck and Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder.Already during the Bavarian municipal reform of 1818, the city was endowed with its own administration. In 1862, the canton administration Erlangen was founded, from which later arose the administrative district of Erlangen. In 1972, this district was merged with the administrative district of Höchstadt. Erlangen became the capital of this newly founded district Erlangen-Höchstadt. During this municipal reform, Erlangen was effectively enlarged considerably, so that by 1974, it had more than 100,000 inhabitants.UniversityThe University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität, http://www.uni-erlangen.org) was founded in 1742 by Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, in the city of Bayreuth, but was relocated to Erlangen the next year. Today, it features 11 departments (German "Fakultäten"), 2 of which (Economics and Education) are located in Nuremberg. About 24,000 students study at this university, of which about 20,000 are located in Erlangen.BergkirchweihThe Bergkirchweih is an annual beer festival, similar to the Oktoberfest in Munich but smaller in scope, and therefore more intimate. It takes place during the twelve days before and after Pentecost, under the spring trees of the "Berg" and draws more than one million visitors each year.It is commonly known by local residents as the "Berchkärwa" (pronounced "bairch'-care-va") or simply the "Berch", as in "Gehma auf'm Berch?" ("Let's go to the mountain?").DistrictsAm AngerAlterlangenBruck, pop. 20,000BüchenbachBurgbergDechsendorfEltersdorf, pop. around 3,200FrauenaurachHäuslingHüttendorfInnenstadtKosbachKriegenbrunnNeussesRöthelheimSchallershofSiedlung SonnenblickSieglitzhof/Buckenhofer SiedlungSteudachTennenlohe http://www.fen-net.de/er/stadtteile/tennenlohe/tennenlohe.htmHistorical populationYearPopulation1495292163055017527,93918309,800December 1, 1871¹12,500December 1 1890¹17,559December 1, 1900¹22,953December 1 1910¹24,877June 16 1925¹29,597June 16 1933¹32,348May 17 1939¹35,964September 13 1950¹50,690June 16 1961¹69,552May 27 1970¹84,110June 20 1975100,700June 30 1980100,900June 30 1985100,000May 27 1987¹99,808June 30, 1997100,700December 31 1997100,330December 31 1998100,775December 31 1999100,750December 31 2000100,778December 31 2001101,912December 31 2002102,198December 31 2003102,449December 31 2004102,627December 31 2005103,426Historical mayors of Erlangen1818 - 1827: Johann Sigmund Lindner1828 - 1855: Johann Wolfgang Ferdinand Lammers1855 - 1865: Carl Wolfgang Knoch1866 - 1872: Heinrich August Papellier1872 - 1877: Johann Edmund Reichold1878 - 1880: Friedrich Scharf1881 - 1892: Georg Ritter von Schuh1892 - 1929: Theodor Klippel1929 - 1934: Hans Flierl1934 - 1944: Alfred Groß (NSDAP)1944 - 1945: Herbert Ohly (NSDAP)1945 - 1946: Anton Hammerbacher (SPD)1946 - 1959: Michael Poeschke (SPD)1959 - 1972: Heinrich Lades (CSU)1972 - 1996: Dietmar Hahlweg (SPD)1996 - : Siegfried Balleis (CSU)International relationsSister citiesErlangen is twinned with several cities: Eskilstuna, Sweden, since 1961.
