The first record of the area is as Helsinge in 1351 when king Magnus II of Sweden granted salmon fishing rights on the river Vantaa to the Estonian Padise monastery. The municipality was formerly known as Helsingin maalaiskunta "Rural municipality of Helsinki". The rapids of river Vantaa were known as Helsingfors, from which the current Swedish name of Helsinki derives. In 1972, the municipality was renamed Vantaa and promoted to a market town (i.e. Vantaan kauppala), and in 1974, finally renamed Vantaan kaupunki "City of Vantaa".On October 11, 2002, the city was shocked by the explosion of a bomb in the local Myyrmanni shopping centre, killing 7, including the bomber, a 19-year-old chemistry student from the Espoo-Vantaa Institute of Technology (see Myyrmanni bombing).Demographics+ Demographic evolutionYearPopulation18054 84018656 97418807 81918908 865190011 110191018 321192022 368193023 558194031 511195014 976196041 906197072 2151980129 9181990152 2632000176 3862007190 058PoliticsMunicipal council+ Composition of the City Council (2005–2008)PartyElection resultsParty results&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;SeatsSocial Democratic Party of Finland30,1&nbsp;%21National Coalition Party]]26,6&nbsp;%19Green League13,8&nbsp;%9Left Alliance]]9,4&nbsp;%6Center Party]]7,7&nbsp;%6Christian Democrats]]4,5&nbsp;%3Swedish People's Party3,8&nbsp;%3Pro Vantaa1,4&nbsp;%1Sister citiesAskim, Norway (1951)Frankfurt an der Oder, Germany (1987)Huddinge, Sweden (1951)Jinan, China (2001)Kineshma, Russia (1969)Lyngby-Taarbæk, Denmark (1951)Matte Yehuda Regional Council, Israel (1967)Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic (1978)Nuuk, Greenland (1965)District of Rastatt, Germany (1968)Salgótarján, Hungary (1976)Seyðisfjörður, Iceland (1980)Słupsk, Poland (1987)Mayors of the City of VantaaLauri Lairala 1974-1989Pirjo Ala-Kapee 1989-1997Erkki Rantala 1997-2003Juhani Paajanen 2003See alsoDistricts of VantaaPeople from VantaaReferencesExternal linksMunicipality Official siteMap of VantaaThe Finnish Science CenterHelsinki-Vantaa International AirportVantaa City MuseumHelsinki.fi - Helsinki region in a nutshell Category:Cities and towns in Finland Category:Municipalities of Uusimaa Region *bg:Вантаа ca:Vantaa cs:Vantaa de:Vantaa et:Vantaa el:Βάνταα es:Vantaa eo:Vantaa fr:Vantaa id:Vantaa it:Vantaa is:Vantaa he:ונטה ka:ვანტაა la:Vantania lv:Vantā nl:Vantaa ja:ヴァンター no:Vanda pl:Vantaa pt:Vantaa ro:Vantaa qu:Vantaa ru:Вантаа se:Vantaa simple:Vantaa sk:Vantaa sr:Ванта fi:Vantaa sv:Vanda tr:Vantaa vo:Vantaa zh:万塔
