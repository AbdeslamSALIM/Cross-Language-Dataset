 Rutherfordium () is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Rf and atomic number 104.  This is a radioactive synthetic element whose most stable known isotope is 267Rf with a half-life of approximately 1.3 hours. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4 (see below).Official discoveryElement 104 was reportedly first detected in 1966 at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna (U.S.S.R.). Researchers there bombarded 242Pu with accelerated 22Ne ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl4. The team identified a spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties. Although a half-life was not accurately determined, later calculations indicated that the product was most likely 259Rf:&quot;DISCOVERY OF THE TRANSFERMIUM ELEMENTS&quot;, IUPAC/IUPAP Technial Report, Pure & Appl.

In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact which the Russian team do not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. &quot;Responses on the Report DISCOVERY OF THE TRANSFERMIUM ELEMENTS&quot;, Pure & Appl.

Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name kurchatovium (, Ku, in honor of Igor Vasilevich Kurchatov (1903-1960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed rutherfordium (Rf) for the new element to honor Ernest Rutherford, who is known as the "father" of nuclear physics. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted unnilquadium (pronounced  or , Unq, as a temporary, systematic element name, derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name dubnium to be used since rutherfordium was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be rightly recognised for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104-107. However in 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name rutherfordium.Electronic structureRutherfordium is element 104 in the Periodic Table. The two forms of the projected electronic structure are:Bohr model: 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 10, 2Quantum mechanical model: 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d10 4p65s24d105p66s24f145d10 6p67s25f146d2Extrapolated chemical properties of eka-hafnium/dvi-zirconiumOxidation statesElement 104 is projected to be the first member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group IV in the Periodic Table, below titanium, zirconium and hafnium. The IV oxidation state is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also portray a stable +4 state.ChemistryIn an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable, high melting point oxide, RfO2. It should also react with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyse on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides should be volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapour phase. In the aqueous phase, the Rf4+ ion should hydrolyse less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent to zirconium and hafnium, thus leading to the rutherfordyl oxyion, RfO22+. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ion should form the hexahalide complexes RfCl62- and RfBr62-. For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes RfF62-, RfF73- and RfF84- are possible.Experimental chemistryGas phase chemistryEarly work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore from a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule:As series of experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4 forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl4) and bromide (RfBr4) as well as an oxychloride (RfOCl2). http://lch.web.psi.ch/pdf/TexasA&amp;M/TexasA&amp;M.pdf (Gas Chem 2007 Review)Aqueous phase chemistryRutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration Rf5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the Periodic Table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions. The most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the Japanese tean at JAERI using the radioisotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium and thorium have proved a non-actinide behaviour. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, in a manner similar to hafnium and zirconium. http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jnrs/paper/JN62/jn6202.pdf (Rf aqueous chem JAERI)\,^\mathrm + 6\mathrm^\, \to\ \,^\mathrm_^Very similar results were observed in hydrofluoric acid solutions.

The first study produced evidence for a 0.3 s spontaneous fission (SF) activity tentatively assigned to 260104 or 259104 and an unidentified 8 s SF activity. The former activity was later retracted and the latter activity associated with the now-known 259104. In 1966, in their discovery experiment, the team repeated the reaction using a chemical study of volatile chloride products. The group was able to identify a volatile chloride decaying by short spontaneous fission with eka-hafnium properties. This gave strong evidence for the formation of 104Cl4 and the team suggested the name kurchatovium. Although a half-life was not accurately measured, later evidence suggested that the product was most likely 259104.  In 1968, the team searched for alpha decay from 260104 but were unable to detect such activity. In 1970, the team repeated the reaction once again and confirmed the ~0.2 s SF activity. They also repeated the chemistry experiment and obtained identical results to their 1966 experiment and calculated a likely half-life of ~0.5 seconds for the SF activity. In 1971, the reaction was repeated again and 0.1 s and 4.5 s SF activities were found. The 4.5 s activity was correctly assigned to 259104. A chemistry experiment in the same year reaffirmed the formation of a 0.3 SF activity for an eka-hafnium product. Later, the 0.1-0.3 s SF activity was retracted as belonging to a kurchatovium isotope but the observation of eka-hafnium reactivity remained and was the basis of their successful claim to discovery. The reaction was further studied in 2000 by Yuri Lazarev at Dubna.

Several studies have indicated that this nuclide decays primarily by spontaneous fission with a long half-life of 10-20 minutes. Alpha particles with energy 7.8-7.9 MeV have also been associated with this nucleus. More recently, a study of hassium isotopes allowed the synthesis of an atom of 263Rf decaying by spontaneous fission with a short half-life of 8 seconds. These two different decay modes must be associated with two isomeric states. Specific assignments are difficult due to the low number of observed events. It is reasonable to tentatively assign the long life to a meta-stable state, namely 263mRf, and the shorter life to the ground state, namely 263gRf. Further studies are required to allow a definite assignment.&lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;RfEarly research on the synthesis of rutherfordium isotopes utilised the 244Pu(22Ne,5n)261Rf reaction. The product was found to undergo exclusive 8.28 MeV alpha decay with a half-life of 78 seconds. Later studies by the GSI team on the synthesis of element 112 and hassium isotopes produced conflicting data. In this case, 261Rf was found to undergo 8.52 MeV alpha decay with a short half-life of 4 seconds. Later results indicated a predominant fission branch. These contradictions led to some doubt on the discovery of element 112. However, it is now understood that the first nucleus belongs to an isomeric meta-stable state, namely 261mRf and the latter to the ground state isomer, namely 261gRf. &quot;EVIDENCE FOR ISOMERIC STATES IN &lt;sup&gt;261&lt;/sup&gt;Rf&quot;, Dressler et al., PSI Annual Report 2001. Retrieved on 2008-01-29 The discovery and confirmation of 261gRf provided proof for the discovery of ununbium in 1996.&lt;sup&gt;257&lt;/sup&gt;RfA detailed spectroscopic study of the production of 257Rf nuclei using the reaction 208Pb(50Ti,n)257Rf allowed the identification of an isomeric level in 257Rf. The work confirmed that 257gRf has a very complicated spectrum with as many as 15 alpha lines. A level structure diagram was calculated for both isomers.Spectroscopic decay level schemes for rutherfordium isotopes===257Rf=== ===255Rf=== Unconfirmed isotopes&lt;sup&gt;268&lt;/sup&gt;RfIn the synthesis of ununpentium, the isotope 288115 has been observed to decay to 268Db which undergoes spontaneous fission with a half life of 29 hours. Given that the electron capture of 268Db cannot be detected, these SF events may in fact be due to the SF of 268Rf, in which case the half-life of this isotope cannot be extracted. &lt;sup&gt;266&lt;/sup&gt;RfIn the synthesis of ununtrium, the isotope 282113 has been observed to decay to 266Db which undergoes spontaneous fission with a half life of 22 minutes. Given that the electron capture of 266Db cannot be detected, these SF events may in fact be due to the SF of 266Rf, in which case the half-life of this isotope cannot be extracted. Retracted isotopes&lt;sup&gt;265&lt;/sup&gt;RfIn 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they has succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293118. These parent nuclei successively emitted seven alpha particles to form 265Rf nuclei. Their claim was retracted in 2001. As such, this rutherfordium isotope is unconfirmed or unknown.see ununoctium&lt;sup&gt;255m&lt;/sup&gt;RfA detailed spectroscopic study of the production of 255Rf nuclei using the reaction 206Pb(50Ti,n)255Rf allowed the tentative identification of an isomeric level in 255Rf. A more detailed study later confirmed that this was not the case.Chemical yields of isotopesCold fusionThe table below provides cross-sections and excitation energies for cold fusion reactions producing rutherfordium isotopes directly.
