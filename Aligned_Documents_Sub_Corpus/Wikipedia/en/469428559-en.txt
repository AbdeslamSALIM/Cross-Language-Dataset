 Syndicalism is a type of movement which aims to degrade capitalist societies through action by the working class on the industrial front. For syndicalists, labor unions are the potential means both of overcoming capitalism and of running society in the interests of the majority. Industry and government in a syndicalist society would be run by labour union federations.IntroductionThis emphasis on industrial organization was a distinguishing feature of syndicalism when it began to be identified as a distinct current at the beginning of the 20th century. Most socialist organisations of that period emphasised the importance of political action through party organizations as a means of bringing about socialism. Although all syndicalists emphasize industrial organization, not all reject political action altogether. For example, De Leonists and some other Industrial Unionists advocate parallel organisation both politically and industrially.Syndicalisme is a French word meaning "trade unionism". This milder version of syndicalism was overshadowed by revolutionary anarcho-syndicalism in the early 20th century, which was most powerful in Spain, but also appeared in other parts of the world, as in the US-centered Industrial Workers of the World.In a model syndicalist community, the local syndicate communicates with other syndicates through the Bourse de Travail (labour exchange), which manages and transfers commodities.Syndicalism is one of the three most common ideologies of egalitarian, pre-managed economic and labour structure, together with socialism and communism. It states, on an ethical basis, that all participants in an organized trade internally share equal ownership of its production and therefore deserve equal earnings and benefits within that trade, regardless of position or duty. By contrast, socialism emphasises distributing output among trades as required by each trade, not necessarily considering how trades organize internally. Syndicalism is compatible with privatism, unlike communism. Communism rejects government-sanctioned private ownership and private earnings in favor of making all property legally public, and therefore directly and solely managed by the people themselves. In Syndicalism, unions are the basis for the future society rather than simply means of attaining that society.Syndicalists often form alliances with other workers' movements, including socialism, communism, and anarchism.Prominent syndicalistsFrench syndicalistsFernand Pelloutier leader of the French Bourses du Travail (Labour Exchange)Emile Pouget Co-leader of the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT, founded in 1895)Hubert Lagardelle writerSee also Charter of Amiens (1906)Scottish syndicalistsJohn Maclean, political activist and writerWelsh syndicalistsSam Mainwaring, orator & originator of the term 'anarcho-syndicalist'German syndicalistsRudolf RockerItalian syndicalistsAlceste de AmbrisMichele BianchiEnrico LeoneArturo LabriolaAgostino LanzilloRobert Michels - Although he was German, he moved to Italy and became a revolutionary syndicalist.Angelo Oliviero OlivettiSergio PanunzioSpanish syndicalistsFrancisco AscasoBuenaventura DurrutiÁngel PestañaAmerican syndicalistsBill HaywoodDaniel De LeonRalph ChaplinNoam ChomskySam DolgoffSwedish syndicalistsJoe HillSee alsoInternational Workers AssociationAnarchismDemocratic socialismDe LeonismInternational Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam (1907)Trade unionismCouncil communismIndustrial Workers of the World (IWW, the "Wobblies")Anarcho-syndicalismExternal linksAnarchoSyndicalism.netRudolf Rocker, a major proponent of anarcho-syndicalismLibertarian Communist Library ArchiveGeneral Strikes, maps with locations where strikes have occurred; includes resource linksBibliographyAnarcho-Syndicalism, Rudolf Rocker, London, 1989.Liberalism and The Challenge of Fascism, Social Forces in England and France (1815-1870), J.
