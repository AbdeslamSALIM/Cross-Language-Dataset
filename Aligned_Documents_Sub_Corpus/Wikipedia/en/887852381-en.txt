Callas is a small rural town in the Var (83) department, in the region of Provence in southeastern France. On a hill top very close to some of France's best wine growers' vineyards this ancient town looms over the valley below. It's a 45 minute drive from more famous coastal resort towns such as Frejus and Saint Raphael and is only 75 minutes by car away from Nice.Category:Communes of Varceb:Callas de:Callas (Var) es:Callas fr:Callas (Var) it:Callas nl:Callas pl:Callas (Francja) sr:Callas vo:Callas (Var)
