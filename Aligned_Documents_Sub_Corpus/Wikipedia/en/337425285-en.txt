Along with Max Steiner, Miklós Rózsa and Franz Waxman, Tiomkin was one of the most productive and decorated film music writers of Hollywood.BiographyTiomkin was born in Kremenchug, Ukraine, and educated at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in Russia, where he studied piano with Felix Blumenfeld and harmony and counterpoint with Alexander Glazunov. In 1920, while working for the Petrograd Military District Political Administration (PUR), he was one of the lead organizers of two revolutionary mass spectacles, the "Mystery of Liberated Labor," a pseudo-religious mystery play for the May Day festivities, and "The Storming of the Winter Palace" for the celebrations of the third anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution.James Von Geldern, Bolshevik Festivals (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1993), 157, Katerina Clark, Petersburg, Crucible of Revolution (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1995), 135-36In 1924 Tiomkin left the USSRKaterina Clark, Petersburg, Crucible of Revolution, ISBN Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1995, p. 184 and moved to Berlin, where his father was practising as a doctor, and had lessons with Ferruccio Busoni. He emigrated to the United States in 1925, moved to Hollywood in 1930 with his wife, dancer Albertina Rasch (1895-1967), and became an American citizen in 1937.Although influenced by Eastern European music traditions, he was able to score typical American movies like Frank Capra's famous Lost Horizon (1937) or It's a Wonderful Life (1946) and also Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), both with James Stewart. He also worked on Fred Zinnemann's High Noon (1952), which also won him a "Best Song" Oscar for “Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'” (“The Ballad of High Noon”). This song, years later, was recorded by the brazilian rock band Legião Urbana in a disc. He won the Academy Award for best scoring of the John Wayne film The High and the Mighty (1954); during the telecast ceremonies in 1955, Tiomkin humorously thanked all of the earlier composers who had influenced him in writing this music.Tiomkin scored four films for Alfred Hitchcock: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Strangers on a Train (1951), I Confess (1952) and Dial M for Murder (1954).Many classic scores followed, many of which were Western movies, like Giant (1956), Friendly Persuasion (1956), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), Rio Bravo (1959), The Alamo (1960), The Guns of Navarone (1961), Town Without Pity (1961), 55 Days at Peking (1963), The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964), and The War Wagon (1967).Besides cinema he was also active in writing for the small screen, writing some memorable television theme-songs, as for Rawhide (1959) and Gunslinger. He was also hired to write the theme for TV's The Wild Wild West (1965), but the producers rejected his themes and hired Richard Markowitz. A cover version of the theme from Rawhide was performed in the 1980 cult musical film The Blues Brothers.Dimitri Tiomkin died in London, England in 1979 and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.LegacyA number of Tiomkin's film scores were released on LP soundtrack albums, including Giant and The Alamo. Some of the recordings, which usually featured Tiomkin conducting his own music, have been reissued on CD.In 1976, RCA Victor released Lost Horizon: The Classic Film Scores of Dimitri Tiomkin (US catalogue #ARL1-1669, UK catalogue #GL 43445) with Charles Gerhardt and the National Philharmonic Orchestra. Featuring highlights from various Tiomkin scores, the album was later reissued by RCA on CD with Dolby Surround Sound.Awards and nominationsAcademy Awards, USA1972 - nominated for "Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song" Score for Chaikovsky (1969)1965 - nominated for "Best Music, Score - Substantially Original" for: The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964)1964 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" and "Best Music, Score - Substantially Original" for 55 Days at Peking (1963)1962 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" for Town Without Pity (1961) AND for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for The Guns of Navarone (1961)1961 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" and for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for The Alamo (1960)1961 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" for The Young Land (1959)1959 - won an Oscar for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for The Old Man and the Sea (1958)1958 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" for Wild Is the Wind (1957)1957 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" for Friendly Persuasion, "Best Scoring of a Dramatic Picture" for "Giant" (1956)1955 - nominated for "Best Music, Original Song" for The High and the Mighty (1954) and won an Oscar for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for the same movie1953 - won (with Ned Washington) an Oscar for "Best Music, Original Song" for High Noon (1952) for "Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin'", sung by Tex Ritter1953 - won an Oscar for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for High Noon (1952)1950 - nominated for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for Champion (1949)1945 - nominated for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1944)1944 - nominated for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for The Moon and Sixpence (1943)1943 - nominated for "Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture" for The Corsican Brothers (1941)1940 - nominated for "Best Music, Scoring" for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)Golden Globes1965 for "Best Original Score" for The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964)1962 for "Best Motion Picture Score" for The Guns of Navarone (1961) AND for "Best Motion Picture Song" for Town Without Pity (1961)1961 for "Best Original Score" for The Alamo (1960)1957 he received the "Special Award" as "Recognition for film music"1955 he received the "Special Award" "For creative musical contribution to Motion Picture"1953 for "Best Motion Picture Score" for High Noon (1952)ReferencesExternal linksOfficial siteUnofficial Tiomkin siteFind-A-Grave for Dimitri TiomkinDimitri TiomkinTiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitri Tiomkin, Dimitriar:ديميتري توامكين de:Dimitri Tiomkin es:Dimitri Tiomkin fr:Dimitri Tiomkin hr:Dimitri Tiomkin it:Dimitri Tiomkin nl:Dmitri Tjomkin ja:ディミトリ・ティオムキン pl:Dymitr Tiomkin pt:Dimitri Tiomkin ru:Тёмкин, Дмитрий Зиновьевич fi:Dmitri Tjomkin uk:Тьомкін Дмитро
