 Lacrimas Profundere is a gothic metal band from Germany. Their name means "to shed tears" in Latin. Their stylistic aesthetic has evolved over time, originally a death doom rooted gothic metal band, they have progressively changed their style to a more mainstream gothic style with the late albums.BiographyLacrimas Profundere was founded in 1993 by guitarist Oliver Schmid. At the time, the band was influenced by doom metal, and also made use of feminine vocals and classical elements. With the entrance of vocalist Anja Hötzendorfer, they drew enough attention to themselves to be able to record their debut, entitled ... and the Wings Embraced Us, which was released in 1995 and was followed by La Naissance d’un Rêve (French for "Birth of a Dream"), from 1997.After the said releases, the band was granted a deal with Napalm Records which included five albums. A harpist was added to the band's line-up and they proceeded to record Memorandum (1999).Burning: A Wish from 2001 was Lacrimas Profundere's first album to receive attention from the international specialized press. This album featured the removal of the band's classical elements to some degree, and was also the first time they employed baritone vocals, supplied by Oliver's brother, Christopher Schmid. Their first international tour then began, including countries of Europe and Latin America.Lacrimas Profundere's subsequent albums were Fall, I Will Follow from 2002 and Ave End from 2004.Filthy Notes For Frozen Hearts received considerable attention from Jackass star Bam Margera and the songs My Velvet Little Darkness, Short Glance, Should and Sweet Caroline along with a vocal excerpt from Sad Theme For a Marriage were played on his show Bam's Unholy Union.In April 2007, Christopher Schmid, the band's founding member and vocalist left the band; citing prolonged stress from touring. It did not take long to find a new vocalist: Peter Kafka, who also sings for the Deutsch band sonicslave. A Few months later basist Daniel Lechner left the band and vocalist Peter Kafka became the new basist and Rob Vitacca employed as the new vocalist. Long time keyboardist Christian Steiner also left the band but supplied some parts for the new album. The new album called "Songs For The Last View" is their latest album out in the summer of 2008.They received a good response as the sole support act for Apocalyptica on their European tour in late 2007.Line-upRob Vitacca - VocalsPeter Kafka - Bass, Backing VocalsOliver Nikolas Schmid - GuitarsTony Berger - GuitarsKorl Fuhrmann - DrumsFormer membersGuitars:Marco PraschbergerChristian FreitsmiedlManuel Ehrlich (Seraph (Ger))Bass:Markus LapperRico Galvagno (ex-Darkseed)Daniel LechnerDrums:Willi Wurm (ex-Darkseed)Christian GreisbergerStefan EireinerLorenz GehmacherOther:Christopher Schmid - VocalsChristian Steiner - KeyboardsAnja Hötzendorfer - Violin, Backing VocalsUrsula Schmidhammer - HarpEva Stöger - Flute, KeyboardsFalse MembersTony CheirichettiRyan ShortDiscography... and the Wings Embraced Us (1995)La Naissance D'Un Rêve (1997)The Crown of Leaving (EP, 1997)The Embrace and the Eclipse (EP, 1998)Memorandum (1999)Burning: A Wish (2001)Fall, I Will Follow (2002)Ave End (2004)Again It's Over (EP, 2006)Filthy Notes for Frozen Hearts (2006)Songs for the Last View (2008)A Pearl (Single, 2008)Videos"Ave End" (2004)"Amber Girl" (2004)"Again It's Over" (2006)"My Velvet Little Darkness" (2006)"A Pearl" (2008)External linksOfficial websiteLacrimas Profundere at Napalm RecordsLacrimas Profundere at MySpaceVideos&quot;Ave End&quot; (2004) at Napalm Records (WMV)&quot;Amber Girl&quot; (2004) at Napalm Records (WMV)&quot;Again It's Over&quot; (2006) at Napalm Records (WMV)&quot;My Velvet Little Darkness&quot; (2006) at Napalm Records (WMV)Category:German heavy metal musical groups Category:Gothic metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1993de:Lacrimas Profundere es:Lacrimas Profundere fr:Lacrimas Profundere it:Lacrimas Profundere nl:Lacrimas Profundere pl:Lacrimas Profundere pt:Lacrimas Profundere fi:Lacrimas Profundere tr:Lacrimas Profundere
