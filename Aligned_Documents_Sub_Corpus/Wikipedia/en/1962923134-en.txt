Fiumana played in the First Division (Prima divisione), which was the second level of the Italian Football Championship, and reached the National Division (Divisione Nazionale), the first level of Italian football in 1928. After 1929, it competed in Serie B in the 1929-1930 and 1941-1942 seasons. The club was renamed Kvarner in 1946, due to Rijeka (Fiume at the time) passing from Italy to Yugoslavia. During its early period in Yugoslavia, the club had moderate success in various Yugoslav and local club championships. It changed its name to "Rijeka" on June 3, 1954, and advanced to the Yugoslav First League in the 1957/58 season. It remained in the top tier until the 1969/70 season, when it was demoted to the Second League. It topped that league many times but it was until 1973/74 when it would return to the First League, where it would remain until the breakup of Yugoslavia.Rijeka won the Yugoslav Cup in 1978 and 1979, was a runner-up in 1987, won the Croatian Cup in 2005 and in 2006, and participated several times in various UEFA championships. Although it has never advanced to the final stages of the competition, Rijeka has topped and shocked some of the biggest clubs in the history of soccer on its home field during the 1980s, including Real Madrid and Juventus.Rijeka has been playing in the Prva HNL since the independence of Croatia in 1991, generally finishing near the top. Notably it finished second in 1999 and 2006 and third in 2004. Due to many format changes of the league, Rijeka has played more games in the competition than any other team. In the 2004/2005 season, its player Tomislav Erceg was the top scorer of the Prva HNL with 17 goals.Colours and badgeNK Rijeka colours are white and sky-blue.StadiumNK Rijeka plays their home matches on Kantrida Stadium, or just simply Kantrida, it can hold 11,000 spectators.SupportersThe fans are known as Armada Rijeka.Current squadAs of August 31, 2008                            Noted playersJosip SkoblarMladen MladenovićDubravko PavličićMauro RavnićDanijel ŠarićDavor VugrinecDamir DesnicaElvis BrajkovićNenad GračanSaša PeršonMario TokićBoško BalabanBarnabas StipanovicsJanko JankovićMatjaž FlorjančičAdrijan FegicFredi BobicDumitru MituDragan ŽilićElvir BolićIgor BudanDario Knežević Rodolfo VolkNoted ManagersNenad GračanElvis ScoriaZlatko DalićHonours3 times best club from Croatia in Yugoslav First Division (1965, 1984, 1987)7 times second best club from Croatia in Yugoslav First DivisionRecordsExternal linksNK Rijeka official websiteArmada Rijeka official websiteHNK Rijeka fansite     Category:Croatian football clubs Category:Yugoslav football clubs Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1946 Category:Italian football (soccer) First Division clubs Category:Serie B clubs Category:Rijeka Category:NK Rijeka Category:Former Italian football clubsbs:HNK Rijeka ca:HNK Rijeka de:HNK Rijeka el:Φ.Κ.
