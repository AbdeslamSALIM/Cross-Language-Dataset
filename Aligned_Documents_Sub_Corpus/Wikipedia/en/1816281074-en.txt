Franklin also served as governor of Tasmania for several years. In his last expedition, he disappeared while attempting to chart and navigate a section of the Northwest Passage in the Canadian Arctic. The entire crew perished from starvation, hypothermia, tuberculosis and exposure before and after Franklin died and the expedition's icebound ships were abandoned in desperation.Early lifeFranklin was born in Spilsby, Lincolnshire, in 1786 and educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth. John Franklin was the ninth of 12 children. One of his sisters was the mother of Emily Tennyson. Franklin's father initially opposed his son's interest in a career at sea. However, Franklin was determined and his father reluctantly allowed him to go on a trial voyage with a merchant ship. This hardened young Franklin's resolve, so at the age of 14 his father secured him a Royal Navy appointment on [[HMS Polyphemus (1782)|HMS Polyphemus]]. Franklin was later present at a number of historic voyages and naval battles. These included the Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, an expedition to explore the coast of Australia on [[HMS Investigator (1798)|HMS Investigator]] with his uncle, Captain Matthew Flinders, a return to the Napoleonic Wars, serving aboard [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS Bellerophon]] at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, and he was at the Battle of New Orleans.1818: First Arctic expeditionJohn Franklin first travelled to the Arctic in 1818 because of a command from David Buchan and became fascinated by it. He led a disastrous overland expedition into the Northwest Territories of Canada along the Coppermine River in 1819&ndash;22, losing 11 of the 20&nbsp;men in his party. Most died of starvation, but there was also at least one murder and suggestions of cannibalism. The survivors were forced to eat lichen and even attempted to eat their own leather boots. This gained Franklin the nickname of "the man who ate his boots" in America.1823: Marriage and second Arctic expeditionIn 1823, after returning to England, Franklin married the poet Eleanor Anne Porden. Their daughter, Eleanor Isabella, was born the following year. Eleanor (senior) died of tuberculosis in 1825, shortly after persuading her husband not to let her ill-health prevent him from setting off on another expedition to the Arctic. This expedition, a trip down the Mackenzie River to explore the shores of the Beaufort Sea, was better supplied and more successful than his last.In 1828, he was knighted by George IV and in the same year married Jane Griffin, a friend of his first wife and a seasoned traveler who proved indomitable in the course of their life together.1836: Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania)Franklin was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land in 1836, but was removed from office in 1843. He did not endear himself with the local civil servants, who particularly disliked his humane ideals and his attempts to reform the Tasmanian penal colony. His wife, Lady Jane, was quite liberated for a woman of her day, known for "roughing it" to the extent that an expedition had to be mounted after she and Franklin became lost in the wild. Such exploits further distanced the couple from "proper" society, and may have contributed to Franklin's recall. Nevertheless, he was popular among the people of Tasmania. He is remembered by a significant landmark in the centre of Hobart&mdash;a statue of him dominates the park known as Franklin Square, which was the site of the original Government House. His wife worked to set up a college, a museum and botanical gardens. The village of Franklin, on the Huon River, is named in his honour, as is the Franklin River on the West Coast of Tasmania, one of the better known Tasmanian rivers due to the Franklin Dam controversy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adb&gt;  1845 Northwest Passage expedition [[Image:Franklin's lost expedition map.png|thumb|right|Map of the probable routes taken by Erebus and Terror during Franklin's lost expedition.

The British decided to send a well-equipped Arctic expedition to complete the charting of the Northwest Passage. After Sir James Ross declined an offer to command the expedition, an invitation was extended to Franklin, who accepted despite his age, 59. A younger man, Captain James Fitzjames, was given command of HMS Erebus and Franklin was named the expedition commander. Captain Francis Rawdon Moira Crozier, who had commanded HMS Terror during the Ross 1841&ndash;44 Antarctic expedition, was appointed executive officer and commander of HMS Terror. Franklin was given command on February 7, 1845, and received official instructions on May 5, 1845.[[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS Erebus]] at  and [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS Terror]] at  were sturdily built and were outfitted with recent inventions. These included steam engines from the London and Greenwich Railway that enabled the ships to make  on their own power, a unique combined steam-based heating and distillation system for the comfort of the crew and to provide large quantities of fresh water for the engine's boilers, a mechanism that enabled the iron rudder and propeller to be drawn into iron wells to protect them from damage, ships' libraries of more than 1,000&nbsp;books, and three&nbsp;years' worth of conventionally preserved or tinned preserved food supplies. Unfortunately, the latter was supplied from a cut-rate provisioner who was awarded the contract only a few months before the ships were to sail. Though his "patent process" was sound, the haste with which he had prepared thousands of cans of food led to sloppily-applied beads of solder on the cans' interior edges and allowed lead to leach into the food. Chosen by the Admiralty, most of the crew were Englishmen, many from the North of England with a small number of Irishmen and Scotsmen.The Franklin Expedition set sail from Greenhithe, England, on the morning of May 19, 1845, with a crew of 24&nbsp;officers and 110&nbsp;men. The ships traveled north to Aberdeen for supplies. From Scotland, the ships sailed to Greenland with HMS Rattler and a transport ship, Barretto Junior. After misjudging the location of Whitefish Bay, Disko Island, Greenland, the expedition backtracked and finally harboured in that far north outpost to prepare for the rest of their voyage. Five&nbsp;crew members were discharged and sent home on the Rattler and Barretto Junior, reducing the ships' final crew size to 129. The expedition was last seen by Europeans on July 26, 1845, when Captain Dannett of the whaler Prince of Wales encountered Terror and Erebus moored to an iceberg in Lancaster Sound.After two&nbsp;years and no word from the expedition, Franklin's wife urged the Admiralty to send a search party. Because the crew carried supplies for three&nbsp;years, the Admiralty waited another year before launching a search and offering a £20,000&nbsp;reward for finding the expedition. The money and Franklin's fame led to many searches. At one point, ten&nbsp;British and two&nbsp;American ships, [[USS Advance (1850)| USS Advance]] and[[USS Rescue (1850)| USS Rescue]], headed for the Arctic. Eventually, more ships and men were lost looking for Franklin than in the expedition itself. Ballads such as "Lady Franklin's Lament", commemorating Lady Franklin's search for her lost husband, became popular. In the summer of 1850, expeditions including three from England as well as one from the United States joined in the search. They converged off the east coast of Beechey Island, where the first relics of the Franklin expedition were found, including the gravesites of three&nbsp;Franklin Expedition crewmen.In 1854, explorer John Rae, while surveying the Boothia Peninsula for the Hudson's Bay Company, discovered more evidence of the Franklin party's fate, and over the next four decades, about 25&nbsp;other searches added information. A century later, Owen Beattie, a University of Alberta professor of anthropology, began a 10-year series of scientific studies known as the "1845&ndash;48 Franklin Expedition Forensic Anthropology Project", showing that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis. Toxicological reports indicated that lead poisoning was also a possible factor. In addition, blade cut marks on the bones of some of the crew found on King William Island suggested that conditions had become so dire that some crew members resorted to cannibalism. It appeared from these studies that a combination of bad weather, years locked in ice, disease including scurvy, poisoned food, botulism and starvation had killed everyone in the Franklin party.For years after the loss of the Franklin party, the Victorian era media portrayed Franklin as a hero who led his men in the quest for the Northwest Passage. A statue of Franklin in his home town bears the inscription "Sir John Franklin — Discoverer of the North West Passage". Statues of Franklin outside the Athenaeum in London and in Tasmania bear similar inscriptions. Although the expedition's fate, including the possibility of cannibalism, was widely reported and debated, Franklin's standing with the public was not diminished. The mystery surrounding Franklin's last expedition was the subject of a 2006 episode of the Nova television series Arctic Passage and a 2007 documentary on Discovery HD Theater. The expedition has inspired many artistic works including a famous ballad, Lady Franklin's Lament, a verse play by Canadian poet Gwendolyn MacEwen, a children's book, a short story and essays by Canadian author Margaret Atwood, and several novels, and is referenced in Canadian musician Stan Rogers' ballad ''Northwest Passage''. There is also a direct reference to John Franklin's ill-fated expedition in the Irish-American group Nightnoise's album Something of Time, specifically in a track titled "The Erebus and the Terror". Additionally in 2007, a fictional account of the expedition was authored by Dan Simmons titled "The Terror", ISBN 978-0-316-01744-2.ReferencesBibliographyNon-fictionFranklin Saga Deaths: A Mystery Solved?
