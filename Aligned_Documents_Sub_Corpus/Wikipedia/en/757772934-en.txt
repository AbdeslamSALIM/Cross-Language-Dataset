She became well-known after a string of 1980s teen-oriented movies, and was one of the best known actresses of 1990s Hollywood. She is married to actor Ashton Kutcher, and her legal name is Demi Kutcher.BiographyEarly lifeMoore was born ' Demetria Gene Guynes' in Roswell, New Mexico, and spent many of her childhood years in Rogers Manor, Pennsylvania, a small town south of Pittsburgh. As a child, Moore had a difficult and unstable home life. Her biological father, Charles Harmon, left her mother, Virginia King (November 27 1943 &ndash; July 2 1998), after a two-month marriage, before Moore was born. As a result, Moore had the surname of her stepfather, Danny Guynes (March 9 1943 &ndash; October 1980), on her birth certificate. Danny Guynes, who committed suicide in 1980, frequently changed jobs; as a result the family moved a total of forty times. Moore's parents were also alcoholics and often fought and beat each other. Moore was cross-eyed as a child, and wore an eye patch in an attempt to correct the problem until it was eventually corrected by two surgeries. During this time, she also suffered from kidney dysfunction. Biography Channel - Demi Moore Moore's family settled in Los Angeles in 1976. When Moore was sixteen, her friend, actress Nastassja Kinski, persuaded her to drop out of Hollywood's Fairfax High School, where her schoolmates included Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis and actor Timothy Hutton, to become an actress. In 1979, she met and married her first husband, songwriter Freddy Moore. Though they divorced in 1985, she kept the last name Moore.CareerAfter quitting school, Moore went to work as a pin-up girl, modelled for European photographers, and worked at a collection agency. In the early 1980s, Moore posed for a series of photographs for Christopher Marrin featuring full frontal nudity. These photos went unnoticed until after she became a star, and were eventually published in a German magazine and later in North America. Moore's film debut was in the 1982 3-D science fiction/horror film, Parasite, which was a hit on the drive-in circuit, ultimately grossing $7 million. However, Moore was not widely known until she played the part of Jackie Templeton on the ABC soap opera, General Hospital, from 1982-1983. Appropriately, she also had an uncredited cameo at the end of the 1982 spoof Young Doctors in Love. In the mid-1980s, she appeared in the youth-oriented films St. Elmo's Fire and About Last Night, and she was often listed as one of the Brat Pack, a name the media dubbed a certain group of top young actors at the time. After the commercial success of Ghost, Moore was given more prominent roles in A Few Good Men, Indecent Proposal, Disclosure and The Hunchback of Notre Dame for which she was the first actress to reach the $10 million salary mark. She never duplicated the success of Ghost and had a string of flops like The Scarlet Letter and The Juror. She then took more risks like shocking her fans with several breast enhanced topless scenes in Striptease, and shaving her head for G.I. Jane. They too failed at the box office and garnered mixed reviews. Meanwhile, Moore's Passion of Mind co-star Joss Ackland lambasted Moore by describing her as being "not very bright or talented".BBC News | SHOWBIZ | Joss Ackland admits 'awful' films&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; At the same time she produced and starred in a TV mini-series called If These Walls Could Talk, written by Nancy Savoca. A three-part series on abortion, Savoca directed two segments, including the one in which Moore played a single woman in the 1950s seeking a back-alley abortion. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress for that role.Demi Moore was a founding "celebrity investor" in the Planet Hollywood chain of international theme restaurants (modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe and launched in New York on October 22, 1991) along with Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and then-husband Bruce Willis.After a break from her acting career, Moore returned to the screen as a former member of Charlie's Angels gone bad in the 2003 film Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. In 2006, she appeared in Bobby which featured an all-star cast including her husband Ashton Kutcher although they did not appear in any scenes together. On June 1, 2007, her most recent film, Mr. Brooks, was released. She appeared in Jon Bon Jovi's longform video "Destination Anywhere" as Janie.http://www.islandrecords.com/bonjovi/archives_atoz_m.las Demi Moore EntryIn 2006, Demi became the new face of the prestigious Cosmetic brand Helena Rubinstein.''Vanity'' controversyIn August 1991, Moore appeared nude on the cover of Vanity Fair under the title More Demi Moore. Annie Leibovitz shot the picture while Moore was seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue, intending to portray "anti-Hollywood, anti-glitz" attitude.Anderson, Susan Heller. &quot;Chronicle&quot;. The New York Times. July 11, 1991. Retrieved March 28, 2008. The cover sparked an intense controversy for Vanity Fair and Demi Moore, it was widely discussed on television, radio, and in newspaper articles. Some retailers pulled the issue from newsstands, while others only sold it in a brown paper bag. The frankness of Leibovitz' portrayal of a pregnant sex symbol led to divided opinions, ranging from complaints of sexual objectification to celebrations of the photograph as a symbol of empowerment.The photograph was subject to numerous parodies, including the ''Spy'' magazine version, which placed Moore's then husband Bruce Willis' head on her body. In Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp., Leibovitz sued over one parody featuring Leslie Nielsen, made to promote the 1994 film Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult. In the parody, the model's body was attached to what is described as "the guilty and smirking face of Mr. Nielsen appeared above". The teaser said "Due this March". The case was dismissed in 1996 because the parody relied "for its comic effect on the contrast between the original". Moore would in August 1992 again become an artistic subject on the cover of Vanity Fair for the world's leading body painting artist, Joanne Gair in Demi's Birthday Suit.Personal lifeMoore married singer Freddy Moore in 1980. They divorced in 1985 and in 1987 Moore met then Moonlighting star Bruce Willis. The two soon fell in love and married two months later. The star couple had three daughters together: Rumer Willis (b. 1988), Scout LaRue Willis (b. 1991) and Tallulah Belle Willis (b. 1994). The pair separated in 1998 and divorced in 2000, but remain friends to this day. In 2003, Moore started dating actor Ashton Kutcher, fifteen years her junior. After much press speculation and interest, the pair married in 2005. Moore's primary residence is in Hailey, Idaho, near the famous Sun Valley resort, although she spends much time in the Los Angeles area with Kutcher. She is a practicing follower of the Rabbi Philip Berg's Kabbalah Centre religion, and initiated Kutcher into the faith, having said that she "didn’t grow up Jewish, but... would say that has been more exposed to the deeper meanings of particular rituals than any of her friends ever did".http://www.thejewishweek.com/top/editletcontent.php3?artid=3430%20&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, Moore claims she has never been a raw foodist and dispels the vegan rumors by eating a hamburger in a recent Mario Testino photoshoot.Speyer, Adriana. "Gimme Moore", page 100. V Magazine, 51, Spring 2008. Moore legally changed her last name to Kutcher two years after marrying husband Ashton Kutcher. However, she will continue to use Moore in her professional life and her acting roles.Demi Moore is now Mrs Ashton Kutcher-International Buzz-Entertainment-The Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Demi Moore Finally Becomes Demi Kutcher - Entertainment News, Movie Reviews, Competitions - Entertainmentwise&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;RTÉ.ie Entertainment: Demi Moore changes name to Kutcher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;According to the New York Times, she is "the world's most high-profile doll collector", and among her favorites is the Gene Marshall fashion doll.FilmographyYearTitleRoleNotes1981It's Not A Rumor - The Nu KatsRock TemptressMTV Video1982ChoicesCorri1983Young Doctors in LoveNew InternuncreditedParasite]]''Patricia Welles1984''No Small AffairLaura Victor''Blame It on RioNicole 'Nikki' Hollis1985St. Elmo's Fire]]''Jules1986Wisdom]]''Karen SimmonsOne Crazy SummerCassandra EldridgeAbout Last Night...Debbie1988The Seventh SignAbby Quinn1989We're No Angels]]''Molly1990Ghost]]''Molly Jensen1991The Butcher's WifeMarina LemkeMortal ThoughtsCynthia KelloggMaster NinjaHolly TrumbullNothing But Trouble]]''Diane Lightson1992A Few Good MenLCDR JoAnne Galloway1993Indecent ProposalDiana Murphy1994Disclosure]]''Meredith Johnson1995Now and Then]]''older SamanthaThe Scarlet Letter]]''Hester Prynne1996Beavis and Butt-Head Do AmericaDallas Grimes(voice)Striptease]]''Erin GrantThe Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''Esmeralda]](voice)The JurorAnnie Laird1997Deconstructing HarryHelen/Harry's CharacterG.I.
