It is also the country's largest city, with a population of 1,181,702 (as of 2006)National 2006 census preliminary results http://www.insd.bf/Documents/Publications/INSD/Publications/Resultats_enquetes/Autres%20enq/Rapport_preliminaire_RGPH06.pdf. The city's name is often shortened to Ouaga.Ouagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles. It is served by an international airport, rail links to Abidjan in Côte d'Ivoire and to Kaya in the north of Burkina, and a highway to Niamey, Niger. Being such a focal point, there are many cinemas, nightclubs, and French, American, and Zaka cultural centers. Ouagadougou was the site of Ouagadougou grand market, one of the largest markets in West Africa, which burned in 2003 and remains closed. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the Moro-Naba Ceremony), the National Museum of Music, and several craft markets.HistoryThe name Ouagadougou goes back to the 15th century when the Yonyonse and the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area. They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri, a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in Burkina Faso’s history, led his tribe to victory. He then renamed the area from “Kumbee-Tenga,” as the Ninsi had called it, to “Wogodogo,” meaning "where people get honor and respect." Ouagadougou is a corruption of Wogodogo. The spelling of the name Ouagadougou is derived from the French orthography common in former French African colonies. The country changed its name from 'Haute Volta' to Burkina Faso after independence. If English orthography were used (as in Ghana or Nigeria), the spelling would be Wagadugu.Commune Ouagadougou.(2005). Mairie de ouagadougou.

Being an administrative center of colonial rule, it became an important urban center in the post-colonial era. First the capital of the Mossi Empire and later of Upper Volta and Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou became a veritable communal center in 1995.GovernmentThe first municipal elections were held in 1956.Ouagadougou is governed by a mayor, who is elected for a five-year term, two senior councillors, and 90 councillors.  The city is divided into five arrondissements, consisting of 30 sectors, which are subdivided into districts. Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, Peuloghin, Bilbalogho, and Tiendpalogo. Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area, which is about 219.3 km².The population of this metropolitan area is estimated to be 1,200,000 inhabitants, 48% of which are men and 52% women. The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total, and the density is 6,249 inhabitants per square kilometer, according to 1997 statistics.Concerning city management, the communes of Ouagadougou have made the decision to invest in huge projects. This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a 'cultural centre' by merit of holding the SIAO (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the FESPACO (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). Moreover, the growing affluence of the villages allow for such investment, and the fact that the population is growing rapidly necessitates it.+ The Arrondissements of OuagadougouArrondissementPopulation (Census 2006)Baskuy180,512Bogodogo374,473Boulmiougou366,182Nongremassom188,329Sig-Noghin163,859ClimateThe climate of Ouagadougou is hot.

The city's automobiles are generally small and inexpensively made, using a small two-stroke cycle engine.
