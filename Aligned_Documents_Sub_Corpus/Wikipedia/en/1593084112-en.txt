It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs: Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford, Wigan, and the cities of Salford and Manchester. Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972.Greater Manchester is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). The Greater Manchester Urban Area is the third most populous conurbation in the UK, and spans across most of the county's territory. As a ceremonial county, Greater Manchester has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff.Greater Manchester County Council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) are now effectively unitary authority areas; however, the metropolitan county, which is some , Retrieved on 6&nbsp;March 2008. continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference.

Several county-wide services are co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities.Before the creation of the metropolitan county the name SELNEC was used for the area, taken from the initials of "South East Lancashire North East Cheshire". Greater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts from the former administrative counties of Lancashire, Cheshire and Yorkshire, West Riding and eight independent county boroughs. Retrieved on 17&nbsp;June 2008.HistoryOriginsAlthough the modern county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, the history of its constituent settlements and parts goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age inhabitation, particularly at Mellor,Nevell and Redhead (2005), p.&nbsp;20. and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, believed to have been an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Retrieved on 10&nbsp;July 2008. Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey.Bayliss (1996), p.&nbsp;6. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007. and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007. are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.Redhead, Norman, in: Hartwell, Hyde and Pevsner (2004), p.&nbsp;18. s in Wardle. The development of Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic cloth production, and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution.]] During the Middle Ages, much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire&nbsp;– an ancient division of the county of Lancashire. Salfordshire encompassed several parishes and townships, some of which, like Rochdale, were important market towns and centres of England's woollen trade. The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production, which encouraged a system of cross-regional trade.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;ix.Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;24–25.McNeil and Nevell (2000), pp.&nbsp;1–3. The Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system, and much of Greater Manchester's heritage is related to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the infrastructure that grew up to support this sector. The townships in and around Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in textile processing.Aspin (1981), p.&nbsp;3. Places such as Bury, Oldham and Bolton played a central economic role in the nation, and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive mill towns in the world.Cowhig (1976), pp.&nbsp;7–9. Due to its commercial and socioeconomic success, the need for local government and geo-administrative change in what is now Greater Manchester was proposed as early as the 1910s.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;226.By the 18th century, traders from Germany had coined the name Manchesterthum, meaning "Greater Manchester", and were using that as a name for the region in and around Manchester.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;268. However, the English term "Greater Manchester" did not appear until the start of the 20th century. One of its first known recorded uses was in a 1914 report put forward in response to what was considered to have been the successful creation of the County of London in 1889. The report suggested that a county should be set up to recognise the "Manchester known in commerce", and referred to the areas that formed "a substantial part of South-Lancashire and part of Cheshire, comprising all municipal boroughs and minor authorities within a radius of eight or nine miles of Manchester".Swarbrick, J., (February 1914), Greater Manchester: The Future Municipal Government of Large Cities, pp.&nbsp;12–15. In his 1915 book Cities In Evolution, innovative urban planner Sir Patrick Geddes wrote "far more than Lancashire realises, is growing up another Greater London".Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;229.  of Cheshire, Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire.]] Conurbations in England tend to build-up at the historic county boundaries and Greater Manchester is no exception. Most of Greater Manchester lay within the ancient county boundaries of Lancashire; those areas south of the Mersey and Tame were in Cheshire. The Saddleworth area and a small part of Mossley are historically part of Yorkshire and in the south-east a small part in Derbyshire. The areas that were incorporated into Greater Manchester in 1974 previously formed parts of the administrative counties of Cheshire, Lancashire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and of eight independent county boroughs. By the early 1970s, this system of demarcation was described as "archaic" and "grossly inadequate to keep pace both with the impact of motor travel, and with the huge increases in local government responsibilities".The Manchester Evening Chronicle brought to the fore the issue of "regional unity" for the area in April 1935 under the headline "Greater Manchester&nbsp;– The Ratepayers' Salvation". It reported on the "increasing demands for the exploration of the possibilities of a greater merger of public services throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities".Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;227. The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and Salford. The Mayor of Salford pledged his support to the idea, stating that he looked forward to the day when "there would be a merging of the essential services of Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding districts constituting Greater Manchester." Proposals were halted by the Second World War, though in the decade after it, the pace of proposals for local government reform for the area quickened.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;228. In 1947, Lancashire County Council proposed a three "ridings" system to meet the changing needs of the county of Lancashire, including those for Manchester and surrounding districts. Other proposals included the creation of a Manchester County Council, a directly elected regional body. In 1951, the census in the UK began reporting on South-East Lancashire as a homogeneous conurbation.Redcliffe-Maud Report The Local Government Act 1958 designated the south east Lancashire area (which, despite its name, included part of north east Cheshire), a Special Review Area. The Local Government Commission for England presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county based on the conurbation surrounding and including Manchester, with nine most-purpose boroughs corresponding to the modern Greater Manchester boroughs (excluding Wigan). The review was abolished in favour of the Royal Commission on Local Government before issuing a final report.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;231.The Royal Commission's 1969 report, known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, proposed the removal of much of the then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering urban and rural districts separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation. The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, provision of services, and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative metropolitan area.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;234. The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included Rossendale), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including Macclesfield, Warrington, Alderley Edge, Northwich, Middlewich, Wilmslow and Lymm), and Derbyshire (the towns of New Mills, Whaley Bridge, Glossop and Chapel-en-le-Frith&nbsp;– a minority report suggested that Buxton be included). The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside. The report noted "The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult".Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;233. Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the British Association intended to define the "South-East Lancashire conurbation" noted that "Greater Manchester it is not ... One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns, ... all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance".Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;264. The term Selnec (or SELNEC) was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as "the most convenient term available", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire.Redcliffe-Maud et al (June 1969), pp.&nbsp;219–235. Following the Transport Act 1968, in 1969 the SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive (an authority to co-ordinate and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area smaller than the proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and Saddleworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It excluded Wigan, which was in both the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not been part of the 1958 act's review area). Retrieved on 6&nbsp;July 2008.Redcliffe-Maud's recommendations were accepted by the Labour-controlled Government in February 1970. Redcliffe-Maud and Wood (1975), pp.&nbsp;46–7, 56, 157. Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the 1970 general election, there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Warrington, Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their county councils had enough revenue to remain competitive (Cheshire County Council would have ceased to exist). Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the Metropolitan Borough of Bury and the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed "Botchdale" by local MP Michael Fidler) but were divided into separate boroughs. To re-balance the districts, the borough of Rochdale took Middleton from Oldham. During the passage of the bill, the towns of Whitworth, Wilmslow and Poynton successfully objected to their incorporation in the new county.post-1974pre-1974Metropolitan countyMetropolitan boroughCounty boroughsNon-county borough]]sUrban districtsRural districtsGreater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts, including eight county boroughs and 16 municipal boroughs.Bury]]Bury]]Prestwich]]&nbsp;• Radcliffe&nbsp;•Ramsbottom]]&nbsp;• Tottington&nbsp;• WhitefieldBolton]]Bolton]]Farnworth]]Blackrod]]&nbsp;• Horwich&nbsp;• Kearsley&nbsp;• Little Lever&nbsp;• Turton&nbsp;• WesthoughtonManchesterManchesterRingwayAt 31 March 1974, Ringway was a civil parish in the Bucklow Rural District.Oldham]]Oldham]]Chadderton]]&nbsp;• Crompton&nbsp;• Failsworth&nbsp;• Lees&nbsp;• Royton&nbsp;• SaddleworthRochdale]]Rochdale]]Middleton]]&nbsp;• Heywood&nbsp;•Littleborough]]&nbsp;• Milnrow&nbsp;• WardleSalford]]Salford]]Eccles]]&nbsp;• Swinton and PendleburyIrlam]]&nbsp;• WorsleyStockport]]Stockport]]Marple]]TamesideAshton-under-Lyne]]&nbsp;• Dukinfield&nbsp;• Hyde&nbsp;• Mossley&nbsp;• StalybridgeAudenshaw]]&nbsp;• Denton&nbsp;• Droylsden&nbsp;• LongendaleTraffordAltrincham]]&nbsp;• Sale&nbsp;• StretfordBowden]]&nbsp;• Hale&nbsp;• UrmstonBucklow]]Wigan]]Wigan]]Leigh]]Abram]]&nbsp;• Ashton in Makerfield&nbsp;• Aspull&nbsp;• Atherton&nbsp;• Billinge and Winstanley&nbsp;• Hindley&nbsp;• Ince-in-Makerfield&nbsp;• Golborne&nbsp;• Orrell&nbsp;• Standish-with-Langtree&nbsp;• TyldesleyWigan]]After 1974) was a converted former railway station in Manchester City Centre used for hosting the county's cultural events.]]  operated bus services throughout the county, from 1974 to 1993.]]  housed the Greater Manchester County Council until its abolition in 1986.]] The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country.HMSO.

The leading article in The Times on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the "new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively". Frangopulo noted that the creation of Greater Manchester "was the official unifying of a region which, through history and tradition, had forged for itself over many centuries bonds ... between the communities of town and village, each of which was the embodiment of the character of this region".Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;xii. The name Greater Manchester was decided by Her Majesty's Government, having been favoured over Selnec by the local population..By January 1974, a joint working party representing Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out strategic and long-term objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;246. The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by way of improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in the county's country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure and recreational facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and journey to work patterns.Frangopulo (1977), pp.&nbsp;246–255. The Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded Manchester Central) was a converted former railway station in Manchester City Centre used for cultural events.Parkinson-Bailey (2000), pp.&nbsp;214–5.Unlike most other modern counties (including Merseyside and Tyne and Wear), Greater Manchester was never adopted as a postal county by the Royal Mail. A review in 1973 noted that "Greater Manchester" would be unlikely to be adopted because of confusion with the Manchester post town.• And so the component areas of Greater Manchester held on to their pre-1974 postal counties until 1996, when they were abolished.A decade after they were established, the mostly Labour-controlled metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council (GLC) had several high profile clashes with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, with regards overspending and high rates charging. Government policy on the issue was considered throughout 1982, and the Conservative Party put a "promise to scrap the metropolitan county councils" and the GLC, in their manifesto for the 1983 general election.•• Greater Manchester County Council was abolished on 31&nbsp;March 1986 under the Local Government Act 1985. That the metropolitan county councils were controlled by the Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: the general secretary of the National Association of Local Government Officers described it as a "completely cynical manoeuvre". Most of the functions of the Greater Manchester County Council were devolved to the ten Greater Manchester metropolitan district councils, though some functions such as emergency services and public transport were taken over by joint boards and continued to be run on a county-wide basis. The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) was established to continue much of the county-wide services of the county council. Retrieved on 5&nbsp;March 2008.

Local governance in Greater Manchester is currently provided by the councils of ten districts, known as metropolitan boroughs, these are: Bolton, Bury, the City of Manchester, Oldham, Rochdale, the City of Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan.Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester are named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence.Frangopulo (1977), p.&nbsp;138. As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of Stockport, a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as Cheadle, Gatley, and Bramhall. The names of two of the metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral name because, at the time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a county borough. These boroughs are Tameside and Trafford, centred on Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford, respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins.For the first 12&nbsp;years after the county was created in 1974, the county had a two-tier system of local government, and the metropolitan borough councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council. The Greater Manchester County Council, a strategic authority running regional services such as transport, strategic planning, emergency services and waste disposal, comprised 106 members drawn from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester.Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (N.D.), p.&nbsp;65. However in 1986, along with the five other metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council, the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished, and most of its powers were devolved to the boroughs. Various civil parishes exist in certain parts of Greater Manchester.Although the county council, which was based in what is now Westminster House off Piccadilly Gardens, has been abolished, a number of local government functions take place at the county level. The ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operate through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), which meets to create a co-ordinated county-wide approach to many issues. The AGMA funds some county-wide bodies such as the Greater Manchester County Record Office. Through the AGMA, the ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operate on many policy issues, including county-wide Local Transport Plans. Retrieved on 12&nbsp;December 2006.

These joint boards are made up of councillors appointed from each of the ten boroughs (except the Waste Disposal Authority, which does not include the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan). The ten boroughs jointly own the Manchester Airport Group which controls Manchester Airport and three other UK airports. Other services are directly funded and managed by the local councils.Greater Manchester is a ceremonial county with its own Lord-Lieutenant who is the personal representative of the monarch.
