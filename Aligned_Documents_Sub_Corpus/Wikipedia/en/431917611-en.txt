 's ship]] A roc or rukh (from Persian رخ rokh, There is no connection with the Rook chess piece, which is from the Persian rukh, or Sanskrit rath, both meaning "chariot", thus corresponding to the Asian chess variants. asserted by Louis Charles CasartelliCasartelli, in 'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'' '''28 1891:345-f, noted by Wittkower 1938:256 note 2. to be an abbreviated form of Persian simurgh) is an enormous legendary bird of prey, often white, reputed to have been able to carry off and eat elephants.Eastern originsThe roc had its origins, according to Rudolph Wittkower, in the fight between the Indian solar bird GarudaWittkower noted the identification of the roc and Garuda made in Kalipadra Mitra, "The bird and serpent myth", The Quarterly Journal of the Mythic Society (Bangalore) 16 1925-26:189. and the chthonic serpent Nāga, a word that A. de Gubernatis asserted signified 'elephant' as well as 'snake'.Wittkower 1938:255 note 3 credits A. de Gubernatis, Zoological Mythology 1872, II, p. 94 The mytheme of Garuda carrying off an elephant that was battling a tortoise appears in two Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata (I.1353) and the Ramayana (III.39). The roc appears in Arabic geographies and natural history, popularized in Arabian fairy tales and sailors' folklore. Ibn Battuta (iv. 305ff) tells of a mountain hovering in air over the China Seas, which was the roc.Noted in Yule-Cordier, Cathay and the Way Thither IV (1916:146), noted by Wittkower 1938.Western expansionRabbi Benjamin of Tudela reported a story reminiscent of the roc in which shipwrecked sailors had themselves carried off desert islands by wrapping ox-hides round them and letting griffins carry them off as if they were cattle.M. Komroff, Contemporaries of Marco Pol;o 1928:311f. In the 13th century, Marco Polo (as quoted in Attenborough (1961: 32) stated "It was for all the world like an eagle, but one indeed of enormous size; so big in fact that its quills were twelve paces long and thick in proportion. And it is so strong that it will seize an elephant in its talons and carry him high into the air and drop him so that he is smashed to pieces; having so killed him, the bird swoops down on him and eats him at leisure". Marco Polo explicitly distinguishes the bird from a griffin. Doubtless it was Marco Polo's description that inspired Antonio Pigafetta, one of Magellan's companions, who wrote or had ghost-written an embroidered account of the circumglobal voyage; in Pigafetta's accountOr the Italian version in Ramusio's Delle navigationi et viaggi, mentioned in Rudolph Wittkower, "'Roc': An Eastern Prodigy in a Dutch Engraving" Journal of the Warburg Institute 1.3 (January 1938:255-257) p 255 the home grounds of the roc were the China Seas. Such descriptions doubtless captured the imaginations of later illustrators, such as Johannes Stradanus ca 1590An engraving after Stradanus is reproduced in Wittkower 1938:fig 33c. or Theodor de Bry in 1594 who showed an elephant being carried off in the roc's talons,De Bry's engraving is reproduced in Attenborough (1961: 35) or showed the roc destroying entire ships in revenge for destruction of its giant egg, as recounted in the fifth voyage of Sinbad the Sailor. Tomasso Aldrovandini's Ornithologia (1599) included a woodcut of a roc with a somewhat pig-like elephant in its talons,Illustrated in Wittkower 1938:33, fig. b. but in the rational world of the seventeenth century, the roc was more critically looked upon.Rationalized accountsThe scientific culture of the nineteenth century introduced some 'scientific' rationalizations for the myth's origins, by suggesting that the origin of the myth of the roc may lie in embellishments of the often-witnessed power of the eagle that could carry away a newborn lamb. In 1863, Bianconi suggested the roc was a raptor (Hawkins and Goodman, 2003: 1031). Recently a giant subfossil eagle in the genus Stephanoaetus identified from Madagascar was actually implicated as a top bird predator of the island, whose megafauna once included giant lemurs and pigmy hippopotami (Goodman, 1994).One such rationalizing theory is that the existence of rocs was postulated from the sight of the African ostrich, which, because of its flightlessness and unusual appearance, was mistaken for the chick of a presumably much larger species. It is, however, possible that the myth originated from accounts of eggs of another Malagasy subfossil, the enormous Aepyornis elephant bird, an extinct three-meter tall flightless bird whose name may also have been inspired by Marco Polo's legend. There are reported sightings of the Aepyornis at least in folklore memory as Étienne de Flacourt wrote in 1658. Its egg, live or subfossilised, was known as early as 1420, when sailors to the Cape of Good Hope found eggs of the roc, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map of the world, which says that the roc "carries away an elephant or any other great animal". In addition to Marco Polo's account of the rukh in 1298, Chou Ch'ű-fei (Zhōu Qùfēi 周去飞) in 1178 told of a large island off Africa with birds large enough to use their quills as water reservoirs (Pearson and Godden 2002: 121).

Through the sixteenth century the existence of the roc was accepted by Europeans. In 1604 Michael Drayton envisaged the rocs being taken aboard the Ark:  All feathered things yet ever knowne to men, From the huge Rucke, unto the little Wren; From Forrest, Fields, from Rivers and from Pons, All that have webs, or cloven-footed ones; To the Grand Arke, together friendly came, Whose severall species were too long to name. Comparable mythic birdsThe roc is hardly different from the Middle-Eastern `anqa "عنقاء" (see phoenix); it is also identified with the Persian simurgh, the bird which figures in Firdausi's epic as the foster-father of the hero Zal, father of Rustam.Going farther back into Persian antiquity, there is an immortal bird, amrzs, or (in the Minoi-khiradh) slnamurv, which shakes the ripe fruit from the mythical tree that bears the seed of all useful things. Sinmartt and simurgh seem to be the same word. In Indian legend the garuda on which Vishnu rides is the king of birds (Benfey, Panchatantra, 98). In the Pahlavi translation of the Indian story as represented by the Syrian Kalilag and Damnag (ed. Gustav Bickell, 1876), the simurgh takes the place of the garuda, while Ibn al-Molaffa (Calila et Dimna, ed. De Sacy, p. 126) speaks instead of the `anl~a. The later Syriac, curiously enough, has behemoth&mdash;apparently the behemoth of Job&mdash;transformed into a bird. The Hungarian Turul, the Ziz of Jewish tradition, the Fijian kanivatu, the Chinese peng and the Thunderbird of Native American tradition are also giant birds.Notes and referencesFor a collection of legends about the roc, see Edward Lane's Arabian Nights, chap; xx. notes 22, 62Heny Yule, as above.Samuel Bochart, Hierozoicon, vi.14Damfri, I. 414, ii. 177 seq.Kazwini, i. ~I9 seq.Ibn Batuta, iv. 305ffFriedrich Spiegel, Eranische Alterthumskunde, ii. 118.Goodman, Steven M.
