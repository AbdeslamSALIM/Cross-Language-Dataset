 .]] Bertrada of Laon, also called Bertha Broadfoot, (720 – July 12, 783) was a Frankish queen. She was born in Laon, in today's Aisne, France, the daughter of Caribert of Laon. She married Pepin the Short, the son of the Frankish Mayor of the Palace Charles Martel, in 740, although the union was not canonically sanctioned until several years later. Eleven years later, in 751, Pepin and Bertrada became King and Queen of the Franks, following Pepin's successful coup against the Frankish Merovingian monarchs.Bertrada and Pepin are known to have had four children, three sons and one daughter: of these, Charles (Charlemagne), Carloman, and Gisela survived to adulthood, whilst Pepin died in infancy. Charlemagne and Carloman would inherit the two halves of their father's kingdom when he died, and Gisela became a nun.Bertrada lived at the court of her elder son Charles, and according to Einhard their relationship was excellent. She recommended he marry his first wife, Desiderata, a daughter of the Lombard king Desiderius, but he soon divorced her. Einhard claims this was the only episode that ever strained relations between mother and son. Bertrada lived with Charlemagne until her death in 783; the king buried her in Saint Denis Basilica with great honors.External links    Category:720 births Category:783 deaths Category:People from Picardie Category:Frankish women Category:Queens consort Category:Carolingian dynasty Category:Franks Category:Frankish peoplebr:Bertrada Laon da:Bertrada af Laon de:Bertrada die Jüngere es:Bertrada de Laon fr:Bertrade de Laon it:Bertrada di Laon nl:Bertrada van Laon pl:Bertrada z Laon pt:Berta de Laon
