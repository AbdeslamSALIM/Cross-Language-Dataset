Many countries are made up of a number of subnational entities called states (or related terms in languages other than English). These should not be confused with nation states or the state as a generic concept.Countries with federal constitutions include several sovereign subnational states with rights and/or powers which cannot be over-ruled or vetoed by the national government or head of state. In cases, such as the U.S. states, the national government arose from a union of sovereign entities, which transferred some of their powers to the national government, while retaining the remainder of their sovereignty.The Constitution of the United States of America: Tenth Amendment, Reserved Powers, from www.gpoaccess.gov These are sometimes called federal states.
