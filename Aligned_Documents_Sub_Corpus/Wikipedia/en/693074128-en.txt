In 2015, Marty's employer is Fujitsu, and he is fired by company owner Ito Fujitsu. When the film was shown in Japan, audiences did not understand the joke, since Fujitsu is not a person's name, it is only a company name similar to the American company General Motors so this was similar to Marty being fired by "Mr. General Motors." Commentary about the making of the film included on the 3 DVD set Back to the Future I, II, III.In the movie Scary Movie 4 there is a dialog between Cindy and the ghost boy. The parody has them talking in Japanese, but in reality they are just using Japanese brand names, and other popular Japanese terms.
