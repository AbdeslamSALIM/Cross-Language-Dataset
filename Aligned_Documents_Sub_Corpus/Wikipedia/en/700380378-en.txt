He played as a striker for Ajax, AC Milan, FC Barcelona, Newcastle United, Valencia, PSV, and Lille OSC.Kluivert played in the Dutch national team from 1994 to 2004. He is the all-time leading goalscorer for the Dutch national team with 40 goals. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by Pelé as part of FIFA's centenary observances.Early lifePatrick Stephan Kluivert is born on July 1, 1976 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. His father, a professional football player, was born in Suriname and his mother in Curaçao.http://www.patrick-kluivert.com/biography.php Dutch bioKluivert learned to play football on the street. After he played for football club Schellingwoude one year, he joined the Ajax youth academy at the age of seven. During his younger years, he played on different positions, even as a defender. He was strong in technique, football intelligence, and speed, but his personality was considered too impulsive.http://www.patrick-kluivert.com/biography.php English bioKluivert played for the Dutch national teams under-15, under-16, and under-17.Club careerAjaxKluivert was part of Ajax's Golden Generation of the 90s. He made his debut in the senior team of Ajax on August 21, 1994 at the age of 18 in the Dutch Supercup win against the old arch rival Feyenoord in which he scored his first goal. The 1994/95 season saw Kluivert make his mark -- along a host of youngsters from the Ajax youth academy including Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf, and Edwin Van der Sar -- on the European stage with a triumph in the UEFA Champions League. Kluivert came off the bench to score an 85th minute winner in the 1994/95 Champions League Final against AC Milan in Vienna. He soon became Ajax's 'Golden Boy' of the mid-90s, leading the Ajax front-line as the side claimed several pieces of silverware during that period. He declined a new contract to leave for AC Milan on a Bosman transfer in 1997.A.C. MilanHis career at A.C. Milan started well when he scored a sensational goal against Juventus in a friendly match. However at this time Kluivert's personal life began to cause problems (see Personal life section). After scoring only six goals in Italy he left for FC Barcelona.BarcelonaAt Barcelona, Kluivert was reunited with Louis Van Gaal, a mentor from his days at Ajax. Kluivert formed a successful partnership with Rivaldo which enabled Barça to defend the Spanish La Liga in 1998/99. He was released from Barça in the summer of 2004.Newcastle UnitedKluivert joined Newcastle United on July 21 2004 to team up with Alan Shearer. However, Newcastle decided not to take up the second year on his contract. Kluivert scored some classy and crucial goals namely both winning strikes against Chelsea and Tottenham in the FA Cup, both games ending 1-0. Despite scoring 13 goals in his debut season Newcastle finished the league in the bottom half which triggered a clause in his contract saying either party could decide not to extend his contract a further year. Both Kluivert and the club agreed that he would leave.ValenciaKluivert decided to return to Spain to play for Valencia CF. Reportedly, the club included a special clause in his contract that allowed for Kluivert to be sacked if he lacked discipline off the pitch. Kluivert was given permission to look for a new club in July 2006 after just one season and 202 minutes played, as he spent most of the season injured.PSVDespite widespread rumours that Kluivert was to return home to Ajax, Kluivert's return to the Eredivisie was to be with PSV Eindhoven, with whom he signed a one-year deal in 2006. Just as with his debut for Ajax, Kluivert made his PSV debut against Feyenoord (2-1 win), coming on as a substitute. Since then, he has had two injuries during the first half of the season, which has limited his playing time. In the game against Ajax in the Philips Stadion, Kluivert refused to celebrate after scoring a goal against his former club. He was eventually released in July 2007.LilleOn July 25 2007, he turned down the offer of a trial at Sheffield Wednesday,Owls fail to woo striker Kluivert BBC Sport and later joined French side Lille.Ligue 1 - Lille announce Kluivert signing - Yahoo! Eurosport UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Since joining Lille, Kluivert has had a mixed experience with the French club; only starting 10 times, although in these appearances he has contributed greatly with 4 goals and valuable assists. In May 2008, Patrick Kluivert told Lille-manager Puel, he'll be looking for a new challenge next season.Current situationAt April 29 2008, Dutch media reported that Kluivert will take part in the coaching course of the Dutch Football Association to become a professional football coach. Kluivert lines up coaching courseAt the same time, Kluivert is currently waiting for the right team to join next season.On July 18, 2008 it was reported on the football website Goal.com that Kluivert would be spending the 2008-2009 season as a member of the backroom coaching staff of Eredivisie club AZ Alkmaar. The KNVB requires that all coaching badge candidates complete this sort of apprenticeship. Fellow Dutchman Dennis Bergkamp will be assuming a similar role this season with Ajax Amsterdam.International careerKluivert missed most of Euro 96 with a knee injury. During the final group game and from a Dennis Bergkamp assist, he scored against England, which enabled the Netherlands to qualify for the knock-out round over Scotland on goal difference. There, they lost in a penalty shootout to France.At the 1998 FIFA World Cup he was sent off against Belgium by referee Pierluigi Collina after elbowing Lorenzo Staelens. He made amends when selected to play against Argentina in the quarter-finals of the same tournament where he scored the opening goal. He also impressed in later matches, scoring a late equalizing goal from a header to draw his team level with Brazil in the semi-final, though the latter prevailed in the penalty shootout.Euro 2000 would represent Patrick Kluivert's finest hour as the spearhead of a star-studded Oranje side. Kluivert scored a hat-trick in the 6-1 quarterfinal demolition of Yugoslavia. The semifinal against Italy would provide much heartache for Kluivert, as the Dutch crashed out yet again on penalties. Neither Kluivert nor his Dutch side could find the back of the net despite twice having a chance from the penalty spot -- Kluivert himself would miss one of those penalties during the game. Despite the Dutch falling short, Kluivert will be remembered for rising to the occasion in front of partisan home crowds, scoring 5 goals in as many games, jointly claiming the Golden Boot with Savo Milošević.Kluivert would once again enter EURO 2004 wearing the famous #9 jersey for his country. But it would be a tournament to forget, as a stubborn Dick Advocaat would not turn to Kluivert even once in the tournament -- Kluivert would end up being the only member of the Dutch squad not to get even a single minute at EURO 2004.Apart from being left out of the 2006 World Cup squad by coach Marco van Basten, Kluivert was not called up to play in any of the qualifying games leading up to the World Cup either. This was partly due to the fact that he suffered persistent injuries which prevented him from playing for his club during the 05-06 season. The international career of Patrick Kluivert seems all but over now that Marco van Basten will continue to be the national team coach until Euro 2008.As of 2008, Kluivert remains the all-time leading goalscorer for the Dutch national team with 40 goals.Personal lifeIn 1997, Kluivert was charged with manslaughter following his involvement in a fatal car accident, to which he received community service and a driving ban. He was also charged with rape on a separate occasion, but he was to be later acquitted due to insufficient evidence. Kluivert stated he had engaged in consensual sex with the defendant. http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19980712/ai_n14481153Kluivert and his wife, Rosanna Lima, a stylist, welcomed a baby boy, Shane Patrick, on September 24 2007.
