He made his fortune in the financial services industry, and was best known for many world records, including five nonstop circumnavigations of the Earth: as a long-distance solo balloonist, as a sailor, and as a solo flight fixed-wing aircraft pilot.A fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and the Explorers Club, Fossett set 116 records in five different sports, 60 of which still stand, .&lt;/ref&gt;On September 3, 2007, Fossett was reported missing after the plane he was flying over the Nevada desert failed to return. Despite a month of searches by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) and others, Fossett could not be found, and the search by CAP was called off on October 2, 2007. Privately funded and privately directed search efforts continued.After a request from Fossett's wife, he was declared legally dead on February 15, 2008.On September 29, 2008, a hiker found personal items, cash, and identification documents confirmed as Fossett's near Mammoth Lakes, California. Over the following week, an aerial search spotted the location of Fossett's airplane wreckage where ground searchers found partial remains that are currently undergoing DNA analysis.Early yearsFossett was born in Jackson, Tennessee but he grew up in Garden Grove, California.Fossett's interest in adventure began early. As a Boy Scout, he grew up climbing the mountains of California, beginning with the San Jacinto Mountains. "When I was 12 years old I climbed my first mountain, and I just kept going, taking on more diverse and grander projects." Fossett said that he did not have a natural gift for athletics or team sports, so he focused on activities that required persistence and endurance. His father, an Eagle Scout, encouraged Fossett to pursue these types of adventures and encouraged him to become involved with the Boy Scouts early. At age 13, Fossett earned the Boy Scouts' highest rank of Eagle Scout and was a Vigil member of the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouts' honor society, where he served as lodge chief. He also worked as a Ranger at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico during the summer of 1961. Fossett said in 2006 that Scouting was the most important activity of his youth.In college at Stanford University, Fossett was already known as an adventurer; his Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity brothers convinced him to swim to Alcatraz and raise a banner that read "Beat Cal" on the wall of the prison, closed two years previously. (He made the swim, but was thwarted by a security guard when he arrived.) Fossett held various leadership positions at Stanford, including serving in student government and serving as President of a few clubs. In 1966, Fossett graduated from Stanford with a degree in economics. Fossett spent the following summer in Europe climbing mountains and swimming the Dardanelles.Business careerIn 1968, Fossett received an MBA from the Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where Fossett was a longtime member of the Board of Trustees.&lt;/ref&gt; Fossett's first job out of business school was with [[IBM]]; he then served as a consultant for [[Deloitte and Touche]], and later accepted a job with [[Marshall Field's]]. Fossett later said, &quot;For the first five years of my business career, I was distracted by being in [[computer]] systems, and then I became interested in financial markets. That's where I thrived.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;airportjournal&quot;/&gt;Fossett then became a successful commodities salesman in Chicago, first for Merrill Lynch in 1973, where he proved a highly successful producer of commission revenue for himself and that firm. He began working in 1976 for Drexel Burnham, which provided him with a membership on the Chicago Board of Trade and permitted him to market the services of the firm from a phone on the floor of that exchange. In 1980, Fossett began the process that eventually produced his enduring prosperity: renting exchange memberships to would-be floor traders, first on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. After 15 years of working for other companies, Fossett founded his own firms, Marathon Securities and Lakota Trading, from which he made millions renting exchange memberships.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnstory2&quot;/&gt; He founded Lakota Trading for that purpose in 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnstory3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1980s,&lt;ref name=&quot;airportjournal&quot;/&gt; he founded Marathon Securities and extended that successful formula to memberships on the New York stock exchanges. He earned millions renting floor trading privileges (exchange memberships) to hopeful new floor traders, who would also pay clearing fees to Fossett's clearing firms in proportion to the trading activity of those renting the memberships. In 1997, the trading volume of its rented memberships was larger than any other clearing firm on the Chicago exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanfordalumni&quot;/&gt; Lakota Trading replicated that same business plan on many exchanges in the United States and also in [[London]].&lt;ref name=&quot;airportjournal&quot;/&gt; Fossett would later use those revenues to finance his adventures.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraphJune2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foxnews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnstory2&quot;/&gt;  Fossett said, &quot;As a floor trader, I was very aggressive and worked hard. Those same traits help me in adventure sports.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stanfordalumni&quot;/&gt;Fossett said he did not participate in any of the "interesting things" he had done in college during his time in exchange-related activities: "There was a period of time where I wasn't doing anything except working for a living. I became very frustrated with that and finally made up my mind to start getting back into things." He began to take six weeks a year off to spend time on sports and eventually moved to Beaver Creek, Colorado in 1990, where for a time he ran his business from a distance. Fossett later sold most of his business interests,&lt;/ref&gt; although he maintained an office in Chicago until 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;airportjournal&quot;/&gt;Personal lifeFossett was married to Peggy Fossett (Viehland), originally from Richmond Heights, Missouri, in 1968. They had no children.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fossetts had homes in [[Beaver Creek, Colorado]] and Chicago and a vacation home in [[Carmel, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yachtsman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stlpostdispatch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stanfordalumni&quot;/&gt;Fossett became well-known in the United Kingdom for his friendship with billionaire Richard Branson, who financed some of Fossett's adventures.RecordsOverviewSteve Fossett was well known for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft. He was an aviator of exceptional breadth of experience, from his quest to become the first person to achieve a solo balloon flight around the world (finally succeeding on his sixth attempt, in 2002) to setting, with co-pilot Terry Delore, 10 of the 21 Glider Open records, including the first 2,000&nbsp;km Out-and-Return, the first 1,500&nbsp;km Triangle and the longest Straight Distance flights. His achievements as a jet pilot in a Cessna Citation X include records for U.S. Transcontinental, Australia Transcontinental, and Round-the-World westbound non-supersonic flights. Prior to Fossett's aviation records, no pilot had held world records in more than one class of aircraft; Fossett holds them in four classes.In 2005, Fossett made the first solo nonstop and unrefueled circumnavigation of the world in 67 hours in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, a single engine jet aircraft.In 2006, he again circumnavigated the globe nonstop and unrefueled in 76 hours, 45 minutes in the GlobalFlyer, setting the record for the longest flight by any aircraft in history with a distance of 25,766 statute miles (41,467 km).He set 93 aviation world records ratified by Fédération Aéronautique Internationale,&lt;/ref&gt; plus 23 sailing world records ratified by the [[World Sailing Speed Record Council]].On August 29,2006 he set the world altitude record for gliders over El Calafale, Argentina at 50,722 feet.Balloon pilotOn February 21, 1995, Fossett landed in Leader, Saskatchewan, Canada, after taking off from South Korea, becoming the first person to make a solo flight across the Pacific Ocean in a balloon.
 | accessdate = 2007-09-05 &lt;/ref&gt;In 2002, he became the first person to fly around the world alone, nonstop, in a balloon. He launched the 10-story high balloon Spirit of Freedom from Northam, Western Australia, on June 19, 2002 and returned to Australia on July 3, 2002, subsequently landing in Queensland, Australia. Duration and distance of this solo balloon flight was 13 days, 8 hours, 33 minutes (14 days 19 hours 50 minutes to landing), 20,626.48 statute miles (33,195.10 km). The balloon dragged him along the ground for 20 minutes at the end of the flight. The control center for the mission was located in St. Louis, Missouri. Fossett's top speed during the flight was 186 miles per hour over the Indian Ocean. Only the capsule survived the landing; it was taken to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, where it was displayed. The trip set a number of records for ballooning: Fastest (200 miles per hour/322 km, breaking his own previous record of 166 miles per hour/270 km), Fastest Around the World (13.5 days), Longest Distance Flown Solo in a Balloon (20,482.26 miles), and 24-Hour Balloon Distance (3,186.80 miles on July 1).&lt;/ref&gt;While Fossett had financed five previous tries himself, his successful record-setting flight was sponsored by Bud Light. Fossett said that he hoped his flight would inspire others to achieve their personal goals in their own lives.In the end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights; he bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight, and along with sponsorship, that payout meant that in the end, Fossett did not have to spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.SailorFossett was one of the world's most accomplished sailors. Speed sailing was his speciality and from 1993 to 2004, he dominated the record sheets, setting 23 official world records and nine distance race records. He is recognized by the World Sailing Speed Record Council as "the world's most accomplished speed sailor."On the maxi-catamaran Cheyenne (formerly named PlayStation), Fossett twice set the prestigious 24 Hour Record of Sailing. In October 2001, Fossett and his crew set a transatlantic record of 4 days 17 hours, shattering the previous record by 43 hours 35 minutes — an increase in average speed of nearly seven knots.In early 2004, Fossett, as skipper, set the world record for fastest circumnavigation of the world (58 days, 9 hours) in Cheyenne with a crew of 13. Both the Transatlantic and Round the World records have been superseded by Bruno Peyron on Orange II. In 2007, Fossett held the world record for crossing the Pacific Ocean in his 125-foot sailboat, the PlayStation, which he accomplished on his fourth try.Airship pilotFossett set the Absolute World Speed Record for airships on October 27, 2004. The new record for fastest flight was accomplished with a Zeppelin NT, at a recorded average speed of 62.2 knots (115.0&nbsp;km/h, 71.5 mph). The previous record was 50.1 knots (92.8&nbsp;km/h, 57.7 mph) set in 2001 in a Virgin airship. In 2006, Fossett was one of only 17 pilots in the world licensed to fly the Zeppelin.Fixed-wing aircraft pilotGlobalFlyerKennedy Space Center’s Shuttle Landing Facility seated in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer cockpit]] Fossett made the first solo nonstop fixed-wing aircraft flight around the world between February 28, 2005 and March 3, 2005. He took off from Salina, Kansas, where he was assisted by faculty members and students from Kansas State University, and flew eastbound, with the prevailing winds, returning to Salina after 67 hours, 1 minute, 10 seconds, without refueling or making intermediate landings. His average speed of 342.2 mph (550.7&nbsp;km/h) was also the absolute world record for "speed around the world, nonstop and non-refueled." His aircraft, the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer, had a carbon fiber reinforced plastic airframe, with a single Williams FJ44 turbofan engine. It was designed and built by Burt Rutan and his company, Scaled Composites, for long-distance solo flight. The fuel fraction, the weight of the fuel divided by the weight of the aircraft at take-off, was 83 percent.Fossett sets record for longest nonstop flight February 11, 2006[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4316599.stm "Fossett sets solo flight record"] - BBC News article dated March 3, 2005[http://www.cnn.com/2005/TECH/03/03/globalflyer.fossett/ "Fossett makes history"] - CNN.com article dated March 4, 2005On February 11, 2006, Fossett set the absolute world record for "distance without landing" by flying from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, around the world eastbound, then upon returning to Florida continuing across the Atlantic a second time to land in Bournemouth, England. The official distance was 25,766 statute miles (41,467&nbsp;km) and the duration was 76 hours 43 minutes.The next month, Fossett made a third flight around the world in order to break the absolute record for "Distance over a closed circuit without landing" (with takeoff and landing at the same airport). He took off from Salina, Kansas on March 14, 2006 and returned on March 17, 2006 after flying 25,262 statute miles (40,655&nbsp;km).There are only seven absolute world records for fixed-wing aircraft recognized by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale and Fossett broke three of them in the Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer.Current Absolute General Aviation World Records All three records were previously held by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager from their flight in the Voyager in 1986. Fossett has contributed the GlobalFlyer to the Smithsonian Institution’s permanent collection.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is on display at the [[Udvar-Hazy Center]] of the Smithsonian’s [[National Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;si_globalflyer_permanent_display&quot;&gt; Fossett flew the plane to the Center and taxied the plane to the front door.Transcontinental aircraft recordsFossett set two U.S. transcontinental fixed-wing aircraft records in the same day. On February 5, 2003, he flew his Cessna Citation X jet from San Diego, California to Charleston, South Carolina in 2 hours, 56 minutes, 20 seconds, at an average speed of 726.83 mph (1169.73&nbsp;km/h) to smash the transcontinental record for non-supersonic jets.He returned to San Diego, then flew the same course as co-pilot for fellow adventurer Joe Ritchie in Ritchie's turboprop Piaggio Avanti. Their time was 3 hours, 51 minutes, 52 seconds, an average speed of 546.44 mph (879.46&nbsp;km/h), which broke the previous turboprop transcontinental record held by Chuck Yeager and Renald Davenport.Fossett also set the east-to-west transcontinental record for non-supersonic fixed-wing aircraft on September 17, 2000. He flew from Jacksonville, Florida to San Diego, California in 3 hours, 29 minutes, at an average speed of 591.96 mph (952.67&nbsp;km/h).First trans-Atlantic flight re-enactmentOn July 2, 2005, Fossett and co-pilot Mark Rebholz re-created the first nonstop crossing of the Atlantic which was made by the British team of John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown in June 1919 in a Vickers Vimy biplane. Their flight from St. John’s, Newfoundland, Canada to Clifden, Ireland in the open cockpit Vickers Vimy replica took 18 hours 25 minutes with 13 hours flown in instrument flight conditions. Because there was no airport in Clifden, Fossett and Rebholz landed on the 8th fairway of the Connemarra Golf Course.Glider recordsThe team of Steve Fossett and Terry Delore (NZL) set ten official world records in gliders while flying in three major locations: New Zealand, Argentina and Nevada, United States. An asterisk (*) indicates records subsequently broken by other pilots.Distance (Free) World Record 2192.9&nbsp;km, December 4, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;Triangle Distance (Free) World Record* 1509.7&nbsp;km, December 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;Out and Return Distance (Free) World Record* 2002.44&nbsp;km, November 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;1500 Kilometer Triangle World Record 119.11&nbsp;km/h (74.02 mph), December 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;1250 Kilometer Triangle U.S. National Record 143.48&nbsp;km/h (89.51 mph).

The flight set the Absolute Altitude Record for gliders at 50,727 feet (15,460 m).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the glider cockpit was unpressurized, the pilots wore full [[pressure suit]]s (similar to space suits) so that they would be able to fly to altitudes above 45,000 feet.  Fossett and Enevoldson had made previous attempts in three countries over a period of five years before finally succeeding with this record flight. This endeavor is known as the [[Perlan Project]].Cross-country skiingAs a young adventurer, Fossett was one of the first participants in the Worldloppet, a series of cross country ski marathons around the world. While he had little experience as a skier, he was in the first group of 'citizen athletes' to participate in the series debut in 1979. And in 1980, he became the eighth skier to complete all 10 of the long distance races, earning a Worldloppet medallion. He has also set cross-country skiing records in Colorado, setting an Aspen to Vail record of 59 hr, 53 min, 30 sec in February 1998, and an Aspen to Eagle record of 12 hr, 29 min in February 2001.Mountain climbingFossett was a lifelong mountain climber and had climbed the highest peaks on six of the seven continents. In the 1980s, he became friends with Patrick Morrow, who was attempting to climb the highest peaks on all seven continents for the "Seven Summits" world record (which Morrow did achieve in 1985). Fossett accompanied Morrow for his last three peaks, including Vinson Massif in Antarctica, Carstensz Pyramid in Oceania, and Elbrus in Europe. While Fossett went on to climb almost all of the Seven Summits peaks himself, he declined to climb Mount Everest in 1992 due to asthma. He also later returned to Antarctica to climb again.Other accomplishmentsFossett competed in and completed premier endurance sports events, including the 1,165 mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, in which he finished 47th on his second try in 1992 after training for five years. He became the 270th person to swim across the English Channel on his fourth try in September 1985 with a time of 22 hours, 15 minutes. Although Fossett said he was not a good enough swimmer "to make the varsity swim team", he found that he could swim for long periods. Fossett has run in the Ironman Triathlon in Hawaii (finishing in 1996 in 15:53:10),  the Boston Marathon, and the Leadville Trail 100, a 100-mile Colorado ultramarathon which involves running up elevations of more than 14,000 feet in the Rocky Mountains.Fossett had raced cars in the mid-1970s and later returned to the sport in the 1990s. He competed in the 24 hours of Le Mans road race twice, in 1993 and in 1996, along with the Paris to Dakar Rally.Previous attempts at recordsFossett tried six times over seven years for the first solo balloon circumnavigation. His fifth attempt cost him $1.25 million of his own money; his sixth and successful attempt was commercially sponsored. Two of the attempts were launched from Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis, and Washington University in St. Louis served as control center for four of the six flights, including the record-breaking one.In 1998, one of the unsuccessful attempts at the ballooning record ended with a five-mile plummet into the Coral Sea off the coast of Australia that nearly killed Fossett; he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbseveningnews&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The first attempt began in the Black Hills of [[South Dakota]] and ended in [[New Brunswick]] 1800 miles later. The second attempt, launched from Busch Stadium, cost $300,000 and lasted 9,600 miles before being downed halfway in a tree in [[India]]; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight (with Fossett doubling his own previous record) and was called ''Solo Spirit'' after Lindbergh's ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;stlpostdispatch&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stanfordalumni&quot;/&gt; Fossett slept an average of two hours a night for the six-day journey, conducted in below-zero temperatures.  After taking too much fuel to cross the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and circling [[Libya]] for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight.  That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an un-pressurized capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanfordalumni&quot;/&gt;  The ''Solo Spirit'' capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum across from the ''[[Apollo 11]]'' command module.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanfordalumni&quot;/&gt;After making an unscheduled landing in a plane, Fossett once walked 30 miles for help.ScoutingFossett earned the Eagle Scout award as a youth member of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), and in later years, he was described as a "legend" by fellow Scouts. As a national BSA volunteer, he served as Chairman of the Northern Tier High Adventure Committee, member of the Philmont Ranch Committee, and member of the National Advisory Council. He later became a member of the BSA National Executive Board, and in 2007, Fossett succeeded Secretary of Defense Robert Gates as president of the National Eagle Scout Association. Fossett previously had served on the World Scout Committee.Fossett was honored with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 1992. In 1999, he received the Silver Buffalo award, BSA's highest recognition of service to youth.Awards and honorsIn 2002, Fossett received aviation's highest award, the Gold Medal of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) and in July 2007, he was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame. He was presented at the ceremony by Dick Rutan.In 1997, Fossett was inducted into the Balloon and Airship Hall of Fame. In February 2002, Fossett was named America's Rolex Yachtsman of the Year by the American Sailing Association at the New York Yacht Club. He was the oldest recipient of the award in its 41-year history, and he was the only recipient to fly himself to the ceremony in his own plane.He received the Explorers Medal from the Explorers Club following his solo balloon circumnavigation. He was given the Diplôme de Montgolfier by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale in 1996. He received the Harmon Trophy, given annually "to the world's outstanding aviator and aeronaut", in 1998 and 2002. He received the Grande Médaille of the Aéro Club de France, and the British Royal Aero Club's Gold Medal in 2002. He received the Order of Magellan and the French Republic's Médaille de l'Aéronautique in 2003.The Scaled Composites White Knight Two VMS Spirit of Steve Fossett, was named in Fossett's honor by his friend Richard Branson, in 2007.. Following his disappearance, Peggy Fossett and Dick Rutan accepted the Spread Wings Award in Steve Fossett's behalf at the 2007 Spreading Wings Gala, Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum, Denver, Colorado.[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5738392,00.html Rocky Mountain News: Missing aviator Steve Fossett honored at Wings Over Rockies] by Tillie Fong, November 3, 2007.

 At 8:45 am, on Monday, September 3, 2007, Fossett took off in a single-engine Bellanca Super Decathlon airplane from a private airstrip known as Flying-M Ranch (), near Smith Valley, Nevada, 30 miles south of Yerington, near Carson City and the California border. The airfield is owned by Barron Hilton and is the site of the biennial Barron Hilton Cup invitational soaring encampment.The search for Fossett began about six hours later. The aircraft had tail number N240R registered to the "Flying M Hunting Club, Inc." There was no signal from the plane's emergency locator transmitter (ELT) designed to be automatically activated in the event of a crash, but it was of an older type notorious for failing to operate after a crash. It was first thought that Fossett may have also been wearing a Swiss-made Breitling Emergency watch with a manually operated ELT that had a range of up to 90 miles, but no signal was received from it, and on September 13, Fossett's wife, Peggy, issued a statement clarifying that he owns such a watch, but was not wearing it when he took off for the Labor Day flight.Fossett took off with enough fuel for four to five hours of flight, according to Civil Air Patrol spokesperson Maj. Cynthia S. Ryan. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spokesperson noted that Fossett apparently did not file a flight plan, and was not required to do so.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;  On the second day, teams of ten aircraft searched but found no trace of wreckage after scouring a large area of rugged terrain. Kansascity.com, Adventurer’s routine flight disappears into a mystery By the fourth day, the Civil Air Patrol was using fourteen aircraft in the search effort, including one equipped with the ARCHER system that could automatically scan detailed imaging for a given signature of the missing aircraft. By September 10, search crews had found eight previously uncharted crash sites, some of which are decades old, but none related to Fossett's disappearance. |title= Aviator's Fate Puzzles Search Crews |accessdate = 2007-09-08 |author= Gerdner, Tom|date= 2007-09-08|format= |work= |publisher=Associated Press|quote=In their quest to find missing aviator Steve Fossett, searchers have come across eight uncharted plane crash wreckage sites.

Richard Branson, Fossett's British billionaire friend, said he and others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the high-resolution pictures might include Fossett's aircraft.On September 8, the first of a series of new high-resolution imagery from DigitalGlobe was made available via the Amazon Mechanical Turk beta website so that users could flag potential areas of interest for searching, in what is known as crowdsourcing. By September 11, up to 50,000 people had joined the effort, scrutinizing more than 300,000 278-foot-square squares of the imagery. Peter Cohen of Amazon believed that by September 11, the entire search area had been covered at least once. Amazon's search effort was shut down the week of October 29, without any measurable success.50,000 Volunteers Join Distributed Search For Steve Fossett, Wired News, By Steve Friess, September 11, 2007, 2:00 p.m. Online Fossett Searchers Ask, Was It Worth It?, Wired.com, Steve Friess, 11/6/2007 5:00 PMOn September 12, survival experts hosted by news organizations CNN and MSNBC reported that Fossett was likely to be dead. http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/09/12/fossett.search.ap/index.html  "Steve Fossett likely dead, survival experts say", http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20732023/ On September 17, the Nevada Wing of the Civil Air Patrol reported that they were suspending all flights in connection with their search operations,Check-Six.com - Missing - Steve Fossett but National Guard search flights, private search flights and ground searches continued.Search for aviator scaled back - CNN.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) began a preliminary investigation into the likely crash of the plane that Fossett was flying.NTSB Preliminary Report - SEA07FAMS2 - on the loss of N240R The preliminary report originally stated that Fossett was "presumed fatally injured and the aircraft substantially damaged", but was subsequently revised to remove that assumption.

Discovery of wreckageOn September 29, 2008, a hiker found three crumpled identification cards in the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range in California at coordinates , about  south-southeast of Fossett's take-off site. The items were confirmed as belonging to Fossett, and included an FAA-issued card and about ten $100 bills. The following day, the same hiker found a pullover fleece near the same location. According to Fox News, the garment had both human and animal hair on it.On October 1, late in the day, air search teams spotted wreckage on the ground within about  of where the personal items were found. Later that evening the teams confirmed identification of the tail number of Fossett's plane. Jeff Page, emergency management coordinator for Lyon County, Nevada, said, "It was a hard-impact crash, and he would've died instantly." The crash site is in the Ansel Adams Wilderness and in Madera County, California. Other named places near the crash site include Minaret Lake ( west-southwest), the Minaret peaks ( west), and the town of Mammoth Lakes (the nearest populated place, less than  east). news.bostonherald, Search party to investigate possible wreckage of Steve Fossett’s planefresnobee.com, Remains found at Fossett crash siteOver the next two days, ground searchers found four bone fragments, including one that was  by  in size that the NTSB believed to be human remains.

Into thin air: Did Steve Fossett fake his own death? - Americas, World - The Independent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Neither of the articles reported the existence of tangible evidence that would support such speculation.Search and rescue costsOn May 1, 2008, the Las Vegas Review-Journal attributed to Nevada State Governor Jim Gibbons's spokesman, Ben Kieckhefer, the Governor's decision to direct the state to charge the family of the late Steve Fossett for the $687,000 expense of the search for Fossett and his ostensible plane wreck. Kieckhefer later played that early report down, when he told the Tahoe Daily Tribune that Nevada did not intend to demand an involuntary payment from Fossett's widow, but that such a payment would be voluntary: "We are going to request that they help offset some of these expenses, considering the scope of the search, the overall cost as well as our ongoing budget difficulties."  Hotelier Barron Hilton, from whose ranch Fossett had departed on the day he went missing, had previously volunteered $200,000 to help pay for the search costs. The Associated Press carried both reports.In his later comments to the Tahoe Daily Tribune, Kieckhefer denied outright that a bill for the family was being prepared, and he said, "It will probably be in the form of a letter," which Kieckhefer indicated would include a financial outline of the steps taken by the state, the associated costs, and a mention of the state's ongoing budget difficulties.Days prior to this announcement, state Emergency Management Director Frank Siracusa noted that "there is no precedent where government will go after people for costs just because they have money to pay for it. You get lost, and we look for you. It is a service your taxpayer dollars pay for,"  although he conceded that legally any decision would rest with Gibbons. At an April 10, 2008 Legislature's Interim Finance Committee hearing, Siracusa indicated that he had hired an independent auditor to review costs incurred by the state in searching for Fossett, but added, "We are doing an audit but not because we are critical of anybody or suspect something was done wrong".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlycharge_report"/ Chairman Morse Arberry queried Siracusa as to why, since they lacked funds, had the state not billed the Fossett family for its search costs, to which Siracusa did not directly respond. In his later interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, he stated that his comments to the Committee may have given the false impression that he had hired an auditor for the purpose of later challenging the state's financial burden incurred on its behalf by the National Guard during the search operation. Upon interview regarding reports that the state would seek payment, Arberry was recorded as stating that he was glad to hear steps were being taken to try to recoup some of the costs.The Nevada search cost $1.6 million, for Silver State, "the largest search and rescue effort ever conducted for a person within the U.S." Jim Gibbons asked Fossett's estate to shoulder $487,000 but it declined, saying Fossett's wife had already spent $1 million on private searching.ReferencesFurther readingExternal linksOfficial websiteLinks to QuickTime videos, including a virtual tour inside the GlobalFlyerObituary from The Economist, February 21, 2008New attempts by adventure athletes to search territory previous searches could not coverTimeline: Steve FossettIn pictures: Steve FossettBBC, Profile: Steve FossettWeather radar loop for September 3, 2007 around Fresno, California, including the crash site.
