During the Ottoman rule (16th-18th centuries), Inđija was mostly populated by ethnic Serbs, and was part of the Ottoman sanjak of Syrmia.Since 1717, Inđija was part of the Habsburg Monarchy, and became a feudal domain of Count Marko Pejačević of the Pejacsevich family from Chiprovtsi, Bulgaria. The old medieval Inđija was placed a little bit to the north than today town. The present-day Inđija was founded by the Serb settlers in 1746. According to the description from 1746 it had 60 households, while in 1791 it has already grown to 122 households with 1,054 residents. In the second half of the 18th century, this new settlement was mostly populated by ethnic Serbs.
