  Teos (Greek: Τέως) or Teo,) was a maritime city of Ionia, on a peninsula between Chytrium and Myonnesus, colonized by Orchomenian Minyans, Ionians, and Boeotians. It was the birthplace of Anacreon the poet, Hecateus the historian, Protagoras the sophist, Scythinus the poet, Andron the geographer, and Apellicon, the preserver of the works of Aristotle.Teos was a flourishing sea-port with two fine harbours until Cyrus the Great invaded Lydia and Ionia (ca. 540 BC). The Teans found it prudent to retire overseas, to the newly founded colonies of Abdera in Thrace and Phanagoria on the Asian side of the Cimmerian Bosporus.Having lost its former importance, Teos ranked among twelve cities comprising the Ionian League. The port was revived by Antigonus Cyclops; and Epicurus reportedly studied there under a disciple of Democritus. During the times of the Roman emperors, the town was noted for its wine and the temple of Dionysus. The modern city of Sığacık is situated close to the ruins of Teos.Vitruvius (vii, introduction) notes Hermogenes of Priene as the architect of the monopteral temple for Father Bacchus at Teos.External linksThe Archaeological Investigations At TeosCategory:Ionian League Category:Ancient Greek sites in Turkeyca:Teos de:Teos el:Τέω es:Teos (ciudad) fr:Téos (ville) nl:Teos no:Teos pl:Teos ru:Теос fi:Teos (kaupunki) ro:Teos
