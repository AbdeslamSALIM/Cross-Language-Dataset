His first club hit was "Gym Tonic", which was co-produced by Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk, featuring vocals illegally taken from a Jane Fonda fitness tape. The Bob Sinclar persona was based on a character from Philippe de Broca's film Le Magnifique.Le Friant is famous for popularising the &quot;French touch&quot; of house music, with heavy use of sampled and filtered disco strings. His track "I Feel For You", a tribute to French musician Cerrone, from his second album Champs Elysées, hit #9 in the UK Top 40. On track "Darlin'", he worked with vocalist James &quot;D-Train&quot; Williams.Le Friant has also worked under other pseudonyms. Under the aliases The Mighty Bop and Reminiscence Quartet, he has dabbled in hip-hop and acid jazz. He also created the Africanism project, where an ensemble of artists produce house music with a combination of Latin, jazz, African and tribal flavours.In 2005 he scored a hit with the single "Love Generation", that reached #1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Charts and the German Media Control Single Charts in 2006. The song was a huge success throughout Europe, also peaking at no. 2 in the Dutch Top 40 and it stood 39 weeks in the Ultratop 50 in Belgium. It also became one of the official anthems for the World Cup 2006 held in Germany. The follow-up hit was "World, Hold On", that features Steve Edwards and also managed to chart in the top ten in most of the European countries. "Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)" followed on 22 August 2006.The remix of "World, Hold on" by E-Smoove was nominated for a Grammy 2007 in the category Remixed Recording. Also, "World, Hold On" topped in Billboard Magazine as Number One Hot Dance Club Play Single of 2006, beating Madonna and Christina Aguilera. The fourth single of the album Western Dream, called "Tennessee" was supposed to be released in April 2007, but has been canceled due to the rumour of a new album being released.His latest album is Soundz of Freedom. It came out in France on 21 May 2007. The remix of "Rock This Party" reached number 1 in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play Charts.DiscographySinglesas The Mighty Bop1994 "Les Jazz Electroniques EP"1995 "Messe Pour Les Temps"1996 "Ult Violett Sounds EP"1998 "Feelin' Good"2002 "I Go Crazy"2003 "Lady", with Duncan Royas Africanism2000 "Bisou Sucré"2000 "Do It", with Eddie Amador2001 "Kazet"2002 "Viel Ou La"2004 "Amour Kéfé"2004 "Kalimbo"2004 "Steel Storm", with Ladysmith Black Mambazo2005 "Summer Moon", with David Guetta2006 "Hard", with The Hard Boys2007 "Meu Carnaval", with Rolando Fariaas Bob Sinclar''most tracks are co-produced by Cutee B1996 "A Space Funk Project"1996 "A Space Funk Project II"1997 "Eu Só Quero um Xodó", with Salomé de Bahia1998 "Gym Tonic", with Thomas Bangalter1998 "My Only Love", with Lee Genesis #56 UK1998 "Super Funky Brake's Vol. I"1998 "The Ghetto"1998 "Ultimate Funk2000 "I Feel For You", with Cerrone's Angels #9 UK, #33 ITA2000 "Darlin'", with James &quot;D-Train&quot; Williams #46 UK2000 "Greetings From Champs Elysées EP" #125 UK2001 "Freedom" , with Gene Van Buren #79 UK2001 "Ich Rocke"2001 "Save Our Soul"2002 "The Beat Goes On", with Linda Lee Hopkins #33 UK2003 "Kiss My Eyes", with Camille Lefort #67 UK, #22 US HotDanceMusic/ClubPlay.2003 "Prego", with Eddie Amador2003 "Slave Nation"2004 "Sexy Dancer", with Cerrone's Angels2004 "Wonderful World", with Ron Carroll2004 "You Could Be My Lover", with Linda Lee Hopkins2005 "Love Generation", with Gary Pine — #2 (http://home.planet.nl/~laar2337/apc2/index.htm)EURO 200 #2 (NL), #3 FR, #3 ITA, #1 AUS, #1 GER, #12 UK, #8 RU, #1 CZ, #1 US Hot Dance Club Play Singles, #11 US Hot Dance Airplay.2006 "Generación Del Amor" (Spanish Version) — #1 ESP2006 "World, Hold On (Children of the Sky)", with Steve Edwards — #5 (NL), #2 FR, #8 CZ #1 ESP, #19 AUS, #9 UK, #4 RU, #1 US Hot Dance Club Play Singles, #10 US Hot Dance Airplay, #48 US Pop Airplay2006 "Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)", with Dollarman and Big Ali — #3 FR, #11 CZ, #3 UK, #7 AUS, #2 US Hot Dance Club Play.2007 "Tennessee", with Farell Lennon #21 ITA, #27 CZ2007 "Everybody Movin'", with Ron Carroll — #3 GER, #1 ESP2007 "Give A Lil' Love" — #10 ITA , #19 PL, #27 ESP2007 "Sound of Freedom", with Gary Pine and Dollarman — #14 UK, #1 UK Indie, #24 CZ2007 "What I Want", with Fireball #52 UK2007 "Together", with Steve Edwards - #63 PL, #4 ROM2008 "W.W.W.
