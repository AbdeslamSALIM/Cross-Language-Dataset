She is best known for her portrayal of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in the film Monster, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress.Acting careerAt the age of 16, Theron traveled to Milan, Italy, on a one-year modeling contract, after winning a local competition. She went to New York with Pauline's Model Management. She decided to remain after her contract ended, attending the Joffrey Ballet School, where she trained as a ballet dancer. A knee injury closed this career path when Theron was 19.Unable to dance, Theron flew to Los Angeles on a one-way ticket her mother bought her. During her early months there, she went to a bank to cash a check her mother had sent her to help with the rent. When the teller refused to cash it, Theron immediately started into a shouting match with her. Afterwards, a talent agent in line behind her handed her his business card and subsequently introduced her to some casting agents and also an acting school. She later fired him as her manager after he kept sending her scripts for films similar to Showgirls and Species, which would have traded solely on her appearance.After eight months in the city, she was cast in her first film part, a non-speaking role in the direct-to-video film Children of the Corn III (1995). Larger roles in widely released Hollywood films followed, and her career skyrocketed in the late 1990s with box office successes like The Devil's Advocate (1997), Mighty Joe Young (1998), and The Cider House Rules (1999).After appearing in a few notable films, Theron starred as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster (2003). Film critic Roger Ebert called it "one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema". For this role, Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress at the 76th Academy Awards in February 2004, as well as the SAG Award and the Golden Globe Award. She is the first South African to win an Oscar for Best Actress. The Oscar win pushed her to The Hollywood Reporter's 2006 list of highest-paid actresses in Hollywood; earning $10,000,000 for both her subsequent films, North Country and Æon Flux, she ranked seventh, behind Halle Berry, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Renée Zellweger, Reese Witherspoon, and Nicole Kidman.On September 30, 2005, Theron received her own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In the same year, she starred in the financially unsuccessful science fiction thriller Æon Flux, IMDB Business Data. Additionally, Theron received Best Actress Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for her lead performance in the drama North Country.

Theron's first language is Afrikaans; she is fluent in English and speaks some Xhosa. "Theron" is an Occitan surname (originally spelled Théron) pronounced in Afrikaans as "Tronn", although she has said that she prefers the pronunciation "Thrown". Aclasscelebs.com interviewTheron grew up on her parents' farm near Johannesburg (Benoni). She attended Putfontein Primary School (Laerskool Putfontein). At the age of 13, Theron was sent to boarding school and began her studies at the National School Of The Arts in Johannesburg. At 15, Theron witnessed the death of her father, an abusive alcoholic; Gerda shot him in self-defense when he attacked her. The police pressed no charges against her.From January 1998 to July 2001, Theron dated the lead singer of Third Eye Blind, Stephan Jenkins. Jenkins ended the relationship after failing to take her marriage requests seriously. Theron resides in Los Angeles, in the home of late 1930s actress Helen Twelvetrees, with her long-time boyfriend Stuart Townsend, with whom she starred in the 2004 film Head in the Clouds, as well as in the 2002 film Trapped and uncredited 2005 Æon Flux. She, like Sarah Silverman, and Brad Pitt, has said that she will not marry until same-sex couples are able to have their marriages recognized. Townsend recently stated he considers himself and Theron to be husband and wife. "We didn't have a ceremony," he said. "I don't need a certificate or the state or the church to say otherwise. So no there's no big official story on a wedding, but we are married... I consider her my wife and she considers me her husband".While filming Æon Flux in Berlin, Germany, Theron had suffered a herniated disc in her neck, which occurred as a result of her suffering a fall while filming a series of back handsprings. This required her to wear a neck collar for a month.Theron became a naturalized citizen of the United States in May 2007.ReferencesExternal links    Category:American film actors Category:South African actors Category:South African film actors Category:South African female models Category:Best Actress Academy Award winners Category:Best Drama Actress Golden Globe (film) winners Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Afrikaner people Category:People from Gauteng Province Category:German-Americans Category:South Africans of German descent Category:South Africans of Huguenot descent Category:White South Africans Category:South African-Americans Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:South African immigrants to the United States Category:South African expatriates in the United Statesaf:Charlize Theron ar:تشارليز ثيرون bs:Charlize Theron bg:Шарлиз Терон cs:Charlize Theronová da:Charlize Theron de:Charlize Theron et:Charlize Theron es:Charlize Theron eo:Charlize Theron eu:Charlize Theron fa:شارلیز ترون fr:Charlize Theron hr:Charlize Theron id:Charlize Theron it:Charlize Theron he:שרליז ת'רון sw:Charlize Theron lv:Šarlīze Terona hu:Charlize Theron mr:चार्लीझ थेरॉन nl:Charlize Theron ja:シャーリーズ・セロン no:Charlize Theron pl:Charlize Theron pt:Charlize Theron ro:Charlize Theron ru:Терон, Шарлиз sq:Charlize Theron simple:Charlize Theron sk:Charlize Theronová sl:Charlize Theron sr:Шарлиз Терон fi:Charlize Theron sv:Charlize Theron th:ชาร์ลิซ เธอรอน vi:Charlize Theron tg:Шарлийз Терон tr:Charlize Theron uk:Шарліз Терон zh:查理兹·塞隆
