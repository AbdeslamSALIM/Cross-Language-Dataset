Princess Isabel did not think much of the idea, which was completely dismissed in 1889, when Brazil became a Republic, with laws mandating the separation of church and state. The group organised an event called Semana do Monumento ("Monument Week") to attract donations and collect signatures to support the building of the statue. The donations came mostly from Brazilian Catholics. The designs considered for the "Statue of the Christ" included a representation of the Christian cross, a statue of Jesus with a globe in his hands, and a pedestal symbolizing the world. The statue of Christ the Redeemer with open arms was chosen.in background.]] Local engineer Heitor da Silva Costa designed the statue; it was sculpted by Paul Landowski, a French monument sculptor of Polish origin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Largest christ&quot; /&gt; A group of engineers and technicians studied Landowski's submissions and the decision was made to build the structure out of [[reinforced concrete]] (designed by [[Albert Caquot]]) instead of [[steel]], more suitable for the [[cross]]-shaped statue.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Dia&quot; /&gt; The outer layers are [[soapstone]], chosen for its enduring qualities and ease of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel Channel&quot; /&gt;  Construction took nine years, from 1922 to 1931.

The statue was meant to be lit by a battery of floodlights triggered remotely by shortwave radio pioneer [[Guglielmo Marconi]], stationed  away in the Bay of Naples, but poor weather affected the signal and had to be lit by workers in Rio.&lt;ref name=&quot;O Dia&quot; /&gt;The statue was struck by lightning during a violent electrical storm on Sunday, February 10, 2008. The storm caused havoc in Rio, felling trees in several neighbourhoods, but the statue was left unscathed due to soapstone, the material forming the outer layers of the statue, being an insulator.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sun (2)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Recognitions and honorsIn October 2006, on the statue's 75th anniversary, Archbishop of Rio of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World in a list compiled by the Swiss-based The New Open World Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brazil]] there was a campaign ''Vote no Cristo'' (Vote for the Christ) which had the support of private companies.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, leading corporate sponsors including [[Banco Bradesco]] and [[Rede Globo]] spent &quot;millions&quot; of dollars in the effort to have the statue voted into the top seven.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;See alsoChrist_of_Vung_Tau in Vietnam (32 m)Cristo-Rei in Portugal.
