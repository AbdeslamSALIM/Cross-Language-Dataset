Another common name for many species of this genus is Sweet Coltsfoot.The short spikes of flowers are produced just before the leaves in spring, emerging with only a few elongated basal bracts and are usually green, flesh coloured or dull white depending on species.Butterburs are found in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. They prefer moist environments such as riverbanks, marshes and ditches.Petasites is very closely related to the genus Tussilago (Coltsfoot), and also related to the huge genus Senecio.Medicinal usesButterbur was used by native Americans as a remedy for headache and inflammation.
