  Harrods is a department store located on Brompton Road in Knightsbridge, London, England. The Harrods brand also applies to other enterprises undertaken by the Harrods group of companies including Harrods Bank, Harrods Estates, Harrods Aviation and Air Harrods.The store occupies a  site and has over one million square feet of selling space in over 330 departments. This makes Harrods the largest department store in the world (the UK's second-biggest store, Oxford Street's Selfridges is a little over half the size with Hot Shops: Retail Revamps&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; of selling space).The Harrods motto is Omnia Omnibus Ubique —- All Things for All People, Everywhere. Several of its departments, including the seasonal Christmas department and the Food Hall are world famous.BackgroundHarrods was established in 1834 in London’s East End, when founder Charles Henry Harrod set up a wholesale grocery in Stepney,http://www.harrods.com/HarrodsStore/GlobalPages/HarrodsHistory.aspx www.harrods.com (history)  with a special interest in tea. In 1849, to escape the filth of the inner city and to capitalise on trade to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in nearby Hyde Park, Harrod took over a small shop in the district of Knightsbridge, on the site of the current store. Beginning in a single room employing two assistants and a messenger boy, Harrod’s son Charles Digby Harrod built the business into a thriving retail operation selling medicines, perfumes, stationery, fruit, and vegetables. Harrods rapidly expanded, acquired the adjoining buildings, and employed one hundred people by 1880.However, the store’s booming fortunes were reversed in early December 1883, when it burnt to the ground.http://www.harrods.com/HarrodsStore/GlobalPages/HarrodsHistory.aspx www.harrods.com (history) Remarkably, in view of this calamity, Charles Harrod fulfilled all of his commitments to his customers to make Christmas deliveries that year — and made a record profit in the process. In short order, a new building was raised on the same site, and soon Harrods extended credit for the first time to its best customers, among them Oscar Wilde, legendary actresses Lilly Langtry and Ellen Terry, Noël Coward, Sigmund Freud, A. A. Milne, and many members of the British royal family.In 1898, Harrods installed the world's first moving staircase (escalator); nervous customers were offered brandy at the top to revive them after their 'ordeal'.http://www.harrods.com/HarrodsStore/GlobalPages/HarrodsHistory.aspx?Id=5ce8d7d8-acb6-4d31-ba01-8e2a6d6bdc4a Harrods history (escalator)Significant events in Harrods history1834: Charles Henry Harrod (1799-1885) founds a wholesale grocery in Stepney, East London1849: Harrods moves to the Knightsbridge area of London, near Hyde Park1861: Harrods undergoes a transformation when it was taken over by Harrod's son, Charles Digby Harrod (1841-1905)1883: On December 6, fire guts the shop buildings, giving the family the opportunity to rebuild on a grander scale1889: Charles Digby Harrod retires, and Harrods shares are floated on the London Stock Exchange under the name Harrod's Stores Limited1905: Begun in 1894, the present building is completed to the design of architect Charles William Stephens.Trevor Square Area - The Estate since 1909 | British History Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;1912: Harrods opens its first and only foreign branch in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
