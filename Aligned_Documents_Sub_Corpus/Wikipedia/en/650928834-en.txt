Flag Ratio: 1:2]] Dolphin Flag of the Republic of Anguilla, 1967-1980]]  The national flag of Anguilla consists of a Blue Ensign with the British flag in the canton, charged with the coat of arms of Anguilla in the fly. The coat of arms consists of three dolphins, which were featured on the earlier Anguillan flag, and which stand for friendship, wisdom and strength.The flag is Anguilla's third flag other than as part of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. The island's first flag was a red blue flag featuring the name of the island in yellow and two mermaids. Variants to this flag were also widely used, with some substituting red for purple and some not bearing the name of Anguilla. This flag was widely disliked, and was replaced during Anguilla's brief period of independence by the Dolphin Flag, which is still widely seen around the island. This flag was a banner of the arms found on the current flag, and was white with a broad blue band across the base of the flag, above which were three stylised golden dolphins. It was adopted in 1990.External links  Category:National symbols of Anguilla Anguilla Anguillabs:Zastava Angvile cs:Anguillská vlajka cy:Baner Anguilla de:Flagge Anguillas et:Anguilla lipp el:Σημαία της Ανγκουίλας es:Bandera de Anguila fr:Drapeau d'Anguilla hr:Zastava Angvile id:Bendera Anguilla he:דגל אנגווילה lt:Angilijos vėliava hu:Anguilla zászlaja nl:Vlag van Anguilla no:Anguillas flagg pl:Flaga Anguilli pt:Bandeira de Anguilla ro:Drapelul Anguillei ru:Флаг Ангильи sq:Flamuri i Anguillas sk:Vlajka Anguilly sr:Застава Ангвиле sh:Zastava Angvile sv:Anguillas flagga th:ธงชาติแองกวิลลา zh:安圭拉旗幟
