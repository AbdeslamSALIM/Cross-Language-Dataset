Only if controlling these devices is open to all via free software, can we balance power equally.Moglen's Metaphorical Corollary to Faraday's Law is the idea that the information appearance and flow between the human minds connected via the Internet works like induction. Hence Moglen's phrase "Resist the resistance!" (i.e. remove anything that inhibits the flow of information).Freeing The Mind: Free Software and the Death of Proprietary CultureStatements and perspectives , 2006]] While speaking in New Delhi, India, in 2006, he remarked: "Anything that is worth copying is worth sharing." His other quotes: "The more we give away, the richer we become." And: "Note how even the smallest encounter with Free Software can make a man cheerful about the future of our judge" (said after hearing a judge of the Allahabad high court, India speak on the subject).Moglen believes the idea of proprietary software is as ludicrous as having "proprietary mathematics" or "proprietary geometry". This would convert the subjects from "something you can learn" into "something you must buy", he has argued. He points out that software is among the "things which can be copied infinitely over and over again, without any further costs".Moglen has criticized what he calls the "reification of selfishness". He has said, "A world full of computers which you can't understand, can't fix and can't use (because it is controlled by inaccessible proprietary software) is a world controlled by machines."He has called on lawyers to help the Free Software movement, saying: "Those who want to share their code can make products and share their work without additional legal risks." He urged his legal colleagues, "It's worth giving up a little in order to produce a sounder ecology for all. Think kindly about the idea of sharing."Moglen has criticized trends which result in "excluding people from knowledge". On the issue of Free Software versus proprietary software, he has argued that "much has been said by the few who stand to lose". Moglen calls for a "sensible respect for both the creators and users" of software code.On the subject of Digital Rights Management, Moglen once said, "We also live in a world in which the right to tinker is under some very substantial threat. This is said to be because movie and record companies must eat. I will concede that they must eat. Though, like me, they should eat less."Keynote speech at Red Hat Summit 2006ReferencesExternal linksmore links can be found on wikiquote    Eben Moglen's webpage at Columbia UniversityFreedom Now &mdash; Moglen's rarely used blogFraming the Debate: Free Expression versus Intellectual Property, the Next Fifty Years - February 2007The dotCommunist Manifesto - January 2003 PDFAnarchism Triumphant: Free Software and the Death of Copyright - August 1999 PDF‘A lawyer who is also idealist - how refreshing’, March 30, 2006 interview in The Guardian.The dotCommunist Manifesto: Video of talk at UNC-Chapel Hill, Howard W.
