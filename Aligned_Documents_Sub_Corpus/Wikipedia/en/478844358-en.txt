Montélimar (Latin name: Acumum and Montelaimar in occitan) is a commune in the Drôme department in southeastern France. It is the second largest town in the department after Valence.The site where the city of Montélimar stands today has been inhabited since the Celtic era. It was reconstructed during the Roman reign, including a basilica, aqueducts, thermae and a forum. The Adhémar family reigned over the city in the Middle Ages and built a castle (Château des Adhémar) which dominates the city silhouette even today.It was the birthplace of the French navigator Louis de Freycinet and the hometown of Émile Loubet, President of France from 1899 till 1906, who worked also as the mayor of Montélimar.Montélimar is widely regarded as the world capital of nougat. The local nougat is one of the 13 desserts of Provence and highly appreciated throughout the country. Travellers used to buy nougat de Montélimar on their way to the south of France (or when returning) as the city is next to the Rhône river and to the primary route N7. Since the construction of the A7 autoroute, many nougat factories have been forced to close as tourists no longer stop in Montélimar but bypass it instead.Montélimar is known in its region for its famous aire (service station) which unlike typical rest-stops offers accommodation, restaurants and such leisure activities as fencing and scuba diving. On occasion, visitors passing the aire have been known to put up tents and stay for several days.Sister cities/towns — Aberdare, Wales — Managua, Nicaragua — Racine, USA — Ravensburg, GermanyReferencesBased on the article in the French Wikipedia.External linksOfficial website Montelimarca:Montelaimar ceb:Montélimar de:Montélimar es:Montélimar fr:Montélimar it:Montélimar la:Acumum nl:Montélimar oc:Montelaimar pl:Montélimar pt:Montélimar ro:Montélimar sl:Montélimar sv:Montélimar vo:Montélimar
