8100]]A smartphone is a mobile phone offering advanced capabilities beyond a typical mobile phone, often with PC-like functionality. There is no industry standard definition of a smartphone.[http://www.wi-fiplanet.com/news/article.php/3551686 Smartphones Take Center Stage at Wi-fi Planet][http://networks.silicon.com/mobile/0,39024665,39156391,00.htm Analysis: What is a smart phone? at Silicon.com] For some, a smartphone is a phone that runs complete operating system software providing a standardized interface and platform for application developers.Birdnest Glossary[http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-iphone-is-not-a-smartphone/ The iPhone is not a smartphone at Engadget] For others, a smartphone is simply a phone with advanced features like e-mail and Internet capabilities, and/or a full keyboard.CEVA Glossary of Termshttp://www.mytelus.com/ncp_news/article.en.do?pn=tech&amp;articleID=2973940&lt;/ref&gt;DefinitionThere is no agreement in the industry about what a smartphone actually is and definitions have changed over time. According to David Wood, EVP at Symbian, "Smart phones differ from ordinary mobile phones in two fundamental ways: how they are built and what they can do."[http://networks.silicon.com/mobile/0,39024665,39156391,00.htm ibid] Other definitions put different stresses on these two factors.Most devices considered smartphones today use an identifiable and open operating system, often with the ability to add applications (e.g. for enhanced data processing, connectivity or entertainment) - in contrast to regular phones which only support sandboxed applications (like Java games). These smartphone applications may be developed by the manufacturer of the device, by the network operator or by any other third-party software developer, since the operating system is open..In terms of features, most smartphones support full featured email capabilities with the functionality of a complete personal organizer. Other functionality might include an additional interface such as a miniature QWERTY keyboard, a touch screen or a D-pad, a built-in camera, contact management, an accelerometer, built-in navigation hardware and software, the ability to read business documents in a variety of formats such as PDF and Microsoft Office, media software for playing music, browsing photos and viewing video clips, internet browsers or even just secure access to company mail, such as is provided by a BlackBerry. One common feature to the majority of the smartphones is a contact list able to store as many contacts as the available memory permits, in contrast to regular phones that has a limit to the maximum number of contacts that can be stored.History]]  8GB]]The first smartphone was called Simon designed by IBM in 1992 and shown as a concept product that year at COMDEX, the computer industry trade show held in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was released to the public in 1993 and sold by BellSouth. Besides being a mobile phone, it also contained a calendar, address book, world clock, calculator, note pad, e-mail, send and receive fax, and games. It had no physical buttons to dial with. Instead customers used a touch-screen to select phone numbers with a finger or create facsimiles and memos with an optional stylus. Text was entered with a unique on-screen "predictive" keyboard. By today's standards, the Simon would be a fairly low-end smartphone.The Nokia Communicator line was the first of Nokia's smartphones starting with the Nokia 9000, released in 1996. This distinctive palmtop computer style smartphone was the result of a collaborative effort of an early successful and expensive PDA model by Hewlett Packard combined with Nokia's bestselling phone around that time and early prototype models had the two devices fixed via a hinge; the Nokia 9210 as the first color screen Communicator model which was the first true smartphone with an open operating system; the 9500 Communicator that was also Nokia's first cameraphone Communicator and Nokia's first WiFi phone; the 9300 Communicator was the third dimensional shift into a smaller form factor; and the latest E90 Communicator includes GPS. The Nokia Communicator model is remarkable also having been the most expensive phone model sold by a major brand for almost the full lifespan of the model series, easily 20% and sometimes 40% more expensive than the next most expensive smartphone by any major manufacturer.The Ericsson R380 was sold as a 'smartphone' but could not run native third-party applications.Ericsson R380 Although the Nokia 9210 was arguably the first true smartphone with an open operating system, Nokia continued to refer to it as a Communicator.In 2001 RIM released the first BlackBerry which was the first smartphone optimized for wireless email use and has achieved a total customer base of 8 million subscribers by June 2007, of which three quarters are in North America.Although the Nokia 7650, announced in 2001, was referred to as a 'smart phone' in the media, and is now called a 'smartphone' on the Nokia support site, the press release referred to it as an 'imaging phone'.Nokia Support SiteNokia 7650Imaging Phone Handspring delivered the first widely popular smartphone devices in the US market by marrying its Palm OS based Visor PDA together with a piggybacked GSM phone module. By 2002, Handspring was marketing an integrated package called the Treo; the company was subsequently bought by Palm primarily because the PDA market was dying but the Treo smartphone was quickly becoming popular as a phone with extended PDA organizer features. That same year, Microsoft announced its Windows CE Pocket PC OS would be offered as "Microsoft Windows Powered Smartphone 2002".Windows Powered Smartphone Microsoft originally defined its Windows Smartphone products as lacking a touchscreen and offering a lower screen resolution compared to its sibling Pocket PC devices. Palm has since largely abandoned its own Palm OS in favor of licensing Microsoft's WinCE-based operating system now referred to as Windows Mobile, although WinCE and Palm OS together now amount to 10% of the smartphone market.In 2005 Nokia launched its N-Series of 3G smartphones which Nokia started to market not as mobile phones but as multimedia computers.Out of 1 billion camera phones to be shipped in 2008, smartphones, the higher end of the market with full email support, will represent about 10% of the market or about 100 million units.The Smartphone Summit semi-annual conference details smartphone industry market data, trends, and updates among smartphone related hardware, software, and accessories.Android, a cross platform OS for smartphones is scheduled for official release on October 22, 2008.Operating systems]]The most common operating systems (OS) used in smartphones are:Symbian OS from Symbian Ltd. (57.1% Market Share Sales Q2 2008 http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=754112&lt;/ref&gt;)Symbian has the largest share in most markets worldwide, but lags behind other companies in the relatively small but highly visible North American market.North American Market This matches the success of its largest shareholderSymbian Shareholders and customer, Nokia, in all markets except Japan. Nokia itself enjoys 52.9% of the smartphone market. In Japan Symbian is strong due to a relationship with NTT DoCoMo, with only one of the 44 Symbian handsets released in Japan coming from Nokia.Symbian Facts It is used by many major handset manufacturers, including BenQ, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and Sony Ericsson.Symbian Licensees Various implementations of user interfaces on top of Symbian (most notable being UIQ and Nokia's own S60) are incompatible, which along with the requirement that applications running on mobile phones be signed Symbian Signed is hindering the potential for a truly widely accepted mobile application platform. It has received some adverse press attention due to virus threats (actually trojan horses).Trojan Horses on SymbianRIM BlackBerry operating system (17.4% Market Share Sales Q2 2008)This OS is focused on easy operation and was originally designed for business. Recently it has seen a surge in third-party applications and has been improved to offer full multimedia support.Windows Mobile from Microsoft (12.0% Market Share Sales Q2 2008)Windows CE operating system along with Windows Mobile middleware are widely spread in Asia. The two improved variants of this operating system, Windows Mobile 6 Professional (for touch screen devices) and Windows Mobile 6 Standard were unveiled in February 2007. Windows Mobile is enjoying great popularity because of the low barrier to entry for third-party developers to write new applications for the platform.Linux operating system (7.3% Market Share Sales Q2 2008)Linux is strongest in China where it is used by Motorola, and in Japan, used by DoCoMo.[http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3904 Shipping Linux-based Phones at Technology News Daily][http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/26/microsoft_excluded_from_docomo/ Microsoft Excluded from DoCoMo at The Register] Rather than being a platform in its own right, Linux is used as a basis for a number of different platforms developed by several vendors, including Motorola and TrollTech, which are mostly incompatible.[http://www.osnews.com/story.php/15040/Editorial-The-Chaos-of-Incompatibility-in-Mobile-Linux Incompatibility in Mobile Linux at OS News]Search Mobile Computing PalmSource (now Access) is moving towards an interface running on Linux.Running on Linux Another platform based on Linux is being developed by Motorola, NEC, NTT DoCoMo, Panasonic, Samsung, and Vodafone.Motorola Press Release on Partnership on Linux PlatformiPhone OS from Apple Inc. (2.8% Market Share Sales Q2 2008)The iPhone (and iPod touch) use an operating system called iPhone OS, which is derived from Mac OS X. Third party applications were originally only made available for iPhone users through a web service that can be accessed via the included web browser; however, with the release of iPhone OS 2.0 on July 11th 2008, native applications are now available and can be downloaded through the iTunes App Store.Palm OS developed by PalmSource (now a subsidiary of ACCESS) (2.3% Market Share Sales Q2 2008)PalmSource traditionally used its own platform developed by Palm Inc. Access Linux Platform (ALP) is an improvement that was planned to be launched in the first half of 2007. It will use technical specifications from the Linux Phone Standards Forum. The Access Linux Platform will include an emulation layer to support applications developed for Palm-based devices.Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW):BREW was developed in the USA by Qualcomm, Inc and is popular in North America.
