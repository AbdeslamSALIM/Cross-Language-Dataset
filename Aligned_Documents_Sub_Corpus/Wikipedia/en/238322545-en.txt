Most of the mammillarias are native to Mexico, but some come from the southwest USA, the Caribbean, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala and Honduras.The first was described by Carolus Linnaeus as Cactus mammillaris in 1753, deriving name from Latin mammilla, "nipple", referring to the tubercles that are one of the plant's specific features. In 1812, the cactus specialist Adrian Haworth described the genus Mammillaria to contain this and related species. Numerous species are commonly known as nipple cactus, fishhook cactus or pincushion though such terms may also be used for related taxa, namely EscobariaMammillarias have extremely variable spination from species to species, and attractive flowers, making them specifically attractive for cactus hobbyists. Most mammillarias plants are considered easy to cultivate, though some species are among the hardest cacti to grow. Several taxa are threatened with extinction at least in the wild, due to habitat destruction and especially overcollecting for the pot plant trade. Cactus fanciers can assist conservation of these rare plants by choosing nursery-bred specimens (wild-collected ones are illegal to possess for the rarest species anyways). Besides helping to preserve rare plants, one can gain experience in growing and breeding cacti in general with nursery-bred rare mammillarias: several mammillarias are quite easy (for cacti) to grow from seeds. One such species, popular and widely available from nursery stock but Endangered in the wild, is Mammillaria zeilmanniana.Description[[Image:Mammillaria celsiana.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Diversity of mammillarias. Mammillaria celsiana in the middle.]] The distinctive feature of the genus is the specific development of an areole, that is split into two clearly separated parts, one occurring at the tubercle's apex, the other at its base. The apex part is spine bearing, and the base part is always spineless, but usually bearing some bristles or wool. The base part of the areole bears the flowers and fruits, and is a branching point. The apex part of the areole does not carry flowers, but in certain conditions can function as a branching point as well.The plants are usually small, globose to elongated, the stems from 1 cm to 20 cm in diameter and from 1 cm to 40 cm tall, clearly tuberculate, solitary to clumping forming mounds of up to 100 heads and possess radial symmetry. Tubercles can be conical, cylindrical, pyramidal or round. The roots are fibrous, fleshy or tuberous. The flowers are funnel-shaped and range from 7 mm to 40 mm and more in length and in diameter, from white and greenish to yellow, pink and red in color, often with a darker mid-stripe; the reddish hues are due to betalain pigments as usual for Caryophyllales. The fruit is berry-like, club-shaped or elongated, usually red but sometimes white, yellow or green. Some species have the fruit embedded into the plant body. The seeds are black or brown, from 1 to 3 mm in size.SystematicsThe large and diverse genus Mammillaria has seen multiple attempts to subdivide the species in it into smaller groups within the genus or attempts to split it to multiple genera for better understanding of the plants' relationship. Early classifications were performed by Pfeiffer (1837), Salm-Dick (1845) and Engelmann (1856). The genus Mammillaria included members of some modern genera like Coryphantha and Ariocarpus at that time. Classifications by Schumann (1898), Britton and Rose (1923), Berger (1929) Buxbaum (1951-56) and Moran (1953) followed, splitting the genus in parts and combining it back together again.Later classification was performed by the cactus specialists Hunt, Reppenhagen and Luthy, with a lot of work focusing on searching the meanings and value of the original plant descriptions, synchronizing them with modern taxonomic requirements and studying the morphology of plants and seeds, as well as ecological aspects of the genus. These works helped to expand the understanding of Mammillaria taxa.Currently the classification of Mammillaria is in a state where few newly discovered species are likely, though some new species may yet be found when the chaos of names created earlier by commercial plant collectors is sorted out. Many names that were introduced for plants barely differentiated by a shade of flower color or variation in spination were eliminated in attempt to make the use of names consistent with the rest of the botanical world. The number of taxa, at one time way over 500, is now is below 200. Some genera (Dolichothele, Mammillopsis, Krainzia and others) have been merged back into Mammillaria, and others like Coryphantha, Escobaria and Mammilloydia were confirmed as separate.Intense studies of DNA of the genus are being conducted, with preliminary results published for over a hundred taxa, and this promising approach might soon end the arguments. Based on DNA research results, the genus does not seem to be monophyletic and is likely to be split into two large genera, one of them possibly including certain species of other closely related genera like Coryphantha, Ortegocactus and Neolloydia.Selected speciesAs noted above, some might not belong into this genus.
