Located about 80 kilometers north of Venice, Belluno is the capital of the province of Belluno and the most important city in the Dolomiti's region. With its roughly 35,000 inhabitants, it the largest populated area of Valbelluna. It is one of the 15 municipalities of the National Park of the Dolomites of Belluno.GeographyThe ancient city of Belluno rises above a cliff spur near the confluence of the Torrente Ardo and the Piave River. To the north is the imposing Schiara range of the Dolomites, with the famous Gusela del Vescovà (Bishop's needle), and Mounts Serva and Talvena rising above the city. To the south, the foothills of the Alps separate Belluno from the Venetian plain. Further to the south is the Nevegal, in the Castionese area, well-known for its skiing resorts. The average annual temperature in Belluno is 9°C (49°F), and the average annual precipitation is 137&nbsp;cm (54 inches).Pope Gregory XVI was born at Belluno on 18 Sept 1765HistoryThe name of the city is derived from celtic belo-dunum which means "splendid hill". The name was inspired by the favorable position within the valley.The city was founded around 220-200 BC by the Romans and, starting from 181 BC, it became an important military stronghold in the Roman Venetia. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by the Lombards (6th century) and the Carolingians (8th century); from the late 9th century it was ruled by a count-bishop and it received a castle and a line of walls. Later it was a possession of the Ghibelline family of the Ezzelino. After having longly contended the nearby territory with Treviso, in the end Belluno gave itself to the Republic of Venice (1404). The city was thenceforth an important hub for the transport of lumber from the Cadore through the Piave river.After the fall of the Republic, Belluno was an Austrian possession, until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.Main sightsThe Duomo (Cathedral, late 15th century), with the 18th century bell tower designed by Filippo Juvarra.
