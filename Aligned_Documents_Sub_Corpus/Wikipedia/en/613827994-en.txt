Human Rights Watch is a United States-based international non-governmental organization that conducts research and advocacy on human rights. Its headquarters are in New York City.HistoryHuman Rights Watch was founded under the name Helsinki Watch in 1978 to monitor the former Soviet Union's compliance with the Helsinki Accords. As the organization grew, it formed other "watch committees" to cover other regions of the world. In 1988, all of the committees were united under one umbrella to form Human Rights Watch. Robert L. Bernstein was a president of the organization and is one of the original founders.ProfilePursuant to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch opposes violations of basic human rights, which include capital punishment and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Human Rights Watch advocates freedoms in connection with fundamental human rights, such as freedom of religion and the press.Human Rights Watch produces research reports on violations of international human rights norms as set out by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and what it perceives to be other internationally-accepted human rights norms. These reports are used as the basis for drawing international attention to abuses and pressuring governments and international organizations to reform. Researchers conduct fact-finding missions to investigate suspect situations and generate coverage in local and international media. Issues raised by Human Rights Watch in its reports include social and gender discrimination, torture, military use of children, political corruption, abuses in criminal justice systems, and the legalization of abortion. Human Rights Watch documents and reports violations of the laws of war and international humanitarian law.Human Rights Watch also supports writers worldwide who are being persecuted for their work and are in need of financial assistance. The Hellman/Hammett grants are financed by the estate of the playwright Lillian Hellman in funds set up in her name and that of her long-time companion, the novelist Dashiell Hammett. In addition to providing financial assistance, the Hellman/Hammett grants help raise international awareness of activists who are being silenced for speaking out in defence of human rights.Hellman-Hammett Grants,Human Rights WatchEach year, Human Rights Watch presents the Human Rights Defenders Award to activists around the world who demonstrate leadership and courage in defending human rights. The award winners work closely with Human Rights Watch in investigating and exposing human rights abuses.http://hrw.org/events/2007/dinner/index.htm,Human Rights WatchHuman Rights Watch was one of six international NGOs that founded the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 1998.

The Canary Islands government, which runs the facilities, replied in a statementHuman Rights Watch says migrant children are at risk in Canary Islands,International Herald Tribune that the report lacked "rigor" and that "an internal investigation had failed to corroborate" Human Rights Watch's findings.PublicationsHuman Rights Watch publishes reports on several topicsPublications,Human Rights Watch and compiles annual reports ("World Report") presenting an overview of the worldwide state of human rights.Human Rights Watch has published extensively on the Rwandan Genocide of 1994Rwandan genocide report,Human Rights Watch and the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.Congo report,Human Rights WatchComparison with Amnesty InternationalHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International are the only two, western orientated, international human rights organizations operating worldwide in most situations of severe oppression or abuse. Though close allies, the two groups play complementary roles, reflecting a division of labour. The major differences lie in the groups’ structure and methods for promoting change.Amnesty International is a mass-membership organization. Mobilization of those members is the organization's central advocacy tool. Human Rights Watch's main products are its crisis-directed research and lengthy reports, whereas Amnesty lobbies and writes detailed reports, but also focuses on mass letter-writing campaigns, adopting individuals as "prisoners of conscience" and lobbying for their release. Human Rights Watch will openly lobby for specific actions for other governments to take against human rights offenders, including naming specific individuals for arrest, or for sanctions to be levied against certain countries, recently calling for punitive sanctions against the top leaders in Sudan who have overseen a killing campaign in Darfur.Its documentations of human rights abuses often include extensive analyses of the political and historical backgrounds of the conflicts concerned, some of which have been published in academic journals. AI's reports, on the other hand, tend to contain less analysis, and instead focus on specific abuses of rights.CriticismsHuman Rights Watch has been criticized for perceived anti-Western, anti-China, and anti-Israel bias while others have criticized it for having a pro-Western and pro-Israel bias. According to a report in the Egyptian press, "the government often accuses human rights groups Human Rights Watch of importing a Western agenda that offends local religious and cultural values."Not just the Queen Boat: HRW is asking the Egyptian government to stop persecuting homosexuals and commit to reform. Given the referenced roots of the organisation; to be orientated towards monitoring Soviet activities on the West's behalf, it is always open to criticism of continuation of this agenda with a pro-western bias. This is further compounded by its US location and dominant US managerial base.See alsoAmnesty InternationalDemocracy Watch (International)Freedom HouseHelsinki Committee for Human RightsHuman rightsInternational Freedom of Expression ExchangeUS Human Rights NetworkAmerican Freedom CampaignReferences  External linksHuman Rights Watch (official website)Human Rights Watch World Report 2007Human Rights Watch World Report 2006Press info on Human Rights Watch World Report 20062008 Report: Democracy Charade Undermines RightsEdward S.
