 Giresun is a province of Turkey on the Black Sea coast. Its adjacent provinces are Trabzon to the east, Gümüşhane to the south-west, Erzincan to the south, Sivas to the south-east, and Ordu to the west. The provincial capital is Giresun.GeographyGiresun is an agricultural region of great natural beauty, especially in the highlands. The lower areas near the Black Sea coast are Turkey's largest producer of hazelnuts, indeed a Giresun folk song tells "I will not eat a single hazelnut, unless you are by my side" bir fındığın içini yar senden ayrı yemem , while another tells of a lover shot dead under a hazelnut tree Giresun'un içinde yeşil fındık tarlası vurdular feride'mi yere düştü bohçası  The higher mountain areas are forest and pasture and in places there is mining of copper, zinc, iron and other metals. The mountain villages are remote, with poor roads and little else in the way of infrastructure. And the hillsides are too steep for agriculture also, so for example cornbread is the traditional meal, as they cannot grow wheat. Life here is hard and in the past many people have left to find jobs in Turkey's larger cities or abroad.The climate is typical of this stretch of the Black Sea coast i.e. very wet. Local flora includes bilberries (Turkish "taflan").DistrictsGiresun province is divided into 16 districts (capital district in bold): AlucraBulancakÇamolukÇanakçıDereliDoğankentEspiyeEynesilGiresunGöreleGüceKeşapPirazizŞebinkarahisarTireboluYağlıdereCultureHandcraftsDue to the dense in Giresun, woodwork is among the common handcrafts in the region.
