Poledouris was raised in the church, and used to sit in services, enthralled with the choir's sound.Rhodes, S. Mark. "A Sprig of Basil: The Musical Mastery of Basil Poledouris." Film Score Monthly, Volume 9, Number 4, 2004. At age 7 he began piano lessons, and eventually enrolled at the University of Southern California to study both film and music. Several short films to which he contributed still reside in the university's archives. At USC he met directors John Milius and Randal Kleiser, with both of whom the composer would later collaborate. In 1985, he scored Flesh &amp; Blood for director Paul Verhoeven, again establishing another ongoing collaboration.Poledouris became renowned for his powerfully epic style of orchestral composition and his intricate thematic designs, and garnered attention for his scores to The Blue Lagoon (1980; dir: Kleiser), Conan the Barbarian (1982; dir: Milius), Conan the Destroyer (1984), Red Dawn (1984; dir: Milius), RoboCop (1987; dir: Verhoeven), The Hunt for Red October (1990), Free Willy (1993) and its sequels, ''Starship Troopers'' (1997; dir: Verhoeven) and ''For Love of the Game'' (1999).His studio, Blowtorch Flats, is located in Venice, CA and is a professional mixing facility specializing in film and media production.Poledouris married his wife, Bobbie, in 1969 and had two daughters, Zoë and Alexis. The elder, Zoë Poledouris, is an actress and film composer who occasionally collaborated with her father composing film soundtracks.  His score for Conan the Barbarian is considered by many to be one of the finest examples of motion picture scoring ever written.Corn, Adam.
