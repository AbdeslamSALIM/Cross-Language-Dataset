The town of La Laguna, being the capital of the island during the first times after the Conquest, adopted this emblem as its own. It features an island with a volcano spitting fire, on waves, between a castle and a lion, and above the Archangel Saint Michael, holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other. In the border, the inscription Michael Arcangele Veni in Adjutorium Populo Dei Thenerife Me Fecit. These elements symbolize the incorporation of the island of Tenerife to the Crown of Castile and its evangelization under the patronage of Saint Michael.SubdivisionsLa VerdelladaViña NavaEl CoromotoSan BenitoEl BroncoLa CuestaTacoTejinaValleguerraBajamarPunta del HidalgoGenetoLos BaldiosGuamasaEl OrtigalLas MercedesEl BatanLas CarbonerasSan DiegoLas GaviasHistoryThe city was founded between 1496 and 1497 by Alonso Fernández de Lugo and was the capital of the island after the conclusion of the conquest of the islands.
