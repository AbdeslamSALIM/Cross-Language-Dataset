It was discovered in 1980 from photos taken by the Voyager 1 probe, and was provisionally designated .[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/03500/03532.html IAUC 3532: Satellites of Saturn] 1980 October 31 (discovery) In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology.[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/04100/04157.html IAUC 4157: Satellites of Saturn and Pluto] 1986 January 3 (naming the moon) It is also designated as .&lt;/ref&gt;Pandora is the outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 km in diameter.NASA JPL Solar System Exploration: Saturn: Moons: PandoraThe orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a mean motion resonance with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 km. Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is a lot of uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.Gallery Image:Pandora moon.jpg|''Voyager 2'' image of Pandora.
