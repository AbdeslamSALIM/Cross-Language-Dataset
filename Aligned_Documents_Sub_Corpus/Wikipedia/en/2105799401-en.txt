  , sunk in 1628]]  A lock is a mechanical fastening device which may be used on a door, vehicle, or container, restricting access to the area or property enclosed. Commonly, it can be released by using a key or combination.History of locksSecuring one's property has long been a concern of people throughout the world. Beyond hiding the objects or constantly guarding them the most frequently used option is to secure them with a device. Early solutions included knots to either detect, like the Thief knot, or hamper, like the Gordian knot.Wooden locks and keys were in use as early as 4,000 years ago in Egypt http://www.locks.ru/germ/informat/schlagehistory.htm. The first known lock with a key is a pin lock. The lock is strung on a rope hanging out of a hole in a door. A cylinder of wood with a hole drilled through its axis is the key, the length of the cylinder being the critical factor. Then the key is inserted into the hole and the bolt is pushed the correct distance. To lock the door,they just pulled on the rope to extract the key cylinder and simultaneously pulling the bolt closed. This type of lock is still in use in certain parts of the world. A danger of this lock is a vandal can push the rope into the hole — an ancient equivalent of putting glue into a lock.Early improvements in pin locks included increasing the number of pins to increase security, and changing the orientation of the pins to allow the key to provide the unlocking force instead of a rope. Thus establishing the principles of the modern pin tumbler lock.Next was developed a warded lock that is still used in modern times when the security required is not high and cost is a significant factor. It is the first lock design to have a key recognizable to a modern western person. Lock puzzles were used to obscure the locking mechanism or even provide a nonfunctioning lock for the thief to waste time on.Famous locksmithsAl-Jazari described the first combination lock in 1309Robert Barrion patented a double-acting tumbler lock in 1778, the first reasonable improvement in lock security.* Joseph Bramah patented the safety lock in 1784.

They may be operated by turning some form of removable key, by keying or dialing in a combination which directly or via electromechanical means operates the lock, with some form of magnetic or other card reader, or by moving a part on a safety lock intended to prevent accidental operation rather than to prevent unauthorised access.5 Lever LockBicycle lockCam lockChild safety lockCombination lockCruciform (or Zeiss) lockCylinder lockDeadboltDisc tumbler lockElectronic lockElectric strikeMagnetic lockKeycard lockLever tumbler lockChubb detector lockProtector lockMagnetic keyed lockPadlockPin tumbler lockRim lockTubular pin tumbler lockTime lockTurner lockWafer tumbler lockWarded lockSecurity door locksSee alsoLock pickingLocksmithingPhysical securityBored cylindrical lock and Mortice lock, two different approaches to locking mechanismsExternal linksHistory of Locks from the Chubb websiteLocksmithing Throughout the AgesThe History of LocksGeneral InformationWest Coast Lock Collectors AssociationAmerican Lock Collectors AssociationFurther readingPhillips, Bill.
