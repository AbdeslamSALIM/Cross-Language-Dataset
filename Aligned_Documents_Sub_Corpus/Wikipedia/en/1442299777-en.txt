Brassica oleracea or Wild Mustard, is a species of Brassica native to coastal southern and western Europe, where its tolerance of salt and lime but intolerance of competition from other plants typically restricts its natural occurrence to limestone sea cliffs.Wild B. olearacea is a tall biennial plant, forming a stout rosette of large leaves in the first year, the leaves being fleshier and thicker than those of other species of Brassica, adaptations to store water and nutrients in its difficult growing environment. In its second year, the stored nutrients are used to produce a flower spike 1&ndash;2&nbsp;m tall bearing numerous yellow flowers.Cultivation and usesAlthough B. oleracea is believed to have been cultivated for several thousand years, its history as a domesticated plant is not clear before Greek and Roman times, when it is known to have been a well-established garden vegetable. Theophrastus mentions three kinds of this species: a curly-leaved, a smooth-leaved, and a wild-type.Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, Domestication of plants in the Old World, third edition (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 199. It has been bred into a wide range of cultivars, including cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, and more, some of which are hardly recognisable as being members of the same genus. The historical genus of crucifera, meaning four-petalled flower, may be the only uniting feature beyond taste. It has become established as an important human food crop plants. According to the Triangle of U theory, B. oleracea is very closely related to five other species of the genus Brassica.The plant is used because of its large food reserves, which are stored over the winter in its leaves. It is rich in essential nutrients including vitamin C.The cultivars of B. oleracea are grouped by developmental form into seven major cultivar groups, of which the Acephala Group remains most like the natural Wild Cabbage in appearance:Brassica oleracea Acephala Group - kale and collard greensBrassica oleracea Alboglabra Group- chinese broccoliBrassica oleracea Botrytis Group - cauliflower, Romanesco broccoli and broccoflowerBrassica oleracea Capitata Group - cabbageBrassica oleracea Gemmifera Group - brussels sproutsBrassica oleracea Gongylodes Group - kohlrabiBrassica oleracea Italica Group - broccoliSome (notably brussels sprouts and broccoli) contain high levels of sinigrin which may help prevent bowel cancer.For other edible plants in the family Brassicaceae, see cruciferous vegetables.[[Image:brassica-garden.jpg|600px|thumb|center|Several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, including Kale, Brussels sprouts, Savoy, and Chinese kale]]ReferencesExternal links[http://database.prota.org/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;BU=http%3A%2F%2Fdatabase.prota.org%2Fsearch.htm&amp;TN=PROTAB~1&amp;QB0=AND&amp;QF0=Species+Code&amp;QI0=Brassica+oleracea+Brussels+sprouts&amp;RF=Webdisplay PROTAbase on Brassica oleracea (Brussels sprouts)][http://database.prota.org/dbtw-wpd/exec/dbtwpub.dll?AC=QBE_QUERY&amp;BU=http%3A%2F%2Fdatabase.prota.org%2Fsearch.htm&amp;TN=PROTAB~1&amp;QB0=AND&amp;QF0=Species+Code&amp;QI0=Brassica+oleracea+cauliflower+and+broccoli&amp;RF=Webdisplay PROTAbase on Brassica oleracea (cauliflower and broccoli)]I Heart Kale: Food blog devoted to kale and other seasonal produceCategory:Brassicazh-min-nan:Brassica oleracea ca:Col cs:Brukev zelná da:Have-Kål de:Gemüsekohl es:Brassica oleracea fr:Chou commun ko:브라시카 올레라케아 hr:Kupus id:Brassica oleracea os:Къабуска it:Brassica oleracea ht:Chou la:Brassica oleracea lv:Dārza kāposts lt:Kopūstas hu:Brassica oleracea nl:Kool (plant) ja:ハボタン nap:Brassica oleracea pl:Kapusta warzywna pt:Couve qu:Kulis ru:Капуста белокочанная sk:Kapusta obyčajná sr:Дивљи купус fi:Kaali sv:Kål (art) vi:Cải bắp dại wa:Cabu zh:甘藍
