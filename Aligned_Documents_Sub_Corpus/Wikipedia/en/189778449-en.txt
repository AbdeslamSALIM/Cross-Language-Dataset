It is often the highest point of the Tour de France.It connects Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne and Briançon via the col du Télégraphe and the Col du Lautaret. The pass is closed during the winter. It is located between the massif d'Arvan-Villards and the massif des Cerces, taking its name from the secondary chain of mountains known as the Galibier.Before 1976, the tunnel was the only point of passage at the top, at an altitude of 2556 m. The tunnel was closed for restoration until 2002, and a new road was constructed over the summit. The re-opened tunnel is a single lane controlled by traffic lights which, at 2400 m., must be amongst the highest in Europe.Details of the climbFrom the north, starting at Saint-Michel-de-Maurienne (including the Col du Télégraphe), the climb is 34.8 km long, gaining 2120 m. in height (an average of 6.1%). The actual climb to the summit starts at Valloire and is 18.1 km long at an average of 6.9% (height gain: 1245 m). The maximum gradient is 10.1% at the summit.From the south, the climb starts from the Col du Lautaret (el. 2058 m.) and is 8.5 km long at an average gradient of 6.9% (height gain: 585 m) with a maximum of 12.1% at the summit.The Tour de FranceThe Col du Galibier was first used in the Tour de France in 1911; the first rider over the summit was Emile Georget, who, with Paul Duboc and Gustave Garrigou were the only riders not to walk..The original summit was at 2556 m. but with the closing of the tunnel in 1976, the tour route now goes over the pass closer to the mountain peak at 2645 m.At the south portal of the tunnel, at the edge of the road, there is a monument to Henri Desgrange, instigator and first director of the Tour de France. The memorial was inaugurated when the tour passed on 19 July 1949. Whenever the tour crosses the Col du Galibier, a wreath is laid on the memorial. The "Souvenir Henri Desgrange" is awarded to the first rider across the summit of the highest mountain in each year's tour. In 2006, the prize of 5000 euros was claimed on the Col du Galibier by Michael Rasmussen.Since 1947, the Col de Galibier has been crossed 31 times by the Tour de France. It was scheduled to be used in 1996, but was left out at the last minute due to bad weather. As a result of snow on both the Col de l'Iseran and the Col du Galibier, the scheduled 190 km stage from Val-d'Isère to Sestriere in Italy was reduced to a 46 km sprint from Le-Monetier-les-Bains which was claimed by Bjarne Riis, resulting in him taking the yellow jersey which he retained to the finish in Paris.In the 2008 Tour, the Col du Galibier had been crossed on 23 July in the 210 km stage 17 from Embrun to Alpe d'Huez.Appearances in the Tour de France (since 1947)YearStageCategoryStartFinishLeader at the summit2008]]17]]HC]]Embrun]]Alpe d'HuezStefan Schumacher2007]]9HC]]Val-d'IsèreBriançonMauricio Soler2006]]16HC]]Le Bourg-d'OisansLa ToussuireMichael Rasmussen2005]]11HC]]CourchevelBriançonAlexandre Vinokourov2003]]8HC]]SallanchesAlpe d'HuezStefano Garzelli2002]]16HC]]Les Deux AlpesLa PlagneSantiago Botero2000]]15HC]]BriançonCourchevelPascal Hervé1999]]9HC]]Le Grand-BornandSestrièresJosé-Luis Arrieta1998]]15HC]]GrenobleLes Deux AlpesMarco Pantani1993]]10HC]]Villard-de-LansSerre-ChevalierTony Rominger1992]]14HC]]SestrièresAlpe d'HuezFranco Chioccioli1989]]17HC]]BriançonAlpe d'HuezGert-Jan Theunisse1987]]21HC]]Le Bourg-d'OisansLa PlagnePedro Muñoz1986]]18HC]]BriançonAlpe d'HuezLuis Herrera1984]]18HC]]Alpe d'HuezLa PlagneFrancisco Rodriguez1980]]17HC]]Serre-ChevalierMorzineJohan De Muynck1979]]17HC]]Les MenuiresAlpe d'HuezLucien Van Impe1974]]111Aix-les-BainsSerre-ChevalierVicente Lopez-Carril1973]]81MoutiersLes OrresLuis Ocana1972]]14a1BriançonValloireJoop Zoetemelk1969]]101ChamonixBriançonEddy Merckx1967]]101Divonne-les-BainsBriançonJulio Jimenez1966]]161Le Bourg-d'OisansBriançonJulio Jimenez1964]]81Thonon-les-BainsBriançonFederico Bahamontes1959]]182GrenobleSt-Vincent]]-d'AosteCharly Gaul1957]]101Thonon-les-BainsBriançonMarcel Janssens1955]]81Thonon-les-BainsBriançonCharly Gaul1954]]191BriançonAix-les-BainsFederico Bahamontes1952]]111Le Bourg-d'OisansSestrièresFausto Coppi1948]]142BriançonAix-les-BainsLucien Teisseire1947]]81GrenobleBriançonFermo CamelliniSee alsoPrincipal passes of the AlpsDauphiné AlpsReferencesExternal linksNorth Side details on Tour de France dayProfile from Valloire on climbbybike.comProfile from Col du Lautaret on climbbybike.comRoute guide for climbing the Galibier by bicycleLe col du Galibier dans le Tour de France Col du Galibier cycling.
