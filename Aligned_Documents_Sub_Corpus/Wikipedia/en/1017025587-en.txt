Irish coffee () is a cocktail consisting of hot coffee, Irish whiskey, and sugar, stirred, and usually topped with thick cream. The coffee is drunk through the cream. The original recipe explicitly uses cream that has not been whipped, although whipped cream is often used. Irish coffee may be considered a variation on the hot toddy.OriginThe original Irish coffee was invented by Joseph Sheridan, a head chef at Foynes, County Limerick. Foynes' port was the precursor to Shannon International Airport in the west of Ireland; the coffee was conceived after a group of American passengers disembarked at the airport on a miserable winter evening in the 1940s. Sheridan decided to add some whiskey to the coffee to warm the passengers. After being asked if they were being served Brazilian coffee, Sheridan told the passengers that it was Irish coffeehttp://www.europeancuisines.com/Irish-Coffee.Stanton Delaplane, travel writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, claimed to have brought Irish coffee to the United States when he convinced the Buena Vista bar in San Francisco to start serving Irish coffee on November 10, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;However, since around or before that date the beverage has been served at Tom Bergin's Tavern in Los Angeles, where a large sign reading "House of Irish Coffee" has been in place since the early 1950s.Preparationcoffee]]Black coffee is poured into the mug;Whiskey and at least one level teaspoon of sugar is stirred in until fully dissolved. The sugar is essential for floating liquid cream on top.Thick cream is carefully poured over the back of a spoon initially held just above the surface of the coffee and gradually raised a little. The layer of cream will float on the coffee without mixing. The coffee is drunk through the layer of cream.VariationsWhipped cream rather than thick liquid cream is sometimes used, although contrary to the original recipe; it is easier to drop a dollop of whipped cream in or even spray it from a can than to float liquid cream, and it will float even if the coffee is made without sugar. The experience of drinking the coffee through the floating cream is lost.In Spain a "Café Irlandés" ("Irish Coffee") is sometimes served with a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on tophttp://www.gastronomiavasca.net/recipes/recipe?id=107. Special devices are sold for making Café Irlandés.Variants of Irish coffee are made, all essentially the same but with different names and using a different spirit. This list will never be hard and fast, as any bar can serve such a drink and call it by any name they choose.

In England this is also known as a Floater Coffee, and should ideally be served in an Irish coffee mug (see above).ReferencesSee alsoLiqueur coffeeStoutExternal linksThe Irish Coffee Story by The Buena Vista Cafe, San Francisco, CA Category:Irish cuisine Category:Cocktails with whiskey/whisky or bourbon Category:Coffeeca:Cafè irlandès de:Irish Coffee es:Café irlandés fr:Irish Coffee gl:Café irlandés ko:아이리시 커피 it:Irish coffee he:אייריש קופי nl:Irish coffee ja:アイリッシュ・コーヒー no:Irish coffee pl:Kawa po irlandzku pt:Irish coffee ru:Кофе по-ирландски fi:Irish coffee sv:Irish coffee th:กาแฟไอริช vi:Irish coffee
