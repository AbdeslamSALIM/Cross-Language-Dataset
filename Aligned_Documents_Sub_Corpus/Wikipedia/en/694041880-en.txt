He made his debut for the senior team on December 20, 2003 in the 1–0 victory over Toulouse FC. He impressed for the team as a hardworking midfield player playing 14 times for the club. However it was his performances in Marseille’s UEFA Cup campaign that brought him to the attention of the general football world, including the semi-final victory over Newcastle United. He played in the final in Gothenburg which Valencia won 2–0. Due to his age, Marseille was unable to offer him a long term professional contract.Arsenal2004–05 seasonOn July 23 2004, Flamini signed a professional contract for Arsenal, rejecting Marseille's long-term senior contract offer to which he had already verbally agreed to. Soon after the incident, Marseille manager José Anigo stated, "This is a beautiful treason. He used me."Flamini made his Arsenal début in the 4–1 win at Everton on August 15 2004. He was used as a utility player starting 9 games but being used as a substitute in 12. The following season saw him filling in for a number of injured players, but unable to command a first team place in his favoured position.2005–06 seasonWhile he is naturally a defensive midfielder, he has been used as a right winger. Due to injuries in Arsenal's back line, he has also operated in the left back position, after injuries to Ashley Cole, Gaël Clichy, Pascal Cygan, Lauren and Kerrea Gilbert . However, despite being right-footed, Flamini performed respectably during the remainder of Arsenal's Premiership and Champions League campaign. When Ashley Cole became fit again, though, he returned to the starting lineup. In May 2006 he came on as a 76th minute substitute in the Champions League Final which Arsenal lost to Barcelona in Paris.2006–07 seasonIn the 2006–07 season, Flamini scored the winner against Dinamo Zagreb in the qualifying stages of the Champions League. He also scored important goals against Chelsea, Blackburn Rovers, and Liverpool in the Premiership. However, despite these important goals, he remained unsatisfied with his "utility player" role at the club and in April 2007, he admitted that he would probably be leaving Arsenal by buying out the remaining year on his contract at the end of the current season. However, he reconsidered after a long talk with manager Arsène Wenger and remained with the team.2007–08 seasonFlamini started in central midfield for Arsenal's first match of the 2007–08 Premier League season, due to the absence of Gilberto Silva and Abou Diaby. During the start of Arsenal's 2007–08 campaign, he struck up a strong partnership with Cesc Fabregas, keeping the likes of Gilberto Silva out of the starting XI with displays widely regarded by Arsenal fans as a vast improvement on those during his previous years at the club. Flamini enjoys a generally good rapport with Arsenal's fans, who have provided him with his own song, an adaptation of the theme tune to British television programme The Sweeney. On January 29 2008, he scored an extraordinary  strike in Arsenal's 3–0 win over Newcastle United in the Premier League. He played his last official game on 8 April, 2008, a UEFA Champions League match in which Arsenal were knocked out by English rival Liverpool F.C.. After the match, it was reported he was injured. It proved to be his last match for Arsenal.MilanFlamini has signed a contract with A.C. Milan where he will be earning €5.6 million per season over a four year period. http://www.goal.com/en/Articolo.aspx?ContenutoId=682482.

Flamini made his Serie A debut on August 30, 2008 in a 2-1 loss to Bologna. http://www.serieatalk.com/bologna-ruin-ronaldinho-debut/254Playing styleFlamini's natural position is central midfielder, where he has formed a formidable partnership with Fabregas. His passing is also very consistent - he has attempted the 2nd most passes in the Premier League during the 2007–08 season. In addition, his tackling ability, stamina, and work rate have improved since moving to Arsenal. His impressive work rate is what really endeared him to the Arsenal fans. He was nicknamed "Fla-Tuso" in homage to A.C Milan's Gennaro Gattuso due to Flamini similar playing style. Ironically, Flamini will go on to play alongside Gattuso after signing for the Milan based club in the summer.International careerFlamini accepted his first call up to France by coach Raymond Domenech for a friendly against Argentina at the Stade de France on February 7 2007 after Jérémy Toulalan was ruled out due to injury.
