 The Actinopterygii (the plural form of Actinopterygius) comprise the class of the ray-finned fishes.The ray-finned fishes are so called because they possess lepidotrichia or "fin rays", their fins being webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ("rays"), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class Sarcopterygii. These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and pectoral girdles).In terms of numbers, actinopterygians are the dominant class of vertebrates, with nearly 30,000 species, and they are ubiquitous throughout fresh water and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Extant species can range in size from Paedocypris, at 7.9 mm (0.3 in), to the massive Ocean Sunfish, at 2,300 kg (5,100 lb), and the long-bodied Oarfish, to at least 11 m (36.5 feet).Fossil recordThe earliest known fossil Actinopterygiian is Andreolepis hedei, dating back 420 million years (Late Silurian). This microvertebrate has been uncovered in Russia, Sweden, and Estoniahttp://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=34968&amp;is_real_user=1.ClassificationTraditionally three grades of actinopterygians have been recognised: the Chondrostei, Holostei, and Teleostei. Some morphological evidence suggests that the second is paraphyletic and should be abandoned; however, recent work based on the analysis of DNA sequence data from the complete mitochondrial genome supports its recognition. Nearly all living bony fishes are teleosts.A listing of the different groups is given below, down to the level of orders, arranged in what has been suggested to represent the evolutionary sequence down to the level of order based primarily on the long history of morphological studies. This classification, like any other taxonomy based on phylogenetic research is in a state of flux. Many of these ordinal and higher-level groupings have not been supported in both the recent morphological and molecular literature. Examples of demonstrably paraphyletic or unnatural groups include the Paracanthopterygii, Scorpaeniformes, and Perciformes. The listing follows FishBase with notes when this differs from Nelson and ITIS.Subclass ChondrosteiOrder Polypteriformes, including the bichirs and reedfishes In Nelson, Polypteriformes is placed in its own subclass Cladistia.Order Acipenseriformes, including the sturgeons and paddlefishesSubclass NeopterygiiInfraclass HolosteiOrder Lepisosteiformes, the garsOrder Amiiformes, the bowfinsInfraclass TeleosteiSuperorder OsteoglossomorphaOrder Osteoglossiformes, the bony-tongued fishesOrder Hiodontiformes, including the mooneye and goldeyeSuperorder ElopomorphaOrder Elopiformes, including the ladyfishes and tarponOrder Albuliformes, the bonefishesOrder Notacanthiformes, including the halosaurs and spiny eelsOrder Anguilliformes, the true eels and gulpersOrder Saccopharyngiformes, including the gulper eelSuperorder ClupeomorphaOrder Clupeiformes, including herrings and anchoviesSuperorder OstariophysiOrder Gonorynchiformes, including the milkfishesOrder Cypriniformes, including barbs, carp, danios, goldfishes, loaches, minnows, rasborasOrder Characiformes, including characins, pencilfishes, hatchetfishes, piranhas, tetras.Order Gymnotiformes, including electric eels and knifefishesOrder Siluriformes, the catfishesSuperorder ProtacanthopterygiiOrder Salmoniformes, including salmon and troutOrder Esociformes the pikeOrder Osmeriformes, including the smelts and galaxiidsSuperorder StenopterygiiOrder Ateleopodiformes, the jellynose fishOrder Stomiiformes, including the bristlemouths and marine hatchetfishesSuperorder CyclosquamataOrder Aulopiformes, including the Bombay duck and lancetfishesSuperorder ScopelomorphaOrder Myctophiformes, including the lanternfishesSuperorder LampridiomorphaOrder Lampriformes, including the oarfish, opah and ribbonfishesSuperorder PolymyxiomorphaOrder Polymixiiformes, the beardfishesSuperorder ParacanthopterygiiOrder Percopsiformes, including the cavefishes and trout-perchesOrder Batrachoidiformes, the toadfishesOrder Lophiiformes, including the anglerfishesOrder Gadiformes, including codsOrder Ophidiiformes, including the pearlfishesSuperorder AcanthopterygiiOrder Mugiliformes, the mulletsOrder Atheriniformes, including silversides and rainbowfishesOrder Beloniformes, including the flyingfishesOrder Cetomimiformes, the whalefishesOrder Cyprinodontiformes, including livebearers, killifishesOrder Stephanoberyciformes, including the ridgeheadsOrder Beryciformes, including the fangtooths and pineconefishesOrder Zeiformes, including the doriesOrder Gobiesociformes, the clingfishesIn ITIS, Gobiesociformes is placed as the suborder Gobiesocoidei of the order Perciformes.Order Gasterosteiformes including sticklebacks, pipefishes, seahorsesOrder Syngnathiformes, including the seahorses and pipefishesIn Nelson and ITIS, Syngnathiformes is placed as the suborder Syngnathoidei of the order Gasterosteiformes.Order Synbranchiformes, including the swamp eelsOrder Tetraodontiformes, including the filefishes and pufferfishOrder Pleuronectiformes, the flatfishesOrder Scorpaeniformes, including scorpionfishes and the sculpinsOrder Perciformes 40% of all fish including anabantids, Centrarchids (incl. bass and sunfish), Cichlids, gobies, gouramis, mackerel, perches, scats, whiting, wrasses==Notes==  Category:Ray-finned fish Category:Bony fishaf:Actinopterygii ar:أسماك شعاعية الزعانف bg:Лъчеперки ca:Actinopterigi cs:Paprskoploutví da:Strålefinnede fisk de:Strahlenflosser et:Kiiruimsed es:Actinopterygii eo:Aktinopterigoj fa:پرتوبالگان fr:Actinopterygii ga:Actinopterygii ko:조기어류 hr:Zrakoperke is:Geisluggar it:Actinopterygii he:מקריני סנפיר la:Actinopterygii lt:Stipinpelekės žuvys hu:Sugarasúszójú halak mk:Зракоперки nl:Straalvinnigen ja:条鰭綱 no:Strålefinnede fisker nn:Strålefinnefisk oc:Actinopterygii pl:Promieniopłetwe pt:Actinopterygii rm:Actinopterygii qu:Wach'i wayt'ana ru:Лучепёрые рыбы scn:Actinopterygii simple:Actinopterygii sk:Lúčoplutvovce sr:Зракоперке fi:Viuhkaeväiset sv:Taggfeniga fiskar vi:Lớp Cá vây tia to:Ika kaponga tala tr:Işınsal yüzgeçliler uk:Променепері zea:Straelvinnigen zh:輻鰭魚
