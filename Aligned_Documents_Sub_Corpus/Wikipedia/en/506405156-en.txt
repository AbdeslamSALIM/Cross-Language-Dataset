After Hormando Vaca Diez and Mario Cossío, presidents of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies, respectively, declined the post, Rodríguez &mdash; as head of the judiciary and fourth in the line of succession &mdash; became the country's new president on June 10, 2005. His inauguration was welcomed by protestors, who saw Rodríguez as one of the few national figures not involved in previous political troubles.Born in Cochabamba in 1956, Rodríguez is a lawyer and holds a master's degree in public administration. He studied at San Agustin High School; later he studied law at the Universidad Mayor de San Simón in Cochabamba and obtained his Master of Public Administration at Harvard University in the United States.Rodríguez's time in office ended with the inauguration of Evo Morales in January 2006, following the victory of Morales in the presidential election of the previous month.See alsoList of presidents of BoliviaHistory of BoliviaPolitics of BoliviaExternal linksOfficial web site of the president of BoliviaNew Bolivia leader promises poll (BBC News, 10 June 2005)Bolivia's peacemaker seeks brighter future, BBC News, 27 July 2005   Category:Presidents of Bolivia Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:History of Boliviaast:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé ay:Eduardo Rodríguez cs:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé de:Eduardo Rodríguez es:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé eo:Eduardo Rodríguez fr:Eduardo Rodríguez io:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé id:Eduardo Rodríguez it:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé nl:Eduardo Rodríguez ja:エドゥアルド・ロドリゲス・ベルツェ no:Eduardo Rodríguez pl:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé pt:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé qu:Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé fi:Eduardo Rodríguez sv:Eduardo Rodríguez zh:爱德华多·罗德里格斯
