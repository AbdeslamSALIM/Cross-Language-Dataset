She is often able to produce an ace or a service winner or provoke a weak reply from her opponent, which allows her to take control of the rally immediately.

Because of visa restrictions, Sharapova's mother could not originally move with them, though she eventually joined them two years later. Sharapova's father was forced to take various low-paid jobs to fund her lessons, including washing dishes, and, until the age of 12, she rode to the academy each day on the handlebars of Yuri's bicycle as they could not afford any other method of transport. Sharapova developed rapidly at the academy and began playing junior tournaments.2001–2002Sharapova turned professional in 2001, although she played just one tournament, on the ITF Circuit, that year.The following year, Sharapova became the youngest girl to reach the final at the junior Australian Open and repeated this feat at Wimbledon later in 2002.
