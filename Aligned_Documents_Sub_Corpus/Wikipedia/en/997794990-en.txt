The area is noted for the concentration of performance motorsport companies and facilities. Oxford University Press has headed a concentration of print and publishing firms; the university is also linked to the concentration of local biotechnology companies.The main centre of population is the city of Oxford. Other significant settlements are Banbury, Bicester, Kidlington, and Chipping Norton to the north of Oxford; Witney to the west; Thame and Chinnor to the east; and Abingdon, Wantage, Didcot, Wallingford and Henley-on-Thames to the south. Future population growth in the county is hoped to be concentrated around Banbury, Bicester, Didcot and Witney, near the South Midlands growth area.The highest point of the county is Whitehorse Hill, in the Vale of White Horse, reaching 856 feet (261m).Oxfordshire's county flower is the Snake's-head Fritillary.HistoryThe county of Oxfordshire was formed in the early years of the 10th century and is broadly situated in the land between the River Thames to the south, the Cotswolds to the west, the Chilterns to the east and the Midlands to the north, with spurs running south to Henley-on-Thames and north to Banbury.Historically the area has always had some importance, containing valuable agricultural land in the centre of the country and the prestigious university in the county town of Oxford (whose name came from Anglo-Saxon Oxenaford = "ford for oxen"). Ignored by the Romans, it was not until the formation of a settlement at Oxford in the eighth century that the area grew in importance. Alfred the Great was born across the Thames in Wantage in Berkshire. The University of Oxford was founded in 1096, though its collegiate structure did not develop until later on. The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century, generating much wealth, particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912, bringing heavy industry to an otherwise agricultural county. The importance of agriculture as an employer has declined rapidly in the 20th century though; currently under one percent of the county's population are involved due to high mechanisation.Throughout most of its history the county was divided into fourteen hundreds, namely Bampton, Banbury, Binfield, Bloxham, Bullingdon, Chadlington, Dorchester, Ewelme, Langtree, Lewknor, Pyrton, Ploughley, Thame and Wootton.The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, the main army unit in the area, was based at the Barracks on Bullingdon Green, Cowley.The Vale of the White Horse district and parts of the South Oxfordshire administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire, but were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire in 1974. Conversely, the Caversham area of Reading was historically part of Oxfordshire as was the parish of Stokenchurch, now in administrative Buckinghamshire.Towns and cities in Administrative OxfordshireAbingdon (In Berkshire until 1974)BanburyBicesterBurfordCartertonChipping NortonDidcot (In Berkshire until 1974)Faringdon (In Berkshire until 1974)Henley-on-ThamesOxfordThameWallingford (In Berkshire until 1974)Wantage (In Berkshire until 1974)WitneyWoodstockFor a more complete list of settlements in the county see List of places in Oxfordshire.EconomyThis is a chart of trend of regional gross value added of Oxfordshire at current basic prices published (pp.240-253) by Office for National Statistics with figures in millions of British Pounds Sterling.YearRegional Gross Value AddedComponents may not sum to totals due to roundingAgricultureincludes hunting and forestryIndustryincludes energy and constructionServicesincludes financial intermediation services indirectly measured19957,6071202,0845,404200010,594802,6617,853200312,942932,66510,184EducationOxfordshire has a completely comprehensive education system with 23 independent schools and 35 state schools. The state schools are from the ages of 11 to either 16 or 18. Only eight schools do not have a sixth form; these are mostly in South Oxfordshire and Cherwell districts.BuildingsThe most famous building in Oxfordshire is Blenheim Palace at Woodstock. It was built by the great architect John Vanbrugh for John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, after he had won the battle of Blenheim. The gardens, which can be visited, were designed by the landscape gardener "Capability Brown", who planted the trees in the battle formation of the victorious troops. In the palace, which can also be visited, Sir Winston Churchill was born.Chastleton House, on the Gloucestershire and Warwickshire borders, is a great country mansion that was built on property bought from Robert Catesby, who was one of the men involved in the Gunpowder Plot with Guy Fawkes. Stonor Park, another country mansion, has belonged to the recusant Stonor family for centuries.Towns by populationRankTownPopulationYear1Banbury52,0002Abingdon]]36,0003Bicester28,6724Witney23,76520015Didcot22,7006Kidlington(village)17,0007Carterton]]14,0008Thame12,0009Henley on Thames]]10,51310Wantage9,76711Wallingford7,00012Chipping Norton]]5,97213Faringdon5,60014Watlington]]3,000Places of interest  Abingdon County Hall Museumhttp://www.abingdonmuseum.org.uk/index.html - housed in a 17th century County Hall buildingAshdown House - 17th century country house in the Lambourn DownsBlenheim Palace and garden - UNESCO World Heritage SiteBroughton Castle - 14th century fortified manor houseBuscot Park, Buscot - 18th century country house and landscape gardenChastleton House - 17th century country house (limited access)Chiltern Hills - Area of Outstanding Natural BeautyChinnor &amp; Princes Risborough Railway - operated with steam and diesel locomotivesChipping Norton Museum http://www.chippingnorton.net/Visitors/museum.htmCholsey and Wallingford RailwayCotswold Wildlife Park and garden, Bradwell Grove, HolwellCogges Manor Farm Museum, Witney - a living museum of country lifeCombe Mill Museum,http://www.combemill.org/ Long Hanborough - working museum of stationary steam enginesCotswolds - Area of Outstanding Natural BeautyDidcot Railway Centre - museum of the Great Western RailwayDorchester Abbey, Dorchester-on-Thames - 12th century church of former Augustinian abbeyChamps Chapel Museum of East Hendred - village museum in a 15th century Carthusian chapelGreat Coxwell Barn - 14th century Tithe barnGreys Court, Rotherfield Greys - 16th century country houseHampton Gay Manor - ruins of 16th century manor house (no website)Harcourt Arboretum, Nuneham CourtenayHeythrop Hall - 17th century country house: now a hotel, golf & country clubHook Norton Brewery - working Victorian "tower" brewery that offers guided toursSt Katharine's church, Chiselhampton - 18th century parish church with original furnishings (no website, limited access)Kelmscott Manor - Home of William MorrisMapledurham Estate - 16th century country house and 15th century watermillMilton Manor House - 18th century country house http://www.miltonmanorhouse.comMinster Lovell Hall - dovecote and ruins of 15th century manor houseNorth Wessex Downs - Area of Outstanding Natural BeautyOxfordOxford Bus Museum and Morris Motors Museum, Long HanboroughOxford Canal - 18th century "narrow" canalThe Oxfordshire Museum,WoodstockThe RidgewayRiver and Rowing Museum, Henley-on-ThamesRiver ThamesRollright Stones - megalithic stone circle and Whispering Knights burial chamber, near Little RollrightRousham House - 17th century country house and landscape gardenRycote chapel - 15th century chapel with original furnishingsSt Mary's church, Iffley - 12th century romanesque parish church http://www.iffley.co.uk/building.shtmlShotover Country Park, HeadingtonSpiceball Country Park, BanburyStanton Harcourt manor house (limited access), with garden and 15th century chapel and Pope's Tower (no website)Stonor House - country house and 14th century chapel of the recusant Stonor familySwalcliffe Tithe Barn - 15th centuryThame Museum http://thamehistory.netTolsey Museum, Burford (no website)Uffington White Horse, Uffington Castle and Wayland's Smithy burial chamber in the White Horse HillsWallingford MuseumWheatley Windmill - 18th century tower mill http://www.wheatleymill.co.uk/See alsoOxford University (including links to the individual colleges).Oxford CanalFurther readingPhilip Powell - The Geology of Oxfordshire (Dovecote Press, 2005) ISBN 1-904349-19-6External links Oxfordshire County CouncilResults of the 2005 county council electionOxfordshire Forum - The place to discuss Oxfordshire issuesThisisoxfordshire Oxfordshire news, sport & informationFlags of OxfordshireVisit South Oxfordshire   Category:Oxfordshirear:أوكسفوردشير br:Oxfordshire bg:Оксфордшър ca:Oxfordshire cs:Oxfordshire cy:Swydd Rydychen da:Oxfordshire de:Oxfordshire es:Oxfordshire eo:Oxfordshire eu:Oxfordshire fr:Oxfordshire ko:옥스퍼드셔 주 hi:ऑक्सफ़र्डशायर id:Oxfordshire is:Oxfordshire it:Oxfordshire kw:Konteth Rysoghen la:Comitatus Oxoniensis lv:Oksfordšīra lb:Oxfordshire nl:Oxfordshire ja:オックスフォードシャー no:Oxfordshire pl:Oxfordshire pt:Oxfordshire ro:Oxfordshire ru:Оксфордшир simple:Oxfordshire sk:Oxfordshire fi:Oxfordshire sv:Oxfordshire uk:Оксфордшир vo:Oxfordshire zh:牛津郡
