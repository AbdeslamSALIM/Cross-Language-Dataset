He is famous for his lightning pace down the left wing and his powerful shots.CareerHe began his career for Botev Vratsa. After few good seasons, he signed with CSKA Sofia and after two successful games against Servette in the UEFA Cup, the Swiss side bought the 19-year-old for 1.2 m. German marks. In June 1999 he received his first call-up to the Bulgarian national team for a Euro 2000 qualifier against England. However, it proved to be an inauspicious start to his international career; he was sent off for a second yellow card just eight minutes after coming on as a substitute. Soon he moved to the German Bundesliga and established himself as a very explosive player for VfL Wolfsburg. In the summer of 2005 he was bought by Atlético Madrid for €10 m.Petrov was the key player in Bulgaria's unsuccessful Euro 2004 participation, excelling in all three games and scoring Bulgaria's only goal at the finals; a penalty against Italy in Bulgaria's 1-2 loss.On 2 September 2006 Petrov played a crucial role in the Bulgarian national team's Euro 2008 opening qualifying game against Romania in Constanţa, nailing two goals in two minutes to equalize from 2-0 in the last minutes of the game. This was seen as a remarkable comeback. He also went on to score against Slovenia (in a 3-0 win) and the Netherlands (in a 1-1 draw). His performances in the 2006 qualifying campaign earned him the 2006 Bulgarian Footballer of the Year award.On 24 July, 2007, after constant press speculation about him leaving the club, it was reported that Atletico Madrid had placed a £6.2m price on the player. Later that day he left the Atletico Madrid training camp to think over his future. English Premiership sides Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City were reported to be interested.Reports in the Spanish press on 25 July suggested Petrov had agreed terms, had his medical tests with Manchester City only small details needed completing before finalising a move to Eastlands. Manchester City confirmed the £4.7Million (€7m) move and a 3-year contract on 26th July 2007. Manchester CityMartin Petrov left Atletico Madrid for the blue half of Manchester on 26 July, 2007, and was a relatively unknown talent to the Premiership, but had a big reputation on the International stage. That soon changed after he played his first Premier League game on 11 August, 2007. He had an important role in Manchester City's 2-0 win over West Ham at Upton Park, making endless runs down his favoured left flank, creating havoc for West Ham's defence, and never shying away from taking a powerful long range shot at goal with his trademark left foot. He had to wait until 22 September, 2007 to score his first goal in Manchester City's sky blue colours, in which he netted two goals at Fulham's Craven Cottage. One of the goals was a superb individual effort, and the other a brilliant one-two with Elano. Since then Petrov has scored 2 goals, one in the 3-1 win over Newcastle United the other in the 2-1 win over Reading F.C. and also notched up 6 assists. Making himself well known for his blistering pace, brilliant runs down the wing, and a great eye for a pass. He was sent off in the home loss to Everton F.C., as he kicked Leon Osman, only to be seen by referee Rob Styles. The challenge earned him a straight red card which banned him for 3 games. The Bulgarian added to his tally with a goal against Portsmouth. A goal hit with his weaker right foot, which managed to go through the legs of Sol Campbell and into the net.It has been announced that Petrovs number will change from 15 up to 17 which is his international number. During the first round of the UEFA cup in the 2008/09 season, Petrov scored a rifle of a shot after a Michael Johnson dummy against EB/Streymur In Citys 2-0 away win. He also scored a goal in the home leg against EB/Streymur along with Darius Vassell's late goal. He scored another brilliant goal against Celtic at Parkhead on 6th August 2008.Career statisticsMartin Petrov Football Profile | News | Pictures - Yahoo!
