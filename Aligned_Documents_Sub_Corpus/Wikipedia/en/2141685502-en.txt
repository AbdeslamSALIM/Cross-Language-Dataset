He broke the record with a fourth win in 2005, but was later disqualified after a urine sample during that year's Vuelta tested positive for the banned drug EPO.Early careerHeras turned professional in 1995 racing for the Spanish cycling team Kelme. His first win as a pro came in 1996, when he won the Subida al Naranco, and later that year he also took an important victory in the twelfth stage of the Vuelta a España. Next year he won yet another stage at the Vuelta and the Clásica de Amorebieta. In 1999 he won stages at the Volta a Catalunya and the Giro d'Italia, and he stood for the first time on the Vuelta's podium, where he was third despite not winning any stage. In 2000 he took two stages and the overall win at the Vuelta, which attracted the attention of US Postal cycling team.Riding with Lance ArmstrongFrom 2001, he raced alongside Lance Armstrong on the US Postal Service team. As a climbing specialist, he greatly assisted Armstrong's progress in the mountain stages of the Tour de France. Heras achieved his highest finishing position to date in the 2000 Tour when he was fifth.Dominating the Vuelta a EspañaHe had, however, already established himself as a contender for leading honours in other Tours. He was fifth overall and a stage winner in the 1997 Vuelta, sixth (and another stage victory) a year later, and was on the podium in third place in 1999; that year he also finished sixth and won a stage in the Giro d'Italia. His first Vuelta win came the following year, 2000 (when he also won two stages and the points classification). This was in 2003 followed by another victory in the Vuelta a EspañaAt the end of the 2003 season, he left US Postal to become the leader of the Spanish Liberty Seguros team. He was thought to be a contender for the 2004 Tour de France, but was forced to abandon after the 16th stage due to lack of fitnessBBC Sports Academy, Roberto Heras' Vuelta mountain guide. Heras entered the Vuelta a España and won it again, thereby equalling Tony Rominger's record of three Vuelta wins. During the first mountain stages of the Vuelta, it seemed it would be a rather easy win for him, but in the last week he had to see off an important challenge from Santiago Pérez.In the 2005 Vuelta a España was initially also won by Heras. During the Vuelta Heras won two mountain stages (including an epic victory atop the Estación de Esquí de Pajares) and lost the last time trial by only less than a second, something nobody expected from the non-time-trial-specialist Heras. Heras was crowned as the winner for the fourth time, a new record.However, a drug test finalized in November 2005, two months after the race's end, showed a positive test for EPO from the day of said time trial (stage 20)Cycling News, November 2005, Cycling News Flash - Heras confirmed positive. Heras was fired from his team, and faced a two year suspension from racing. He was stripped of his 2005 Vuelta win, which was given to second place finisher, Russian Denis Menchov. Heras appealed this result, alleging inaccuracies in the testing process and mishandling of his samples, but the appeal was rejected.Heras was planning to comeback to the peloton after his suspension ended in late 2007 but ProTour rules stated that he couldn't join a ProTour team for the next two years even after his suspension ends. At the end of 2007 he announced his retirement.AccomplishmentsAll results are general classification (overall) rankings unless otherwise indicated:Brompton World Championships2008 - 2ndVuelta a España:1997 - 5th; Stage 12 win1998 - 6th; Stage 19 win1999 - 3rd2000 - 1st; Stage 7 and 20 wins2001 - 4th2002 - 2nd; Stage 6 and 15 wins2003 - 1st; Stage 20 win2004 - 1st; Stage 12 win2005: - Disqualified for doping after finishing 1st; Stage 6 and 15 winsTour de France:2000 - 5th2001 - 15th2002 - 9th2003 - 34th; Stage 4 (TTT) win2004 - DNF2005 - 45thGiro d'Italia1999 - 6th; Stage 21 winVolta a Catalunya1999 - 2nd; Stage 6 win2002 - 1st   See alsoList of doping cases in cyclingList of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offencesReferences Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish cyclists Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Vuelta a España winners Category:Vuelta a España stage winners Category:Giro d'Italia stage winnersca:Roberto Heras Hernández da:Roberto Heras de:Roberto Heras es:Roberto Heras fr:Roberto Heras it:Roberto Heras he:רוברטו הראס la:Robertus Heras nl:Roberto Heras ja:ロベルト・エラス no:Roberto Heras pl:Roberto Heras pt:Roberto Heras fi:Roberto Heras sv:Roberto Heras
