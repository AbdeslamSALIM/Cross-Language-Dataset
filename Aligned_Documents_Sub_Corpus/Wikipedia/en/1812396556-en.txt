It is the largest known non-spherical moon in the solar system. It is named after Proteus, the shape-changing sea god of Greek mythology.DiscoveryProteus was discovered from the images taken by Voyager 2 probe during the Neptune flyby in 1989. It received the temporary designation S/1989&nbsp;N&nbsp;1. Stephen P. Synnott and Bradford A. Smith announced (IAUC 4806) its discovery on July 7, 1989, speaking only of “17 frames taken over 21 days”, which gives a discovery date of sometime before June 16. The name was given on 16 September 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;Physical characteristicsProteus is more than 400 kilometres in diameter, larger than Nereid, another moon of Neptune. However, it was not discovered by Earth-based telescopes because it is so close to the planet that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight.  view of Proteus orbiting Neptune]] Proteus is very cratered, showing no sign of any geological modification. It is irregularly shaped; scientists believe Proteus is about as large as a body of its density can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Saturn's moon Mimas has a more spherical shape due to a lower density, despite being less massive than Proteus.See alsoList of craters on ProteusReferencesExternal linksProteus Profile by NASA's Solar System ExplorationIAU Circular describing the discovery of S/1989 N 1 (with mandatory IAU web policy statement)Proteus page on The Nine8 PlanetsProteus, A Moon Of Neptune on Views of the Solar SystemTed Stryk's Proteus Page  Category:Neptune's moonsbg:Протей (спътник) ca:Proteu (satèl·lit) cs:Protetus (měsíc) cy:Protëws (lloeren) da:Proteus (måne) de:Proteus (Mond) el:Πρωτέας (δορυφόρος) es:Proteo (luna) fr:Protée (lune) ko:프로테우스 (위성) hr:Protej (mjesec) it:Proteo (astronomia) he:פרוטאוס (ירח) ht:Pwote lv:Protejs (pavadonis) lt:Protėjas (palydovas) hu:Protéusz (hold) nl:Proteus (maan) ja:プロテウス (衛星) no:Proteus (måne) nn:Neptunmånen Proteus pl:Proteusz (księżyc) pt:Proteu (satélite) ru:Протей (спутник) simple:Proteus (moon) sk:Proteus (mesiac) sl:Proteus (luna) fi:Proteus (kuu) sv:Proteus (måne) zh:海卫八
