Lohan started in show business as a child fashion model for magazine advertisement and television commercials. At age 10, she began her acting career in a soap opera; at 11, she made her motion picture debut by playing identical twins in Disney's 1998 remake of The Parent Trap.Lohan rose to stardom with her leading roles in the films Freaky Friday, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Mean Girls and Herbie: Fully Loaded. Her subsequent roles include appearances in A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby. In 2004, Lohan launched a second career in pop music yielding the albums Speak (2004), A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005) and the forthcoming Spirit in the Dark (2008).Lohan's personal life has been a frequent subject of celebrity and tabloid journalism.Early lifeLohan was born in New York City "[Phillips|[KYRA PHILLIPS]]: Lindsay Morgan Lohan's life began on 2 July 1986. Though she was born in New York City, she was raised in the upper middle class Long Island town of Cold Spring Harbor." and grew up in Merrick and Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island in New York. She is the eldest child of Donata &quot;Dina&quot; (née Sullivan) and Michael Lohan. Lohan has three younger siblings, all of whom were child models: Michael Jr., who appeared with her in The Parent Trap, sister Aliana, who is also an actress, and Dakota, the youngest Lohan child. Lohan is of Irish and Italian heritage and was raised as a Catholic.Her maternal family were "well known Irish Catholic stalwarts" in Merrick, with her great-grandfather, John L Sullivan, being a co-founder of the Pro-life Party in Long Island.&lt;/ref&gt; Lohan attended public school on Long Island. She finished her studies at home through Laurel Springs Schoolhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517820/bio retrieved 2007-07-26 of Ojai, California. Her father was sentenced to four years in prison in the late 1980s. In 2005, he was sent back to prison for nearly two years, released in March 2007, for "aggravated unlicensed driving" and attempted assault. Michael currently works with Teen Challenge. In December 2005, Michael and Dina Lohan signed a separation agreement.retrieved  In 2007, Lohan's parents announced that their divorce proceedings had been finalized.Acting careerEarly career success[[Image:Lohan AW.jpg|thumb|Lohan's debut as an actress on Another World.]] Lohan began her career with Ford Models at age three, but found little work as a fashion model. She persisted and eventually appeared in more than 100 print-ads for companies like Toys &quot;R&quot; Us. She also modeled for Calvin Klein Kids (usually with siblings Michael and Ali) and Abercrombie Kids.Lohan's first auditions for television work did not go well; by the time she tried out for a Duncan Hines commercial, she told her mother that she would give up if she did not get the job. She was hired, and went on to appear in over 60 commercials, including a Jell-O spot with Bill Cosby. Her ad work led to roles in soap operas, and she was already considered a show-business veteran in 1996 when she landed the role of Alexandra "Alli" Fowler on Another World, "where she delivered more dialogue than any other 10-year-old in daytime serials" of the time.[[Image:Twins4.jpg|left|thumb|Lohan in dual roles in The Parent Trap (1998), her first feature film.]] Lohan gave up Another World for the big screen when director Nancy Meyers cast her to play the dual roles of the estranged twin sisters who try to reunite their long-divorced parents (Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson) in the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap. Trap was well-received for a family comedy, bringing in US$92 million worldwide. Film critic Janet Maslin found Lohan's dual performances so forceful "that she seems to have been taking shy violet lessons from Sharon Stone." Critic Kenneth Turan called Lohan "the soul of this film as much as Hayley Mills was of the original, and … she is more adept than her predecessor at creating two distinct personalities".She starred in two original television movies, Life-Size (2000) (with Tyra Banks) and Get a Clue (2002). She also played Bette Midler's daughter in the first episode of the short-lived series, Bette (2000), but Lohan, then 14, quit when the production moved from New York to Los Angeles. In 2001, she hosted the ABC-TV commercial series commemorating Walt Disney's 100th birthday during a rebroadcast of The Parent Trap.Rise to fame and career developmentFollowing a brief hiatus, Lohan won a lead role in another Disney remake: Freaky Friday (2003), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. Lohan's character in the movie was originally written as a Goth, but she didn't think anyone would relate to that, and decided to dress in a preppy style for her audition, and the character ended up being re-written.&lt;/ref&gt; Through 2005, ''Friday'' was Lohan's biggest commercial film success, earning [[US$]]160 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ffbox&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;In 2004, Lohan was given the lead in two films, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (her first feature that was not a remake) and Paramount's Mean Girls, both released in 2004. Drama Queen was a modest success at the box office, grossing about US$30 million, but was a failure with critics. "Though still a promising star, Lohan will have to do a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions," Robert K. Elder wrote.Far more successful was Mean Girls, her first PG-13 (and first non-Disney) film. Her breakout lead performance pushed the critical and commercial hit to gross US$128 million worldwide, "cementing her status as the new teen movie queen," wrote Brandon Gray. "Lohan dazzles us once more," said Steve Rhodes. "The smartly written script is a perfect match for her intelligent brand of comedy." Mean Girls was scripted by Tina Fey and featured several alumni of Saturday Night Live; Lohan was asked to host the show three times, in 2004, 2005, and 2006.In 2005, Lohan became the first living person to have a "My Scene Goes Hollywood" doll released by Mattel. She also voiced herself in the direct-to-DVD feature film based on the dolls.Lohan returned to Disney for Herbie: Fully Loaded (2005), the fifth film in the Herbie series. Her popularity allowed her to choose from a wider variety of projects; Lohan felt Herbie would help her make the transition into more grown-up roles. "In most of my other films, I was in high school," she said. "Here, character is just out of college. It's nice to be able to do something that I think will be acceptable to the fan base I've accumulated from my Disney movies, but subconsciously they'll see me getting older and maturing." Fully Loaded earned $144,146,816 worldwide.Her next film in wide release, Just My Luck, opened in May 2006 to poor reviews and earned only $38 million worldwide. The following month, ''A Prairie Home Companion, in limited release ended its run with $25,648,948 globally. "Lohan rises to the occasion, delivering a rock-the-house version of 'Frankie and Johnny'," wrote Peter Travers. Lohan completed filming the independent Emilio Estevez film, Bobby, in December 2005; the film débuted at the Venice Film Festival on 5 September 2006, and was released in theaters on 23 November 2006, though it earned a weak $19,560,892 worldwide with mixed reviews. She then appeared in Chapter 27 as a John Lennon fan who befriends Mark David Chapman (Jared Leto) on the day he murders the singer. It was filmed in New York between January and March of 2006. The film had trouble finding a distributor for the United States and received a very limited release. Chapter 27 was widely panned by critics, receiving a dismal 20% Fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.Chapter 27 Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Lohan was voted #10 on the list of "100 Sexiest Women" by readers of FHM.

The film premiered "to an abysmal $3.5 million"&quot;I Know Who Killed Your Career&quot;, EW.com and earned Lohan two nominations for worst actress at the Golden Raspberry Awards. She came in first and second, tying with herself.Entertainment Weekly quoted the head of a major film studio as saying, "Her career was over long before she had these troubles... Right now, she'd have to pay a studio to get herself into a movie." The article continues, "There's the L.A. bar scene that serves underage stars and Hollywood's compulsion to turn child actors into products, plus a frenzied 21st-century media culture that has made Lohan and other celebs into exotic prey in flashbulb cages." ABC News quoted publicist Michael Levine as calling Lohan unemployable "for the next 18 months." The head of a talent agency agreed, noting that her personal issues likely made the insurance and other costs required for any film production to proceed prohibitively expensive.&quot;From Sought-After to 'Unemployable'.&quot; ABC News, July 24, 2007. James Robinson, the producer of Georgia Rule, stated he would still like to work with her. "She's a good person who's making some bad choices.

For the ''Freaky Friday'' soundtrack, she sang the closing theme, "Ultimate"; she also recorded four songs for the ''Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen'' soundtrack.Producer Emilio Estefan, Jr. signed Lohan to a five-album production deal in 2002. "The minute I heard her sing, I knew she was gifted," he said, "and she has an incredible ability to connect with her audience. I am very excited to be working with her." Lohan — who said she was "extremely excited" — added, "I am surrounded by a group of very talented people." Two years later, Lohan signed a recording contract with Casablanca Records, headed by Tommy Mottola. Lohan is currently signed with Motown Records.''Speak'' (2004)Her debut album, Speak, was released in December 2004, and peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. By early 2005, it was certified Platinum. Though primarily a pop album, Speak was introduced with the single "Rumors", described by Rolling Stone as "a bass-heavy, angry club anthem". Its sexually suggestive video reached number one on MTV's Total Request Live and was nominated for Best Pop Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. "Rumors" eventually earned a Gold certification in America.The album spawned the second single "Over" and the third single "First", which was featured in Lohan's 2005 film Herbie: Fully Loaded. The music video also featured Herbie the Love Bug. Both music videos were directed by Jake Nava, who also directed the music video for "Rumors.""With just two hit films under her belt, Lohan decided it was time to turn herself into a multimedia, cross-platform star," wrote Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic. "And so Speak was recorded quickly and rushed into the stores". He called her music "a blend of old-fashioned, Britney-styled dance-pop and the anthemic, arena rock sound pioneered by fellow tween stars Hilary Duff and Ashlee Simpson. However, Lohan stands apart from the pack with her party-ready attitude and her husky voice".''A Little More Personal (Raw)'' (2005)In December 2005, her second album, A Little More Personal (Raw), debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200 chart, but fell under the top 100 within six weeks. Reviews were unfavorable; critics called the album a "slick pop production." Slant magazine called it "contrived ... for all the so-called weighty subject matter, there's not much meat on these bones." Still, A Little More Personal (Raw) was certified Gold on 18 January 2006. The music video for the album's first single, "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" — directed by Lohan and featuring the acting debut of her sister, Ali — was a dramatization of the pain Lohan says her family has suffered at the hands of her father. She said "It's kind of offensive... I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative."The album's second single was supposed to be "I Live for the Day." Radio promos singles were pressed and released and sent to radio stations. However due to Lohan's schedule, she was unable to promote or support the single as she did with her previous efforts. Eventually, since the single received absolutely no radio airplay or support, and the disappointing chart position and sales of the album, Casablanca Records cancelled "I Live for the Day" and moved forward with "If It’s Alright" as the second single. However plans for releasing "If It’s Alright" were later cancelled, as well as all other singles and promotion with the album. Therefore, A Little More Personal (Raw) was not as successful as her previous album, Speak. A Little More Personal (Raw), with little promotion, was still certified gold by the RIAA on 18 January 2006 after debuting on the Billboard 200 at #20, while "Speak" went platinum after debuting at #4.===''Spirit in the Dark'' (2008)===Lohan's third album, Spirit in the Dark, is set for release on November 4, 2008.Artist News | New Album Out on 4 November!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Z100 All the Hits, One Station&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Lohan has promised a third studio album on multiple occasions and stated that she wants the album to be dance, hip-hop, and R&amp;B - "kind of Kylie Minogue-meets-Rihanna".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20181997,00.html, Lindsay Lohan: 'I'm Back on Track'], People.com, 4 March 2008Lindsay's New Sound: Kylie Minogue-Meets-Rihanna, People.com, 7 March 2008 She is working with J.
