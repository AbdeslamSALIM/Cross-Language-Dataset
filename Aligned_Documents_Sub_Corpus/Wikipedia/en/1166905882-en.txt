 |Issued: 25 May 1999Photo: Per á Hædd]]Borðoy is an island in the north-east of the Faroe Islands. There are eight settlements: Klaksvík (the second largest town in the Faroes), Norðoyri, Ánir, Árnafjørður, Strond, Norðtoftir, Depil and Norðdepil. There are also three abandoned settlements: Skálatoftir, Múli and Fossá, all in the north. Múli was one of the remotest settlements in the Faroes - there was no road link until 1989, before which goods had to be brought in via helicopter or boat. The last people left in 1994. A Klaksvík museum bought the Fossá area in 1969 with the plan of turning it into a typical Faroese Medieval village, though the plan never came to fruition.MountainsThe island has the following five mountainsNameHeightLokki755mHáfjall647mBorðoyarnes392mDepilsknúkur680mHálgafelli503mExternal linksPersonal website with 9 aerial photos of Borðoy * Category:Islands of the Faroe Islandsca:Borðoy cs:Borðoy da:Borðoy de:Borðoy es:Borðoy fo:Borðoy fr:Borðoy gv:Borðoy is:Borðey he:בורד'וי hu:Borðoy nl:Borðoy ja:ボルウォイ島 no:Borðoy nn:Borðoy pl:Borðoy pt:Borðoy ro:Borðoy sk:Borðoy sr:Бордој fi:Borðoy sv:Borðoy vi:Borðoy
