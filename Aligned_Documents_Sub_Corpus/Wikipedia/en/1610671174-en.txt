She was close friends/house mates with Ari Up and worked at Better Badges, which was a centre of punk culture. Cherry moved through several bands, including The Slits, New Age Steppers, Rip Rig &amp; Panic, and Float Up CP. She also dj'd, playing early rap music on the reggae pirate Dread Broadcasting Corporation PFF 200.Raw Like SushiShe began a solo career with "Stop the War", a protest song about the Falkland Islands. She also worked with The The and musician Cameron McVey (a.k.a. Booga Bear), who co-wrote most of her debut album Raw Like Sushi, and whom she would eventually marry. She was intimately involved in the Bristol Urban Culture scene, working as an arranger on Massive Attack's Blue Lines album and helping out in various other ways in the scene. Famously, she gave birth while Shara Nelson was recording the vocals for the album in the same house. Robert Del Naja and Andrew Vowles of Massive Attack had in turn contributed to Raw Like Sushi.Her cover was released as a single, and "Buffalo Stance" was an international blockbuster and she caused controversy when she performed the song - complete with gyrating choreography - on UK television show Top Of The Pops while 7-8 months' pregnant. "Buffalo Stance" eventually peaked at number 3 on the UK pop charts and number 1 on the American Dance charts, becoming one of 1988's biggest club anthems.More singles released between 1988 and 1990 included the slower "Manchild," "Kisses on the Wind," "Heart," and "Inna City Mama." She also found success with "I've Got U Under My Skin," a dramatic reworking of the Cole Porter song, which appeared on the Red Hot + Blue AIDS fundraising album. The single reached number 25 on the UK pop charts.HomebrewBack in Sweden in 1991, Neneh began work on her second album Homebrew."I suppose the second album took a long time in pop terms, but that's the way it is with me, I need to have a life, lived at my own pace, in between the albums".This was a more developed and crafted album - the sound of someone stretching out. Led by the single "Money Love," it was not as commercially successful as its predecessor, but received great critical acclaim . The album had some success on the dance charts with songs "Buddy X" and "Trout." "Buddy X" was an even bigger hit years later in a remix by Dreem Teem and on college radio the "Trout" duet with Michael Stipe was popular. Homebrew included the work of a Bristolian lad called Geoff Barrow ('Somedays'), who would later turn up as the studio architect of the group Portishead.ManHer most recent solo album, 1996's Man, was led by the track "Woman". Woman is her take on James Brown's 1966 track "It's a Man's Man's Man's World." It featured the major hit single "7 Seconds" featuring Youssou N'Dour, and "Trouble Man" - a remake of the old Marvin Gaye classic. Man was recorded mainly in London and Spain. Neneh's stepfather Don Cherry had recently died in her Spain home, so many of Man's songs have recurring themes of death, longing, and moving on. "Woman"'s video garnered Neneh with many British music honors ."Feel It" features a very vulnerable Neneh singing the tale of a young man's growing up. The funky, agitated rock of "Kootchi" shows a return to Neneh's appealing, sass-filled sexual side. "Carry Me" gracefully tells the tale of a young girl's death from the dying girl's perspective. "Golden Ring" is a power ballad sung in a flamenco, Spanish style which exhibits the influence that living in the flamenco scene has had on Neneh's dwelling of Spain. International hit "7 Seconds" is a haunting anthem about racism and "Together Now" features Tricky.Man is more atmospheric and leaning towards trip-hop and rock than Neneh's previous albums.Neneh Chérie RemixesA remix album of Man songs released in 1997.01.
