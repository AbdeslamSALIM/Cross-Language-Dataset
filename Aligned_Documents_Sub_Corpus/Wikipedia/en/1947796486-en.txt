He located city and funded in Wodzisław monastery in 1257 year.The city's origins can be traced back into the 10th and 11th century, when three Slavic settlements existed on Wodzisław's present-day territory which eventually merged to form one town. In the course of the medieval eastward migration of German settlers (Ostsiedlung), Wodzisław, as many other Polish settlements, was incorporated (granted city status and right) according to the so-called Magdeburg Law at some point before 1257 (the exact date remains unknown). This, however, is not to be confused with a change in national affiliation; Wodzisław continued to be part of the Kingdom of Poland, until Silesia as a whole became a fiefdom of the Bohemian crown in 1327. The city continued to grow and developed into a regional trade centre. In the 15th century, the Hussites devastated the city. From 1526, Bohemia, including the fiefdom of Silesia, which Wodzisław was a part of, came under the authority of the Habsburg crown.Early Modern AgeIn century XVI and XVII also time Thirty Years' War Wodzisław been part of Habsburg Empire. After the end of the Thirty Years' War Wodzisław was destroyed. Never back to Middle Ages' "golden time". At the beginning of the War of the Austrian Succession between Frederick II of Prussia (the Great) and the Habsburg empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the greatest part of Silesia, including Wodzisław, was annexed by Prussia in 1740, which Austria eventually recognized in 1763. Coal mining gained importance for Wodzisław's economy as early as the 19th century.20th centuryAfter the end of World War I in 1918, Polish statehood was finally restored. Amidst an atmosphere of ethnic unrest, a referendum was organized to determine the future national affiliation of Upper Silesia. Although an overall majority had opted for Germany, the area was finally divided in an attempt to satisfy both parties. Although both parties considered the territory they were assigned insufficient, the division was justified insofar as in the German and Polish parts a majority had voted in favour of the respective nation.The lowest amount of pro-German votes (nevertheless still 49 % of the total) was registered in the districts of Rybnik and Pszczyna (Pless). The city and the largest part of the district of Rybnik were attached to the territory of the Second Polish Republic; Wodzisław thus became part of a Polish state for the first time since 1526. The Upper Silesia plebiscite and eventual division of Upper Silesia were accompanied by three Silesian Uprisings of Polish milicians.Within the Second Polish Republic of the interwar period, Wodzisław was part of the Silesian Voivodeship, which enjoyed far-reaching political and financial autonomy.With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the border city Wodzisław returned under the rule of Germany, being in the part of Poland that was directly incorporated into the German state. The population was ethnically categorized and either "re-Germanized" or disfranchised and partially deported into the General Government as Poles.In January 1945 came to Wodzisław dead march from Nazi German's death camp Auschwitz. When the Soviet army advanced on Poland, nine days before the Soviets arrived at the death camp at Auschwitz, the SS marched 60,000 prisoners out of the camp toward Wodzisław Śląski (22 January 1945), thirty-five miles away, where they were put on freight trains to other camps. Approximately 15,000 prisoners died on the way.In March 1945 the Soviet army arrived near Wodzisław. 80% of the town was destroyed in the war. From 26 March 1945 Wodzisław was once more integrated into Poland.TransportWodzisław is situated at the junction of several major lines of road, railway and air communication.
