Her parents were Courteney (née Bass) and the late Richard Lewis Cox, a contractor.Courteney Cox Biography (1964-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Cox has two older sisters (Virginia McFerrin and Dottie Pickett), an older brother (Richard, Jr.) and nine half-brothers and half-sisters. Her parents divorced in 1974, and her father eventually settled in Panama City, Florida, where he opened a company called Cox Pools, while Cox grew up with her mother and her stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland.Cox was raised in a wealthy suburb of Birmingham, Mountain Brook, Alabama where she was known as CeCe. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. Upon graduation, Cox went to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College for Women. She dropped out after a year to pursue a modeling career, after being signed by the Ford modeling agency in New York City. While modeling, she also took acting classes and worked to lose her southern accent.CareerEarly careerCox first came to prominence in the 1984 music video for Bruce Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark" (in which she was the pulled-on-stage girl who danced onstage with Springsteen). Cox is also notable for being the first person to use the word "period" on U.S. television in its physiological sense, in a 1985 advertising campaign for Tampax brand tampons. Her early film roles include Masters of the Universe (1987) and Cocoon: The Return (1988). Her early television work includes a starring role in the short-lived television series Misfits of Science (1985), and later a recurring role (1987 - 1989) on the television series Family Ties as the girlfriend of Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox). She had a supporting role as Jewel, the hard-as-nails assistant to Jim Belushi's character, in the 1990 fantasy film Mr. Destiny.In 1994, shortly before the debut of Friends, Cox appeared with Jim Carrey in the film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and on Seinfeld, as Jerry's girlfriend Meryl.''Friends''Later in 1994, Cox was asked to audition for the part of Rachel Green on a new sitcom called Friends, but she was instead cast as the character Monica Geller. At first the most famous cast member of the new show, Cox joined fellow castmates Jennifer Aniston (Rachel Green), Lisa Kudrow (Phoebe Buffay), Matt Le Blanc (Joey Tribbiani), Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing) and David Schwimmer (Ross Geller) for what would become her most famous role, lasting for 10 seasons until 2004.Between seasons 5 and 6, Cox married David Arquette, becoming Courteney Cox Arquette. An in-joke reference to this is made in the opening credits of the episodes The One After Vegas, where the rest of the cast and executive producers have "Arquette" added to their names; however, this was corrected in season 7. The dedication "To Courteney and David, who did get married" appears during the fade out to the tag scene.

She met her husband, David Arquette who played her on-screen love interest Dwight "Dewey" Riley, while filming the first of this trilogy.Although she starred in several other films during her time on Friends, none achieved the same level of success as the show. Such films include The Runner, 3000 Miles to Graceland and The Shrink Is In. In late 2003, Cox produced the television series Mix It Up. The lifestyle show received low ratings and was not renewed for a second season.After ''Friends''After her Friends role, Cox was producer Marc Cherry's first choice to be offered a starring role as Susan Mayer on Desperate Housewives. However, Cox was unavailable due to her pregnancy and the role went to Teri Hatcher. A couple of years later, Cox signed a deal with ABC Television Studio (formerly Touchstone Television), to star in her own series.Since Friends, Cox has primarily concentrated on her family but has starred in the independent film November (2005), which had a limited theatrical release, co-starred with Tim Allen in the critically derided Zoom and cameoed in the big budget remake of The Longest Yard, as the girlfriend of Adam Sandler's character. Cox later said her breasts were digitally enhanced to portray her role as the wife of a quarterback. She has recently supplied her voice for the animated film Barnyard. A Friends reunion film was rumored to be released within the next 18 months following the success of Sex and the City: The Movie Friends: The Movie on the cards? - Telegraph&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; but this has been denied by Warner Brothers and others.Since 2007, Cox has starred as Lucy Spiller, a cynical tabloid editor, in Dirt, a television drama for the FX Network.

Cox also dated singer Adam Duritz of Counting Crows and appeared in their music video for song "A Long December" in 1997. (Duritz has also dated Cox's Friends co-star Jennifer Aniston.)Cox married David Arquette on June 12, 1999. On June 13, 2004, she gave birth to their first child, daughter Coco Riley Arquette. The child was originally to be named after her mother as Courteney Cox Arquette. However, Arquette's family objected to this on the grounds that naming a child after a living relative goes against Jewish tradition (David Arquette is Jewish). Coco is a nickname Cox's friends gave her mother when she was a child. Jennifer Aniston is the baby's godmother.In June 2007, Cox announced plans to expand her family. The actress said she hopes to have a child through in vitro fertilisation despite battling post-partum depression after Coco's birth.FilmographyFilmYearFilmRoleOther notes1987Down TwistedTarahMasters of the Universe]]''Julie Winston1988]]Cocoon: The ReturnSara1990]]Mr. DestinyJewel Jagger1991]]Blue Desert]]''Lisa Roberts1992]]Shaking the Tree]]''Kathleen1993]]The Opposite Sex and How to Live with ThemCarrie Davenport1994]]Ace Ventura: Pet DetectiveMelissa Robinson1996]]Scream]]''Gale Weathers1997Commandments]]''Rachel LuceScream 2Gale Weathers1999]]The Runner]]''Karina2000]]Scream 3Gale Weathers20013000 Miles to GracelandCybil WaingrowThe Shrink Is InSamantha CrumbGet Well Soon]]''Lily2002]]Alien Love TriangleAlice Connor2004]]November]]''Sophie Jacobs2005]]The Longest Yard]]''Lena2006Barnyard]]''DaisyVoice RoleZoom]]''Marsha Holloway]]The TripperCynthiaAlso film producer2008The Monday Before Thanksgiving]]''CeceShort filmBedtime Stories]]''Wendypost-production2009]]The Big ChangeTelevisionYearTitleRoleNotes1984As the World TurnsBunny1985Code Name: FoxfireFlight AttendantTV-Movie]]1985&ndash;1986Misfits of ScienceGloria Dinallo]]1986The Love BoatEpisode: Dare Devil/Picture Me As a Spy/SleeperSylvan in ParadiseLucy AppleTV-Pilot]]Murder, She WroteCarol BannisterEpisode: Death Stalks the Big Top (1)]]  Episode: Death Stalks the Big Top (2)1987If It's Tuesday, It Still Must Be BelgiumHana WyshockiTV-Movie]]1987&ndash;1989Family TiesLauren Miller1988I'll Be Home for Christmas]]''Nora BundyTV-Movie]]1989Roxanne: The Prize PulitzerJacquie KimberlyTV-Movie]]Judith Krantz's Till We Meet AgainMarie-Frederique 'Freddy' de LancelCBS Miniseries1990Curiosity KillsGwenTV-Movie]]1991Morton &amp; HayesPrincess LucyEpisode: Oafs Overboard1992Battling for BabyKatherineTV-Movie]]Dream On]]''AlishaEpisode: Come and Knock on Our Door1993The Trouble with LarryGabriella Easden1994SeinfeldMerylEpisode: The Wife]]1994&ndash;2004Friends]]''Monica Geller1995Sketch Artist II: Hands that SeeEmmyTV-Movie]]Saturday Night LiveHostEpisode: Courtney Cox/Dave Matthews Band]]1999Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every ChildVoice Role  Emerald Salt PorkEpisode: The Three Little Pigs2007&ndash;2008Dirt]]''Lucy SpillerAwards and nominationsAmerican Comedy Awards1999: Nominated, "Funniest Supporting Female Performer in a TV Series" — FriendsBlockbuster Entertainment Award1998: Nominated, "Favorite Actress - Horror" — Scream 22001: Nominated, "Favorite Actress - Horror" — Scream 3Golden Apple Award1995: Won, "Female Discovery of the Year"Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards1997: Nominated, "Favorite Television Actress" — Friends2000: Nominated, "Favorite Television Friends" — Friends (shared w/Jennifer Aniston & Lisa Kudrow)Razzie Awards2002: Nominated, "Worst Screen Couple" — 3000 Miles to Graceland (shared w/Kurt Russell & Kevin Costner)2002: Nominated, "Worst Supporting Actress" — 3000 Miles to GracelandSaturn Awards1998: Nominated, "Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture" — Scream 2Screen Actors Guild Awards1999: Nominated, "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)2000: Nominated, "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)2001: Nominated, "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)2002: Nominated, "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)2003: Nominated, "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)2004: Nominated, "Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)Teen Choice Awards2000: Won, "Film - Choice Chemistry" — Scream 32002: Nominated, "Choice TV Actress, Comedy" — Friends2003: Nominated, "Choice TV Actress, Comedy" — Friends2005: Nominated, "Choice Movie Hissy Fit" — The Longest YardTV Guide Awards2000: Won, "Editor's Choice" — Friends (shared w/co-stars)TV Land Awards2006: Nominated, "Most Wonderful Wedding" — Friends (shared w/Matthew Perry)2007: Nominated, "Break Up That Was So Bad It Was Good" — Family Ties (shared w/Michael J.
