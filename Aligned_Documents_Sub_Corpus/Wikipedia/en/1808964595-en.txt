Dolostone is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite. It is usually referred to as dolomite rock. In old U.S.G.S. publications it was referred to as magnesian limestone. Most dolostone formed as a magnesium replacement of limestone or lime mud prior to lithification. It is resistant to erosion and can either contain bedded layers or be unbedded. It is less soluble than limestone in weakly acidic groundwater, but it can still develop solution features over time.The term dolostone was introduced to avoid confusion with the mineral dolomite. The usage of the term dolostone is controversial because the name dolomite was first applied to the rock during the late eighteenth century and thus has technical precedence. The use of the term dolostone is not recommended by the Glossary of Geology published by the American Geological Institute (AGI). It is, however, used in some geological publications.ReferencesCategory:Sedimentary rocks Category:Limestonecs:Dolomit (hornina) de:Dolomit (Gestein) et:Dolokivi es:Dolomía fr:Dolomie it:Dolomia he:דולומיט nl:Dolomiet ja:苦灰岩 pl:Dolomit ro:Dolomit (rocă) sk:Dolomit (hornina) tr:Dolomit
