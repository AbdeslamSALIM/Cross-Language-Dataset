I Did It Again is the sophomore album by American pop singer Britney Spears, released on May 16, 2000 on Jive Records.[[Reception]]The album received generally positive reviews from critics resulting in the reviews being more positive than Spears's previous album. Rolling Stone gave the album a 3.5 rating calling the album "fantastic pop cheese, with much better song-factory hooks than 'N Sync or BSB get", this was a huge step up from the 2 star rating they gave Spears for her previous album.Allmusic gave the album a 4 star rating saying "It has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made ...Baby One More Time".NME reported (with a score of 8 out of 10) that "She's modern-day pop perfection realised in a nearly, human form," though it also refers to her as an "evil genius" and rather cynically compares her music to the addictive drug ketamine, based on the drug's tendency to blank the user's mind and thought processes.Chart performanceOops!...
