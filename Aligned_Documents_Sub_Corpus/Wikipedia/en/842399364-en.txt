The team was founded as Fußball-Klub Alemania Augsburg in 1907 and played as BC Augsburg from 1921 to 1969.History[[Image:BC Augsburg.png|thumb|100px|left|Logo of BC Augsburg 1921-69.]] In the face of impending financial collapse, BC merged with the football side of TSV Schwaben Augsburg in July 1969 to form FC Augsburg, however Schwaben was unhappy with the result and re-formed its own football team in 1970. For this reason, FCA is generally not considered to carry on the traditions of TSV Schwaben, only those of BC Augsburg.Prior to World War II the club's best performance came as a second place finish in the Gauliga Bayern in 1940. After the war it played regularly in the top-flight Oberliga Süd with occasional laspes which dropped it to the second division.Play in the 2. BundesligaSince the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963, the Augsburg side has spent most of its time in tier III leagues. They managed two seasons in the 1960s in 2.Bundesliga, and enjoyed another eight seasons at that level in the mid-70s and early 80s. The club's most successful season was undoubtedly 1973-74 when, freshly promoted to Regionalliga Süd, they won the league with a team led by Helmut Haller and missed out on an advance to the Bundesliga by only one point. A highlight of that season was the away game at its old rival TSV 1860 München which attracted 90,000 spectators. However, the club could not match this success in the following seasons and was back in the Bayernliga in 1979-80. They advanced to the national amateur final that year where they dropped a 1:2 decision to VfB Stuttgart II.In 1981 and 1983 the club returned once more to the 2nd Bundesliga, just to be relegated straight away again. In 1983, a young FCA team missed survival by just three goals, being on equal points with the 16th placed Union Solingen. In 1994 they had another try at promotion in the last year of promotion play-offs to the 2nd Bundesliga. However, the Bavarian champion was not grouped with the other southern German clubs as in previous years and had to face stronger clubs in the northern group that included Eintracht Braunschweig and Fortuna Düsseldorf. Despite being overmatched and unable to advance, they still had good support in the region with crowds of 20,000 plus turning up at these games.Financial crisis and return to the 2. BundesligaWhen a potential investor backed out, the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association) denied the debt-laden team a license, and as a result, the 2000-01 and 2001-02 seasons were spent in the Oberliga Bayern (IV) before a return to the Regionalliga Süd (III). FCA came achingly close to advancing to 2.Bundesliga in 2005, but missed their oppourtunity after giving up two goals to Jahn Regensburg in the last four minutes of their final game of the season. The club dominated the Regionalliga Süd the next year, winning the league and clinching a berth in the 2nd Bundesliga for the 2006-07. This marked their first appearance in the 2nd Bundesliga in 23 years. They finished the campaign in seventh place on 52 points, only 8 points away from promotion to the top-flight. One again, the game at TSV 1860 was the highlight, with a 3-0 victory for Augsburg in front of 69,000 in the Allianz Arena. Ralf Loose replaced Rainer Hörgl as head coach in October 2007 when the club found itself in the relegation zone. Loose's contract was terminated on 16 April 2008 after a string of bad results. He was replaced with Holger Fach two days later. The club avoided relegation on goal average, being on equal points with relegated side Kickers Offenbach at the end of the season.The long time home ground of the FCA, Rosenau Stadion, built from World War II rubble, may finally come to its well deserved rest in 2009 when a new stadion is slated to be completed. The new Impuls Arena is also scheduled to host games of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.Youth and amateur sidesThe historically indifferent performance of the senior side was offset by the success of the club's youth team, which captured a national championship in the under-18's in 1993, being the last non-Bundesliga club to do so. They also took several Cup titles in the early 1990s. Today, the under-18's and under-16's youth teams play in the Bayernliga-Süd, the second tier of youth football.FC Augsburg's reserve team currently plays in the Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V), having been promoted to the league in 2004. The club did not field a reserves team at all between 1989 and 1997, preferring instead to concentrate on its successful youth program.The FC Augsburg II finished fourth in their league in the 2006-07 and 2007-08 seasons and remains at this level for the 2008-09 season.FC Augsburg seasonsFC AugsburgYearDivisionPosition1969-70Amateurliga Bayern4th1970-71Amateurliga Bayern3rd1971-72Amateurliga Bayern8th1972-73Amateurliga Bayern1st ↑1973-74Regionalliga Süd1st1974-752nd Bundesliga Süd12th1975-762nd Bundesliga Süd15th1976-772nd Bundesliga Süd9th1977-782nd Bundesliga Süd14th1978-792nd Bundesliga Süd18th ↓1979-80Amateur Oberliga Bayern1st ↑1980-812nd Bundesliga Süd18th ↓1981-82Amateur Oberliga Bayern1st ↑1982-832nd Bundesliga17th ↓1983-84Amateur Oberliga Bayern7th1984-85Amateur Oberliga Bayern2nd1985-86Amateur Oberliga Bayern3rd1986-87Amateur Oberliga Bayern6th1987-88Amateur Oberliga Bayern6th1988-89Amateur Oberliga Bayern4th|YearDivisionPosition1989-90Amateur Oberliga Bayern3rd1990-91Amateur Oberliga Bayern3rd1991-92Amateur Oberliga Bayern4th1992-93Amateur Oberliga Bayern6th1993-94Amateur Oberliga Bayern1st1994-95Regionalliga Süd9th1995-96Regionalliga Süd11th1996-97Regionalliga Süd11th1997-98Regionalliga Süd10th1998-99Regionalliga Süd14th1999-2000Regionalliga Süd8th ↓2000-01Oberliga Bayern4th2001-02Oberliga Bayern1st ↑2002-03Regionalliga Süd3rd2003-04Regionalliga Süd4th2004-05Regionalliga Süd4th2005-06Regionalliga Süd1st ↑2006-072nd Bundesliga7th2007-082nd Bundesliga15th2008-092nd Bundesliga|FC Augsburg IIYearDivisionPosition2002-03Bezirksliga Schwaben-Süd (VII)1st ↑2003-04Bezirksoberliga Schwaben (VI)1st ↑2004-05Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V)10th2005-06Landesliga Bayern-Süd5th2006-07Landesliga Bayern-Süd4th2007-08Landesliga Bayern-Süd4th2008-09Landesliga Bayern-Süd (VI)HonoursGauliga Bayern (I) runner-up: 1940Regionalliga Süd (II) champions: 1974, 20062nd Oberliga Süd (II) champions: 1961Bayernliga (II-III-IV) champions: 1948(BCA), 1966(BCA), 1973, 1980, 1982, 1994, 2002Schwaben Cup Winners winners: 1965(BCA), 1969-1972, 1980, 1986, 1988, 1993, 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005Overall tablesIn the overall tables of the Oberliga Süd (1945-63), 2nd Bundesliga (1974-2007), Regionalliga Süd (1963-74/1994-2007) and Bayernliga (1963-2007) the FC Augsburg ranks as follows:LeaguePlaceSeasonsGamesWinDrawLoseGFGAPointsOberliga Süd14th14432138772177379833532nd Bundesliga36th83009673131432509361Regionalliga Süd8th1237814892138567528536Bayernliga5th1964634115115412737301174Source:Source:Source:Managers11/1989 - 3/1990 Dieter Schatzschneider4/1990 - 6/1990 Gernot Fuchs7/1990 - 6/1995 Armin Veh7/1995 - 9/1996 Karsten Wettberg9/1996 - 12/1996 Helmut Riedel1/1997 - 4/1998 Hubert Müller4/1998 - 6/1998 Helmut Riedel (2nd time)7/1998 - 6/1999 Gerd Schwickert7/1999 - 11/1999 Alfons Higl11/1999- 12/1999 Heiner Schuhmann (4th time)1/2000 - 6/2000 Hans-Jürgen Boysen7/2000 - 6/2002 Gino Lettieri7/2002 - 9/2003 Ernst Middendorp10/2003- 9/2004 Armin Veh (2nd time)9/2004 - 9/2007 Rainer Hörgl9/2007 - 4/2008 Ralf Loose4/2008 - present Holger FachSource:Famous players Helmut Haller, who scored against England in the 1966 World Cup final, made 19 appearances for the West German national team while playing for Augsburg from 1957 to 1962.

Considering the opposite directions the two clubs have since taken, it is hard to imagine FCA avenging this defeat in the near future.

It began in earnest in 1973-74 when both clubs played for Bundesliga promotion in the Regionalliga Süd and carried on in the 2nd Bundesliga Süd. It heated up again in the Bayernliga from 1983 to 1993 when both tried unsuccessfully for years to return to professional football. After this, their ways parted for 13 years, till FCA regained its 2nd Bundesliga status in 2006. Since then, their games against each other have become huge crowd magnets for the region, well above 2nd Division standards. The Rosenaustadion with its current capacity of 28.000 has both times been sold out and the Allianz Arena in Munich with a capacity of 69.000 comes close.The games since 2005:SeasonLeagueTeamsResultSpectatorsDate2006-072nd BundesligaFC Augsburg - TSV 1860 München3 - 028.00027-10-20062006-072nd BundesligaTSV 1860 München - FC Augsburg0 - 369.00016-03-20072007-082nd BundesligaFC Augsburg - TSV 1860 München2 - 628.00012-08-20072007-082nd BundesligaTSV 1860 München - FC Augsburg0 - 357.40003-02-2008Source:External linksOfficial team siteThe Abseits Guide to German SoccerReferences    Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1907 Category:German football clubs Category:Bavarian football clubs FC Augsburgaf:FC Augsburg bar:FC Augschburg de:FC Augsburg es:FC Augsburg fr:FC Augsburg it:FC Augsburg hu:FC Augsburg nl:FC Augsburg ja:FCアウクスブルク no:FC Augsburg pl:FC Augsburg pt:FC Augsburg sv:FC Augsburg zh:奧格斯堡足球俱乐部
