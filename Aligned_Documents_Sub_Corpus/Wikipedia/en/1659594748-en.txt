  |birth_place = Le Mans, France |occupation = Lawyer |spouse = Penelope Fillon |religion = Roman Catholic |party = UMP François Fillon (; born 4 March 1954 in Le Mans, Sarthe) is the current Prime Minister of France, having been appointed to that office by President Nicolas Sarkozy on 17 May 2007.As a member of the UMP party, Fillon became Jean-Pierre Raffarin's Minister of Labour in 2002 and undertook controversial reforms of the 35-hour working week law and of the French retirement system (Loi Fillon). He became Minister of Education and Research in 2004 and proposed the much debated Fillon law on Education. In 2005, he was not included in the new government headed by Dominique de Villepin, but was elected senator for the Sarthe département. His role as a political advisor in Nicolas Sarkozy's successful race for president led to his current role.Early lifeThe Fillon family has its roots in the Sarthe area.François Fillon's father is a civil law notary, whilst his mother, Anne Fillon, is a celebrated French historian and his youngest brother, Dominique, is a talented pianist.Fillon lives with his wife, Penelope, and five children, Marie, Charles, Antoine, Édouard and Arnaud, in the 12th century Château de Beaucé, set in 20 acres (8 ha) of woodland on the banks of the River Sarthe at Sablé-sur-Sarthe, near the famous monastery village of Solesmes, about halfway between Le Mans and Angers. M. and Mme Fillon resided in various other properties, always in the Sarthe, throughout their marriage, before buying Beaucé in 1993.Family roots and connections with United Kingdom[[Image:Fillon-181207.jpg|thumb|François Fillon speaking in the Assemblée nationale.]]Fillon has a reputation as an Anglophile and has had speaking engagements at a wide variety of universities in Britain, notably the London School of Economics.His wife Penelope Kathryn Clarke was born in the village of Llanover, near Abergavenny in Wales, like him the child of a solicitor. They met while she was teaching English in her gap year in Le Mans, and they were married in the bride's family church in June 1980. Many notable guests attended their wedding, including the famous solicitor Gillian Powell, and her husband Graham. Fillon's younger brother, Pierre, an ophthalmic specialist, later married Penelope Fillon's younger sister, Jane.Both brothers may have been naturalized British citizens, and thus the French Prime Minister of France is possibly a Briton by marriage.Having lived all his life in the Le Mans area and now representing it politically, Fillon is an enthusiastic supporter of the city's famous 24 hour sportscar race, which he has attended nearly every year since he was a small child. He is a member of the Automobile Club de l'Ouest, which stages the event, and is on the race's organisation committee. He has competed himself in the Le Mans Legend historic sportscar races on the full 24 hour circuit and in a number of other classic road rallies.On 9 July 2007, Yves Courage of Courage Compétition offered Fillon a chance to drive a Courage LC75 prototype around the smaller Bugatti Circuit at Le Mans where Courage is based.LM Story : Le Premier Ministre François Fillon teste la Courage LC75. - Endurance Info - Endurance Info WebSite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; His best time was 1:50.300 after ten laps.LM Story - Le Premier Ministre François Fillon pilote la Courage LC75 LMP2 ! - My first weblog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Professional résuméEducation1972, Baccalaureat, Philosophy stream.1976, MA Public Law, Université du Mans.1977, DEA in Public Law, University of Paris V: René Descartes.DEA in Political Science, Sciences Po.Political careerEarly appointments1976 to 1977, Parliamentary Assistant to Joël Le Theule, deputy of Sarthe.1977 to 1978, Chief Assistant of the Cabinet to Joël Le Theule, Minister of Transportation.In 1980, Chief Assistant of the Cabinet to Joël Le Theule, Minister of Defense.In 1981, Chief of the Service of Legislative and Parliamentary Work to the Cabinet of Michel Giraud, Minister of Industry.Local elective career1981 - 1986, elected city council member of Sablé-sur-Sarthe.Deputy-mayor, in charge of the economic affairs.March 1983 - 2001, Mayor of Sablé-sur-Sarthe.February 1981 - 1998, General Council member for the canton of Sablé-sur-Sarthe.March 1985, vice-president of the General Council, in charge of the Economic affairs.1992 - 1998, President of the General Council of Sarthe.Since 1998, Regional Council member of Pays de la Loire.From April 1998 to May 2004, President of the Regional Council of Pays de la Loire.Since 2001, city council member of Solesmes in Sarthe.President of the Communauté de communes de Sablé-sur-Sarthe.Party positions1997, National Secretary of RPR, in charge of the Federations.1998, Executive Commission Spokesman of RPR.1999, candidate at the RPR leadership election (eliminated in the first round)Since 2002, founder member of Union en Mouvement, writer of the project of Union en Mouvement ("Our vision for France") and President of the Association France.9.Parliamentary careerIn 1981, 1986, 1988, 1993, 1997,2002 and 2007, elected and re-elected to the National Assembly for the 4th district of Sarthe, running for the UMP.Member of the Commission of Defense.President of the France-Thailand Friendship Group.In 2005, elected senator from the Sarthe.Ministerial careerApril 1993 - 1995, Minister for the Higher education and Research.May - November 1995, Minister of Postal Services and Information Technologies, then Minister delegated to the Postal Services, Telecommunications and Space.May 2002 - March 2004, Minister of Social Affairs, Work and Solidarity.March 2004 - June 2005, Minister of National Education, Higher Education and Research17 May 2007 - Appointed Prime Minister of France by President Nicolas SarkozyPrime MinisterThe day after he became President, Nicolas Sarkozy appointed Fillon as Prime Minister of France, charging him with the task of forming a new cabinet, which was announced on 18 May 2007.Communiqué de la Présidence de la République concernant la composition du gouvernement de M.
