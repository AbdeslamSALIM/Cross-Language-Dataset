He studied in Zürich, Berlin, London and Vienna, and obtained his doctorate in Berne in 1865. In 1872, he succeeded Georg Albert Lücke as Ordinary Professor of Surgery and Director of the University Surgical Clinic at the Inselspital in Berne. He published works on a number of subjects other than the thyroid gland including hemostasis, antiseptic treatments, surgical infectious diseases, on gunshot wounds, acute osteomyelitis, the theory of strangulated hernia, and abdominal surgery. His new ideas on the thyroid gland were initially controversial but his successful treatment of goiter with a steadily decreasing mortality rate soon won him recognition. The prize money, from the Nobel prize he received, helped him to establish the Kocher Institute in Berne.A number of instruments and surgical techniques (for example, the Kocher manoeuvre) are named after him, as well as the Kocher-Debre-Semelaigne syndrome.External linksNobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1901-1921, Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1967Universität Bern - Theodor Kocher&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt; at www.tki.unibe.chUniversität Bern - Theodor Kocher Institut - Home&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt; at www.tki.unibe.ch Category:Swiss scientists Category:Nobel laureates in Physiology or Medicine Category:Swiss Nobel laureates Category:People from Bern (city) Category:1841 births Category:1917 deathsar:تيودور كوخر ca:Emil Theodor Kocher cs:Emil Theodor Kocher de:Emil Theodor Kocher es:Emil Theodor Kocher eu:Emil Kocher fr:Emil Theodor Kocher ko:에밀 테오도어 코허 hr:Emil Theodor Kocher id:Theodor Kocher it:Emil Theodor Kocher nl:Emil Theodor Kocher ja:エーミール・テオドール・コッハー pl:Emil Theodor Kocher pt:Emil Theodor Kocher ro:Emil Theodor Kocher ru:Кохер, Эмиль Теодор sv:Theodor Kocher zh:埃米爾·特奧多爾·科赫爾
