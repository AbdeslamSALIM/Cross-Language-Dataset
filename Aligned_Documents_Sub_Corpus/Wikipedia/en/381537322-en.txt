  [[Image:America rugiente 1969.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''América rugiente'' (Cinque figli di cane, 1969) poster, shows the mix of Italian, Spanish and American names typical of spaghetti westerns]] Spaghetti Western, also known in some countries in mainland Europe as the Italo-Western, is a nickname for a broad sub-genre of Western film that emerged in the mid-1960s, so named because most were produced by Italian studios, usually in coproduction with a Spanish partner.The typical team was made up of an Italian director, Spanish technical staff and a cast of Italian and Spanish actors and sometimes a falling Hollywood star. The films were primarily shot in the Andalusia region of Spain, and in particular the Tabernas Desert of Almería, because it resembles the American Southwest. (A few were shot on Sardinia.) Because of the desert setting and the readily available southern Spanish extras, a usual theme in Spaghetti Westerns is the Mexican Revolution, Mexican bandits, and the border region shared by Mexico and the U.S..HistoryOriginally Spaghetti Westerns had in common the Italian language, low budgets, and a recognizable highly fluid, violent, and minimalist cinematography that eschewed (some said "demythologized") many of the conventions of earlier Westerns — partly intentionally, partly as a result of the work being done in a different cultural background and with limited funds. The term was originally used disparagingly, but by the 1980s many of these films came to be held in high regard, particularly because of influence they had on other Westerns.[[Image:DannyPose.jpg|200px|thumb|Alex Nicol with Maria Granada and Richard Basehart in The Savage Guns.]] Paradoxically enough, the movie that qualifies as the very first Spaghetti Western, The Savage Guns / Tierra brutal (1961), showed no Italian involvement at all, being a British-Spanish coproduction, but it was shot in Almería and featured the very heterogeneous cast that later became typical of any film of the genre (in this case combining ex-Hollywood US actors Richard Basehart and Alex Nicol with the Spanish folklóricas Paquita Rico and María Granada); the whole being directed by an English specialist in horror B movies, Michael Carreras.The best-known and perhaps archetypal Spaghetti Westerns were the Man With No Name trilogy (or the Dollars Trilogy) directed by Sergio Leone, starring then-TV actor Clint Eastwood and with musical scores composed by Ennio Morricone (all of whom are now synonymous with the genre): A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966). Atypically for the genre, the last had a relatively high budget, over one million $USD. Leone's next film after the so-called "trilogy" was Once Upon a Time in the West, which is often lumped in with the previous three for its similar style and accompanying score by Morricone, although it differs by the absence of Clint Eastwood in the starring role.Notable films  Tierra brutal / The Savage Guns (1961)El llanero (1963)Gringo / Duello nel Texas (1963)Cavalca e uccidi / Brandy, el sheriff de Losatumba (1964)Relevo para un pistolero (1964)A Fistful of Dollars (1964)For a Few Dollars More (1965)The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)Navajo Joe (1966)Django (1966)The Big Gundown (1967)A Bullet for the General (1967)Face to Face (1967)Day of Anger (1967)Death Rides a Horse (1967)A Minute to Pray (1967)Ace High (1968)The Great Silence (1968)If You Meet Sartana Pray for Your Death (1968)The Mercenary (1968)Once Upon a Time in the West (1969)The Price of Power (1969)Sabata (1969)Cinque figli di cane / América rugiente (1969)Compañeros (1970)A Fistful of Dynamite (1971)They Call Me Trinity (1971)Storm Rider (1972)Trinity Is STILL My Name!
