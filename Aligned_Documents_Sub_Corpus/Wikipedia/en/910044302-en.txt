Initially, Baumann wanted to work in the area of confectionery and bakery. This; however, did not last long as his desire for dancing clicked with the development of the breakdancing after his high-school graduation. Having been involved within numerous dance-contests, René managed to reach the top-10 of the German dance-contest "Disco Kings" with his acrobatic dance style.Baumann began his DJ career in 1985 a year after which he was a runner-up in the Swiss DJ Championshipshttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/bobo_dj/bio.jhtml&quot;DJ_BoBo/bio_on_vh1.com&quot;vh1.com. . He continued to work as a DJ at numerous Night-clubs such as Don Paco and the Hazyland both in Swizerland through which he gathered enough experience and later desided to produce his own record. His first single "I Love You" came out in late 1989 during which time he would still spin records as a DJ but focusing on future releases of his own production. In 1991, DJ BoBo released two other singles "Ladies in the House" and "Let's Groove On".Career breakthroughRené's enormous success wasn't far from this point as in November 1992 his Europe-wide smash hit "Somebody Dance with Me" was released which landed in the Top-10 of many countries including the German and Swedish official single chartshttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/bobo_dj/bio.jhtml&quot;DJ_BoBo/bio_on_vh1.com&quot;vh1.com. . His second hit "Keep on Dancing" reached the top-10 both at home and outside and earned him a Gold status in Germany (with sales of 250.000 sold singles). The long awaited album Dance with Me was awarded a Platinum certification in Switzerland and remained in the charts all over Europe for quite some time which was followed by the single "Take Control" earning him another Gold in Germany meanwhile reaching the top positions in the charts of many countrieshttp://www.vh1.com/artists/az/bobo_dj/bio.jhtml&quot;DJ_BoBo/bio_on_vh1.com&quot;vh1.com. . At this point, DJ BoBo appeared to have already separated himself from one-hit wonders as his single "Everybody" released in the summer of 1994 climbed as high as number 2 in Germany and was certified Platinum for selling 500,000 units.In the fall of 1994, his second album "There is a Party" came out which was introduced by the first single "Let the Dream Come True". The follow-up second single "Love is All Around" was awarded with the sixth Golden Record in a row. During the course of this ongoing success, in 1995, DJ BoBo represented Switzerland in World Music Award in Monaco with his "Everybody" for being the "World's best selling Swiss Artist of the Year".In the summer of 1995, DJ BoBo went on a tour which took place most parts of Asia which was followed by a promotional tour in Australia.

In Switzerland, it even jumped from 0 to number 1 and was awarded Double-Platinum for selling 100,000 units which was ranked in the top 40 albums of all time, after remaining on the Swiss album chart for a staggering 67 weekshttp://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6509&quot;DJ_BoBo_on_esctoday.com&quot;esctoday.com. .

A month thereafter, in April of 1998, his album Magic was released which managed to stay in the number one position for four consecutive weeks in his native country.

The Album eventually became a Platinum record in Switzerland. In 2003, DJ BoBo received yet another World Music Award for being Switzerland's Best Selling Artist of the year.Baumann's one of the most successful singles turned out to be his single "Chihuahua" which initially was released in 2002 and later re-released again Europe-wide. The track was produced upon the request of Coca-Cola in Spain. They were in search of an artist who could produce an attention-drawing mambo-song for their new campaign.

The council earned some negative comments for the selection as not having been fair towards lesser known Swiss artists.On February 21 2007, DJ BoBo revealed both the song and the video he would enter the Eurovision Song Contest in Helsinki with. The song was entitled "Vampires Are Alive."Despite being one of the favorites to win the contest according to many bookmakers, the song failed to get past the semi-final stage on May 12.
