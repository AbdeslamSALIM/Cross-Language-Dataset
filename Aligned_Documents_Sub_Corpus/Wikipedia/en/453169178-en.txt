Maurice Béjart (January 1, 1927 – November 22, 2007) was a French and Swiss choreographer who ran the Béjart Ballet Lausanne in Switzerland. He was the son of the French philosopher Gaston Berger.He was born in Marseille, France and founded the Ballet de l'Etoile company in 1954. In 1960 he founded the Ballet du XXe Siècle in Brussels.In 1987 he moved to Lausanne in Switzerland, where he founded the Béjart Ballet Lausanne, one of the most famous and successful dance companies in the world.He made significant contribution to the Persian Ballet Repertoire in the late 1960s and 1970s performing at the famous Roudaki Hall in Tehran created under the supervision of the former Empress of Iran, with whom he kept strong ties of friendship over the years.The Modern Magazine for Persian Weddings, Cuisine, Culture &amp; Community&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Among his works is a thoroughly revised version of The Nutcracker, presumably inspired by his own life story, which he staged in 2000. It still uses Tchaikovsky's original score, but completely scraps the original plot and characters, instead supplying a new story about a boy's efforts to re-connect with his mother. We also are given a look into the boy's strange sexual fantasies. The production design is full of erotic images — some of which are most likely shocking to many, such as wombs and vaginal openings. http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/showreview.php3?ID=759 One of the characters is Marius Petipa, who becomes Mephisto. Another character is called Felix the Cat, presumably after the famous cartoon character. The production has been issued on DVD.Dance schoolsBéjart was the founder of several dance schools:the Mudra School in Brussels, 1970-1988;the Mudra Afrique School in Dakar, 1977-1985;the Rudra School in Lausanne, 1992-present.The Rudra School is still open and is one of the most famous professional dance schools in the world.External links[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2925396.ece Obituary in The Times, 23 November 2007]Official biography (in French)Béjart Ballet LausanneRudra Béjart SchoolObituary in The Guardian UKReferencesCategory:1927 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Erasmus Prize winners Category:French choreographers Category:Naturalised citizens of Switzerland Category:Prix Benois de la Danse winners Category:Dance directors of La Monnaie Category:People from Marseillebg:Морис Бежар cs:Maurice Béjart da:Maurice Béjart de:Maurice Béjart es:Maurice Béjart fa:موریس بژار fr:Maurice Béjart it:Maurice Béjart he:מוריס בז'אר la:Mauritius Béjart lb:Maurice Béjart nl:Maurice Béjart ja:モーリス・ベジャール pms:Maurice Béjart pl:Maurice Béjart pt:Maurice Béjart ro:Maurice Béjart ru:Морис Бежар scn:Maurice Béjart sk:Maurice Béjart fi:Maurice Béjart sv:Maurice Béjart uk:Бежар Моріс
