Science Fiction Writers of America, or SFWA ( or ), was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight. The organization has since changed its name to Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Inc., but continues with the acronym SFWA after a very brief use of the acronym SFFWA.SFWA is a non-profit association of science fiction and fantasy writers. Most members live in the United States. Active membership is limited to professionally published authors in the genres of science fiction, fantasy, or horror; the minimum qualification is the sale of one novel or dramatic script, or three short stories to venues with certain minimum circulations or pay rates. Associate membership is for professionally published authors who have not yet qualified for Active membership. The "America" in the organization's title refers to the fact that the primary focus of SFWA's author advocacy concerns publishing in the U. S. A. Authors (regardless of nationality or residence) must be professionally published in the English language in order to qualify as SFWA members. SFWA boasts approximately 1,500 members as of 2007.SFWA presents the Nebula Award each year for the best short story, novelette, novella, novel, and script. It also gives the Andre Norton Award each year for Best Young Adult novel, the occasional Bradbury award for best dramatic presentation, the Author Emeritus recognition to a senior writer whose major impact was long ago or overlooked, and the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award for a lifetime's extraordinary achievement in science fiction or fantasy.SFWA maintains a web site that provides a lot of information for writers. A popular feature of the site is Writer Beware, which provides information and warnings about literary scams, schemes, and pitfalls.PresidentsDamon Knight (1965-1967)Robert Silverberg (1967-1968)Alan E.
