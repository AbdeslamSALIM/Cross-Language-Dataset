 Birkenfeld is a district (Landkreis) in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Sankt Wendel (Saarland), Trier-Saarburg, Bernkastel-Wittlich, Rhein-Hunsrück, Bad Kreuznach and Kusel.HistoryIn the past, the Nahe River was the boundary between two tiny principalities: Birkenfeld west of the Nahe, and Lichtenberg east of the river. The principality of Birkenfeld was annexed by Oldenburg in 1817; Lichtenberg became an exclave of Saxe-Coburg. The latter unit was bought by Prussia in 1834 and became the District of Sankt Wendel.After World War I the southern half of Sankt Wendel had to be ceded to the newly-created Saarland territory, and the small part remaining in Prussia was then officially called Restkreis Sankt Wendel ("remaining district of Sankt Wendel"). In 1937 the Oldenburgian District of Birkenfeld was merged with the remaining Sankt Wendel District to form the new Prussian District of Birkenfeld.Following World War II 24 more villages were ceded to the Saarland. It was not before 1970 that the district got its present borders.GeographyThe Nahe River runs through the district from south to north. The portions west of the river are located on the eastern slopes of the Hunsrück Mountains.Coat of armsTowns and municipalitiesVerband-free town: Idar-ObersteinVerbandsgemeinden1seat of the Verbandsgemeinde; 2townExternal linksOfficial website (German) Category:Districts of Rhineland-Palatinatede:Landkreis Birkenfeld es:Distrito de Birkenfeld eo:Distrikto Birkenfeld fr:Arrondissement de Birkenfeld id:Birkenfeld (distrik) nl:Birkenfeld (district) pl:Powiat Birkenfeld pt:Birkenfeld (distrito) ro:Birkenfeld (district) ru:Биркенфельд (район) zh:比肯费尔德县
