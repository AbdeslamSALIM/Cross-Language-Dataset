As deputy director of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov solidified his reputation in Moscow as a competent analyst in matters of domestic and external security. Aleksei Makarkin and Valeria Sycheva, "Putin's Electoral Staff Opens Inside Security Council" Segodnya, p. 2 Russian Press Digest, November 16, 1999 On November 15 1999 Ivanov was appointed secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, an advisory body charged with formulating presidential directives on national security, by Boris Yeltsin. In that position, Ivanov replaced Putin as Yeltsin's national security adviser upon Putin's promotion to the premiership.As secretary, Ivanov was responsible for coordinating the daily work of the council, led by the president. But Ivanov's role as secretary was initially unclear to media observers. At the time of his appointment, the Security Council was a relatively new institution. (The council was set up by Yeltsin's tutelage in 1991-1992. http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol12/staar.html) Between 1992 and Ivanov's appointment in 1999, Yeltsin used the council as political expediency had dictated, but had not allow it to emerge as a relatively strong and autonomous institution. http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol12/staar.html Ivanov's predecessors in that post, including Putin, according to Western analysts, were either the second most powerful political figure in Russia or the just another functionary lacking close access to the center of state power, depending on their relationship with Yeltsin. http://www.bu.edu/iscip/vol12/staar.htmlDefense Ministermeets with Russian Minister of Defense Sergei Ivanov at the G8 meeting for the Ministers of Foreign Affairs on June 29 2006.]]Ivanov was named by Vladimir Putin, who had succeeded Yeltsin as President on December 31 1999, as Russia's Minister of Defense in March 2001. That month Ivanov stepped down as secretary of the Security Council, but remained a member. Ivanov had resigned from military service around a year earlier, and was a civilian while serving as secretary of the Security Council. Ivanov therefore became Russia's first civilian defense minister. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021501526_pf.html Putin called the personnel changes in Russia's security structures coinciding with Ivanov's appointment as defense minister "a step toward demilitarizing public life." Putin also stressed Ivanov's responsibility for overseeing military reform as defense minister. http://www.ufg.com/pr/press_kit/ufg_russia_index_2006_en.pdfUnsurprisingly to specialists on Russia, Ivanov became bogged down in the sheer difficulty of his duties as Defense Minister. But despite bureaucratic inertia and corruption in the military, Ivanov did preside over some changes the form of a shift towards a more professional army. Although Ivanov was not successful in abandoning the draft, he did downsize it. http://www.ufg.com/pr/press_kit/ufg_russia_index_2006_en.pdfAs Defense Minister, Ivanov worked with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to expand Russian-U.S. cooperation against international terrorist threats to both states. http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/sept_11/rumsfeld_015.htmOn May 2001, Ivanov was elected chairman of the Council of Commonwealth of Independent States Defense Ministers.(MAKS-2001)]]In October 2003 Sergei Ivanov claimed that Russia did not rule out a pre-emptive military strike anywhere in the world if the national interest demands it.Russia bares its military teeth, BBC News, October 2 2003.In 2004, Sergei Ivanov, then acting Defence Minister, pledged state support to the suspects in Chechen leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev's assassination detained in Qatar and declared that their imprisonment was illegal.Sergei Ivanov has promised to strive for discharge of the Russian prisoners in Qatar.

Kommersant, April 132004.In January 2006, Ivanov received criticism for his downplaying response to the public outcry over a particularly brutal hazing incident at a military base in the Urals, which involved Andrey Sychyov as a victim, whose legs and genitals were amputated due to the vicious beatings and abuse.Russian Soldier Brutally Hazed CBS NewsWashington Post (30 January 2006) — Violent Bullying of Russian Conscript ExposedHazing Trial Bares Dark Side of Russia's Military, The New York Times, August 11 2006http://www.ufg.com/pr/press_kit/ufg_russia_index_2006_en.pdfFrom time to time Ivanov has disconcerted Western audiences with the bluntness of his remarks on international military and political issues, though his political orientation is moderate and generally liberal on economic issues. In a series of public comments on the 2003-2004 elections, for instance, he unequivocally stated his opposition to rolling back the Western-style economic reforms and privatizations of the 1990s. http://www.ufg.com/pr/press_kit/ufg_russia_index_2006_en.pdfOn December 15 2006, in Moscow, Sergei Ivanov said to foreign correspondents about Alexander Litvinenko, murdered in London in November, which made headlines in the West: "For us, Litvinenko was nothing.

This speculation was intensified in November 2005 by Ivanov's promotion to the rank of Deputy Prime Minister. http://www.ufg.com/pr/press_kit/ufg_russia_index_2006_en.pdf The speculation was further intensified in February 2007 by Ivanov's promotion to the post of First Deputy Prime Minister, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/15/AR2007021501526_pf.html but they ceased after his colleague Dmitri Medvedev was nominated to run for presidency with Putin's backing.

Three months younger than Putin, Ivanov had been a student contemporary of Putin's in their hometown of Leningrad. Both completed competitive specialized secondary education programs (Putin in chemistry, Ivanov in English language) in Leningrad before attending Leningrad State University. http://www.russiaprofile.org/resources/whoiswho/alphabet/i/Ivanovsb.wbp Both completed postgraduate studies in counterintelligence; and both joined the foreign intelligence service shortly afterward.
