This place was also site of the first great jesuists missions of Guayra, having the borders around the north limits, the Paranapanema river, or according to other versions, the Tiete river, and the Iguazu river on the south.So, it used to be called Guayra o Guaira, to the big territory that nowadays corresponds to the state of Parana, around the XVI and XVIII centuries, there were cities which were founded by Spanish people(Ontiveros, Ciudad Real del Guayra, Villa Rica del Espiritu Santo) and some reductions founded by Jesuits, also under the Spanish jurisdiction, such as San Ignacio Guazu, Santa Maria del Iguazu (actual Foz do Iguacu) Pirapo, Loreto,etc.Such cities were devastated by the malocas of bandeirantes ensalveries from São Paulo, having to migrate great part of the population to the west of the Parana river (were Villa Rica was re founded-the actual Villarica-) or to the south of the Iguazu river (were San Ignacio was re founded-with the name of San Ignacio Mini- and Loreto among others).The Salto del Guayra (or Salto Canendiyu-called by the Brazilians Salto das Sete Quedas, on the Parana river, almost to the crossing with the parallel 24ªS, was the natural limit of the navegation of good depth of the river. Actually the Paraguayan city called Salto del Guaira, and the Brazilian Guaira, indicate approximately the place where such fall, beautiful and known, covered by the waters of the Itaipu dam, since the 1980´s.The Brazilian occupation on the region of the Guaira was concentrated in 1870, at the end of the War of the Triple Alliance, being later baptized with the name of Guaira, to the small department located in the center of the Oriental Region, in a territory which was not included in the original Guayra.LocationThe departament is in the central area of the Oriental Region Guaira, which name comes from guai: boys and ra: place, is one of the richest departments of the country, very fertile.

The city of Villa Rica del Espiritu Santo was founded by Ruy Diaz de Melgarejo on May 14th, 1570 in the ancient Guaira, today Brazilian territory.Always persecuted by the attacks of the bandeirants, the city suffers a migratory process which takes it to occupy seven different sites, before finally being established in 1682 where is now located: near the Ybyturuzu.The Franciscan missionaries helped with the process of consolidation, founding in 1686 a guarani reduction in the zone of Itape. In 1906 the IV department is created, conformed besides Villarica by Itape, Hiaty, Mbocayaty and Yataity. During the 20th century, the forestal exploitation as well as the yerva in the zone, closely bonded to the rich region of Caaguazu, and taking into account the great importance of the urban center of Villarrica, the train crosses from East to West a great part of the departmental territory, contributing this way of communication to the development of the department.FlagIt is divided in two horizontal zones of similar dimensions.
