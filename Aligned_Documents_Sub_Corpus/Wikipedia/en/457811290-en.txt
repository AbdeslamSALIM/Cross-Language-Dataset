Kataklysm is a Canadian death metal band. They call their musical style "northern hyperblast" after an advertisement in M.E.A.T. magazine describing another band, Fear Factory, as "hyperblast". The term refers to the extremely fast blast beats that Kataklysm's drummer, Max Duhamel, fuses into the music.BiographyKataklysm was formed in 1992. At the beginning of their career they were mostly known for being one of the fastest, most chaotic metal bands. However, their music changed after Sylvain Houde left the band, and bassist/backing vocalist Maurizio Iacono took over Houde's vocal duties, and another full-time bassist was recruited.In 1998, the band released Victims of this Fallen World, an album which was noted as being a change in musical style from previous albums. The following album The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate), however, saw the band return to its previous style, though less chaotic and with a touch of thrash metal.Drummer Max Duhamel is said to have been forced out of the band because of injuries. Eventually, Duhamel recovered from his injuries and participated on Kataklysm's ninth album, In the Arms of Devastation.Kataklysm's line-up has remained relatively stable compared to many other bands within the metal genre. The band only has one missing original member, Sylvain Houde. Drummers make out most of the band's "former members" list.The band's latest album is called Prevail.MusicKataklysm is well known for their incorporation of movie-quote samples in their music.Interview with Maurizio Iacono 09.March.2004They are a Death metal band, but are also known to experiment with Brutal, Melodic, Technical and Progressive elements of Death metal music into their music.MembersCurrent membersMaurizio Iacono – Vocals (formerly Bass)Jean-Francois Dagenais – GuitarsStephane Barbe – BassMax Duhamel – DrumsFormer membersSylvain Houde – VocalsMartin Maurais – DrumsNick Miller – DrumsAriel Saied – DrumsDiscographyStudio albumsSorcery (1995)Temple of Knowledge (1996)Victims of this Fallen World (1998)The Prophecy (Stigmata of the Immaculate) (2000)Epic: The Poetry of War (2001)Shadows &amp; Dust (2002)Serenity in Fire (2004)In the Arms of Devastation (2006)Prevail (2008)Live albumsNorthern Hyperblast Live (1998)Live in Deutschland - The Devastation Begins (2007)Demos / EPs / OtherThe Death Gate Cycle of Reincarnation (1992)The Mystical Gate of Reincarnation (1993)Vision the Chaos (1994)Sorcery &amp; the Mystical Gate of Reincarnation (1998)ReferencesExternal linksOfficial websiteOfficial MyspaceNuclear Blast's official websiteCategory:Canadian death metal musical groups Category:Canadian heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1991cs:Kataklysm de:Kataklysm es:Kataklysm fr:Kataklysm it:Kataklysm he:קטאקליסם nl:Kataklysm pl:Kataklysm pt:Kataklysm ru:Kataklysm sl:Kataklysm fi:Kataklysm sv:Kataklysm
