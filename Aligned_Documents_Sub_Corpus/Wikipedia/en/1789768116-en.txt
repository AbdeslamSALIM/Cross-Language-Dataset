The castle from which the city takes its name was built in the latter part of the 10th century by Raoul, prince of Déols. During the Middle Ages it was the seat of a seigniory, which was raised to the rank of countship in 1497. In 1616, when it was held by Henry II, prince of Condé, it was raised to the rank of duchy. In 1736 it returned to the crown, and was given to Marie Anne de Mailly-Nesle, duchess of Châteauroux, by Louis XV in 1744. The present Château Raoul housing the préfecture offices dates from the 15th century.LandmarksChâteau RaoulMusée BertrandMusée des Arts et Traditions PopulairesPublic Garden and the Jardins des CordeliersLe Parc de loisirs de Belle-IsleChateau de BougesConvent of the CordeliersChurch of St. MartialChurch of St. AndréChurch of Notre DameMusée du CompagnonnageQuartier St. ChristopheLa Prairie St. GildasEquinoxeLe TarmacFestivalsBals'artsVendredi...MusiqueFestival MultirythmesFestival Populaire du FolkloreFestival de théâtre "les Nocthalies"Rock à Belle-IsleStage festival de danse de Châteauroux (DARC)La Châteauroux Classic d'Indre Trophée FeniouxLa Biennale de Céramique contemporaineLes LitztomaniasSalon du livre de ChâteaurouxForum des associationsPersonalities born in ChâteaurouxHenri Gatien Bertrand (1773-1844), general of Napoleon's armyAlbert Aurier (1865-1892), symbolist poet, writer and art criticMarcel Boussac (1889-1980), entrepreneur and horse breederJack Claude Nezat (born 1943), author, City Councilor of Lésigny (France), initiator of Lésigny-Leingarten twinning, founder and first President of Rencontres Franco Allemandes, Annecy (Annecy-Bayreuth twinning)Gérard Depardieu (born 1948), actor and businessmanMardi Jacquet (born 1960), playmateOther personalitiesJean Lauron (1560-1620)Jean-Claude Guymon de la Touche (1723-1760)Pierre Leroux (1797-1871)Napoléon Chaix (1807-1865)Adolphe Combanaire (1859-1939)George-Albert Aurier (1865-1892)Fernand Maillaud (1862-1948)Bernard Naudin (1876-1946)Ernest Nivet (1871-1948)Émile Goué (1904-1946)Abbé PaviotÉdouard Ramonet (1909-1980)Louis SuardSister CitiesGütersloh (Germany) since 1977Bittou (a commune of Burkina Faso) since November 1985Olsztyn (Poland) since February 23, 1991See alsoBerrichonne de ChâteaurouxChâteauroux-Déols &quot;Marcel Dassault&quot; AirportMarie-Anne de Mailly-Nesle duchess de ChâteaurouxSaint-Benoît-du-SaultReferenceshttp://www.lameteo.org/chateauroux.htmlhttp://www.villes-et-villages-fleuris.com/chateaur.htmExternal linksCity of Châteauroux Official Website  Category:Communes of Indre Category:Prefectures in France category:towns and cities with zero-fare transportca:Châteauroux ceb:Châteauroux cs:Châteauroux da:Châteauroux de:Châteauroux es:Châteauroux eo:Châteauroux fr:Châteauroux it:Châteauroux (Indre) la:Castrum Radulphi lb:Châteauroux nl:Châteauroux ja:シャトールー no:Châteauroux nn:Châteauroux oc:Châteauroux pl:Châteauroux (Indre) pt:Châteauroux ro:Châteauroux ru:Шатору sl:Châteauroux sr:Châteauroux (Indre) fi:Châteauroux sv:Châteauroux vi:Châteauroux uk:Шатору vo:Châteauroux zh:沙托鲁
