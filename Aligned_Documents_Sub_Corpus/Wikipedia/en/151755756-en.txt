It was sometimes called "Hades" between 1955 and 1975.Sinope was the outermost known moon of Jupiter until the discovery of Megaclite in 2000. The most distant moon of Jupiter now known is .OrbitSinope orbits Jupiter on a high eccentricity and high inclination retrograde orbit. The orbital elements are as of January 2000. They are continuously changing due to Solar and planetary perturbations. It is often believed to belong to the Pasiphaë group.Sheppard, S. S.; and Jewitt, D.

J.; Gladman, B. J.; and Aksnes, K.; [http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301016 Photometric Survey of the Irregular Satellites], Icarus, Vol. 166 (2003), pp. 33-45 The diagram illustrates Sinope's orbital elements in relation to other satellites of the group. Sinope is also known to be in a secular resonance with Jupiter, similar to Pasiphae. However, Sinope can drop out of this resonance and has periods of both resonant and non resonant behaviour in time scales of 107 years.Physical characteristicsSinope has an estimated diameter of 38 km (assuming an albedo of 0.04) The satellite is red (colour indices B-V=0.84, R-V=0.46). unlike Pasiphae which is grey.Its infrared spectrum is similar to D-type asteroids also different from Pasiphae. These dissimilarities of the physical parameters suggest a different origin from the core members of the group.See alsoIrregular satelliteSinope in fictionEphemeris IAU-MPC NSESReferencesExternal linksSinope Profile by NASA's Solar System ExplorationDavid Jewitt pagesScott Sheppard pagesCategory:Jupiter's moons Category:Irregular satellitesals:Sinope (Mond) bs:Sinopa (mjesec) br:Sinope (loarenn) bg:Синопа (спътник) co:Sinope da:Sinope (måne) de:Sinope (Mond) es:Sinope (luna) fr:Sinopé (lune) ko:시노페 (위성) hr:Sinopa (mjesec) it:Sinope (astronomia) lv:Sinope (pavadonis) lt:Sinopė (palydovas) nl:Sinope (maan) ja:シノーペ (衛星) nn:Jupitermånen Sinope nds:Sinope (Maand) pl:Sinope (księżyc) simple:Sinope (moon) sk:Sinope (mesiac) sl:Sinopa (luna) sr:Синопе fi:Sinope (kuu) sv:Sinope (måne) zh:木卫九
