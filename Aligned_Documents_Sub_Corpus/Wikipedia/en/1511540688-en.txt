In order to avoid people associating the stadium's name with that of its competition TV Azteca, Televisa officially changed the stadium's name to "Guillermo Cañedo", a top executive and long-time football advocate at Televisa. The change took place in early 1997, following Cañedo's death (January 20, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. However the change did not go well with the general population, who generally refused to refer to the stadium by its alleged new name. Following a schism where two of Cañedo's sons, who worked at Televisa, switched camps and went to TV Azteca,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Televisa quietly returned the stadium's name to its original version. Some people did not even notice, as they usually referred to the stadium as &quot;Azteca&quot; (a tribute name to the [[Aztec]] heritage of Mexico City); during the name change. The stadium has been given the nickname of "Coloso de Santa Ursula" which, in English, means "Colossus of Santa Ursula", due to its large structure. Santa Ursula refers to the part of town where the stadium resides in Mexico City.Monuments and MemorialsA bronze plaque of Maradona's "Goal of the Century" was placed outside the stadium.
