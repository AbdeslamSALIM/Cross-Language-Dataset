 The family Scarabaeidae as presently defined consists of over 30,000 species of beetles worldwide. The species in this large family are often called scarabs or scarab beetles. The classification of this family is fairly unstable, with numerous competing theories, and new proposals appearing quite often. It is probable that many of the subfamilies listed here will no longer be recognized very much longer, as they will likely be reduced in status below subfamily rank, or elevated to family status (the latter is most likely, e.g., with the family "Melolonthidae" already appearing in some recent classifications). Other families have been removed recently, and are nearly universally accepted (e.g., Pleocomidae, Glaresidae, Glaphyridae, Ochodaeidae, Geotrupidae, Bolboceratidae)Scarabs are stout-bodied beetles, many with bright metallic colors, measuring between 5-60 mm. They have distinctive, clubbed antennae composed of plates called lamellae that can be compressed into a ball or fanned out like leaves to sense odors. The front legs are broad and adapted for digging.The C-shaped larvae, called grubs, are pale yellow or white. Most adult beetles are nocturnal, although the flower chafers (Cetoniinae) and many leaf chafers (Rutelinae) are active during the day. The grubs mostly live underground or under debris, so are not exposed to sunlight. Many scarabs are scavengers that recycle dung, carrion, or decaying plant material. Others, such as the Japanese beetle are devastating agricultural pests.In ancient Egypt, scarabs were revered as sacred. Some of the well-known beetles from the Scarabaeidae are Japanese beetles, dung beetles, June beetles, rose chafers, rhinoceros beetles, Hercules beetles and Goliath beetles.Several members of this family have shells which act as left-handed circular polarisers; this was the first-discovered example of circular polarization in nature.Gallery image:Liparetrus.jpg|''Liparetrus'' species; subfamily Melolonthinae Image:Scarabaeid sal.jpg|''Onthophagus'' species; subfamily Scarabaeinae Image:Punctate Flower Chafer02.jpg|Punctate Flower Chafers mating ReferencesExternal links Family SCARABAEIDAE[http://www.cirrusimage.com/beetles_japanese.htm Japanese Beetles Popillia japonica photos, description, natural history]June Beetles, Family: Scarabaeidae - Diagnostic photographs[http://www.cirrusimage.com/beetle_chafer_trichiotinus.htm Hairy Flower Chafer Beetle Trichiotinus piger reference photographs][http://www.cirrusimage.com/beetles_Euphoria_inda.htm Brown Fruit Chafer Euphoria inda reference photographs][http://www-museum.unl.edu/research/entomology/scarabcentral.htm Scarab Beetle Research, Databases, and Links from Scarab Central at University of Nebraska State Museum]An electronic checklist of the New World chafers (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae) (2005)Bibliography of literature published on scarab beetles since 1 January 2001 (worldwide coverage; through 2005)Checklist of the world Anoplognathini (2003)[http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/misc/beetles/rice_beetle.htm Dyscinetus morator, rice beetle] on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site[http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/orn/beetles/Euphoria_sepulcralis.htm Euphoria sepulcralis, a flower beetle] on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site[http://creatures.ifas.ufl.edu/orn/turf/sugarcane_grub.htm Tomarus subtropicus, sugarcane grub] on the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web siteCategory:Scarabaeidae Category:Beetlesbg:Листороги бръмбари ca:Escarabeid cs:Vrubounovití de:Blatthornkäfer et:Põrniklased es:Scarabaeidae fa:سرگین‌چرخانان fr:Scarabaeidae ko:풍뎅이과 io:Skarabeo it:Scarabaeidae he:זבליתיים lt:Plokštėtaūsiai nl:Bladsprietkevers ja:コガネムシ科 no:Skarabider pl:Żukowate pt:Escaravelho sv:Bladhorningar tr:Scarabaeidae zh:金龜子
