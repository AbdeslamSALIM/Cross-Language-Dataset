The word "kuna" means "marten" in Croatian since it is based on the use of marten pelts as units of value in medieval trading. It has no relation to the various currencies named "koruna" (translated as kruna in Croatian).Early usageDuring Roman times, in the provinces of upper and lower Pannonia (today Hungary and Slavonia), taxes were collected in the then highly valued marten skins. Hence, the Croatian word "marturina" or tax, derived from the Latin word "martus" (Croatian: "kuna"). The kuna was a currency unit in several Slavic states, most notably Kievan Rus and its successors until the early 15th century. It was equal to  (later ) gryvna of silver.In the Middle Ages, many foreign monies were used in Croatia, but since at least 1018 a local currency was in use. Between 1260 and 1380 the Croatian Viceroys were making a marten-adorned silver coin called the banovac http://www.hr/croatia/economy/money/historyhttp://www.hnb.hr/novcan/povijest/h-nastavak-3.htm. However, the diminishing autonomy of Croatia within the Croatia-Hungarian Kingdom led to the gradual disappearance of that currency.First kuna, 1939-1945The idea of a kuna currency reappeared in 1939 when the Banovina of Croatia, established within the Yugoslav Monarchy, planned to issue its own money.The Croatian kuna was introduced in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) on 26 July, 1941. It was subdivided into 100 banica. The kuna replace the Yugoslav dinar at par and was fixed to the German Reichsmark (RM) with dual exchange rates, one fixed at 20 kuna = 1 RM, the other a state-stimulated rate of31 December 1941 - 25.00 Kn = 1 RM31 December 1942 - 37.50 Kn = 1 RM31 December 1943 - 40.00 Kn = 1 RM31 December 1944 - 80.00 Kn = 1 RM6 May 1945 - 120.00 Kn = 1 RMThe kuna was withdrawn from circulation from 30 June to 9 July, 1945 and replaced by the 1944 issue of the Yugoslav dinar at a rate of 40 kuna = 1 dinar.CoinsZinc coins were issued in denominations of 1 and 2 kune in 1941 but only the 2 kune pieces are available today in appreciable numbers.Banknotes130px]]130px]]130px]]10 kuna100 kuna500 kunaKuna banknotes were introduced by the government in 1941, in denominations of 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kuna. These were followed in 1942 by notes for 50 banica and 1 and 2 kuna. In 1943, the Hrvatska Državna Banka (Croatian State Bank) introduced 100, 1000 and 5000 kuna notes. The notes were printed in Germany by Giesecke &amp; Devrient.Notes were also issued by partisan groups. These included the Zagreb Government Region (Oblasni Narod. Oslobod. Odbor Zagrebačke Oblasti), the Croatian Anti-Fascist Authority (Zemaljsko Antifašističko Vijeće Hrvatske) and the Croatian Anti-Fascist Government Authority (Zemaljsko Antifašističko Vijeće Narodnog Oslobodenja Hrvatske). The Zagreb Government Region issued notes for 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000 and 50,000 kuna. The Croatian Anti-Fascist Authority and Croatian Anti-Fascist Government Authority issued notes in 1943, denominated in both dinari and kune, for 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10,000 and 100,000 kuna/dinara. Notes for 100, 500 and 1000 lire were also issued without indication as to the value in kuna.Second kuna, 1994-presentThe modern kuna was introduced in June, 1994, after a transitional period during which the Yugoslav dinar was replaced with the Croatian dinar. The exchange rate between dinar and kuna was 1 kuna = 1000 dinara. The modern kuna is subdivided into 100 lipa. The word lipa means "linden (lime) tree". The kuna is issued by the Croatian National Bank and the coins are minted by the Croatian Monetary Institute.The choice of the name kuna was controversial for a number of Croatian citizens, including the Serb minority, as this currency name had been used by the World War II Independent State of Croatia. The Croatian government claimed continuity in the historical use of marten pelts, the use of a marten adorned coin by Croatian viceroys and the consideration of the kuna during the Banovina of Croatia in the first Yugoslavia. Detractors accused the government of attempting to establish symbolic continuity of modern Croatia with the WWII extremist regime, and using these relatively little known historical facts as an excuse. An alternative proposition for the name of the new currency was kruna (crown) after the Austro-Hungarian krone. However, this proposition was challenged on the same basis as the previous, since the kruna was proposed to be divided in 100 banica. Additionally, terms like kruna (crown) and banica (viceroy's wife) were found inappropriate for the country which is a republic. http://www.matis.hr/zbornici/2001/Text/Text2-4.htm The transition to the new currency went smoothly and the controversy quickly blew over.The self-proclaimed Serbian entity Republic of Serbian Krajina did not use the kuna or the Croatian dinar. Instead, they issued their own dinar until Krajina was integrated back into Croatia in 1995.CoinsIn 1994, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 lipa, 1, 2 and 5 kuna. The coins are issued in two versions: one with the name of the plant or animal in Croatian (issued in odd years), the other with the name in Latin (issued in even years).DenominationObverse DesignCroatianLatinEnglish translation1 lipakukuruzZea maysMaize2 lipevinova lozaVitis viniferaGrapevine]]5 lipahrast lužnjakQuercus roburOak]]10 lipaduhanNicotiana tabacumTobacco]]20 lipamaslinaOlea europaeaOlive50 lipavelebitska degenijaDegenia velebiticaDegenia1 kunaslavujLuscinia megarhynchosNightingale2 kunetunaThunnus thynnusTuna]]5 kunamrki medvjedUrsus arctosBrown BearA number of commemorative designs have also been issued for circulation, see Commemorative coins of the Croatian kuna.BanknotesDenominationObverse DesignReverse Design5 kuna(withdrawn)Petar Zrinski andFran Krsto FrankopanVaraždin's Old Town fortress, mirrored view10 kunaJuraj DobrilaArena colosseum]] in Pula20 kunaJosip JelačićThe castle of Count Eltz]] in Vukovar50 kunaIvan GundulićDubrovnik;historic, UNESCO-protected town core100 kunaIvan MažuranićRijeka; church of St. Vid200 kunaStjepan RadićOsijek; the building of the High Command at Tvrđa500 kunaMarko MarulićSplit; Diocletian's Palace1000 kunaAnte StarčevićTomislav]] and the Zagreb cathedralSee alsoKrajina dinarReproduction of Croatian currencyEconomy of CroatiaReferences External links Kuna banknotes, Croatian National BankKuna exchange rates, Croatian National BankCroatian Ministry of Foreign Affairs &amp; European Integration - History of the Croatian kunaCroatian government site: The Republic of Croatia and its currency          Category:Currencies of Europe Kunabe:Куна, валюта bs:Kuna (valuta) ca:Kuna (moneda) cs:Chorvatská kuna de:Kroatische Kuna et:Kuna es:Kuna croata eo:Kroata kunao fr:Kuna (monnaie) hr:Kuna (novac) it:Kuna croata he:קונה (מטבע) lt:Kroatijos kuna mk:Хрватска куна hu:Horvát kuna nl:Kuna (munteenheid) ja:クーナ no:Kuna pl:Kuna (waluta) pt:Kuna croata ro:Kună croată ru:Куна (валюта) sk:Chorvátska kuna sr:Хрватска куна sh:Hrvatska kuna fi:Kroatian kuna sv:Kroatisk kuna tg:Кунаи Хорватия tr:Hırvatistan Kunası uk:Куна хорватська zh:克羅埃西亞庫納
