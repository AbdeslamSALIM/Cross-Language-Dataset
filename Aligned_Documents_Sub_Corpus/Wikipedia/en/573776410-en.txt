He most often plays as a side midfielder or winger, usually on the right side of the pitch. He is also capable of playing as a striker. Although he is not known for his technical abilities, he makes up for this with his speed and acceleration.International successEuropean U-16 ChampionshipHe was involved in both the 2000 and 2001 European U-16 Championships. However he did not score in 2000 but managed one goal in an 8-2 victory over Romania in 2001. Germany made the quarter-finals only to lose on penalties on both occasions, losing to Portugal in 2000 and England in 2001.World Cup 2006In 2006 he became a surprise member of the Germany national football team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany despite never having been capped previously. He had however made a number of promising appearances in various German youth sides. Odonkor made his debut on May 30, 2006 for the Germany in a friendly match against Japan. He appeared as a substitute in the first two group games of the World Cup. Against Poland, Odonkor displayed an excellent performance and assisted Oliver Neuville's deciding goal in stoppage time of the second half. He made two additional appearances as a substitute, in the quarter-final match against Argentina and in the semi-final match against Italy.European Championship 2008David Odonkor was called up to Euro 2008 by Joachim Löw, now a more well-known player than he was before the 2006 World Cup. He was switched from the number 22 to the number 19.Real BetisOdonkor was one of the main players in the World Cup and impressed so much that he signed for Real Betis for an undisclosed fee. His first season in La Liga was nothing short of a disaster, appearing in only 13 league games due to a serious knee injury. His second season began promisingly, but another knee injury forced him out for long periods. On his return he forced his way back into the side and scored his first goal for Betis against UD Almería on May 4, 2008. Having made his way back into the German squad and the Real Betis starting lineup, Odonkor had surgery on his knee for a third time in his Betis career.External links Official website of Real Betis Balompié S.A.D.
