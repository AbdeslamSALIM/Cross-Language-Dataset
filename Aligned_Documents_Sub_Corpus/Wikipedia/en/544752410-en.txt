 | year = 1992 | website = The MTV Movie Awards is a film awards show presented annually on MTV (Music Television). It also contains movie parodies that used official movie footage with hosts and other celebrities and music performances. The nominees are decided by a special panel at Tenth Planet Productions, the production company headed by Joel Gallen, who also created the MTV Movie Awards. Winners are decided by the general public. Presently voting is done through MTV's official website through a special Movie Awards link.Production processUnlike sister event the MTV Video Music Awards (which are broadcast live), the MTV Movie Awards (up to 2006) were taped and then broadcast a few days laterMark Burnett signs on to produce a live MTV Movie Awards. The entire production was taped in a completely different order than what the MTV viewing audience saw. For example, the show's host would tape all his/her monologues and introductions at one time, and all the musical acts would perform one after the other. Celebrities would often only appear at the live taping for the announcement of their award category, and members of the general audience fill their vacant seats during the other times. Through clever editing, MTV was able to present to its viewing audience an awards show which appears to be taped in live sequence, with celebrities sticking around for the whole show. This method of production allowed foul language to be edited from the show and also is more convenient for celebrities. The actual live taping aired same-day on pay-per-view channels in most metropolitan cities around the world. Some awards telecasts had also been shown in television syndication. However, in 2007, this changed, as MTV and Survivor producer Mark Burnett (who took over duties from Joel Gallen for the 2007 awards) announced the '07 edition would be broadcast live on MTV for the first time on June 3, 2007 in Los Angeles.CategoriesBest MovieBest Male PerformanceBest Female PerformanceBest Male Breakthrough PerfomanceBest Female Breakthrough PerformanceBest On-Screen TeamBest VillainBest Comedic PerformanceBest Song From a MovieBest KissBest Action SequenceBest FightBest Frightened PerformanceBest Summer Movie You Haven't Seen YetBest Summer Movie So FarBest New FilmmakerSexiest PerformanceLifetime Achievement Award/MTV Generation AwardMTV has awarded at least three fictional characters their version of the lifetime achievement award: Godzilla, Jason Voorhees, and Chewbacca. Jason was awarded the honor in 1992. Godzilla was awarded it in 1996, and Chewbacca followed in receiving the award the following year. (Carrie Fisher presented him with a medal identical to that which Han Solo and Luke Skywalker received at the ceremony at the end of Star Wars. A long running joke is that Chewbacca never received his medal in the movie.) The category existed as a spoof award through 1997, where other recipients included Jackie Chan and Richard Roundtree. In 1998, Clint Howard was the last person given the award. The award was retired in 1998, but reemerged seven years later (as the MTV Generation Award); Tom Cruise in 2005, Jim Carrey and Spike Lee in 2006, Mike Myers in 2007, and currently Adam Sandler for 2008.Jim Carrey And Spike Lee Scoring Big Honors At MTV Movie AwardsYearsYearHost(s)Best MovieBest PerformanceFemaleMale1992]]1992 MTV Movie Awards (1992) (TV)Dennis MillerTerminator 2: Judgment DayLinda HamiltonArnold Schwarzenegger1993]]1993 MTV Movie Awards (1993) (TV)Eddie MurphyA Few Good MenSharon StoneDenzel Washington1994]]1994 MTV Movie Awards (1994) (TV)Will SmithMenace II SocietyJanet JacksonTom Hanks1995]]1995 MTV Movie Awards (1995) (TV)Jon Lovitz and Courteney CoxPulp Fiction]]''Sandra BullockBrad Pitt1996]]1996 MTV Movie Awards (1996) (TV)Ben Stiller and Janeane GarofaloSe7enAlicia SilverstoneJim Carrey1997]]1997 MTV Movie Awards (1997) (TV)Mike Myers]]Scream]]''Claire DanesTom Cruise1998]]1998 MTV Movie Awards (1998) (TV)Samuel L.

This may include sound and video montages, replacing some of the original cast with other actors (commonly, the hosts of each year's show) generally mocking the scenes of that film. The diversity of the spoofs can vary greatly, from one dialogue (such as in 2005) to several long scenes, including fighting and action sequences (2003).+ MTV Movie Awards Film Spoofs by YearYearFilmStarringWatch1995 Pulp Fiction]]''Samuel L Jackson1996Twister]]''Ben Stiller Janeane Garofalo Jay LenoBraveheartBob NewhartClueless]]''The Golden GirlsSe7enWilliam Shatner (in all three key roles)Interview with the VampireAdam West  Frank Gorshin1997The Lost World: Jurassic ParkRomeo and Juliet]]''Scream]]''1998Godzilla]], ''Taxi (combined in one video)Christopher Lloyd (as Jim Ignatowski)Dawson's CreekArmageddon]]) ''Armagedd'NSync is not a traditional movie spoof, but rather a trailer parody created by an independent director Russell Bates.
