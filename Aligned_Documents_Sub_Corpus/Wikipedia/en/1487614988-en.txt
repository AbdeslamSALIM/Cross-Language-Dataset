  Minimax (sometimes minmax) is a decision rule used in decision theory, game theory, statistics and philosophy for mini''mizing the ''max''imum possible loss. Alternatively, it can be thought of as maximizing the minimum gain ('maximin'''). It started from two player zero-sum game theory, covering both the cases where players take alternate moves and those where they make simultaneous moves. It has also been extended to more complex games and to general decision making in the presence of uncertainty.Game theoryIn the theory of simultaneous games, a minimax strategy is a mixed strategy which is part of the solution to a zero-sum game. In zero-sum games, the minimax solution is the same as the Nash equilibrium.Minimax theoremThe minimax theorem states:For every two-person, zero-sum game with finite strategies, there exists a value V and a mixed strategy for each player, such that (a) Given player 2's strategy, the best payoff possible for player 1 is V, and (b) Given player 1's strategy, the best payoff possible for player 2 is -V.Equivalently, Player 1's strategy guarantees him a payoff of V regardless of Player 2's strategy, and similarly Player 2 can guarantee himself a payoff of -V. The name minimax arises because each player minimizes the maximum payoff possible for the other--since the game is zero-sum, he also maximizes his own minimum payoff.This theorem was established by John von NeumannVon Neumann, J: Zur theorie der gesellschaftsspiele Math. Annalen. 100 (1928) 295-320, who is quoted as saying "As far as I can see, there could be no theory of games … without that theorem … I thought there was nothing worth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved".See Sion's minimax theorem and Parthasarathy's theorem for generalizations; see also example of a game without a value.Example
