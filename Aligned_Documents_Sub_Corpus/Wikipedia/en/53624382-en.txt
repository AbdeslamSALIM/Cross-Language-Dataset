It is one of the nine towns of Grecìa Salentina, which still keeps Greek language and traditions.HistoryZollino was founded in messapica epoch in the state property of Soleto. Probably its population increased when the near town of Apigliano was abandoned. It was an important trade centre: in fact it was crossroads of exchanges along the jonico-adriatic direction; it is attested by topographical maps which highlight the position and the name of the village. It belonged to the Lecce county under the government of the Normans of Altavilla; in 1190 the king Tancredi donated it to Berlinghiero Chiaromonte. After belonging to the Principato of Taranto, in 1463 it became a possession of Raimondello Orsini del Balzo. Afterwards it was an estate of the king, but after few years first the Angioini and then the Aragonesi owned it until the latter donated it to the Granafei marquisses of Sternatia. It ceased to be a feud in 1806 following the law that abolished the feudality.MonumentsMatrice Church of Saint Peter and Saint PaulMenhir S.
