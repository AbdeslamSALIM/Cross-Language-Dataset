Its creation was negotiated first through an unwritten agreement between the leader of the Second Serbian Uprising Miloš Obrenović and Ottoman official Marashli Pasha (1817), which formally ended the Serbian revolution. It was followed by the series of legal documents published by the Porte in 1828, 1829 and finally, 1830- the Hatt-i Sharif.HistoryDespite serious and extremely brutal oppression and revenge by the Ottoman authorities (that was especially evident between the revolutions), first Karađorđe and then Miloš Obrenović, the revolutionary leaders, have succeeded in their goal to liberate Serbia after centuries of Turkish rule. Turkish authorities have acknowledged this state in 1830 by the charter known as the Hatisherif, and Miloš became a hereditary prince of the Serbian Principality.At first, the principality included only territory of former Pashaluk of Belgrade, but was in 1831-1833 expanded to east, south and west. In 1867 the Ottoman army was expelled from the Principality, de facto securing its independence.http://globalanalyst.org/uploads/Yugo_ethnic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia was further expanded to south-east in 1878, when it won full international recognition at the Treaty of Berlin. The Principality would last until 1882 when it was raised to the level of Kingdom of Serbia.RulersThe Principality was reigned by the Obrenović dynasty, except for a period when it was reigned by Prince Aleksandar of the Karađorđević dynasty. Princes Miloš and Mihailo Obrenović each had reigned twice.List of princes of the principality:Miloš Obrenović (1815-1839) first reignMilan Obrenović (1839) reigned for only 26 days and diedMihailo Obrenović (1839-1842) first reignAleksandar Karađorđević (1842-1858)Miloš Obrenović (1858-1860) second reignMihailo Obrenović (1860-1868) second reignMilan Obrenović (1868-1882)See alsoHistory of SerbiaKingdom of SerbiaReferencesExternal linksPrincipality of Serbia in 1833Principality of Serbia in 1878Balkan Peninsula in 1878MapMapMaps Image:Serbia02.png|Principality of Serbia and Vojvodina of Serbia and Tamiš Banat in 1849 Image:Serbia1878.png|The Principality of Serbia in 1878.
