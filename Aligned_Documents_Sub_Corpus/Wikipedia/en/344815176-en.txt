The Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) is a North American bird in the Cardinal family. It is found from southern Canada through the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and south through Mexico to northern Guatemala and Belize. It is found in woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps.The Northern Cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21-23&nbsp;cm (8.3 to 9&nbsp;inches). It has a distinctive crest on the head and a mask on the face which is black in the male and gray in the female. It displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a vibrant red, while the female is a dull red-brown shade. The Northern Cardinal is mainly granivorous, but also feeds on insects and fruit. The male behaves territorially, marking out his territory with song. During courtship, the male feeds seed to the female beak-to-beak. A clutch of three to four eggs is laid, and two to four clutches are produced each year. It was once prized as a pet, but its sale as cage birds is now banned in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.TaxonomyThe Northern Cardinal is one of three birds in the genus Cardinalis and is included in the family Cardinalidae, which is made up of passerine birds found in North and South America.The Northern Cardinal was one of the many species originally described by Linnaeus in his 18th century work, Systema Naturae. &lt;/ref&gt; It was initially included in the genus Loxia, which contains crossbills. In 1838, it was placed in the genus Cardinalis and given the scientific name Cardinalis virginianus, which means "Virginia Cardinal". In 1918, the scientific name was changed to Richmondena cardinalis in honor Charles Wallace Richmond, an American ornithologist.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the scientific name was changed again to ''Cardinalis cardinalis'' and the common name was changed to &quot;Northern Cardinal&quot;, to avoid confusion with the seven other species also termed cardinals.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ritchison&quot;/&gt;The common name, as well as the scientific name, of the Northern Cardinal refers to the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, who wear distinctive red robes and caps.&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;Northern&quot; in the common name refers to its range, as it is the only cardinal found in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name= &quot;Holloway&quot;/&gt;DescriptionThe Northern Cardinal is a mid-sized songbird with a body length of 21-23&nbsp;cm (8.3 to 9&nbsp;inches) and a wingspan of 25-31&nbsp;cm (10-12&nbsp;in). It weighs about 45&nbsp;g (1.6&nbsp;ounces). The male is slightly larger than the female.&lt;/ref&gt; The male is a brilliant crimson red with a black face mask over the eyes, extending to the upper chest. The color is dullest on the back and wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;/&gt; The female is fawn, with mostly grayish-brown tones and a slight reddish tint on the wings, the crest, and the tail feathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;/&gt; The face mask of the female is gray to black and is less defined than that of the male. Both sexes possess prominent raised crests and bright coral-colored [[beak]]s. The beak is cone-shaped and strong.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Young birds, both male and female, show the coloring similar to the adult female until the fall, when they molt and grow adult feathers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are brown above and red-brown below, with brick-colored crest, forehead, wings, and tail.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ritchison&quot;/&gt; The legs and feet are a dark pink-brown. The iris of the eye is brown.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ritchison&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;The plumage color of the males is produced from carotenoid pigments in the diet.&lt;/ref&gt; Coloration is produced from both red pigments and yellow carotenoid pigments.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGraw&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Northern Cardinal males possess the ability to metabolize carotenoid pigments to create plumage pigmentation of a different color than the ingested pigment. When fed only yellow pigments, males become a pale red color, rather than a yellow.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGraw&quot;/&gt;Distribution and habitatThe Northern Cardinal is abundant across the eastern United States from Maine to Texas and in Canada in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. Its range extends west to the U.S.-Mexico border and south through Mexico to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, northern Guatemala, and northern Belize. It was introduced to Bermuda in 1700. It has also been introduced in Hawaii and Southern California. Its natural habitat is woodlands, gardens, shrublands, and swamps. This bird is a permanent resident throughout its range, although it may relocate to avoid extreme weather or if food is scarce.EcologyThe Northern Cardinal is a territorial song bird. The male sings in a loud, clear whistle from the top of a tree or another high location to defend his territory. He will chase off other males entering his territory. The Northern Cardinal learns its songs, and as a result the songs vary regionally. It is able to easily distinguish the sex of another singing Northern Cardinal by its song alone.&lt;/ref&gt; Mated pairs often travel together.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Both sexes sing a clear, whistled song patterns, which are repeated several times, then varied. Some common phrases are described as purdy, purdy, purdy...whoit, whoit, whoit, whoit and what-cheer, what-cheer... wheet, wheet, wheet, wheet'.&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Cardinal has a distinctive alarm call, a short metallic 'chip' sound. This call often is given when predators approach the nest, in order to give warning to the female and nestlings.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ritchison&quot;/&gt; In some cases it will also utter a series of chipping notes. The frequency and volume of these notes increases as the threat becomes greater.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ritchison&quot;/&gt;  Northern Cardinals are preyed upon by a wide variety of predators native to North America, including Cooper's Hawks, Loggerhead Shrikes, Northern Shrikes, Eastern gray squirrels, Long-eared Owls and Eastern Screech Owls. Predators of chicks and eggs include milk snakes, coluber constrictors, Blue Jays, fox squirrels, red squirrels and eastern chipmunks.DietThe diet of the Northern Cardinal consists mainly (up to 90 percent) of weed seeds, grains, and fruits. It is a ground feeder and finds food while hopping on the ground through trees or shrubbery. It eats beetles, cicadas, grasshoppers, snails, wild fruit and berries, corn and oats, sunflower seeds, the blossoms and bark of elm trees, and drinks maple sap from holes made by sapsuckers, an example of commensalism. During the summer months, it shows preference for seeds that are easily husked, but is less selective during winter, when food is scarce. Northern Cardinals also will consume insects and feed their young almost exclusively on insects.Cardinalis cardinalis: Information Animal DiversityReproductionMated pairs sometimes sing together before nesting. During courtship they may also participate in a bonding behavior where the male collects food and brings it to the female, feeding her beak-to-beak. If the mating is successful, this mate-feeding may continue throughout the period of incubation.The female builds a cup nest in a well-concealed spot in dense shrub or a low tree one to three&nbsp;meters (three to ten&nbsp;ft) off the ground. The nest is made of thin twigs, bark strips, and grasses, lined with grasses or other plant fibers.&lt;/ref&gt; Eggs are laid one to six days following the completion of the nest. The [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] are white, with a tint of green, blue or brown, and are marked with lavender, gray, or brown blotches which are thicker around the larger end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The shell is smooth and slightly glossy.&lt;ref name =&quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt; Three or four eggs are laid in each clutch.

Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing seeds, particularly sunflower seeds. Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. It has an estimated global range of 5,800,000&nbsp;square kilometers (2,239,392.5&nbsp;sq mi) and a global population estimated to be about 100,000,000 individuals. Populations appear to remain stable and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations. It was once prized as a pet due to its bright color and distinctive song.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], this species receives special legal protection under the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]], which also banned their sale as cage birds.&lt;ref name=&quot;FWS&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is also protected by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name= &quot;cornell2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to take, kill, or possess Northern Cardinals, and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to 15,000 US dollars and imprisonment of up to six months.&lt;ref name= &quot;cornell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;In the United States, the Northern Cardinal is the mascot of a number of athletic teams. In professional sports, it is the mascot of the St. Louis Cardinals of baseball's National League and the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League. In college athletics, it is the mascot of many schools, including the University of Louisville, the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, Ball State University, Illinois State University, the Catholic University of America, Wesleyan University, Wheeling Jesuit University and Saint John Fisher College. It is also the state bird of seven states, more than any other species: North Carolina, West Virginia, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia. It was also a candidate to become the state bird of Delaware, but lost to the Blue Hen of Delaware.Photo gallery Image:Cardinal-singing.jpg|Singing male in Arizona Image:Cardinal female 1.JPG|Female Image:Cardinal male 2.JPG|Male Image:Cardinal0004.jpg|Female in nest.
