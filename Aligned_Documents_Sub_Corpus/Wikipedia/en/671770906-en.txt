A product of Galatasaray's youth system, Arda is a member of the Turkey national football team. (video)In July 2008, Arda was selected as one of the 100 Best Young Football Players in the World as published by Spanish magazine Don Balón.Club careerGalatasarayJoined Galatasaray's youth team after impressing with his technique at amateur side Altıntepsi Makelspor. Made his debut for the Galatasaray's U20 team on August 31, 2003 against Gençlerbirliği's U20 team. He made 56 appearances for Galatasaray's U20 team where he scored 17 goals.Made his senior debut on January 22, 2005 in a 1-0 win against Bursaspor in the Turkish Cup entering the match in the 60th minute to replace Ayhan Akman by then manager Gheorghe Hagi. One year later in January 2006, he was loaned out to Manisaspor to get playing time and adjust playing in the the Süper Lig. He was played primarily as a right back and impressed in his performances during his loan spell which paved the way for his return to the Galatasaray squad.Despite the purchase of Marcelo Carrusca, Arda quickly impressed manager Eric Gerets with his performances early in the 2006/2007 season and won the two-way battle for the left midfielder position between himself and the Argentinian. After his stellar performances in the Champions League qualifiers which led Galatasaray to the group stage, Arda also impressed against Liverpool F.C. but couldn't prevent his team from losing. Arda was also a victim of his inexperience against Bordeaux as he head butted Franck Jurietti to receive a red card. Arda scored his first Süper Lig goal against Kayserispor on August 13, 2006 and finished the season with five goals. He suffered an injury to his knee in a match against Konyaspor after colliding with goalkeeper Özden Öngün on March 16, 2007 and was expected to miss the rest of the season. However he managed to get fit to play against Fenerbahçe in the championship decider, entering the game as a substitute in the 49th minute and scoring with a header in the 86th minute in a losing effort.With the installment of Karl-Heinz Feldkamp as the new manager, Arda continued his development in the 2007/2008 season. Despite a less than impressive first half to the season, Arda improved his performances immensely, scoring 7 goals in the second half of the season after failing to score in the first half. Three of his goals came against Sivasspor on May 4, 2008 in a match which virtually ensured that Galatasaray would win the title. Following his impressive displays domestically, Newcastle United made a £9m offer to buy Arda prior to Euro 2008 but the Galatasaray chairman rejected the offer and announced that Arda would not be sold until he and his team mates bring home a European trophy.

The goal, a deflected shot in the 92nd minute, made the score 2-1 to Turkey, reignited Turkey's chances of making the quarter-finals and effectively knocked Switzerland out of their own tournament.The Turks had previously been 1-0 down following a comical Hakan Yakin goal in the first half which came about as a result of the deteriorating weather conditions and severely waterlogged pitch. Arda was announced by the UEFA as man of the match for his European Championship debut.Switzerland vs Turkey match reportOn June 15, Turan scored the first goal in his country's dramatic late win over the Czech Republic in the final Group A match to qualify for the quarter-final.
