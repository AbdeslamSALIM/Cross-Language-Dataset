 The King Clancy Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the National Hockey League player who best exemplifies leadership qualities on and off the ice and who has made a significant humanitarian contribution in his community. No player has won the award more than once over its 19 year history, but players from the same team have won it in different years. The winner is chosen by "a special panel of representatives" from the Professional Hockey Writers' Association and the NHL Broadcasters' Association. Players from Canadian teams have won the trophy eight out of eighteen times that it has been awarded, and from the Northwest Division (NHL) six out of eighteen times, in a six-division league.HistoryThe King Clancy Memorial Trophy is named in honour of Francis M. &quot;King&quot; Clancy, a former player for the Ottawa Senators and Toronto Maple Leafs who later went on to become a coach, referee, and team executive. The trophy was first awarded in 1988, and was presented to the National Hockey League by its board of governors. No player has won it more than once, but two teams have had more than one player win the award. Three Calgary Flames have won the award, the most of any franchise; the only other franchise that has had more than one winner is the Boston Bruins, with two.Players from six different Canadian teams have won this award. While players from the Calgary Flames have won three times, players from five other teams (Edmonton Oilers, Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Vancouver Canucks, and Winnipeg Jets) have won it once. No team from the now-called Pacific Division have won it while being part of it (the Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix, Arizona to play as the Coyotes starting from the 1996-97 NHL season). The Northwest Division produced the most winners, with six different players, and a member from every team has won except the Minnesota Wild, which only started to play in the league as an expansion team starting from the 2000-01 season.WinnersSeasonWinnerTeamPlayer's humanitarian contribution1987–88]]Lanny|McDonaldCalgary FlamesSupporter of numerous charities in Toronto and Calgary.1988–89]]Bryan|TrottierNew York IslandersWorked with numerous charities, including the Special Olympics, the Long Island "Just Say No to Drugs" program, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.1989–90]]Kevin|LoweEdmonton OilersNHLPA]], he was made the honorary Chairman of the Edmonton City Christmas Bureau, a charity which fed needy persons.1990–91]]Dave| Taylor|Dave Taylor (ice hockey)Los Angeles KingsDid a lot of charity work with his team, and also assisted persons with speech impediments, as he had previously overcame one.1991–92]]Ray|BourqueBoston BruinsInvolved in numerous charities; he was most notably the honourable Chairman for Boston's Floating Hospital for Infants and Children.1992–93]]Dave|PoulinBoston BruinsSpent a lot of time helping charities; he was Co-Chairman of the March of Dimes "Walk for Life" fundraiser.1993–94]]Adam| GravesNew York RangersWas previously recognized by his team and city for his extensive community work.
