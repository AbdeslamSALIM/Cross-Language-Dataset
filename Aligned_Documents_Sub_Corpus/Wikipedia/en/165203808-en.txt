Union for Europe of the Nations is a political group of the European Parliament formed on 20 July 1999, supplanting the earlier Union for Europe.While the UEN in the broad is national-conservative, some members are uncomfortable with this political line. Fianna Fáil is centrist and there is a strong movement for the party to leave UEN and join the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. National Alliance, which despite its post-fascist background is a moderate national-conservative party strongly promoting European integration, is also growing uncomfortable with UEN allies and is seeking admission to the European People's Party. Lega Nord, an advocate of a "Europe of the Regions", is an uncomfortable member of the group as well.Present and futureUEN is attached to the broader Alliance for Europe of the Nations organization. Fianna Fáil and National Alliance are considered the driving forces behind the group despite their being alone in their support for the proposed European Constitution. The Treaty was negotiated by FF leader Bertie Ahern (in his capacity as President of the European Council in 2004) and by AN leader Gianfranco Fini (in his capacity as member of the Convention presided by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing).While the UEN in the broad is national-conservative, Fianna Fáil is centrist. European political commentators have often noted substantive ideological differences between this party and its groupmates, whose strongly conservative stances have at times prompted domestic criticism of Fianna Fáil. The party, over the objections of some MEPs, has made several attempts to sever the party's links to the European right, most recently an aborted 2004 agreement to join the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with whom it already sits at the Council of Europe.Even National Alliance, which despite having its roots in the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement is a moderate-conservative party, is growing uncomfortable within UEN and is seeking admission to the European People's Party and its group. This will finally happen in 2009, when it will be merged with Forza Italia, a christian-democratic and liberal party, into the People of Freedom.As also Lega Nord is uncomfortable with its groupmates and would like to form an alliance with other regionalist parties and two of the three Polish parties are almost disbanded, the future of the group is uncertain.Member PartiesDenmark (1 MEP)Danish People's Party (1 MEP)Ireland (4 MEPs)Fianna Fáil (4 MEPs)Italy (13 MEPs)National Alliance (8 MEPs)Lega Nord (4 MEPs)The Right (1 MEP)Latvia (4 MEPs)For Fatherland and Freedom (4 MEPs)Lithuania (2 MEPs)Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union (1 MEP)Order and Justice (1 MEP)Poland (20 MEPs)Law and Justice (7 MEPs)League of Polish Families (5 MEPsThree LPR MEPs remain in the Ind/Dem group, which encompassed all LPR MEPs at the outset of the legislature and two others sit as Non-Inscrits.)Self-Defense of the Republic of Poland (5 MEPsOne Samoobrona MEP sits apart from his colleagues in the Socialist group.)Polish Peasant Party &quot;Piast&quot; (3 MEPs- entered from the Polish Peasant Party, which is aligned with the European People's Party, but against the wishes of party leadership 3 of its 4 MEPs moved to UEN in December 2005 and, in March 2006, registered a new party - PSL "Piast".)SourcesDemocracy in the European ParliamentDemocracy in the European ParliamentDevelopment of Political Groups in the European ParliamentDevelopment of Political Groups in the European ParliamentEurope PolitiqueUFE on Europe PolitiqueUEN on Europe PolitiqueEurope Politique Seats in the EP 20/07/2004 by party has UEN with 27 seatsEuropean Parliament MEP ArchivesEuropean Parliament profile of Charles PasquaEuropean Parliament profile of Brian CrowleyEuropean Parliament profile of Cristiana MuscardiniCentral European Political Studies Review (Czech) from the International Institute of Political Science, Masaryk University.Unie pro Evropu národů/Union for Europe of Nations, 2005 article by Pavla Papírníková, in the Central European Political Studies Review, from the International Institute of Political Science, Masaryk University.European Parliament election results, 2004Seats in the EP 05/05/2004 has UEN with 30 seatsSeats in the EP 22/07/1999 has UEN with 30 seatsSeats in the EP 30/04/2004 has UEN with 23 seatsSeats in the EP 30/06/2004 has UEN with 27 seatsSeats in the EP 30/06/2004 by party has UEN with 27 seatsReferencesExternal linksTable of all groups and the number of MEPs from countriesUENCategory:Current European Parliament party groups Category:Conservatismde:Union für ein Europa der Nationen et:Liit Rahvusriikide Euroopa Eest es:Unión por la Europa de las Naciones eo:Unio por Eŭropo de Nacioj fr:Union pour l'Europe des nations gl:Unión pola Europa das Nacións it:Unione per l'Europa delle Nazioni hu:Unió a Nemzetek Európájáért nl:Unie voor een Europa van Nationale Staten pl:Unia na rzecz Europy Narodów pt:União para a Europa das Nações fi:Unioni kansakuntien Euroopan puolesta sv:Unionen för nationernas Europa
