The coach is Arne Sandstø, manager is Erik Solér. The team plays in yellow jerseys, black shorts and yellow socks at home, blue jerseys, white shorts and blue socks away.They play their home matches at Sør Arena, the club's own football stadium, opened in 2007. Before moving to Sør Arena, , IK Start played their games at Kristiansand Stadion.Start's style of playing is often described as 'makrellfotball' (mackerel football), meaning the whole team is in constant, coordinated motion. Another feature of their playing style is the so-called 'Start-vippen' (Start-tip), where the ball at a free-kick is tipped up by one player before hit by another.Start were Norwegian champions in 1978 and 1980. They participated in the European Cup in 1979 and 1981, as well as being qualified for the UEFA-cup 2006/2007. The years since 1995 have been turbulent, but recent investments have given greater expectations for the future. In 2004 they won the Norwegian First Division and were promoted to the Norwegian Premier League.In 2005 they reached a second place, following Vålerenga, after a strong comeback season in the Norwegian Premier League. For this, Start earned a place in the UEFA-cup 2006.In 2006, after beating Skála Ítróttarfelag of the Faroe Islands in the 1st qualifying round of the UEFA Cup, and Drogheda United of Ireland in the 2nd qualifying round (after penalties), they reached the 1st round of the UEFA Cup, where they were knocked out by AFC Ajax of the Netherlands.2007 was a bad year for Start with problems working as a team and management issues. It lead to a disappointing 13th place, leading to Start's relegation to Adeccoligaen.==Current squad== As of 17 September 2008.
