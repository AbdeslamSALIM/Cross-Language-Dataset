The Reebok Stadium is the home stadium of English Premier League football club Bolton Wanderers, and is located on the Middlebrook Retail Park in Horwich, situated in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton, Greater Manchester. It is commonly known as 'The Reebok'. It has 4 stands: The Debt Matters (North) Stand at one end, the Woodford Group (South) Stand:the away end, at the other end, the West Stand at one side of the pitch and the Nat Lofthouse (East) Stand at the other side.HistoryIt is a modern, all-seater stadium with a capacity of 28,723 which was completed in 1997, replacing the club's old ground, Burnden Park. Despite the improved facilities and larger capacity (and resultant larger ticket revenues), this move was unpopular with many of the club's fans. This was partly due to the new stadium being built out-of-town, and partly due to sentimental attachment to the old stadium and its history. In recognition of this, the street on which the stadium is situated is called Burnden Way.The lead consultant/architect of the project was Lobb Sports, but the local firm of Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope acted as planning supervisors and quantity surveyors. The value of the contract was £25 million.Bradshaw Gass &amp; Hope website retrieved 26 October 2007 The stadium is noted for its distinct gabled architecture.The Reebok Stadium is named for long-time team sponsor, Reebok. Again, this was unpopular with many fans, as it was considered impersonal, and that too much emphasis was being placed on financial considerations. This opposition has considerably lessened since the stadium was built, however, as fans have grown accustomed to the name and since Reebok is a local company.Football FirstsThe first competitive - and English Premier League - match at the stadium was a 0-0 draw between Bolton and Everton on Monday 1 September 1997.
