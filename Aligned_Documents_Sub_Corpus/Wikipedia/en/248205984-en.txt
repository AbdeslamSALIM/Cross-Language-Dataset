 char       =&lt;math&gt;(1-2\,i\,t)^\,&lt;/math&gt;In probability theory and statistics, the chi-square distribution (also chi-squared or \chi^2&nbsp; distribution) is one of the most widely used theoretical probability distributions in inferential statistics, e.g., in statistical significance tests.NIST (2006). Engineering Statistics Handbook - Chi-Square Distribution It is useful because, under reasonable assumptions, easily calculated quantities can be proven to have distributions that approximate to the chi-square distribution if the null hypothesis is true.The best-known situations in which the chi-square distribution are used are the common chi-square tests for goodness of fit of an observed distribution to a theoretical one, and of the independence of two criteria of classification of qualitative data. Many other statistical tests also lead to a use of this distribution, like Friedman's analysis of variance by ranks.DefinitionIf X_i are k independent, normally distributed random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, then the random variableQ = \sum_^k X_i^2is distributed according to the chi-square distribution with k degrees of freedom. This is usually writtenQ\sim\chi^2_k.\,The chi-square distribution has one parameter: k - a positive integer that specifies the number of degrees of freedom (i.e. the number of X_i)The chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.CharacteristicsProbability density functionA probability density function of the chi-square distribution isf(x;k)= \begin\displaystyle \frac\Gamma(k/2)\,x^ e^&\textx0,\\ 0&\textx\le0, \end where \Gamma denotes the Gamma function, which has closed-form values at the half-integers.Cumulative distribution functionIts cumulative distribution function is:F(x;k)=\frac = P(k/2, x/2)where \gamma(k,z) is the lower incomplete Gamma function and P(k, z) is the regularized Gamma function.Tables of this distribution &mdash; usually in its cumulative form &mdash; are widely available and the function is included in many spreadsheets and all statistical packages.Characteristic functionThe characteristic function of the Chi-square distribution is\chi(t;k)=(1-2it)^.\,Expected value and varianceIf X\sim\chi^2_k then\mathrm(X)=k\mathrm(X)=2kMedianThe median of X\sim\chi^2_k is given approximately byk-\frac+\frac-\frac.Information entropyThe information entropy is given byH = \int_^\infty f(x;k)\ln(f(x;k)) dx = \frac + \ln\left(

 \left(

\right)+ \left(1 - \frac\right) \psi(k/2). where \psi(x) is the Digamma function.Related distributions and propertiesThe chi-square distribution has numerous applications in inferential statistics, for instance in chi-square tests and in estimating variances. It enters the problem of estimating the mean of a normally distributed population and the problem of estimating the slope of a regression line via its role in Student's t-distribution. It enters all analysis of variance problems via its role in the F-distribution, which is the distribution of the ratio of two independent chi-squared random variables divided by their respective degrees of freedom.If X\sim\chi^2_k, then as k tends to infinity, the distribution of X tends to a normal distribution with mean k and variance 2k (convergence is slow as the skewness is \sqrt and the excess kurtosis is 12/k)If X\sim\chi^2_k then \sqrt is approximately normally distributed with mean \sqrt and unit variance (result credited to R. A. Fisher).If X\sim\chi^2_k then \sqrt3 is approximately normally distributed with mean 1-2/(9k) and variance 2/(9k) (Wilson and Hilferty,1931)X \sim \mathrm(\lambda = \tfrac) is an exponential distribution if X \sim \chi_2^2 (with 2 degrees of freedom).Y \sim \chi_^2 is a chi-square distribution if Y = \sum_^ X_m^2 for X_i \sim N(0,1) independent that are normally distributed.If \boldsymbol'=Z_1,Z_2,\cdots,Z_n, where the Z_is are independent \rm(0,\sigma^2) random variables or \boldsymbol\sim N_p(\boldsymbol,\sigma^2 \mathrm) and \boldsymbol is an n\times n idempotent matrix with rank n-k then the quadratic form \frac'\boldsymbol\boldsymbol\sim \chi^2_.If the X_i\sim N(\mu_i,1) have nonzero means, then Y = \sum_^k X_m^2 is drawn from a noncentral chi-square distribution.The chi-square distribution X\sim\chi^2_\nu is a special case of the gamma distribution, in that X \sim (\frac, \theta=2).Y \sim \mathrm(\nu_1, \nu_2) is an F-distribution if Y = \frac where X_1 \sim \chi_^2 and X_2 \sim \chi_^2 are independent with their respective degrees of freedom.Y \sim \chi^2(\bar) is a chi-square distribution if Y = \sum_^N X_m where X_m \sim \chi^2(\nu_m) are independent and \bar = \sum_^N \nu_m.if X is chi-square distributed, then \sqrt is chi distributed.in particular, if X \sim \chi_2^2 (chi-square with 2 degrees of freedom), then \sqrt is Rayleigh distributed.if X_1, \dots, X_n are i.i.d. N(\mu,\sigma^2) random variables, then \sum_^n(X_i - \bar X)^2 \sim \sigma^2 \chi^2_ where \bar X = \frac \sum_^n X_i.if X \sim \mathrm(\tfrac)\,, then \mathrm(1 + e^) \sim \chi_2^2\,The box below shows probability distributions with name starting with chi for some statistics based on X_i\sim \mathrm(\mu_i,\sigma^2_i),i=1,\cdots,k, independent random variables:NameStatisticchi-square distribution\sum_^k \fracnoncentral chi-square distribution\sum_^k \left(\frac\right)^2chi distribution\sqrt^k \left(\frac\right)^2noncentral chi distribution\sqrt^k \left(\frac\right)^2See alsoCochran's theoremInverse-chi-square distributionDegrees of freedom (statistics)Fisher's method for combining independent tests of significanceNoncentral chi-square distributionNormal distributionNormalised Innovation Squared==External links==Course notes on Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Testing from Yale University Stats 101 class.
