Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.Alternative names, mainly in herbalism, are Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae and Herbe d'Euphraise.Use in herbalism and medicineThe plant was known to classical herbalists, but then was not referred to until mentioned again in 1305.
