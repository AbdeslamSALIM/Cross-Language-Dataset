She is the seventh holder of the title Princess Royal, and is currently tenth in the Line of succession to the British throne. At the time of her birth, she was third in line, but moved to second place when her mother became Queen, until the birth of her brother, The Prince Andrew, in 1960.The Princess Royal is known for her charitable work, and is the only member of the British Royal Family to have competed in the Olympic Games.Early lifePrincess Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise was born on 15 August 1950 at Clarence House, London. Her father is Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark and the former Princess Alice of Battenberg. Her mother is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, the elder daughter of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother.She was baptised in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace on 21 October 1950 by Cyril Garbett, Archbishop of York. Her godparents were: The Earl Mountbatten of Burma, Andrew Elphinstone, Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, Princess Andrew of Greece and Denmark and The Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.Shortly before the birth of her elder brother, Prince Charles, in 1948, their grandfather King George VI issued Letters Patent granting the titular dignity of Prince or Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the style ''Royal Highness'' to any children born to the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. Thus, from birth, Princess Anne was styled Her Royal Highness Princess Anne of Edinburgh. Had it not been for these letters patent she would have been known as 'Lady Anne Mountbatten' until her mother became Queen in 1952.Princess Anne was educated in Buckingham Palace and then at Benenden School, a public boarding school in Kent.The Princess AnneOn 6 February 1952, when Anne's grandfather, George VI, died, her mother ascended the throne as Elizabeth II. Anne was now styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Anne. Given her young age, she did not attend her mother's coronation. Princess Anne began to undertake royal and official duties as a teenager in the late 1960s. She has visited many countries and towns.Interests and activitiesAnne has always shown a keen interest in horses, and equine pursuits have been an important part of her life. At the age of 21, she won the individual title at the European Eventing Championship held at Burghley and was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 1971. Her daughter Zara Phillips would win the same award 35 years later, on 10 December 2006. For over five years she competed with the British eventing team, winning a silver medal in both individual and team disciplines in the 1975 European Eventing Championships held in Germany riding the home-bred Doublet. The following year she participated in the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games as a member of the British team, riding the Queen's horse Goodwill. On 5 February 1987, she appeared as a panellist on the 200th edition of the BBC TV panel game A Question of Sport, becoming the first titled British royal to appear as a contestant on a TV quiz show.In 1981, following the retirement of The Queen Mother, Anne was elected Chancellor of the University of London, following an election by graduates of the university in which she was chosen above Jack Jones and Nelson Mandela.In 1994, Princess Anne was created a Lady of the Garter by The Queen. She also received special dispensation to use the post-nominal KG, rather than the normal female equivalent of LG.In May 1996, Princess Anne served as Her Majesty's High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. This role granted her, in Scotland, for the duration, higher precedence just below her parents (above her brothers), and the alternative style of Her Grace Her Majesty's High Commissioner.First marriageOn 14 November 1973 Princess Anne married Mark Phillips, a Lieutenant and later a Captain in the 1st Queen's Dragoon Guards at Westminster Abbey, London. The marriage was televised around the world with an estimated audience of 100 million. The couple has two children, both of whom, like their mother, were born on the 15th day of a month:Peter Phillips, born 15 November 1977Zara Phillips, born 15 May 1981 As is customary, the Queen is believed to have offered Capt. Phillips an earldom on his wedding day, which he turned down. This may also have been the specific wish of Princess Anne, who wanted to shield future children from the publicity that courtesy titles might bring. They thus became the first grandchildren of a sovereign to carry no title. However, they are not the first children of a British princess to carry no title. The children of Princess Alexandra, the Queen's cousin, who were born in the 1960s, are also untitled.After their wedding, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips lived at Gatcombe Park, in Gloucestershire.[[Image:Dean Bradford and Princess Anne.jpg|left|thumb|235px|The Princess Royal visits the [[USNS Comfort (T-AH-20)|USNS Comfort]] on 11 July 2002 while the ship was docked in Southampton, England]]Kidnapping attemptPrincess Anne was the target of a failed kidnapping attempt on 20 March 1974. It remains the closest in modern times any individual has come to kidnapping a member of the British Royal Family.The incident occurred as Princess Anne and Mark Phillips were returning to Buckingham Palace from a London charity event on Pall Mall. Their Austin Princess Limousine was forced to stop by a Ford Escort.Daily Express, 21 August 2006 The driver of the Escort, Ian Ball (later judged to be mentally unstable) jumped from his car, firing a gun. Inspector James Beaton, the Princess's personal police officer, responded by jumping out to shield the Princess as he tried to disarm Ball. However, Beaton's firearm jammed, and he was also shot in the head and chest by the assailant. The car's chauffeur, Alex Callender1974: Kidnap attempt on Princess Anne was also shot as he tried to disarm Mr. Ball. Journalist Brian McConnell, who was passing by, also tried to intervene and was shot once in the chest. As Ball told the Princess of his kidnapping plan and asked her to get out of the car, she replied "Not bloody likely!", and she briefly considered hitting Ball.Kidnap the Princess? Not bloody likely! Eventually, the Princess dived out of the car on the other side. A second passer-by, Ron Russell, punched Ball in the back of the head and led Anne from the scene. PC Michael Hills stumbled upon the scene, but he was shot by Ball. However, Hills managed to call for backup. A nearby police officer, DC Peter Edmonds gave chase, and he finally arrested Ball.Daily Express, 21 August 2006 In total, Mr. Ball had fired eleven times, hitting Beaton, Callender, McConnell, and a man passing by in a taxi.1974: Kidnap attempt on Princess Anne The people he shot were hospitalised, but they all recovered from their wounds.Ball later pleaded guilty to attempted murder and attempted kidnapping, and he was detained under the Mental Health Act. He was sent to the Broadmoor Hospital, where he remains. Ball planned to ransom the Princess for a sum given in various sources as £2 millionPrincess foiled 1974 kidnap plot or £3 million to the NHS.Daily Express, 21 August 2006 The incident prompted higher security levels for the Royal Family.
