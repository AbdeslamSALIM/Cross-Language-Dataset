At the time, grunge was at the height of its popularity, and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. Undertow helped heavy metal remain prominent as a mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. Allmusic saw the album's success in the "striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album's nihilistic yet wistful mood." It was eventually certified double platinum by the RIAA on May 14, 2001.The album was recorded between October and December 1992 at Grand Master Studios, Hollywood, California, by Sylvia Massy. It includes songs that the band decided to not release on their previous EP, Opiate.Album artThe album art was designed by Adam Jones. Photos in the liner notes of a nude obese woman, a nude thin man, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads generated controversy, resulting in the album being removed from stores such as KMart and Wal-Mart. The band reacted by releasing another version, which depicted a giant bar code on a white background. This version of the album included a note from the band (see right).When the original cover is held up to a light, the obese woman inside is seen encircled by the ribcage.The message on the photographs of the band members reads "Trust me trust me trust me trust me trust me I just want to start this over say you won't go this is love I'll make weapons out of my imperfections lay back and let me show you another way only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind cleanse and purge me in the water twice as loud as reason euphoria I've been far too sympathetic no one told you to come I hope it sucks you down life feeds on life this is necessary." This passage has several lyrics from the album's songs.In some versions of the CD, when the black backing of the CD case (where the CD lies) is removed, an obscure picture of a cow licking what appears to be it's genital region is revealed.Track listingCDAll songs written by Tool unless otherwise noted.1.
