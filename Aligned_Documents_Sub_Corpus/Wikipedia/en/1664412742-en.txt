The German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (born 28 May 1925) is a German singer and conductor of classical music, one of the most famous lieder (art songs) singers of his generation. He is greatly admired for his interpretations, the tonal qualities and shadings of color in his voice, his exceptional rhythmic sense and his impeccable diction. Fischer-Dieskau has also performed and recorded many operatic roles.Early yearsAlbert Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was born in Berlin to Albert, a principal, and Dora, a teacher. He started singing as a child and began formal voice lessons at the age of sixteen. When he was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1943, Fischer-Dieskau had just completed his secondary school studies and one semester at the Berlin Conservatory. He was captured in Italy in 1945 and spent two years as an American prisoner of war. During that time, he sang lieder in POW camps to the homesick German soldiers.Singing careerIn 1947, he returned to Germany where he launched his professional career as a singer in Badenweiler when he sang in Brahms' Ein Deutsches Requiem without any rehearsal&mdash;he was a last-minute substitute for a singer who was indisposed. He gave his first lieder recital in Leipzig in the fall of 1947 and followed it soon afterwards with a highly successful first concert at Berlin's Titania-Palast.In the fall of 1948, Fischer-Dieskau was engaged as principal lyric baritone at the Berlin State Opera, making his debut as Posa in Verdi's Don Carlos under Ferenc Fricsay. Subsequently, Fischer-Dieskau made guest appearances at the opera houses in Vienna and Munich. After 1949 he made concert tours in England, the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Italy. In 1951, he made his Salzburg Festival concert debut with Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (Songs of a Wayfarer) under Wilhelm Furtwängler. He made regular opera appearances at the Bayreuth Festival between 1954 and 1961 and at the Salzburg Festival from 1956 until the early 1970s.As an opera singer, Fischer-Dieskau performed mainly at Berlin and at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He also made guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London, at the Hamburg State Opera, in Japan, and at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh during the Edinburgh Festival. His first tour in the United States took place in 1955, when he was 29, with his concert debut in Cincinnati, Ohio on 15 April (Bach's Kreuzstab cantata) and 16&nbsp;April (Ein Deutsches Requiem). His American lieder debut, singing Franz Schubert songs, took place in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on 19 April. His New York City debut occurred on 2 May at The Town Hall, where he sang Schubert's song cycle Winterreise without intermission. Both American recitals were accompanied by Gerald Moore.In 1951, Fischer-Dieskau made his first recordings of lieder with Gerald Moore, at EMI Studios, London; they performed and recorded frequently until the latter's retirement in 1967 and were renowned above all for their performances of Schubert. Their recordings of Die schöne Müllerin and Winterreise are highly prized.Fischer-Dieskau also performed many works of contemporary music, including Benjamin Britten, Samuel Barber, Hans Werner Henze, Ernst Krenek, Witold Lutosławski, Siegfried Matthus, Winfried Zillig, Gottfried von Einem and Aribert Reimann.Beyond his recordings of lieder and German repertoire, Fischer-Dieskau also recorded interesting performances in the Italian operatic repertoire. His recordings as Rigoletto alongside Renata Scotto and Carlo Bergonzi and also Rodrigo in Verdi's Don Carlos are probably the most respected of these ventures. Both these recordings, made right at the peak of his career, are very fine indeed (comparable to performances of the quality shown by Tito Gobbi or Giuseppe Taddei at their peak ). Other roles such as the title role in Verdi’s Macbeth alongside Elena Souliotis, Giorgio Germont in La traviata, and Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca with Birgit Nilsson, and are not often as successful, showing insight and inventiveness but lacking somewhat in idiomatic Mediterranean vocal colour or temperament - perhaps seeming too Germanic. However, as with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Maria Callas, Fisher-Dieskau's performances always seem thought out and are often true to the score.Fischer-Dieskau retired from the concert hall in 1992 and dedicated himself to conducting, teaching (especially lieder), painting, writing books, etc.In a 1999 "Top Singers of the Century" critics' poll compiled by British Classic CD magazine, Fischer-Dieskau came second, behind Jussi Björling.He is an honorary member of the Robert Schumann Society.Personal lifeIn 1949, Fischer-Dieskau married the cellist Irmgard Poppen. Together they had three sons: Mathias (stage designer), Martin (conductor), and Manuel (cellist). Irmgard died in 1963 of complications following childbirth. Afterwards, Fischer-Dieskau was married to the actress Ruth Leuwerik from 1965 to 1967 and Christina Pugel-Schule from 1968 to 1975. Since 1977 he has been married to the soprano Julia Varady.Partial discographyAs singerFischer Dieskau recorded mainly on the labels EMI, DG and ORFEO.Johann Sebastian Bach, Cantatas, with Karl Richter on the Polygram labelBach, Jesus and bass parts in the Passions under a wide host of conductors, e.g. Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Karl RichterBéla Bartók, Bluebeard's Castle, with Ferenc FricsayBartók, Bluebeard's Castle, with Wolfgang SawallischLudwig van Beethoven, Fidelio, with FricsayBeethoven, Fidelio, with Leonard BernsteinJohannes Brahms, Ein Deutsches Requiem, with Rudolf KempeBrahms, Ein deutsches Requiem, with Otto Klemperer and the Philharmonia Orchestra on the Angel labelBrahms, Liebeslieder Walzer on the Deutsche Grammophon labelBrahms, Vier ernste Gesänge, lieder, with Jörg Demus, piano on the Deutsche Grammophon labelBenjamin Britten, War Requiem, Benjamin Britten conducting, with Galina Vishnevskaya and Sir Peter PearsFerruccio Busoni, Doktor Faust, conductor Ferdinand LeitnerDomenico Cimarosa, The Secret Marriage, with Daniel BarenboimClaude Debussy, Mélodies, with Hartmut Holl, piano, recorded 1988 for Claves Records, available in 2006 on Brilliant ClassicsGabriel Fauré, Requiem, Op. 48 under André Cluytens on EMIJoseph Haydn, The Creation, with Herbert von KarajanGustav Mahler, Das Lied von der Erde, with Leonard Bernstein and the New York PhilharmonicMahler, Lieder, with Daniel Barenboim, piano, on the EMI labelMahler, Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and Des Knaben Wunderhorn, with Daniel Barenboim, piano, on the Sony labelMahler, Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and Kindertotenlieder with orchestra, with Wilhelm Furtwangler and Rudolf Kempe, on the EMI labelMahler, Kindertotenlieder, with Karl BohmMahler, Rückert Lieder, on the Deutsche Grammophon labelFelix Mendelssohn, Lieder, with Harmut Holl, piano, recorded 1989 and 1991 for Claves Records, available in 2006 on Brilliant ClassicsMozart and Haydn Discoveries, with Reinhard Peters and the Vienna Haydn Orchestra on the Decca labelMozart, The Magic Flute with Ferenc FricsayMozart, The Magic Flute, with Karl BohmMozart, ''[[The Marriage of Figaro", with Karl BohmMozart, Don Giovanni, with Ferenc FricsayMozart, Don Giovanni, with Karl BohmCarl Orff, Carmina Burana, with Eugen Jochum and the Chor und Orchester der Deutschen Oper Berlin on the Deutsche Grammophon labelGiacomo Puccini, Tosca, with Birgit Nilsson, and excerpts in German with Anja Silja, on Decca RecordsAribert Reimann, Lear, with the Bavarian State Orchestra on the Polygram labelOthmar Schoeck, Lebendig begraben, with Radio-Symphonie-Orchester Berlin, on the Deutsche Grammophon labelOthmar Schoeck, Notturno, five movements für voice and string quartet, on EMI ClassicsOthmar Schoeck, Lieder, with Margrit Weber (piano) and Karl Engel (piano), on the Deutsche Grammophon labelFranz Schubert, Deutsche Messe, with Wolfgang Sawallisch and the Orchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks on the Capitol labelSchubert, Die Winterreise, with Gerald Moore, piano, on the Deutsche Grammophon labelSchubert, Die Winterreise, with Jörg Demus, piano, on the Deutsche Grammophon labelSchubert, Die Schöne Müllerin, with Gerald Moore, piano, on the Angel labelSchubert, Lieder, with Gerald Moore, piano on the Deutsche Grammophon labelSchubert, Missa Solemnis and Masses in C major and E flat major, with Wolfgang Sawallisch and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra on the EMI labelSchubert, Schwanengesang, with Gerald Moore, piano on the EMI labelSchubert, Lieder, with Harmut Holl, piano, recorded 1987 for Claves Records, available in 2006 on Brilliant ClassicsRobert Schumann, Dichterliebe, Liederkreis, and others with Christoph Eschenbach, piano, on the Deutsche Grammophon labelSchumann, Liederkreis, with Gerald Moore, piano, on the EMI labelDmitri Shostakovich, Suite on Verses of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Four Verses of Captain Lebyadkin, with Vladimir Ashkenazy and the Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin on the Polygram labelShostakovich, Symphony No. 14 with Bernard Haitink and the Concertgebouw Orchestra on the Decca labelRichard Strauss, Elektra, with Karl BohmStrauss, Arabella, with Joseph KeilberthStrauss, "Arabella", with J.
