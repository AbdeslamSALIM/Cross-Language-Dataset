 The Busan I'Park football team was founded in 1983 in the city of Busan by the Daewoo corporation. Originally called Daewoo, the side finished second in the 1983 K-League Championship behind winners Hallelujah. The club turned professional at the end of 1983 and for the 1984 season changed their name to Daewoo Royals ().The newly-named team lifted the Championship in 1984, and again in 1987 & 1991.Their greatest triumph was winning the Asian Club Championship in 1986, when they defeated Al-Ahly 3-1 in the final.At the end of 1995 when K-League sides were 'localizing', they adopted the name Busan Daewoo Royals () and in 1997 lifted their fourth Korean championship.After the Daewoo corporation suffered major financial difficulties in the late 90s, the team was acquired by I'Park construction, the domestic construction division of Hyundai. The team's name was changed to Busan I'cons (the "con's" referring to construction; Korean: 부산 아이콘즈). At the start of the 2005 season, the team's name was again changed, directly to I'Park.Busan endured a few lean seasons entering the 2000s, but in 2004 Scottish manager Ian Porterfield led the team to FA Cup victory. Just six months later the team continued to show its improved form, claiming the first stage of the 2005 K-League Championship. The club struggled to maintain their form in the second stage of the league finishing dead last, eventually losing out to Incheon United in the championship playoff. Despite struggling domestically, Busan reached the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League.Crest Image:DaewooRoyals.png‎|1983-2000Daewoo Royals FC Image:PusanIcons.png‎|2000-2002Pusan I'Cons Image:BusanIcons.png‎|2002-2005Busan I'Cons Image:BusanIpark oldlogo.png‎|2005-2007Busan I'Park Image:BusanIpark.png|2007-2008Busan I'Park Image:Busan Ipark new logo.png|2008-currentBusan I'Park Club honorsDomesticProfessionalAmateurInternationalSponsorsKit Supplier1997-1999 : Rapido2000-2003 : Nike2004: Kappa2005-2006: Hummel2007-Present: FilaCurrent squadAs of August 8 2008 Last Modified August 8 2008                                        2008 Season transfersIn Hammarby IF FC Thun                    Out                    StaffCoaching StaffManager : Hwang Sun-HongHead Coach : Kim Pan-GonCoach : Kim Seung-Ahn, Ko Sung-MinTrainer : Kim Gwang-Jae, Bae Gui-HyunTeam Doctor : Kang Nam-Uk, Kim Myung-JoonAcademy StaffU-18 Manager : Park Hyung-JooU-18 Head Coach : Song Se-RimU-15 Manager : Yoon Dae-SungU-15 Head Coach : Jo Kyung-HoU-12 Head Coach : Jung Su-JinFormer Foreign Players Rubén Bernuncio (1994) Emmanuel Amunike (2002-2003) Andy Cooke (2003-05) Jamie Cureton (2003-04) Chris Marsden (2004)ManagersAs of end of 2007 seasonNameStartEndWinDrawLoseKOR Jang Woon-Soo1983 Jan 11983 Dec 31673KOR Jo Yoon-Ohk1984 Jan 11984 Dec 311765KOR Jang Woon-Soo1985 Jan 11986 Dec 31261120KOR Lee Cha-Man1987 Jan 11989 Dec 31383325GER Frank Engel1990 Jan 11990 Nov 1412117HUN Bicskei Bertalan1990 Nov 151991 Dec 3117185KOR Lee Cha-Man1992 Jan 11992 Jun 30385KOR Cho Kwang-Rae (Temporary)1992 Jul 11994 Jun 217611KOR Cho Kwang-Rae1992 Jul 11994 Jun 2112269KOR Jung Hae-Won (Temporary)1994 Jun 221994 Sep 7117KOR Kim Hee-Tae1994 Sep 81995 Jul 3111613KOR Shin Woo-Sung (Temporary)1995 Aug 11995 Dec 31428YUG Dragoslav Sekularac1996 Jan 11996 Jul 217610KOR Kim Tae-Soo (Temporary)1996 Jul 221996 Dec 26566KOR Lee Cha-Man1996 Dec 271999 Jun 9452131KOR Shin Yoon-Ki (Temporary)1999 Jun 101999 Sep 8638KOR Chang Woe-Ryong (Temporary)1999 Sep 91999 Dec 31805KOR Kim Tae-Soo (Temporary)2000 Jan 12000 Feb 28000KOR Kim Ho-Gon2000 Mar 12002 Nov 5373138KOR Park Kyung-Hoon (Temporary)2002 Nov 62002 Nov 17004SCO Ian Porterfield2002 Nov 182006 Apr 3304053KOR Kim Pan-Gon (Temporary)2006 Apr 42006 Jul 29839SUI Andy Egli2006 Jul 302007 Jun 2591215KOR Kim Pan-Gon (Temporary)2007 Jun 262007 Jul 17000KOR Park Seong-Hwa2007 Jul 182007 Aug 3100KOR Kim Pan-Gon (Temporary)2007 Aug 62007 Dec 4257KOR Hwang Sun-Hong (Current)2007 Dec 5435External links Official website Busan I'Park at ROKfootball.com  |after=Furukawa Electric|years=1985-86      Category:South Korean football clubs Category:Football (soccer) clubs established in 1983 Category:K-League clubs Category:Sport in Busande:Busan I'Park es:Busan I'Park fr:Busan I'Park ko:부산 아이파크 nl:Busan I'Park ja:釜山アイパーク pl:Busan I'Park pt:Busan I'Park tr:Busan I'Park zh:釜山I'Park
