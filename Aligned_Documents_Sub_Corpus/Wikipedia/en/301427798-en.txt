As seen from Epsilon Indi, the Sun is a 2nd magnitude star in Ursa Major, near the bowl of the Big Dipper. As of 2003, two brown dwarfs were found orbiting the star.ObservationThe constellation Indus (the Indian) first appeared in Johann Bayer's celestial atlas Uranometria in 1603. The 1801 star atlas Uranographia, by German astronomer Johann Elert Bode, places Epsilon Indi as one of the arrows being held in the left hand of the Indian.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1847, Heinrich Louis d'Arrest compared the position of this star in several catalogues dating back to 1750, and discovered that it possessed a measureable proper motion. That is, he found that the star had changed position across the celestial sphere over time.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882-3, the [[parallax]] of Epsilon Indi was measured by astronomers [[David Gill (astronomer)|David Gill]] and William L. Elkin at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. They derived a parallax estimate of .22±.03 [[arcsecond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, [[Harlow Shapley]] of the [[Harvard Observatory]] derived a parallax of 0.45 arcseconds.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;During Project Ozma in 1960, this star was examined for artificial radio signals, but none were found.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory|Copernicus satellite]] was used to examine this star for the emission of [[ultraviolet]] laser signals. Again, the result was negative.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Epsilon Indi leads a [[Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems|list]], compiled by [[Margaret Turnbull]] and [[Jill Tarter]] of the [[Carnegie Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], of 17,129 nearby stars most likely to have planets that could support complex life.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;CharacteristicsEpsilon Indi is a dwarf star of spectral type K4.5V. The star has only about three-fourths the mass of the Sun. Its surface gravity is slightly higher than the Sun's. The metallicity of a star is the proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium. This is typically represented by the ratio of iron to hydrogen compared to the same ratio for the Sun. Epsilon Indi is found to have about 79% of the Sun's proportion of Iron in its photosphere.The corona of Epsilon Indi is similar to the Sun, with an X-ray luminosity Lx = 2&nbsp;ergs&nbsp;s-1 and an estimated coronal temperature of 2&nbsp;K. The stellar wind of this star expands outward, producing a bow shock at a distance of 63 AU. Downstream of the bow, the termination shock reaches as far as 140 AU from the star.&lt;/ref&gt;This star has the third highest proper motion of any star visible to the unaided eye (after Groombridge 1830 and 61 Cygni)&lt;/ref&gt; and the ninth highest overall.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[space velocity]] relative to the Sun of 86&amp;nbsp;[[km/s]], which is unusually high for what is considered a young star.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to be a member of the ε Indi [[moving group]] of at least sixteen [[population I]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is an association of stars that have similar [[space velocity]] vectors, and therefore most likely formed at the same time and location.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;CompanionsIn January 2003, astronomers announced the discovery of a brown dwarf with a mass of 40 to 60 Jupiter masses in orbit around Epsilon Indi at a distance of at least 1500&nbsp;astronomical units.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2003, astronomers discovered that this brown dwarf was actually a binary brown dwarf, with an apparent separation of 2.1&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both brown dwarfs are of [[spectral class T]]; the more massive, ε Indi Ba, has been classified as spectral type T1V, while its less massive companion, Epsilon Indi Bb, has been classified as spectral type T6V.Evolutionary modelsE.g., &lt;/ref&gt; have been used to estimate the physical properties of these brown dwarfs from [[spectroscopic]] and [[photometric]] measurements. These yield masses of 47&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;10 and 28&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;7 times the mass of [[Jupiter]], radii of 0.091&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.005 and 0.096&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.005 [[solar radii]], and [[effective temperature]] of 1280&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;40 [[Kelvin|K]] and 850&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;20 [[Kelvin|K]] for Epsilon Indi Ba and Epsilon Indi Bb, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Measurements of the radial velocity of Epsilon Indi appear to show a trend that indicated the presence of a planetary companion with an orbital period of more than 20 years. A visual search using the ESO's Very Large Telescope found one potential candidate. However, a subsequent examination by the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS showed that this was a background object. Thus, no other companions have yet been found orbiting this star.&lt;/ref&gt;See alsoDouble planetEpsilon Indi in fictionList of nearest starsNotesa.A|a|none From Epsilon Indi the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at the coordinates RA=, Dec=, which is located near Beta Ursae Majoris.
