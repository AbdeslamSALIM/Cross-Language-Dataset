It is exchangeable with the UK pound sterling at par value.History Until 1898, the currency situation in Gibraltar was complicated, with a system based on the real being employed which encompassed British, Spanish and Gibraltarian coins. From 1825, the real (actually the Spanish real de plata) was tied to the pound at a value of 6½ pence (1 Spanish dollar = 4 shillings 4 pence).In 1898, the British pound was made sole legal tender. Since 1927, Gibraltar has issued its own banknotes and, since 1988, its own coins. Gibraltar decimalised in 1971 at the same time as the UK, replacing the system of 1 pound = 20 shillings = 240 pence with one of 1 pound = 100 (new) pence.Relationship with the British poundThe Currency Notes Act of 1934 confers on the Government of Gibraltar the right to print its own notes, and the obligation to back and exchange each printed note with sterling reserves at a rate of one pound to one pound sterling. Although Gibraltar notes are denominated in "pounds sterling", they are not legal tender in the UK, but they are exchangeable at par for UK notes at banks. Gibraltar's coins are the same weight, size and metal as UK coins, although the designs are different, and can be found in circulation in the UK.British coins and Bank of England notes circulate in Gibraltar and are universally accepted and interchangeable with Gibraltar issues.Coins  In 1988, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 pence and 1 pound were introduced which bore specific designs for and the name of Gibraltar. They were the same sizes and compositions as the corresponding British coins, with 2 pound coins introduced in 1999.BanknotesIn 1914, the government introduced notes in denominations of 2 and 10 shillings, 1, 5 and 50 pounds. The 2 shilling and 50 pound notes were not continued when a new series of notes was introduced in 1927. The 10 shilling note was replaced by the 50 pence coin during the process of decimalization. In 1975, 10 and 20 pound notes were introduced, followed by 50 pounds in 1986. The 1 pound note was discontinued in 1988. In 1995, a new series of notes was introduced which, for the first time, bore the words "pounds sterling" rather than just "pounds".References See alsoEconomy of GibraltarCoins of the Gibraltar poundCurrency boardHighest valued currency unitExternal links       Pound, Gibraltar Category:Currencies of British Overseas Territories Category:Currencies of Europe Category:Fixed exchange ratebr:Lur Jibraltar ca:Lliura de Gibraltar cs:Gibraltarská libra de:Gibraltar-Pfund es:Libra gibraltareña fr:Livre de Gibraltar hr:Gibraltarska funta it:Sterlina di Gibilterra lt:Gibraltaro svaras hu:Gibraltári font nl:Gibraltarees pond no:Gibraltarpund pl:Funt gibraltarski pt:Libra de Gibraltar ro:Liră gibraltareză ru:Гибралтарский фунт sk:Gibraltárska libra sr:Гибралтарска фунта sh:Gibraltarska funta sv:Gibraltarpund zh:直布羅陀鎊
