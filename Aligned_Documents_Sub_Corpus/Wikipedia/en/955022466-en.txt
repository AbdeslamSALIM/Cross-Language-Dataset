 Nero Julius Caesar Germanicus (6&ndash;30) was a close relative of the Roman Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.Nero was born in 6 to Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder. His paternal grandparents were Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor, daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor. His maternal grandparents were Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa and Julia the Elder, daughter of Caesar Augustus.Nero's siblings included four brothers (Tiberius and Gaius Julius, who died young; Drusus; and the future Emperor Caligula) and three sisters (Julia Livilla, Drusilla and Agrippina the younger). In 20, he married Julia, daughter of Livilla and Drusus "Castor" (Tiberius' only son by Vipsania).Nero was uncle to Julia Drusilla and Emperor Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus).His father Germanicus was heir apparent to his own adoptive father Emperor Tiberius, but Germanicus predeceased the Emperor in 19. He was replaced as heir by Julius Caesar Drusus, son of Tiberius and his first wife Vipsania Agrippina. But he too predeceased the Emperor on September 14, 23.Nero was the oldest adoptive grandson of Tiberius, and was seen as the emperor's most obvious successor. However, he was accused of treason along with his mother in 29. Nero was exiled to the island of Ponza where in 30 he was either induced to commit suicide or else starved to death.ReferencesPortraitureRose, Charles Brian, Dynastic Commemoration and Imperial Portraiture in the Julio-Claudian Period.
