Cannes Film Festival  2006 Bug  'Empire Awards'  1973 ''The Exorcist William Friedkin (born August 29 1935 in Chicago, Illinois) is an Academy Award-winning American movie and television director, producer and screenwriter best known for directing The Exorcist and The French Connection in the early 1970s.CareerAfter seeing the movie Citizen Kane as a boy, Friedkin became fascinated with movies and began working for WGN-TV immediately after high school. He eventually started his directorial career doing live television shows and documentaries, including The People vs. Paul Crump which won several awards and contributed to the commutation of Crump's death sentence. In 1965 Friedkin moved to Hollywood and two years later released his first feature film, Good Times starring Sonny and Cher. Several other "art" films followed (including the gay-themed movie The Boys in the Band), although Friedkin did not want to be known as an art house director.In 1971, his The French Connection was released to wide critical acclaim. Shot in a gritty style more suited for documentaries than Hollywood features, the film won five Academy Awards, including Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director.Friedkin followed up with 1973's The Exorcist, based on William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, which revolutionized the horror genre and is considered by some critics to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The Exorcist was nominated for 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.Following these two critically acclaimed pictures, Friedkin, along with Francis Coppola and Peter Bogdanovich, was deemed as one of the premier directors in Hollywood. Unfortunately, Friedkin's later movies did not achieve the same success. Sorcerer, an American remake of the movie Wages of Fear starring Roy Scheider, was overshadowed by the box office smash, Star Wars, which was released around the same time.Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Friedkin's films received mostly lackluster reviews and moderate ticket sales. However, his crime film To Live and Die in L.A., starring William Petersen and Willem Dafoe was a critical favorite.In 2000, The Exorcist was re-released in theaters with extra footage and grossed $40 million in the U.S. alone.Friedkin's involvement in 2007's Bug resulted from a positive experience watching the stage version in 2004. He was surprised to find that he was, metaphorically, on the same page as the playwright, and felt that he could relate well to the story. http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=20415Later, Friedkin directed an episode of the hit TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, entitled Cockroaches, which re-teamed him with To Live and Die In L.A. star William Petersen.Personal lifeFriedkin has two sons: Jack (with actress Lesley-Anne Down) and Cedric, whose mother is Australian dancer Jennifer Nairn-Smith. He has been married four times, including a short marriage to French actress Jeanne Moreau. He is currently married to former film executive Sherry Lansing.Filmography (as director)Award information is from The Internet Movie Database (IMDb)http://imdb.com/.YearFilm informationAdditional information2007]]Bug]]'2003]]The Hunted]]'2000]]Rules of Engagement]]'1995]]Jade]]'1994]]Blue Chips1990]]The Guardian]]'1988]]Rampage]]'1985]]To Live and Die in L.A.1983]]Deal of the Century1980]]Cruising]]'1978]]The Brink's Job1977]]Sorcerer]]'1973]]The Exorcist]]'1971]]The French Connection]]'1970]]The Boys in the Band1968]]The Night They Raided Minsky's1968]]The Birthday Party]]'1967]]Good Times]]'   External linksWatching Under the Influence: To Live and Die in L.A. essay at 24 Lies A Second&quot;From 'Popeye' Doyle to Puccini: William Friedkin&quot; NPR's Robert Siegel interviews Friedkin, 14 September 2006EXCL: Bug Director William Friedkin [http://www.thereeler.com/features/as_best_as_i_can_define_it.php The Reeler interview with Friedkin]American Film Institute interview  Category:American film directors Category:American television directors Category:Best Director Academy Award winners Category:Best Director Golden Globe winners Category:The Exorcist Category:Jewish American film directors Category:People from Chicago, Illinois Category:1935 births Category:Living peoplebn:উইলিয়াম ফ্রিডকিন da:William Friedkin de:William Friedkin es:William Friedkin eu:William Friedkin fr:William Friedkin hr:William Friedkin it:William Friedkin nl:William Friedkin ja:ウィリアム・フリードキン no:William Friedkin pl:William Friedkin pt:William Friedkin ru:Фридкин, Уильям fi:William Friedkin sv:William Friedkin tr:William Friedkin
