 FC Midtjylland are a Danish football team from Herning and Ikast. The team is a result of a merger between Ikast FS (which also includes tennis, badminton and handball clubs) and Herning Fremad. Currently FC Midtjylland play in the Danish Superliga.Club HistoryThe myth lives onIn Norse mythology, Fenrir is a wolf, the son of Loki and the giantess Angrboda. In danish football Fenrir is FC Midtjylland, Loki is Ikast FS and Angrboda is Herning Fremad.FC Midtjyllands founding fathers were Mr. Johnny Rune: a carpenter and owner of a private business in the wood-supply industry, and Mr. Ejner Hessel: an authorized Mercedes Benz dealer.On Tuesday April 6 1999 the two men gathered with a vision of uniting the football clubs Ikast FS (founded 1935) and Herning Fremad (founded 1918) – clubs who for decades had been strong rivals but none of which had ever played any siginificant role in danish football. Ikast FS had some success in the late 70s and 80s, but that was about it. At least 10 years had passed with the two clubs being unable to agree on a merger, but after long and hard negotiations between the two gentlemen and other parties the deal was sealed, and announced at a press conference the next day.Success storySince then, FC Midtjylland have gone from one success to the other. In 2000 FC Midtjylland were promoted to the Danish Superliga, after a season in which the team had gathered more points than any other team in the history of the 1st division.FC Midtjylland in 2007 made a financial expansion in the region of 10 million EUR, to secure its current status as a challenger to the national football throne of Brøndby IF and F.C. Copenhagen.Scouting and developingFC Midtjylland have generally built a reputation of finding and developing promising talents.In July 2004 FC Midtjylland was the first danish club to have its own football academy, similar to that of French side FC Nantes Atlantique. The academy attracts players from all of Denmark, as well as players from a partnering club in Nigeria - FC Ebedei. FC Midtjylland have also gained support from a network of over 100 clubs predominantly situated in the western part of the Jutland peninsula.In 2008 Simon Kjær, a talent of the academy, was sold to Palermo in Italy.AchievementsOn the pitch the Club has been runner-up twice in the Danish Cup final, and finished second twice and third twice in the Superliga.The best international result was in the 2002-03 season, where the team reached the 2nd qualifying round of the UEFA cup, but lost to RSC Anderlecht of Belgium.On 14 Aug 2008 they beat Manchester City 1-0 in Manchester, in the 2nd Qualifying Round 1st leg of the UEFA cup.
