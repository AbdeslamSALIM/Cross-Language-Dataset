Originally the team was founded in 1960 as Banga Kaunas. After Lithuania regained its independence the club was restructured. In 1993 Banga Kaunas was renamed FBK Kaunas and the baseball section added (which later separated and became BK Lituanica Kaunas), hence the original name in Lithuanian is Kauno futbolo beisbolo klubas. FBK Kaunas are sponsored by Ūkio Bankas, a bank which has Vladimir Romanov as its principal shareholder. In October 2005 Mr Romanov became the majority shareholder of Scottish Premier League side, Heart of Midlothian. Romanov has since used Kaunas as a feeder club for Hearts by allowing the SPL side to loan many players, such as Edgaras Jankauskas, Bruno Aguiar, Andrius Velička, Nerijus Barasa, Marius Žaliūkas and Roman Bednář, the latter signing a permanent deal for Hearts on 31 August 2006. Kaunas have played Celtic, Rangers and Liverpool in Champions League qualifying stages. On 5 August 2008, FBK Kaunas defeated Rangers, 2-1, to advance to the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League for the first time. The game was won in dramatic circumstances as Kaunas had to come from behind and finally took the lead just four minutes from time. Linas Pilibaitis was the scorer.PlayersCurrent squadAs of July 16,2008FBK Kaunas Futbolas.lt                                   Personal''Transfers 2008/2009''Players in Artūras Rimkevičius (striker, from FK Liepājas Metalurgs) Vytautas Lukša (midfielder, from FC Vilnius) Tomas Miklinevičius (midfielder, from FK Sūduva Marijampolė) Irmantas Zelmikas (defender, from SC Tavriya Simferopol) Mohamed Larbi Arouri (defender, from Etoile Sportive du Sahel) Bojan Mamic (forward, from FK Atlantas) Rogerio Dos Santos (midfielder, from Ituano Futebol Clube)Out on loan        Players out Mindaugas Malinauskas (goalkeeper, to FK Šilutė) Modestas Stonys (goalkeeper, to FK Atlantas) Darius Sanajevas (defender, FK Šilutė) Janko Valkanov (defender, to FC MTZ-RIPO) Givi Kvaratskhelia (midfielder, FC MTZ-RIPO) Edin Pehlic (midfielder, FC MTZ-RIPO) Arturas Jersovas (striker, FC Vilnius) Giedrius Barcevicius (midfielder, released) Oleg Strakhanovich (midfielder, FC MTZ-RIPO) Arnus Lekevicius (goalkeeper, to released) Muharem Bajrami (midfielder, to released)Selected former playersHonoursA LygaChampions 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007,Lithuanian CupWinners 2002, 2004, 2005, 2008Lithuanian Super CupWinners 2002, 2004, 2006Season-by-season2003 - 1st2004 - 1st2005 - 2nd2006 - 1st2007 - 1stReferencesExternal linksOfficial website Supporters' site     Kaunas Category:FBK Kaunasda:FBK Kaunas de:FBK Kaunas es:FBK Kaunas fr:FBK Kaunas ko:FBK 카우나스 id:FBK Kaunas it:FBK Kaunas lt:FBK Kaunas nl:FBK Kaunas ja:FBKカウナス no:FBK Kaunas pl:FBK Kowno pt:FBK Kaunas ro:FBK Kaunas ru:Каунас (футбольный клуб) fi:FBK Kaunas sv:FBK Kaunas bat-smg:FBK Kaunas zh:FBK考那斯
