  Some Like It Hot is a 1959 comedy film directed by Billy Wilder and starring Marilyn Monroe, Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon. The supporting cast includes George Raft, Joe E. Brown, Pat O'Brien, and Nehemiah Persoff.The film was adapted by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond from the story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan. Logan had already written the story (but without the gangsters) for a German film, Fanfaren der Liebe (directed by Kurt Hoffmann, 1951), so that Wilder's film is seen by some as a remake.In 2000, the American Film Institute listed Some Like It Hot as the greatest American comedy film of all time.==Plot== [[Image:Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot trailer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Marilyn Monroe as Sugar Kane in Some Like It Hot]] Two struggling musicians, Joe and Jerry (Curtis and Lemmon), witness what looks like the Saint Valentine's Day massacre of 1929.When the Chicago gangsters, led by 'Spats' Columbo (Raft) spot them, the duo flee for their lives. They escape and decide to leave town, only to find the sole out-of-town jobs available are in an all-girl band headed to Florida. The two disguise themselves as women, calling themselves Josephine and Geraldine (later Jerry changes his pseudonym to Daphne), join the band and board a train. Joe and Jerry both fall for "Sugar Kane" (Monroe), the band's sexy Polish-American vocalist and ukulele player, and fight for her affection while maintaining their disguises.In Florida, Joe woos Sugar by assuming a second disguise as a millionaire named "Junior", the heir to Shell Oil, while mimicking Cary Grant's voice. An actual millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Brown), falls for Jerry in his Daphne guise. One night Osgood asks Daphne out to his yacht. Joe convinces Daphne to keep Osgood ashore while he goes on the yacht with Sugar. That night Osgood proposes to Daphne who, in a state of excitement, accepts, believing he can finagle a large settlement from Osgood immediately following their wedding ceremony.When the mobsters arrive at the same hotel for a conference honoring "Friends of Italian Opera", Spats and his gang spot Joe and Jerry. After several humorous chases (and witnessing yet another mob murder), Jerry, Joe, Sugar, and Osgood escape to the millionaire's yacht. Enroute, Sugar tells Joe that she's in love with him and not with "Junior". Jerry, for his part, tries to explain to Osgood that he can't marry him, but Osgood is oblivious to all of Jerry's objections and remains determined -- to the very end&mdash;to go through with the marriage; finally, Jerry removes the wig and yells, "I'm a man!", prompting Osgood to utter the movie's memorable last line: "Well, nobody's perfect."CastMarilyn Monroe as 'Sugar' Kane KowalczykTony Curtis as Joe / "Josephine" / "Junior"Jack Lemmon as Jerry / "Daphne"George Raft as 'Spats' ColomboPat O'Brien as Detective MulliganJoe E.

Robinson, Jr. as Johnny ParadiseProductionThe film was originally planned to be filmed in full color, but after several screen tests, it had to be changed to black and white because of a very obvious 'green tint' around the heavy make-up required by Curtis and Lemmon when portraying Josephine and Daphne.The Florida segment was filmed at Hotel Del Coronado in Coronado, California.Some Like It Hot received a "C" (Condemned) rating from the Catholic Legion of Decency. The film, along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) and several other films, led to the end of the Production Code in the mid-1960s.

A 1991 production of this show in London featured Tommy Steele and retained the original title.In 2002, Tony Curtis performed in a stage production of the film. He portrayed the character originally played by Joe E. Brown.AwardsThe film won an Academy Award for Best Costume Design, Black-and-White (Orry-Kelly) and was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Jack Lemmon), Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.It won the Golden Globe for Best Comedy.

He looks similar to Daphne, and becomes the romantic persuit of General Melchett.&quot;Nobody's perfect!&quot;The film's last line has frequently been parodied:In the Torchwood episode "To the Last Man", as "Gwen: He's a frozen soldier from 1918. / Jack: grinning Nobody's perfect."In Independence Day, as "Albert Nimzicki: I'm not Jewish. / Julius Levinson: Nobody's perfect."MiscellaneousTony Curtis is frequently quoted as saying that kissing Marilyn Monroe was like "kissing Hitler." In a 2001 interview with Leonard Maltin, Curtis stated that he never made this claim.The film's title is a line in the nursery rhyme "Pease Porridge Hot."
