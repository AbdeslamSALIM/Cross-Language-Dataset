 The William M. Jennings Trophy is an annual award given to "to the goalkeeper(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it. Winners are selected based on regular-season play." Up until 1981, the Vezina Trophy had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. Since its beginnings in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 25 seasons to 27 different players. The most recent winners are Chris Osgood and Dominik Hasek of the Detroit Red Wings, who combined for a league-low 183 team goals against.HistoryUntil the 1980–81 season, the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest number of goals during the regular season. However, it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual and hence the change was made to offer the Vezina to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL General Managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is awarded to the goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals against.The Jennings Trophy was donated by the NHL's board of governors and first presented at the conclusion of the 1981–82 season. It is named in honor of the late William M. Jennings, who was a longtime governor and president of the New York Rangers and a builder of ice hockey in the United States. Normally the minimum number of games a goaltender must play to be eligible for the trophy is 25, but for the lockout shortened 1994–95 season, the required minimum was fourteen games.Five players have managed to win both the Jennings and Vezina Trophy for the same season: Patrick Roy (1988–89 and 1991–92), Ed Belfour (1990–91 and 1992–93), Dominik Hasek (1993–94 and 2000–01), Martin Brodeur (2002–03 and 2003–04) and Miikka Kiprusoff (2005–06). Roy has won the trophy five times, the most of any goaltender. Belfour and Brodeur are tied for second, having each won the trophy four times. It has been won most often by the Montreal Canadiens, on 5 occasions. The New Jersey Devils have won four times, and Buffalo Sabres and Chicago Blackhawks have three wins each.WinnersSeasonWinnerTeamWin #1981–82Rick|WamsleyMontreal Canadiens2231Denis Herron11982–83Roland|MelansonNew York Islanders2261Billy Smith]]11983–84Al|JensenWashington Capitals2261Pat Riggin11984–85Tom|BarrassoBuffalo Sabres2371Bob Sauve]]11985–86Bob|FroesePhiladelphia Flyers2411Darren Jensen11986–87Roy, Patrick|Patrick RoyMontreal Canadiens2411Brian Hayward11987–88Roy, Patrick|Patrick RoyMontreal Canadiens2382Brian Hayward21988–89Roy, Patrick|Patrick RoyMontreal Canadiens2183Brian Hayward31989–90Andy|MoogBoston Bruins2321Rejean Lemelin11990–91]]Ed|BelfourChicago Blackhawks21111991–92]]Roy, Patrick|Patrick RoyMontreal Canadiens20741992–93]]Belfour, Ed|Ed BelfourChicago Blackhawks23921993–94Dominik|HasekBuffalo Sabres2181Grant Fuhr11994–95]]Belfour, Ed|Ed BelfourChicago Blackhawks11531995–96Detroit Red Wings1811Mike Vernon]]11996–97New Jersey Devils1821Mike Dunham11997–98]]New Jersey Devils16621998–99Belfour, Ed|Ed BelfourDallas Stars1684Roman Turek11999–2000]]Roman TurekSt. Louis Blues]]16522000–01]]Hasek, Dominik|Dominik HasekBuffalo Sabres18422001–02]]Roy, Patrick|Patrick RoyColorado Avalanche16952002–03&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;New Jersey Devils1663Roman|Cechmanek|Roman Čechmánek&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Philadelphia Flyers1661Robert Esche&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;12003–04]]New Jersey Devils16442004–05]]2004-05 NHL lockoutNo winner---2005–06]]Calgary Flames20012006–07Minnesota Wild1911Manny Fernandez12007–08Dominik|HasekDetroit Red Wings1843Chris Osgood2NotesFor the 2002–03 season, there was a tie between Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils and Robert Esche and Roman Cechmanek of the Philadelphia Flyers.
