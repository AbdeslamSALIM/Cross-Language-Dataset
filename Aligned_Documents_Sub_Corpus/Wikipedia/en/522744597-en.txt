Riders competed in national teams. The race was the idea of the Tour de France organiser, Félix Lévitan, who wanted to attract to the roads of the Tour teams from countries such as the Soviet Union and other communist nations that had no professional riders.From 1986 to 1990, the race was organized under the name of Tour de la Communauté Européenne (English: Tour of European Community).It is currently reserved for riders up to 23 years old and it is considered prestigious for that age group. This is partly because of the impressive names of previous winners, including later Tour de France winners Felice Gimondi, Joop Zoetemelk, Greg Lemond, Miguel Indurain and Laurent Fignon, who have won 12 editions of the Tour de France between them. Since 2007, the event is run as a UCI Nations Cup event, meaning that it is open to men under 23 category and is once more run for national teams.Previous winners                                                  External linksOfficial 2007 siteCategory:Cycle races in France Category:Recurring events established in 1961da:Tour de l'Avenir de:Tour de l’Avenir es:Tour del Porvenir fr:Tour de l'Avenir it:Tour de l'Avenir lb:Tour de l'Avenir nl:Ronde van de Toekomst ja:ツール・ド・ラブニール no:Tour de l'Avenir pl:Tour de l'Avenir
