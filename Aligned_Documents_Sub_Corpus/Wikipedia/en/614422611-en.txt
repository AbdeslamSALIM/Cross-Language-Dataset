  The Austro-Asiatic languages are a large language family of Southeast Asia, and also scattered throughout India and Bangladesh. The name comes from the Latin word for "south" and the Greek name of Asia, hence "South Asia." Among these languages, only Vietnamese, Khmer, and Mon have a long recorded history, and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status (in Vietnam and Cambodia, respectively). The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups.Austro-Asiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. It is widely believed that the Austro-Asiatic languages are the autochthonous languages of Southeast Asia and the eastern Indian subcontinent, and that the other languages of the region, including the Indo-European, Tai-Kadai, Dravidian, and Sino-Tibetan languages, are the result of later migrations of people. There are, for example, Austro-Asiatic words in the Tibeto-Burman languages of eastern Nepal. Some linguists have attempted to prove that Austro-Asiatic languages are related to Austronesian languages, thus forming the Austric superfamily.ClassificationLinguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austro-Asiatic: the Mon-Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, Northeast India and the Nicobar Islands, and the Munda languages of East and Central India and parts of Bangladesh. Ethnologue identifies 168 Austro-Asiatic languages, of which 147 are Mon-Khmer and 21 are Munda. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published, and it is possible that the linguistic classification has been influenced by researchers' subjective perception of a racial dichotomy between the speakers of languages that have traditionally been classified as Mon-Khmer and those that have traditionally been classified as Munda.Each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade. However, the relationships between these families within Austro-Asiatic is debated; in addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional Mon-Khmer as a valid unit. It should be noted that little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.===Gérard Diffloth (1974)=== This is the widely cited used in Encyclopædia Britannica.

This means that a language may appear to be more distantly related than it actually is due to language contact, so it is only a starting point for a proper genealogical classification.NicobareseMunda-KhmerMundaMon-KhmerKhasiNuclear Mon-KhmerMangic (Mang + Palyu) (perhaps in Northern MK)Vietic (perhaps in Northern MK)Northern Mon-KhmerPalaungicKhmuic'Central Mon-KhmerKhmer dialectsPearicAsli-BahnaricAslianMon-BahnaricMonicKatu-BahnaricKatuicBahnaric===Gérard Diffloth (2005)=== Rather than counting cognates, Diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades, and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations.Munda languages (India)Koraput: 7 languagesCore Munda languagesKharian-Juang: 2 languagesNorth Munda languagesKorku Kherwarian: 12 languagesKhasi-Khmuic languagesKhasian: 3 languages of eastern India and Bangladesh.Palaungo-Khmuic languagesKhmuic: 13 languages of Laos and Thailand.Palaungo-Pakanic languagesPakanic or Palyu: 2 languages of southern ChinaPalaungic: 21 languages of Burma, southern China, and Thailand, plus Mang of Vietnam.Nuclear Mon-Khmer languagesKhmero-Vietic languagesVieto-Katuic languagesVietic: 10 languages of Vietnam and Laos, including the Vietnamese language, which has the most speakers of any Austro-Asiatic language.
