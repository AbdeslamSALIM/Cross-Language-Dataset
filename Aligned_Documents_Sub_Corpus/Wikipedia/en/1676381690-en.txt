His parents divorced when he was three years old, so Howard lived with his mother, a project manager for a cosmetics distributor. His father, a long-distance truck driver for a health-care firm, nonetheless maintained a presence in his life. It was his father, in fact, who was determined to get Tim and his brother, Chris, involved in sports. Before the two could walk, he bought them equipment for various sports to see which games they preferred. Tim showed a preference for basketball and soccer.Racism, which manifested itself when Howard dated a Caucasian female whose father refused to let him in their house, was one of two major obstacles Howard faced in his early life; the other was Tourette's syndrome. Howard’s symptoms began to appear when he was in the fifth grade. He did not suffer from the well-known form of the disease that causes one to curse randomly and without warning, but from a strain that made him feel compelled to touch objects and people in specific ways. For example, he would put his hands on his mother's shoulders or arms whenever he would talk with her. Before Howard was even a teenager, Tim Mulqueen, a one time assistant coach for the U-17 United States Men's National Soccer Team, saw his potential at a soccer camp Howard attended and took the boy under his wing.In high school Howard proved a star not only in soccer, as a midfielder, but also on the basketball court, where he averaged 15 points per game and helped bring his team to the state finals in his senior year. However his talent and abilities as a soccer player were far more impressive. Despite his position on his high school team, Howard was a far better goalkeeper than he was an outfield player. Howard spent the first years of high school attending Montclair Kimberley Academy, a small private school in Montclair, New Jersey.MKA’s Riddick has unique view as she watches surging Mounties, The Montclair Times, May 20, 2005 Howard left MKA his junior year to go back to North Brunswick where he grew up, and graduated from North Brunswick Township High School.By the age of 15 he began covering goals on U.S. youth national teams. He made his international debut against Honduras on the U-17 squad. In 1997 Mulqueen became the coach of the North Jersey Imperials, a team in the United Systems of Independent Soccer Leagues(USISL), and served as the goalkeeper coach for MLS's MetroStars; he immediately considered Howard for a position on the Imperials. In May of that year, a month before graduating from high school, Howard played for the Imperials in his first professional game.Club careerNorth Jersey Imperials and MetroStarsAfter only six appearances with the USISL's North Jersey Imperials, Tim Mulqueen, who at the time was the New York/New Jersey MetroStar's goalkeeper coach, brought Howard up from the Imperials to the MetroStars1998: Victorious in his MLS debut with Metrostar's on August 18 making five saves in a 4-1 win over Colorado at Giants Stadium (his only appearance of the year) ... Played in one game with the Nike Project-40 Team, a 3-1 win over the Staten Island Vipers at Giants Stadium on May 6.1999: With the MetroStars, he made eight starts in nine contests ... Had a 1.58 GAA and won just one match in a season in which the Metros won just seven games … Spent most of the season with the U.S. Under-20 MNT ... He left the club to compete in the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria in April and the Pan Am Games in Winnipeg in July2000: Posted a 5-2-2 record with a 1.59 GAA in 2000, splitting time between the MetroStars and the U.S. Olympic Team … Started and won all three of his U.S. Open Cup starts2001: Became the youngest player to win the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year award, recording four shutouts and a league-leading 146 saves … Named to the MLS All-Star Team … Played every minute of every MetroStars game … Finished the year with a 1.33 GAA, four shutouts and a 13-10-3 record … Received the MLS Humanitarian of the Year Award2002: Played in 27 of 28 regular season games, recording four shutouts2003: Before leaving the MetroStars he appeared in 13 games and had three shutouts as the MetroStars challenged for first place during the season’s first halfManchester UnitedManchester United paid a $4 million transfer fee to sign Howard in the middle of the 2003 MLS season, and surprisingly he replaced French international Fabien Barthez as the club's first-choice goalkeeper. He started off very well at Manchester United, saving the decisive penalty in the Community Shield against Arsenal. Other notable performances followed, including Bolton Wanderers and a home FA Cup tie victory over Manchester City. However, in March 2004, Howard's poor parry handed a last minute goal to FC Porto, eliminating United from the UEFA Champions League. The error appeared to shatter Howard's confidence and he was replaced by Roy Carroll. After a period of rest, Howard reclaimed his starting position ahead of Carroll for the 2004 FA Cup Final, picking up a winner's medal. He was the first American player to collect a winner's medal in the FA Cup, although fellow countryman John Harkes had picked up a runners-up medal with Sheffield Wednesday in the 1993 final. Howard was also named in the PFA Best XI in his first season at Manchester United, making him the only United player in the team.In his second season with Manchester United, he started poorly, making several errors and was dropped again for Carroll. After Carroll made several errors as well, Howard forced his way back in but his performances were unconvincing, leading to Carroll retaining his place again, playing in the FA cup final defeat to Arsenal.At the end of the 2005–06 season, Howard signed a new contract, which was to run until 2009. In the summer of 2005, Manchester United released both of his competitors for the goalkeeper position — Ricardo López Felipe and Carroll. However, they also bought experienced Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar soon after. An uncharacteristically outspoken Howard fumed in an interview that he would not have signed the new contract had he known van der Sar was on his way to United (van der Sar replaced Howard as first choice keeper). He felt that he had done enough to remain as the first choice United keeper.EvertonIn May 2006 a deal was agreed between Manchester United and Everton that would see Howard join the Merseyside club on loan for the 2006–07 season. Everton looked to Tim as a replacement for their newly-retired goalkeeper Nigel Martyn, in much the same way as Manchester United, when they were involved in the search for a successor to Peter Schmeichel (after many unsuccessful replacements). Howard made his Everton debut against Watford on the opening day of the season. Since his debut, Howard has established himself as Everton's first-choice goalkeeper.On February 14 2007, Everton announced that Howard had signed a permanent deal with the club through the 2012–2013 season. The permanent deal is believed to be worth around £3 million, but the exact fee paid by Everton remains undisclosed.On April 28, 2007, Everton faced Manchester United at Goodison Park. Howard did not participate in the game, and there was some speculation that this came from a clause in his loan contract which states that he cannot take part in games against Manchester United. However, since a permanent deal had been signed by the two clubs, such a clause would not be permitted. This was investigated by the Football Association and according to some newspapers, both Everton and Manchester United could have been fined for this and possibly receive point deductions. But the British newspaper The Sun, however, held it to be more likely that this affair would result in a tightening of the rules on loan deals. The F.A. eventually stated on May 6 that neither Manchester United nor Everton had broken any rules regarding Howard's transfer and that both clubs had confirmed that Everton had been free to play Howard against Manchester United if they had wished to do so.International careerHoward started for the United States national team in the 1999 World Youth Championship in Nigeria and was a backup to Brad Friedel (of Aston Villa) at the 2000 Summer Olympics. On March 10, 2002, he received his first senior cap, against Ecuador. Howard has appeared for the US 32 times so far (as of December 23 2007). On May 2, 2006, Howard was named as one of three goalkeepers on the US roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. Howard was also the starting keeper for the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup final, a 2–1 win over Mexico. He has recently established himself as the first choice keeper for the US national team, over players such as Kasey Keller (who was first choice for the 2006 World Cup) and Marcus Hahnemann. Howard also started for the US v Mexico friendly match held on February 6, 2008, in Houston, which resulted in a 2–2 draw.HonoursManchester UnitedFA Cup:Winner (1): 2003-04Runner-up (1): 2004-05Football League Cup:Winner (1): 2005-06FA Community Shield:Winner (1): 2003Runner-up (1): 2004===United States Soccer Federation===CONCACAF Gold Cup:Winner (1): 2007Career statistics  |- |1997||North Jersey Imperials||USISL||6||0|||||||| |- |1998||rowspan="6"|New York/New Jersey MetroStars||rowspan="6"|Major League Soccer||1||0|||||||| |- |1999||9||0|||||||| |- |2000||9||0|||||||| |- |2001||29||0|||||||| |- |2002||27||0|||||||| |- |2003||13||0||||||||  |- |2003-04||rowspan="3"|Manchester United||rowspan="3"|Premier League||32||0|||||||| |- |2004-05||12||0|||||||| |- |2005-06||1||0|||||||| |- |2006-07||rowspan="3"|Everton||rowspan="3"|Premier League||36||0|||||||| |- |2007-08||36||0|||||||| |- |2008-09||6||0|||||||| 94||0|||||||| 123||0|||||||| 217||0|||||||| |HumanitarianHoward has Tourette syndromeTourette Syndrome Association.
