She rose to fame as lead singer/guitarist for the punk rock band The Distillers.Musical careerAt the age of 13, Dalle started a band of her own, Sourpuss, which developed a solid fanbase, and played alongside Beastie Boys and Sonic Youth at Australia's Summersault Festival. She met Tim Armstrong, the frontman of the punk rock band Rancid at this festival when she was 16. She met him after seeing him packing up the drums backstage, and the two subsequently pursued a relationship. Despite Armstrong being 12 years her senior, and Dalle initially lying about her age, the couple got engaged shortly after Dalle turned 18. She moved with Armstrong from Melbourne to Los Angeles, California and there founded The Distillers, which took their name from a distillery she saw in Geelong.The Distillers released their self-titled first album in 2000, receiving acclaim and comparisons to Hole. By the time The Distillers came back to the studio for their second album, the band had a complete overhaul in lineup. The Distillers' second effort was Sing Sing Death House. From that album they released two singles, "The Young Crazed Peeling" and "City of Angels". In 2003, they released Coral Fang. Dalle was then the only original member in the group. They released three singles from it: "Drain the Blood", "Beat Your Heart Out" and "The Hunger". That same year, they played Lollapalooza.After the Distillers broke up, Dalle began work on a new project, Spinnerette, with fellow Distillers member Tony Bevilacqua, former Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, and Alain Johannes. The band has only one song, Valium Knights, available which can be heard on Spinnerette official website as of the 08/08/08. The band chose this release date as they consider it a special day of regeneration and resurrection.Spinnerette :: Landing_stf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;She appeared on the track "Weigh on My Mind" on the self-titled album by The Transplants in 2002.
