As crown prince, he distinguished himself by his brilliant victory over the Tatars at Kopersztyn (1487). In 1490, the Hungarian nobility proclaimed John King of Hungary at the Rákos diet. He was, however, defeated by his brother, King Ladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary. In 1492, John succeeded his father as King of Poland.Losses of revenue due to the secession of Lithuania placed John at the mercy of the Polish sejmik''s, or local diets, where the ''szlachta, or local nobles, made their subsidies dependent on the king's subservience.John desired to pose as the champion of Christendom against the Ottoman Turks. Circumstances seemed, moreover, to favor him. In his brother Ladislaus, who as King of Hungary and Bohemia possessed a dominant influence in central Europe, he found a counterpoise to the machinations of Emperor Maximilian I, who in 1492 had concluded an alliance against him with Ivan III of Muscovy. As suzerain of Moldavia, John was favorably situated for attacking the Turks. At the conference of Leutschau (1494), the details of the expedition were arranged between the kings of Poland and Hungary and Elector John Cicero of Brandenburg, with the co-operation of Stephen III of Moldavia, hospodar of Moldavia, who had appealed to John for assistance.In the course of 1496 John collected an army of 80,000 men in Poland with great difficulty, but the crusade was deflected from its course by the sudden invasion of Galicia by the hospodar, who apparently — for the whole subject is still very obscure — had been misled by reports from Hungary that John was bent upon placing his younger brother Sigismund on the throne of Moldavia. Whatever the reason, the Poles entered Moldavia not as friends but as foes, and after the abortive siege of Suceava were compelled to retreat following defeat at the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. The insubordination of the szlachta seems to have been one cause of this disgraceful collapse, for John after his return confiscated hundreds of their estates; in spite of which, to the end of his life he retained his extraordinary popularity.When the new Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Friedrich Wettin von Sachsen, refused to render homage to the Polish crown, John compelled him to do so. His intention to still further humiliate the Teutonic Order was stymied by his sudden death in 1501.Ancestors+''' John I Albert's ancestors in three generations'''John I Albert of PolandFather:Casimir IV JagiellonPaternal Grandfather:JogailaPaternal Great-grandfather:AlgirdasPaternal Great-grandmother:Uliana Alexandrovna of TverPaternal Grandmother:Sophia of HalshanyPaternal Great-grandfather:Andrew of HalshanyPaternal Great-grandmother:Alexandra DruckaMother:Elisabeth of AustriaMaternal Grandfather:Albert II of GermanyMaternal Great-grandfather:Albert IV, Duke of AustriaMaternal Great-grandmother:Johanna of Bavaria, Queen of BohemiaMaternal Grandmother:Elisabeth II of BohemiaMaternal Great-grandfather:Sigismund, Holy Roman EmperorMaternal Great-grandmother:Barbara of CeljeSee alsoHistory of Poland (1385-1569)Piotrków StatutesReferencesV.
