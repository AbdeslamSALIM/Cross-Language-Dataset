The Magdeburg hemispheres were a pair of large copper hemispheres with mating rims. When the rims were sealed with grease and the air was pumped out, the sphere contained a vacuum and could not be pulled apart by teams of horses. The Magdeburg hemispheres were designed by German scientist Otto von Guericke in 1650 to demonstrate the air pump he had invented and the concept of air pressure. The first artificial vacuum had been produced a few years earlier by Evangelista Torricelli, and had inspired von Guericke to design the world's first vacuum pump, which consisted of a piston and cylinder with one-way flap valves. The original hemispheres are preserved in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.'s sketch of Otto von Guericke's Magdeburg hemispheres experiment.]]OverviewThe Magdeburg hemispheres, around 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were designed to demonstrate the [[vacuum pump]] that von Guericke had invented. One of them had a tube connection to attach the pump, with a valve to close it off.  When the air was sucked out from inside the hemispheres, and the valve was closed, the hose from the pump could be detached, and they were held firmly together by the [[air pressure]] of the surrounding [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].The force holding the hemispheres together was equal to the area bounded by the joint between the hemispheres, a circle with a diameter of 50 cm, multiplied by the difference in air pressure between the inside and the outside. It is unclear how good a vacuum von Guericke's pump was able to achieve, but if it was able to evacuate all of the air from the inside, the hemispheres would have been held together with a force of around 20&thinsp;000&nbsp;N (4&thinsp;500&nbsp;lbf)Calculated using a diameter of 0.5&nbsp;m with atmospheric pressure. Due to the inefficiencies of the vacuum pump, the artificial vacuum was likely much weaker., equivalent to lifting a car or small elephant; a dramatic demonstration of the pressure of the atmosphere.DemonstrationsVon Guericke's demonstration was performed on 8 May 1654 in front of the Reichstag and the Emperor Ferdinand III in Regensburg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thirty horses, in two teams of 15, could not separate the hemispheres until the vacuum was released. In [[1656]] he repeated the demonstration with 16 horses (2 teams of 8) in his hometown of [[Magdeburg]], where he was mayor. He also took the two spheres, hung the two hemispheres with a support, and removed the air from within. He then strapped weights to the spheres, but the spheres would not budge. In [[1657]], [[Gaspar Schott]] was the first to describe the experiment in print in his ''[[Mechanica Hydraulico-Pneumatica]]''. In [[1663]] (or according to some sources in [[1661]]) the demonstration was given in [[Berlin]]  before [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]]) with 24 horses. The experiment became very popular to illustrate the principles of air pressure, and many smaller copies of the hemispheres were made, and are used to this day in science classes. Re-enactments of von Guerike's 1654 experiment are performed in locations around the world by the Otto von Guericke Society. The experiment has been commemorated on at least two German stamps.RelatedAfter learning about Guericke's pump through Schott's book, Robert Boyle worked with Robert Hooke to design and build an improved air pump. From this, through various experiments, they formulated what is called Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a body of an ideal gas is inversely proportional to its pressure. Soon the ideal gas law was formulated.Based on these concepts, in 1679, an associate of Boyle's named Denis Papin built a steam digester, which is a closed vessel with a tightly fitting lid that confines steam until a high pressure is generated. Later designs implemented a steam release valve to keep the machine from exploding. By watching the valve rhythmically move up and down, Papin conceived of the idea of a piston and cylinder engine. He did not, however, follow through with his design. Nevertheless, in 1697, based on Papin's designs, engineer Thomas Savery built the first commercial steam engine.TriviaA variation of Schott's sketch featuring a single pair of horses trying to separate a pair of jeans appears on the tag of Levi Strauss &amp; Co. jeans.References published in print Summer 2004.FootnotesExternal linksMagdeburg HemispheresCategory:Physics experiments Category:Historical scientific instruments Category:Magdeburgcs:Magdeburské polokoule de:Magdeburger Halbkugeln es:Hemisferios de Magdeburgo eo:Magdeburgaj duongloboj eu:Magdeburgoko Hemisferioak fr:Hémisphères de Magdebourg nl:Maagdenburger halve bollen ja:マグデブルグの半球 pl:Półkule magdeburskie ru:Магдебургские полушария sk:Magdeburské pologule sl:Magdeburški polkrogli fi:Magdeburgin puolipallot zh:馬德堡半球
