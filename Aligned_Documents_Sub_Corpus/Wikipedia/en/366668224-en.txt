  The Brazilian Giant Tortoise, Forest Tortoise, South American Tortoise, South American Yellow-footed Tortoise, or Yellow-footed Tortoise (Geochelone denticulata) is a species of turtle in the Testudinidae family. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.This species is sexually dimorphic and is easy to distinguish. The male has an extreme plastral concavity and is subsequently much lighter. There is a pinching off at the midsection of the carapace. The female is much heavier, with a flat plastron and more symmetrical, curved carapace. The female also has a shorter tail compared to the male. The male is quite vocal at mating time with a low moan produced.The Yellow foot tortoise is much larger with constant yellow markings compared to the red foot tortoise (Geochelone carbonaria - underlined). Also, the yellow foot is strictly a rainforest species. It is not found in grasslands or savannah regions.As with many species of turtles and tortoises, many yellow foots end up as food items in local markets.==References==Tortoise & Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group 1996.
