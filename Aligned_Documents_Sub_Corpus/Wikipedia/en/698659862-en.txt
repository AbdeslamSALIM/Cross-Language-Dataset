  Wig Wam is a Norwegian hard rock band, which is dedicated to Glam metal and imitates the style of typical rock bands from the 1980s movement.EurovisionIn the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 Wig Wam represented Norway after winning the Norwegian pre-selection Melodi Grand Prix. With the song "In My Dreams", written by guitarist Teeny, they brought Norway to a ninth place in Kiev. The song immediately became a huge hit in Norway, being among the most bought singles for 19 weeks and peaking for three weeks at the top of the national single chart http://lista.vg.no/album_info.php?AlbumOp=show&amp;albumId=4526&amp;albumtype=song&amp;albumtype_id=, an achievement neither of Norway's two Eurovision winners managed. Also in Iceland and Sweden it enjoyed moderate to huge commercial success. The band's slogan says: "Rock is the new schläger".Wig Wam first took part in the Eurovision in 2004, finishing 3rd in the Norwegian final. With the song "Crazy Things" they could not beat singer Knut Anders Sørum ("High"), who subsequently slumped to last place in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2004. Band leader Glam also took part in the Norwegian preselection on his own in 1998 and claimed third place under his former artist name G'sten, singing the song "Always Will".After the 2005 contest Glam caused mild controversy due to his actions in interviews after the contest, in particular with the United Kingdom's BBC broadcasts, where he seemingly had to be separated from Javine during an interview in their after-show. The band also confirmed their desire to tour Europe later in the year.The Eurovision song "In My Dreams" may contain a guitar riff taken from another song, according to the Latvian entrants, who claimed after the competition that Wig Wam had sampled another song and that they knew which one it was. The Latvian duo, however, refused to reveal which song it was due to it "being Wig Wam's song".On the 28th of May 2005 Wig Wam were also special guests on the Norwegian Junior Eurovision pre-selection final, as well as on the Norwegian Eurovision-preselection of 2006 on the 4th of May 2006 presenting a medley of their Eurovision-entry "In My Dreams" and their new single "Gonna Get You Someday".Band historyWig Wam comes from Norway, more specifically the county of Østfold, and they were founded in 2001.
