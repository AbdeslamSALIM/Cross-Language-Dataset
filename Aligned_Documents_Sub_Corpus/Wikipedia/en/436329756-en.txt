He was a famous centre-back or right-back.Starting out in the German Bundesliga, his first club was Bayern Munich, for whom he played initially from the youth squad, forging to the first team and making eight starts, as well as four substitute appearances in league games.Moving to Hamburger SV in August 1992 gave Babbel the chance to appear regularly in a first-team slot. Between this and his exit in 1994, he managed to score his first league goal. Transferring back to Bayern Munich, he made 167 starts, before being snapped up by then-Liverpool F.C. manager Gérard Houllier in June 2000, building part of the solid back four of Liverpool's five trophy winning season of 2001. He went on loan to Blackburn Rovers in August 2003 after having recovered from Guillain-Barré syndrome, achieving regular first team appearances in the league, and three goals in the process. Babbel won the UEFA Cup twice, in 1996 with Bayern and in 2001 with Liverpool.He was an integral member of Liverpool's historic 2000&ndash;01 treble winning side and his characteristic raiding runs down the right side led to plenty of important goals, including in the UEFA Cup final itself. His Liverpool career was forced to a sudden halt when he contracted the virus and was unable to play for a whole season. Despite his limited number of appearances, he was loved by the Liverpool fans, and was voted at number 53 on the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop survey.Babbel's most recent club is VfB Stuttgart, who he joined on a free transfer in July 2004. He has been capped over 50 times for Germany and was part of the Euro 96 winning team. Babbel also played for his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and Euro 2000.In January 2007, Babbel announced that he would retire at the end of the season. In May 2007, he signed as assistant coach of the VfB Stuttgart.HonoursUEFA Cup (2): 1996, 2001European Championship (1): 1996Bundesliga (4): 1997, 1999, 2000, 2007DFB Liga-Pokal (3): 1997, 1998, 1999; Runner-up 2005DFB Pokal (2): 1998, 2000; Runner-up: 1999, 2007Football League Cup (1): 2001FA Cup (1): 2001Community Shield (1): 2001European Super Cup (1): 2001UEFA Champions League: Runner-up 1999External linksCareer stats at fussballdaten.deProfile at Liverpoolfc.tv   Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:German expatriate footballers Category:German expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:German footballers Category:Germany international footballers Category:Germany under-21 international footballers Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Bayern Munich players Category:Bayern Munich II players Category:Hamburger SV players Category:Liverpool F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:VfB Stuttgart players Category:Premier League players Category:People from Munich Category:Bavarian sportspeople Category:UEFA Euro 1996 players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 2000 players Category:UEFA European Football Championship-winning players Category:First Bundesliga footballersde:Markus Babbel es:Markus Babbel fr:Markus Babbel it:Markus Babbel nl:Markus Babbel no:Markus Babbel pl:Markus Babbel ru:Баббель, Маркус sl:Markus Babbel fi:Markus Babbel sv:Markus Babbel
