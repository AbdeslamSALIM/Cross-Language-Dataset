In 1991, he won the Kantou National Cup Kart Championship. In 1992 he was second in the Regional Kart Championship East Kantou series A1 Class and also won the Japan Kart Grand Prix SS stock class National GP. The following year he joined the All Japan Kart Championship Series Formula A Class before progressing to the All Japan Formula Three series.In 1999 he came second in the All Japan GT Championship GT300 Class Series. He was also the Formula Dream series champion in Japan. In 2002 Ide joined the French Formula 3 series and finished in seventh place. The following year, 2003, he joined the All Japan Championship Formula Nippon Series and also finished seventh. In 2004, he claimed third spot before going on to win the Super Endurance Race Class 3 Series. He finished his first stint in Formula Nippon finishing second in the 2005 championship.Formula One.]] At age 31, Ide became one of Formula One's older rookies when he landed a seat at Super Aguri for the 2006 season, in part due to Super Aguri's aspiration of fielding an all-Japanese team. Ide had known Aguri Suzuki for a long time, according to a press release, however Ide's meshing with the team had some issues with his lack of proficient English.In his debut race in Bahrain, Ide was not that far behind his teammate Takuma Sato but failed to finish. At the next race in Malaysia, he retired after 33 laps.The third race of the 2006 season went poorly for Ide: He was blamed for blocking Rubens Barrichello during his qualifying lap, causing the Brazilian to be stuck in the first round of qualifying and start 16th on the grid. Ide finished in Australia, two laps down. His weekend in Melbourne was notable for a number of spins, and team principal Aguri Suzuki subsequently suggested Ide's seat was not safe if his performances did not improve.At Imola, Ide caused a first lap crash with Christijan Albers that put the Dutchman into a series of rolls which ended with Albers' car upside down. Ide was reprimanded by the stewards and warned over future conduct. Many accepted that this was not entirely his fault, as the rushed Aguri project had not allowed him much time in the car pre-season.On May 4, 2006, Super Aguri announced that following advice from the FIA, Ide would be dropped from the upcoming European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, being replaced by former Renault test driver Franck Montagny. Ide was demoted to Montagny's seat as test driver.On May 10, 2006, the FIA revoked Ide's FIA Super Licence meaning he could no longer compete in F1 during the 2006 season. Super Aguri remained committed to getting Ide back into F1 until their withdrawal from Formula One.OverallOverall during Ide's four-race F1 career, he finished once - a 13th place at the 2006 Australian Grand Prix. Ide started last three of his four starts. His best qualifying effort was 21st of 22 cars at his debut at Bahrain. At Bahrain, the 22nd starter, Kimi Räikkönen, did not complete a qualifying attempt.Return to lower-level racingIn July 2006 it was announced that Ide would be racing for Team Dandelion Racing in the final six rounds of the Formula Nippon championship, with the aim of increasing his racing experience.In 2007, he has remained in Formula Nippon with the Autobacs Racing Team Aguri team, which is owned by Aguri Suzuki. His best finish of the season is a third place, scored in round five at Suzuka.PersonalAccording to Ide's personal website, he is 69 kilograms (152 pounds), 177 centimeters (5.8 ft) tall, and the blood type AB+ .http://babelfish.altavista.com/babelfish/trurl_pagecontent?lp=ja_en&amp;trurl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.yuji-ide.com%2fpro.html (Japanese) Ide is good friends with Shoichi Funaki.Racing recordCareer summarySeasonSeriesTeam NameRacesPolesWinsPointsFinal Placing1994All-Japan Formula ThreeActive]]6000NCAsada Racing0001997All-Japan Formula ThreeAsada Racing2000NC1998All-Japan Formula ThreeNow Motorsports7000NC2000All-Japan Formula ThreeMugen Dome Project]]1012352ndMacau Grand PrixSkill Speed100N/A24thF3 Korea Super PrixSkill Speed100N/A13th2001All-Japan Formula ThreeThree Bond Racing18001005thMacau Grand PrixSignature Compétition100N/A5thF3 Korea Super PrixSignature Compétition100N/A12th2002French Formula Three]]Autobacs Racing Team Aguri1401847thEuropean Formula Three Cup]]Autobacs Racing Team Aguri100N/A6thMacau Grand PrixAutobacs Racing Team Aguri100N/ANCMasters of Formula Three]]Autobacs Racing Team Aguri100N/A25thF3 Korea Super PrixAutobacs Racing Team Aguri100N/A10th2003Formula Nippon]]Racing Team Cerumo1000197thAll-Japan GT Championship]]Team Impul802647th2004Formula Nippon]]Team Impul911323rd2005Formula Nippon]]Team Impul912392ndSuper GTTeam Impul (GT500)8103521st2006Formula One]]Super Aguri]]400025thFormula Nippon]]Team Dandelion Racing6000NCSuper GT]]NISMO]]1000NC2007Formula Nippon]]Autobacs Racing Team Aguri900613thSuper GT]]Autobacs Racing Team Aguri (GT500)1001518th2008Formula Nippon]]Autobacs Racing Team Aguri1100219thComplete Formula One results(key)YrEntrantChassisEngine123456789101112131415161718WDCPoints2006]]Super Aguri F1Super Aguri]] SA05Honda]] RA806E 2.4 V8BHRRetMALRetAUS13SMRRetEUR]]ESP]]MON]]GBR]]CAN]]USA]]FRA]]GER]]HUN]]TUR]]ITA]]CHN]]JPN]]BRA]]25th0ReferencesExternal linksYuji Ide Official site Yuji Ide profile and statisticsCareer details  Category:Japanese racecar drivers Category:Japanese Formula One drivers Category:Formula Nippon drivers Category:Japanese Formula Three Championship drivers Category:French Formula Three Championship drivers Category:Super GT drivers Category:Super Aguri Formula One drivers Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Saitama (city)ca:Yuji Ide de:Yūji Ide et:Yūji Ide es:Yuji Ide fr:Yuji Ide id:Yuji Ide it:Yuji Ide lv:Judži Ide hu:Ide Judzsi nl:Yuji Ide ja:井出有治 no:Yuji Ide pl:Yuji Ide pt:Yuji Ide ro:Yuji Ide ru:Иде, Юдзи sl:Judži Ide fi:Yūji Ide sv:Yuji Ide zh:井出有治
