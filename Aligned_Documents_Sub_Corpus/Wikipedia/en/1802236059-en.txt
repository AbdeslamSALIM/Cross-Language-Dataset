 is a subset of manga that is generally targeted at an 18&ndash;30 year old male audience, but the audience can be much older with some comics aimed at businessmen well into their 40s. It has a wide variety of art styles and more variation in subject matter, ranging from the avant-garde to the pornographic. The female equivalent to seinen manga is josei manga. In Japanese, the word Seinen means "young man" or "young men", and it is not indicative of sexual matter. Examples include Berserk, 3×3 Eyes, Hellsing, Chobits, Tenjho Tenge, Elfen Lied, Oh My Goddess!, Trigun Maximum, Rozen Maiden, xxxHolic, Vagabond (manga), Sekirei and Zero no Tsukaima.A common way to tell if a manga is seinen is by looking at whether or not furigana is used over the original kanji text: if there are furigana on all kanji, the title is generally aimed at a younger audience. The title of the magazine it was published in is also an important indicator. Usually Japanese manga magazines with the word young in the title (Young Jump for instance) are seinen. Other popular seinen manga magazines include Ultra Jump, Afternoon, and Big Comic.==List of seinen manga==Please see the category Seinen for a list of manga that are considered "seinen".See alsoShōnen: intended for boysShōjo: intended for girlsJosei: intended for adult womenKodomo: intended for childrenList of seinen magazinesExternal linksDefinition of seinen at the Anime News NetworkAnime for men Japanese Magazine Publishers Association Category:Japanese words and phrases Category:Anime and manga terminology Seinenast:Seinen manga ca:Seinen cs:Seinen de:Seinen es:Seinen fr:Seinen gl:Seinen it:Seinen ms:Seinen nl:Seinen ja:青年漫画 pl:Seinen pt:Seinen ro:Seinen ru:Сэйнэн fi:Seinen sv:Seinen th:เซเน็น vi:Seinen uk:Сейнен zh:青年漫画
