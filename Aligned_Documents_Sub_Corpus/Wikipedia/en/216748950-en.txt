This article refers to an art institution in London. For other meanings of '''Royal Academy' see Royal Academy (disambiguation).''The Royal Academy of Arts is an art institution based in Burlington House on Piccadilly, London, England.Historyat the Academy's original home in Somerset House.]]The Royal Academy was formed to rival the Society of Artists after an unseemly leadership dispute between two leading architects, Sir William Chambers and James Paine. Paine won, but Chambers vowed revenge and used his strong connections with King George III to create a new artistic body, the Royal Academy, in 1768. It was formally launched the following year.Its forty founder members, all admitted on 10 December 1768, included a father/daughter combination (George Michael Moser and Mary Moser) and two sets of brothers (George Dance the Younger and Nathaniel Dance-Holland, and Paul and Thomas Sandby).Sir Joshua Reynolds was its first president, and Benjamin West its second.ActivitiesThe Royal Academy does not receive financial support from the state or crown. One of its principal sources of revenue is hosting temporary public art exhibitions. These are of the highest quality, comparable to those at the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery and leading art galleries outside the United Kingdom. In 2004 the highlights of the Academy's permanent collection went on display in the newly restored reception rooms of the original section of Burlington House, which are now known as the "John Madejski Fine Rooms".Under the Direction of the Exhibitions Secretary Norman Rosenthal the Academy has hosted ambitious exhibitions of contemporary art including in 1997 "Sensation" the collection of work by Young British Artists owned by Charles Saatchi. The show created controversy for including a painting of Myra Hindley that was vandalised while on display.The Academy also hosts an annual Royal Academy summer exhibition of new art, which is a well known event on the London social calendar. It is not as fashionable as was the case in earlier centuries, and has been largely ignored by the trendy Brit Artists and their patrons; however Tracey Emin exhibited in the 2005 show. In March 2007 this relationship developed further when Tracey Emin accepted the Academy's invitation to become a Royal Academician, commenting in her weekly newspaper column that, "It doesn't mean that I have become more conformist; it means that the Royal Academy has become more open, which is healthy and brilliant."The IndependentAnyone who wishes may submit pictures for inclusion and those which are selected are displayed alongside the works of the Academicians. Many of the works are available for purchase.In 2004 the Academy attracted press and media attention for a series of financial scandals and reports of a feud between Rosenthal and other senior staff that resulted in the cancellation of what would have been profitable exhibitions. &lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006, it attracted further press by erroneously placing only the support for a sculpture on display in the belief that it was the sculpture, and then justifying it being kept on display.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;In late 2007, the director of the National Gallery, Charles Saumarez Smith, is due to take over as head of the Royal Academy in a newly created post as secretary and chief executive. &lt;/ref&gt;The Academy has received many gifts and bequests of objects and money. Many of these gifts were used to establish Trust Funds to support the work of the Royal Academy Schools by providing "Premiums" to students displaying excellence in various artistic genre. The rapid changes that pulsed through 20th century art have left some of the older prize funds looking somewhat anachronistic. But efforts are still made to award each prize to a student producing work that bears a relation to the intentions of the original benefactor.Royal Academy SchoolsThe Academy runs a postgraduate art school and a research library. The Royal Academy Schools, the country's oldest art school, is based in Burlington House. There are generally two exhibitions every year of work by Royal Academy students.html Royal Academy==Membership== Full membership of the academy is limited to 80 Academicians or "RAs", who may be painters, printmakers, sculptors, or architects, and must be "professionally active in Britain".The Academy's rules are that there must always be at least 14 sculptors, 12 architects, and 8 printmakers; the balance being made up of 46 painters. New Academicians are elected by the existing RAs, and originally had to enter a Diploma Work representative of their œuvre.Apart from kudos of being elected, full members of the Academy may expect to serve for a time on the governing council of the Academy, and to take part in various committees. Each room in the Summer Exhibition is generally hung by a different R.A.In common with certain other Royal societies, election as President of the Royal Academy (P.R.A.) practically guarantees a knighthood, if the President is not already of that rank.A larger number of Associates of the Royal Academy (designated "A.R.A.") are also elected, but being an A.R.A. is not a prerequisite to full membership.Members of the public can also join the Royal Academy as "Friends" by making a financial donation; outside of public exhibitions, this is one of the RA's main sources of income.List of RAs(incomplete list)PresidentsPresidentServedSir Joshua Reynolds1768&ndash;1792Benjamin West1792&ndash;1805James Wyatt1805&ndash;1806Benjamin West1806&ndash;1820Thomas Lawrence]]1820&ndash;1830Sir Martin Archer Shee1830&ndash;1850Sir Charles Lock Eastlake1850&ndash;1865Sir Francis Grant1866&ndash;1878Lord Leighton]]1878&ndash;1896Sir John Everett MillaisFebruary&ndash;August 1896Sir Edward Poynter1896&ndash;1918Sir Aston Webb1919&ndash;1924Sir Frank Dicksee1924&ndash;1928Sir William Llewellyn1928&ndash;1938Sir Edwin Lutyens1938&ndash;1944Sir Alfred Munnings1944&ndash;1949Gerald Kelly]]1949&ndash;1954Sir Albert Richardson1954&ndash;1956Charles Wheeler]]1956&ndash;1966Thomas Monnington]]1966&ndash;1976Sir Hugh Casson1976&ndash;1984Sir Roger de Grey1984&ndash;1993Sir Philip Dowson1993&ndash;1999Phillip King]]1999&ndash;2004Sir Nicholas Grimshaw2004&ndash;PresentOther postsKeeperServedProf. Dr. Maurice Cockrill2005&ndash;PresentTreasurerServedProf. Paul Huxley2000&ndash;PresentSecretary and Chief ExecutiveServedDr. Charles Saumarez Smith2007&ndash;PresentSee alsoThe Arts ClubRoyal West of England AcademyCategory:Members of the Royal AcademyCork Street, behind the Royal Academy, with many art galleriesReferencesExternal links[http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/ Official website of the Royal Academy]Category:Art museums and galleries in London Category:Art schools in London Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom Category:Education in Westminster Category:Buildings and structures in Westminster Category:1768 establishments *ar:الأكاديمية الملكية للفنون cs:Royal Academy of Arts de:Royal Academy of Arts es:Royal Academy fr:Royal Academy it:Royal Academy of Arts hu:Királyi Művészeti Akadémia nl:Royal Academy of Arts ja:ロイヤル・アカデミー・オブ・アーツ no:Royal Academy pl:Royal Academy pt:Academia Real Inglesa ru:Королевская Академия художеств
