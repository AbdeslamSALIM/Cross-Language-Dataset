It is located midway between the islands of Ios and Folegandros. It was known as Oinoe (Island of Wine) in Ancient Greece. It contrasts with nearby islands, such as Ios, in being quiet and relatively less developed. There are two villages, one being a harbor, and the other higher up in the hills. There are a handful of tavernas in the harbor. The beach at the harbor is one of two large sandy beaches on the island. Several ancient ruins rest on the island, although some are remote. There are only 2 paved roads, although a third is being built to connect the nascent heliport and eventually a new resort on the other sandy beach, and there are several well-maintained dirt roads. Much of the island is very difficult to access due to the terrain. Nearly all of the island's area is covered by terraces once used for extensive agriculture. Now only a handful are used across the island, most operating on government subsidies. The community had a 2001 census population of 238 inhabitants. It includes the uninhabited island of Kardiotissa and other uninhabited islets. Its total land area is 42.507 km².ReferencesExternal linksOfficial website    Category:Islands of Greece Category:The Cycladesca:Síkinos de:Sikinos el:Σίκινος es:Síkinos fr:Sikinos it:Sikinos la:Sicinos nl:Sikinos nn:Síkinos pl:Sikinos sr:Сикинос sh:Sikinos
