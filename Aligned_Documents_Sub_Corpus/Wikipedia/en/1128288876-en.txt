He won a scholarship to the University of Leeds and gained his first degree in chemistry. He then served in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War.Porter then went on to do research at Cambridge under Norrish where he began the work that ultimately led to them becoming Nobel Laureates.His original research in developing the technique of flash photolysis to obtain information on short-lived molecular species provided the first evidence of free radicals. His later research utilised the technique to study the minutiae of the light reactions of photosynthesis, with particular regard to possible applications to a hydrogen economy, of which he was a strong advocate.Porter became a Fullerian Professor of Chemistry and director Royal Institution in 1966. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 along with Manfred Eigen and Ronald George Wreyford Norrish. Porter was president of the Royal Society 1985&ndash;1990, having been elected a Fellow in 1960 and also winning the Davy Medal in 1971, the Rumford Medal in 1978 and the Copley Medal in 1992. He was knighted in 1972 and was made a life peer as Baron Porter of Luddenham, of Luddenham in the County of Kent, in 1990.Porter was a major contributor to the public understanding of science. He became president of the British Association in 1985 and was the founding Chair of the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science (COPUS). He gave the Romanes Lecture, entitled "Science and the human purpose", at the University of Oxford in 1978; and in 1988 he gave the Dimbleby Lecture, "Knowledge itself is power". From 1990 to 1993 he gave the Gresham lectures in astronomy.Porter served as Chancellor of the University of Leicester between 1984 and 1995. In 2001, the University's chemistry building was named the George Porter Building in his honour.See alsoGresham Professor of AstronomyFullerian ProfessorshipsReferencesExternal linksProfile &ndash; Royal Institution of Great BritainThe Lord Porter of Luddenham (PDF) &ndash; Biographical memoirs, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 149, no. 1, March 2005The Life and Scientific Legacy of George Porter, World Scientific Publishing, 2006[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/09/02/db0201.xml His obituary notice in The Telegraph, 2 September 2002]Biographical Database of the British Chemical Community, 1880-1970     Category:1920 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:Academics of the University of Sheffield Category:Alumni of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:British humanists Category:English chemists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Kalinga Prize recipients Category:Davy Medal Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Life peers Category:Members of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:English Nobel laureates Category:People associated with the University of Leicester Category:People from Stainforth Category:Presidents of the Royal Society Category:Members of the Order of Meritar:جورج بورتر ca:George Porter de:George Porter es:George Porter fr:George Porter id:George Porter it:George Porter sw:George Porter hu:George Porter nl:George Porter ja:ジョージ・ポーター oc:George Porter pl:George Porter pt:George Porter ro:George Porter fi:George Porter sv:George Porter zh:乔治·波特
