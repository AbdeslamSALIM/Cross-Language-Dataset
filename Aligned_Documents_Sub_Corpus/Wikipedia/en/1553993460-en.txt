Film Reference.com At an early age, she became interested in music. She learned piano, flute and drums and played organ well enough as a teenager to serve as an organist at her church in Wareham. Enrolling at New England College, Davis eventually graduated with a bachelor's degree in drama from Boston University in 1979. While an exchange student in Sandviken, Sweden, Davis became bilingual; she is fluent in English and Swedish.CareerAfter graduating, Davis signed with New York's Zoli modelling agency and served as a window mannequin for Ann Taylor. With a height of six feet and a shoe size of 11 (US), Davis was a striking model cast from a different mold. She was working as a model when director Sydney Pollack spotted her and cast her in Tootsie (1982) as a soap opera actress. She followed this up with roles in the short-lived television series Buffalo Bill (1983–1984), for which she also wrote an episode, and Sara (1985). Davis made her film breakthrough with The Fly and Beetlejuice. She received an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Accidental Tourist (1988) and a Best Actress nomination for her role in Thelma and Louise (1991). Davis replaced Debra Winger for the lead in A League of Their Own and received a Best Actress Golden Globe Award nomination for her performance. She then co-starred in Hero alongside Dustin Hoffman and Andy Garcia. Following this, Davis teamed up with then husband Renny Harlin for the films Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight. She and Harlin produced the films. Davis starred in the short-lived sitcom The Geena Davis Show (2000–2001). In early 2004, she guest-starred as Grace Adler's sister Janet on the NBC sitcom Will &amp; Grace. She most recently starred in the ABC television series Commander in Chief as the first female President of the United States. This role garnered her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Drama Series in 2006, and she also was nominated for a SAG Award for Outstanding Female Actor in a Drama Series and an Emmy Award.  at Walt Disney World's Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park.]]Personal lifeOn September 1, 2001, Davis married Iranian-American Dr. Reza Jarrahy. They have three children: daughter Alizeh Keshvar (born April 10, 2002) and fraternal twin boys Kian William Jarrahy and Kaiis Steven Jarrahy on May 6, 2004. The marriage is Davis' fourth; she was previously married to Richard Emmolo (25 March 1982 - 26 February 1983); actor Jeff Goldblum, with whom she co-starred in three films, Transylvania 6-5000, The Fly and Earth Girls Are Easy (1987 to 1990); and Renny Harlin, who directed her in Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight (1993 to 1998).In 1999, Davis was a semi-finalist in trials for the United States' Olympic Archery team. She placed twenty-fourth out of twenty-eight.Davis is 6 feet tall (1.83 m) and is a member of American Mensa, the society of persons with IQs in the statistical top 2%, with an IQ of 140.ActivismDavis is fronting the Women's Sports Foundation campaign Geena Takes Aim in support of Title IX — an Act of Congress focusing on equality in sports opportunities, now expanded to prohibit gender discrimination in United States' educational institutions.In 2004, while watching children’s television programs and videos with her daughter, Davis noticed what she thought was an imbalance in the ratio of male to female characters. From that starting point, Davis went on to sponsor the largest research project ever undertaken on gender in children’s entertainment (resulting in 4 discrete studies, including one on children’s television) at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication. The study, directed by Dr. Stacy Smith, shows that there are nearly 3 males to every 1 female character in the nearly 400 G, PG, PG-13, and R-Rated movies the undergraduate team of Annenberg students coded. That research sparked Davis to launch The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media in 2007. The Institute’s first focus is an on-the ground program that works collaboratively with the entertainment industry to dramatically increase the presence of female characters in media aimed at children and to reduce stereotyping of both males and females.FilmographyYearFilmRoleOther notes1982TootsieApril Page1985Fletch]]''LarryTransylvania 6-5000]]''Odette1986The Fly]]''Veronica Quaife1988BeetlejuiceBarbara MaitlandEarth Girls Are EasyValerie GailThe Accidental Tourist]]''Muriel PritchettAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actress1990Quick ChangePhyllis Potter1991Thelma and LouiseThelma Yvonne DickinsonNominated - Academy Award for Best Actress;Nominated - BAFTA Award; Nominated - Golden Globe1992A League of Their OwnDottie HinsonNominated - Golden GlobeHero]]''Gale Gayley1993Princess Scargo and the Birthday PumpkinNarrator (voice)short subject1994Angie]]''Angie ScacciapensieriSpeechlessJulia Mannalso producer; Nominated - Golden Globe1995Cutthroat IslandMorgan Adams1996The Long Kiss GoodnightSamantha Caine / Charly Baltimorealso producer1999Stuart Little]]''Mrs. Eleanor Little2002Stuart Little 2Mrs. Eleanor Little2006Stuart Little 3: Call of the WildMrs. Eleanor Littlevoice2009Accidents HappenMrs. Conwaypre-productionTelevision workYearShowRoleOther notes1983-1984Buffalo Bill]]''Wendy Killian1983Knight RiderGrace Fallonguest star, "K.I.T.T.
