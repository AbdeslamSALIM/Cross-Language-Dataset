The Cypriot Championship First Division (Greek: Πρωτάθλημα Α' Κατηγορίας) is the top tier football league competition in Cyprus. As of 2007 it is sponsored by Marfin Popular Bank and is hence officially known as Marfin Laiki League (Greek: Πρωτάθλημα Marfin Laiki).FormatAt present, 14 clubs compete in the league. Each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, which makes a total of 26 games for each club. Since 2007-08 the league has a second round. In the second round the first 12 teams are separated into groups of 4 teams according to their position at the end of the first round. The last two teams are relegated to the second division. The points from the first round are carried to the second round and the teams play the other teams twice.Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. The rule for three points for a win has been applied since 1992, before then two points were awarded for a win. Teams are ranked by total points, the matches between the teams, then goal difference and then goals scored. If teams are still equal they are deemed to occupy the same position. If the champions, teams for relegation or qualification for other competitions thus cannot be decided, a series of play-off match(es) are played between the affected teams, although this has yet to occur. Since the establishment of the league and until 2005-06, goal difference had the biggest ranking after total points. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned as champions. The three lowest placed teams are relegated into the Cypriot Second Division and the top three teams from the 2nd Division promoted in their place.The league champions are entitled to entrance in the UEFA Champions League in the first qualifying round. The winner of the Cypriot Cup and runner-up in the league automatically enters the UEFA Cup second qualifying round. The third placed team enters the UEFA Cup on the first qualifying round. If the cup winners are also league champions, then the losing cup finalists are granted a UEFA Cup berth. If the cup winners qualify for Europe by their league position, then the fourth-placed team in the league qualifies for the UEFA Cup.The First Division has had 14 teams since the 1989-90 season, apart from the 1994-95 season when the league was reduced temporarily to 13 teams. For some years there has been discussion about reducing the number of teams in the first division This is partly driven by some of the mid-table clubs not being involved for much of the season in either the Championship or qualification for Europe, or relegation.HistoryFootball was introduced to Cyprus early in the 20th century by the founding fathers of the game, the British. Initially played in the island's schools, it proved hugely popular and a number of clubs were duly formed.Since 1911, when Anorthosis Famagusta FC was founded, many clubs were established and in 1932 the Cypriot Championship began annually at first unofficially. Every season, the championship was organized by a different football club which caused some conflicts between some of the teams.As football became more established, the clubs were united in agreeing that an official body was needed to regulate the sport. And in September 1934, the Cyprus Football Association (CFA) was formed and the Cypriot Championship and Cup began to take place annually. The first Champions of Cyprus were Trast AC in 1935 but the club folded three years later. The 1930s were dominated by , who won five championship in a row until 1940. Like other Championships in the World, the Cypriot Championship was interrupted, due to World War II from 1941 until 1945.World War II was followed by the Greek Civil War, which caused a lot of fanaticism between Greeks. Since the majority of the island are Greek Cypriots, it had a lot of influence in their society too, including sport. In 1948, some clubs were involved in politics and criticized the left-wing as responsible for the War. Several footballers from those clubs criticized their club but that followed the expulsion of those players from their teams. Those players then went on to help establish new clubs with their own Association and their own football competitions. Until 1953 there were two separate football Championships in Cyprus and two different Associations. However, in 1953, the two Associations unified Cypriot football, and the teams which were established in 1948 under the separate association, were allowed to become members of the CFA. Only AC Omonia were accepted into the First Division. And due to the addition of more clubs that season, relegation and promotion begun in Cypriot football.The Cypriot Championship unification, lasted for only two seasons. In 1955, Çetinkaya Türk S.K., who had been the only Turkish Cypriot team playing in the Cypriot First Division since 1934-35, withdrew from the Championship and with other Turkish Cypriot teams, established the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation, with its own competitions. The reason behind this was political, as the Turkish Cypriot leadership were supporting the partition of the island. However, this Federation was never recognized and no team of that federation could play in international competitions.The independence of Cyprus in 1960, was followed by full membership for the Cyprus Football Association to UEFA in 1962. From 1963, the champions of the Cyprus, could compete in the European Champions Cup and the Cup winners in the European Cup Winners Cup. Since 1971, the runners up in the Cypriot First Division can compete in the UEFA Cup. From 1967 until 1974, the Cypriot Champions were promoted to the Greek First National Division and in case of relegation, they were replaced by the Cypriot Champions of the next season. Cypriot teams were though relegated every season from the Alpha Ethniki, apart from 1974, when APOEL managed to remain in the Greek Championship. However, due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus that year, APOEL withdrew from the League.The Cypriot championship was abandoned in the 1963-64 season due to the bicommunal conflicts between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.AC Omonia dominated the Cypriot Championship in the 1970s and 1980s, winning 12 championship in 13 seasons. In 1976, Omonia player Sotiris Kaiafas was the top scorer not only in Cyprus but also in Europe with 39 goals winning the European Golden Boot. Anorthosis Famagusta dominated Cyprus football between 1995 and 2000, losing the championship during those years only once in 1996.2008-09ClubsThe fourteen clubs that participate in the Cypriot First Division 2008-09 season (in alphabetical order) are:AEK Larnaca - LarnacaAEL - LimassolAE Paphos - PaphosAlki - LarnacaAnorthosis - FamagustaAPEP Pitsilia - KyperoundaAPOEL - NicosiaApollon Limassol - LimassolAPOP Kinyras Peyias - Peyia, PaphosAtromitos Yeroskipou - YeroskipouDoxa Katokopias - Katokopia, NicosiaEnosis Neon Paralimni - ParalimniEthnikos Achnas - Achna, FamagustaOmonia - NicosiaChampions1934/35-2006/07 Pancypriot Championship2007/08-present Marfin Laiki LeagueSeasonWinner1934-35Trast AC1935-36APOEL]]1936-37APOEL]]1937-38APOEL]]1938-39APOEL]]1939-40APOEL]]1940-41AEL Limassol1941-44League suspended due to World War II1944-45EPA Larnaca1945-46EPA Larnaca1946-47APOEL]]1947-48APOEL]]1948-49APOEL]]1949-50Anorthosis Famagusta1950-51Çetinkaya1951-52APOEL]]1952-53AEL Limassol1953-54Pezoporikos Larnaca1954-55AEL Limassol1955-56AEL Limassol1956-57Anorthosis Famagusta1957-58Anorthosis Famagusta1958-59not held1959-60Anorthosis Famagusta1960-61AC Omonoia1961-62Anorthosis Famagusta1962-63Anorthosis Famagusta1963-64championship abandoned1964-65APOEL]]1965-66AC Omonoia1966-67Olympiakos Nicosia1967-68AEL Limassol1968-69Olympiakos Nicosia1969-70EPA Larnaca1970-71Olympiakos Nicosia1971-72AC Omonoia1972-73APOEL]]1973-74AC Omonoia1974-75AC Omonoia1975-76AC Omonoia1976-77AC Omonoia1977-78AC Omonoia1978-79AC Omonoia1979-80APOEL]]1980-81AC Omonoia1981-82AC Omonoia1982-83AC Omonoia1983-84AC Omonoia1984-85AC Omonoia1985-86APOEL]]1986-87AC Omonoia1987-88Pezoporikos Larnaca1988-89AC Omonoia1989-90APOEL]]1990-91Apollon Limassol1991-92APOEL]]1992-93AC Omonoia1993-94Apollon Limassol1994-95Anorthosis Famagusta1995-96APOEL]]1996-97Anorthosis Famagusta1997-98Anorthosis Famagusta1998-99Anorthosis Famagusta1999-00Anorthosis Famagusta2000-01AC Omonoia2001-02APOEL]]2002-03AC Omonoia2003-04APOEL]]2004-05Anorthosis Famagusta2005-06Apollon Limassol2006-07APOEL]]2007-08Anorthosis FamagustaPerformance By ClubClubWinnersWinning seasonsAPOEL]]191936]], 1937, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1965, 1973, 1980, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1996, 2002, 2004, 2007Omonia]]192001]], 2003Anorthosis]]132000]], 2005, 2008AEL Limassol]]51941, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1968Olympiakos]]31967, 1969, 1971Apollon Limassol32006]]EPA Larnaca31945, 1946, 1970Pezoporikos Larnaca21954, 1988Trast AC11935]]Çetinkaya Türk S.K.11951Top GoalscorersThis is a list of the top goalscorers of Cyprus by season since 1960.
