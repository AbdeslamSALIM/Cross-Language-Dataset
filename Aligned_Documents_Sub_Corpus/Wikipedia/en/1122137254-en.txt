               Francis Obiorah Obikwelu, born 22 November, 1978 in Nigeria and a Portuguese citizen since 2001, is a former sprint athlete specializing in 100&amp;nbsp;metres and 200&amp;nbsp;metres. He holds the record for the fastest time in the 100&nbsp;m set by a European competitor with a time of 9.86&nbsp;seconds.  He finished second in the 100&nbsp;m at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, the first medal ever in athletics sprinting events for Portugal. He won 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m in 2006 at the European Championships in Athletics and became the first athlete to win both 100&nbsp;m and 200&nbsp;m in the same European Championship since 1978. Kim Gevaert also succeeded in this double victory at the same Championship.He was voted Waterford Crystal European Male Athlete of the Year for 2006 by the European Athletic Association, in an internet poll open to member federations, media and the general public.Obikwelu announced his retirement from competitive athletics after failing to qualify for the 100&nbsp;m finals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.From Football to AthleticsAt the age of 14, one of Obikwelu's football coaches in Nigeria noticed him and suggested he try out athletics. After two years he was representing Nigeria in the 1994 African Junior Championships and won the silver medal in the 400&amp;nbsp;metres.The StarFrom Nigeria to PortugalHe based himself in Lisbon, Portugal, as a 16-year-old, after competing at the 994 World Junior Championships. After being rejected by both Sport Lisboa e Benfica and Sporting Clube de Portugal, he worked for a while as a construction worker in Algarve. He decided to learn Portuguese, and his teacher put him in contact with Belenenses, where he restarted practising. While living in Portugal, Francis was adopted by a lady who he now proudly refers to as his "mother".He then made a decision to run for Portugal. The news was broken in July 2000 by Nigerian sprinter Mercy Nku, who like Obikwelu is based in Lisbon. She said Obikwelu took the decision because of neglect by Nigerian sports officials when he was injured while representing Nigeria in Sydney, Australia. "He had to go to Canada to undergo an operation on his knee spending his own money." He became a Portuguese citizen in October 2001.Both his athletics achievements, his life story and his personality made him a popular figure in his adoptive country, where he is nicknamed Chico, the short form of the Portuguese version of his first name.He currently competes for Sporting Clube de Portugal.Athens 2004In the qualifiers he was one of the most impressive runners, managing two times under ten seconds (beating the Portuguese record). In the final he recovered from a non-medal position in the second half of the race to reach Silver, just one hundredth of a second behind Justin Gatlin and one hundredth ahead of Maurice Greene, managing to beat the European record set by Linford Christie in 1993. In 2006, Justin Gatlin failed a doping test and it is now suspected that he may have been using doping during the Athens Olympics. However, the probability of the medal passing on to Francis is remote, as it would require a confession from Gatlin. Even so, Francis has already stated that he does not want a medal won in the office.Francis Obikwelu ended fifth in the 200&nbsp;m final.StatisticsAs of September 9, 2008Personal bestsDateEventVenueTime (seconds)28 February 200450&nbsp;metres]]Liévin, France5.7924 February 199960&nbsp;metres]]Madrid, Spain6.5422 August 2004100&nbsp;metres]]Athens, Greece9.8625 August 1999200&nbsp;metres]]Seville, Spain19.843 June 1998400&nbsp;metres]]Unknown46.29All information from IAAF Profile  Awards and honoursOlympic Games2nd 100 m, 2004 Athens, GRE 9.865th 200 m, 2004 Athens, GRE 20.14World Championships2nd 4 x 100 m Relay 1997 Athens, GRE 38.073rd 200 m 1999 Seville, ESP 20.11===World Indoor Championships===3rd 200 m 1997 Paris, FRA 21.106th 60 m 2004 Budapest, HUN 6.60====European Championships====1st 100 m 2002 Munich, GER2nd 200 m 2002 Munich, GER1st 100 m 2006 Goteborg, SWE 9.991st 200 m 2006 Goteborg, SWE 20.01====Golden League====1st 100 m 2004 Saint-Denis, FRA 10.061st 200 m 2004 Saint-Denis, FRA 20.121st 100 m 2001 Berlin, GER 9.982nd 100 m 2002 Brussels, BEL 10.013rd 200 m 2004 Zurich, SUI 20.363rd 200 m 2004 Bergen, NOR 20.461st 100 m 2008 Madrid.
