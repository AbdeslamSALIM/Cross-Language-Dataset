The main town on the island is known as Apollonia (pop. 942) located near the center of the island. The second-largest town is Artemon (744). Another major population center is the hilltop village named Kastro (101), built on top of a high cliff on its northwestern shore. The port settlement, on the west cost of the island is known as Kamares (188).GeographySifnos lies in the less touristed western half of the Cyclades between Serifos and Milos and is also located west of Delos and Paros and is about 130 km (80 nautical miles) from Piraeus (Athens' port). It has an area of 74 km² and is 15 km long and 7.5 km wide. and a shoreline of 70 km, with a permanent population of 2442. The island is reached on the ferries which run on the Piraeus- Kythnos- Serifos- Sifnos- Milos- Kimolos line. There are also infrequent sailings to other islands in the Cyclades.HistorySifnos was very wealthy in ancient times, thanks to its gold and silver mines. Proof of this, is the treasury which the Siphnians built at Delphi in the 6th century BC to house their offerings. However, it appears that something went wrong with the mines; either they were worked out or flooded by the sea -we do not know which- and their production ceased.Due to the physiology of the island (rich clay veins, sunny weather and temperature) Sifnos has been traditionally the capital of pottery in the Aegean, with unique jars and pots that are a kind of "trademark" of the island. They are frequent the Sifnian everyday life, such as ashtrays, cooking and food vessels, "masteles", "foufoudes" (kind of chimneys) etc. Locally, 'Sifnios' was a variant word for potter. Initially the oldest potteries were found in central regions such as Artemon and Ano Petali to avoid pirate attacks.Historical populationYearCommunal populationChangeIsland populationChange1981----1991-1031,960-2001--2,442+482/+24.59%CommunitiesApolloniaArtemonasFarosKastroPlatys GialosSifnos, also Kamares SifnouVathyHerronisosGallery Image:Apollonia on Sifnos.jpg|Apollonia Image:Vathy_harbour_Greek_island_of_Sifnos.jpg| The church at Vathy See alsoCommunities of the CycladesReferencesExternal linksOfficial website  Map and aerial photos:Street map: Street map from Mapquest, MapPoint or |=36.9845,24.667 GoogleSatellite images: Google - image not yet availableCoordinates:   Category:Cities and towns in Greece Category:The Cyclades Category:Islands of Greece Category:Tourism in Greececa:Sifnos cy:Sifnos de:Sifnos et:Sífnos el:Σίφνος es:Sifnos fr:Sifnos gl:Sifnos - Σίφνος it:Sifnos he:סיפנוס la:Siphnos nl:Sifnos ja:シフノス島 nn:Sífnos pl:Sifnos sr:Сифнос sh:Sifnos sv:Sifnos zh:锡弗诺斯岛
