of Zürich.]] The Limmat is a river in Switzerland. It is the continuation of the Linth river, known as Limmat from the point of effluence from Lake Zürich, in the city of Zürich. From Zürich it flows in a northwesterly direction, after 35 km reaching the river Aare. The confluence is located north of the small town of Brügg and shortly after the mouth of the Reuss. The main towns along the Limmat downstream of Zürich are Dietikon, Wettingen, and Baden. Its main tributaries are the Sihl (in Zürich) and the Reppisch (in Dietikon). Like many Swiss rivers, it is intensively used for production of hydroelectric power: along its course of 35 km, its fall is used by no less than ten hydroelectric power stations.The name Limmat originates as a combination of the names of the [[Linth|''Linth'' and Maag rivers]], the main tributaries of the lake of Zürich before the construction of the Linth canal.Towns near the riverIn the canton of Zurich:ZurichOberengstringenUnterengstringenSchlierenDietikonGeroldswilOetwil an der LimmatIn the canton of AargauSpreitenbachWürenlosNeuenhofWettingenBadenEnnetbadenNussbaumenUntersiggenthalTurgiCategory:Rivers of Switzerland Category:Zürich Category:Canton of Zürich Category:Aar basinals:Limmat de:Limmat et:Limmat es:Limmat eo:Limato eu:Limmat fr:Limmat it:Limmat he:לימאט lb:Limmat hu:Limmat nl:Limmat ja:リマト川 pl:Limmat rm:Limmat ru:Лиммат sq:Limmat simple:Limmat sr:Лимат fi:Limmat sv:Limmat zh:利馬特河
