On June 28, 2007, Noah was taken 9th overall in the 2007 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls.BackgroundNoah is of Swedish, French, and Cameroonian descent. He was born February 25, 1985 to Yannick Noah, a former French professional tennis player and 1983 French Open Champion, and Cécilia Rhode, Miss Sweden 1978. In addition, his paternal grandfather Zacharie Noah was a Cameroonian professional football (soccer) player, winner of the Coupe de France in 1961. Noah calls himself "the African Viking"CAMLIONS: Lions indomptables du cameroun : Football, Volleyball, Handball, Athletisme,Basketball, etc...&lt;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;.He competed on basketball teams for several high schools, first at the United Nations International School (UNIS) in New York City. He played streetball tournaments and his nickname was "The Noble One" because someone heard that his dad was a pro tennis player. He later transferred to Poly Prep in Brooklyn, New York, where he was coached by Bill McNally, and then to The Lawrenceville School, outside of Princeton, New Jersey. At UNIS he was coached by Alsonso Shockley, Harry Muniz and David Gartrelle. He reached the championships as the only sophomore on the team. After that he left to Lawrenceville to further his basketball career.College careerDuring his freshman year at Florida (2004-2005), he played sparingly, clocking in just 10.3 minutes per game, and averaged only 3.9 points and 2.7 rebounds per contest.Noah made significant improvement in his sophomore year (2005-2006), leading his team in points (14.2 ppg) and blocks (2.4 bpg), while ranking second in rebounds (7.1 rpg) behind teammate Al Horford (7.6 rpg). Almost unknown at the beginning of the season, Noah's draft stock improved continually. By the end of the NCAA tournament he was considered by many to be the top college prospect in the country, and had he declared for the 2006 NBA Draft he very likely would have been taken first or second. However, Noah, along with teammates Al Horford and Corey Brewer announced at their national championship celebration that they would return for their junior seasons. Noah and the Gators would go on to repeat as champions.2006 NCAA TournamentNoah was named the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the NCAA Tournament's Minneapolis Regional after leading the Gators over top-seeded Villanova in the final game with 21 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 blocks. On April 3, 2006, Noah led the Gators to a 73-57 win over UCLA for the school's first NCAA Basketball Championship, and was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four. In the finale, he posted 16 points, 9 rebounds, and a championship game record 6 blocks.Professional careerThe Chicago Bulls selected Noah as the ninth overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft. Noah and his teammates at Florida, Corey Brewer and Al Horford, became the highest picked trio from the same college in the history of the NBA. Horford was chosen third overall by the Atlanta Hawks, and Brewer was chosen seventh overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves. On November 6, 2007, he made his regular season debut off the bench after missing the first three games with a sprained ankle. He posted 2 points and 4 rebounds. On January 13, 2008 Noah was benched for the team's upcoming game at Atlanta following a confrontation with assistant coach Ron Adams. Noah's teammates delivered a unanimous vote to bench him for an additional game since they felt the one game suspension did not suffice. According to interim coach Jim Boylan, Noah has been involved in several incidents, including being late for practices and team meetings. "This is not college anymore. This is professional sports," Boylan remarked.http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/basketball/nba/01/13/noah.benched.ap/index.html?eref=si_topstories&lt;/ref&gt;Personal lifeThough Noah could be eligible for international competitions such as the Olympics or World Basketball Championships by playing with the American, Cameroonian, French or Swedish team, he seems to be leaning towards playing for France. "The French National team is definitely something that has been in my dreams for a while." Noah also said his decision to be in the competition was mainly because of his good friend Dwayne Sherman, whom he grew up with. He was officially made a French citizen on April 11, 2007.FIBA: Noah cleared to play for France Noah is fluent in French.ArrestAt 1:56 a.m. on May 25, 2008 in Gainesville, Florida, Noah was arrested for having an open container of alcohol and misdemeanor possession of marijuana.
