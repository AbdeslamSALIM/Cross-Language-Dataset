At 202 cm (6ft 7 1/2in) tall, Žigić is one of the tallest footballers in the world playing for a top flight football club.Club career=== Red Star Belgrade === After having played with modest teams in native country with impressive scoring rates, Žigić joined Red Star Belgrade in 2003. His world-class goal from 30 meters against A.S. Roma in the UEFA Cup 2005-06 showed a glimpse of a developping talent, and further raised his asking price on the transfer market. During his years at Red Star, he played 110 matches and scored 71 goals in all competitions (cup, league and European competitions).=== Racing Santander === On 29 August 2006, Žigić signed a four-year contract with Spanish side Racing de Santander.On 1 April 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in La Liga in a 5-4 win over Athletic Bilbao.Žigić hat-trick earns Racing 5-4 win over Bilbao While at Racing, he formed a formidable duo with diminutive veteran striker Pedro Munitis, and netted 11 league goals during the season.=== Valencia === On 8 August 2007, Sky Sports understood that Valencia CF had offered Racing €15 million for Žigić, handing the player a lucrative five-year contract. Numerous other clubs, such as Werder Bremen and Manchester City attempted to sign the tall striker, but the Che side eventually signed the player, announcing the €20 million deal on their official website on the following day. After passing a physical the next day, Žigić was introduced at Estadio Mestalla.Career moves, at Transfermarkt Žigić's first goal for Valencia came in a Spanish Cup match against Real Unión, adding another to turn the match around, as Valencia won 2-1. His first and only league goal came on December 22, 2007 at Real Zaragoza. Valencia again came from behind and earned a 2-2 draw. It was made clear in January that he turned down the opportunity to join English side Portsmouth on loan for the remainder of the season.Pompey set to miss out on loan dealIn the summer of 2008, Stoke City made an offer for Žigić, which was accepted by Valencia. The player then held talks with Stoke, but they broke down and the deal was called off. On 25 August 2008, Turkish club Galatasaray S.K. reportedly opened talks with Valencia, with a view to a one-year loan deal and an option to buy afterwards. On the same day, Valencia said that Žigić's future was in his own hands.It was announced on 28 August 2008, via Sky Sports News and other numerous newspapers, that Žigić wanted a move to the English Premier League, but the player, after having also snubbed a deadline transfer day loan deal to former club Racing Santander, finally agreed to stay and fight for a place in 2008-09's Valencia.== International career == Although he attracted much attention for his fine performances with Red Star in the Serbo-Montenegrin league, Žigić only nailed down a regular place in the Serbia and Montenegro national team in mid-2005, after having made his debut the previous year. He scored a couple of goals in some friendlies, but it was his appearance in a crucial 2006 World Cup qualifier against Spain in Madrid that brought him to international recognition.After an atrocious first-half at the Vicente Calderón stadium, during which Serbia-Montenegro rarely crossed the centre line, only being 1&ndash;0 down, coach Ilija Petković threw Žigić into the mix, and his towering presence up front changed the flow of the match instantly. He would later set up the equalizer, also providing Mateja Kežman with a 2-1 chance, but the ball was clipped wide of Iker Casillas' gaping half-empty net. However, Serbia got the key away point and confirmed their World Cup qualification at home in Belgrade versus Bosnia-Herzegovina, with Žigić again nicely setting up Kežman for the game's only goal.Žigić's only start of the 2006 FIFA World Cup came in the nation's final Group C match, when the team was already eliminated. He scored an early goal in the 10th minute of the first half off a long ball from Dejan Stankovic against Ivory Coast, in a 3-2 loss.On 24 March 2007, Žigić received a red card during the Euro 2008 qualifications against Kazakhstan, seconds before the end of the game. This caused him to miss the home game against Portugal (against Finland, on June 2, 2007, he was also not available due to surgery on a facial injury he received on May 27).Serbia's Žigić to miss Euro 2008 qualifier in FinlandHonoursRed Star BelgradeSerbia and Montenegro League: 2003-04, 2005-06Serbia and Montenegro Cup: 2004, 2006ValenciaSpanish Cup: 2007-08References and notesExternal linksSerbian national football team profile Valencia profile Stats at Liga de Fútbol Profesional   Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vojvodina Category:Serbian footballers Category:Football (soccer) strikers Category:Red Star Belgrade footballers Category:La Liga footballers Category:Racing de Santander footballers Category:Valencia CF footballersCategory:Serbia and Montenegro international footballers Category:Serbia international footballers Category:2006 FIFA World Cup playersar:نيكولا زيغيتش bg:Никола Жигич ca:Nikola Žigić de:Nikola Žigić et:Nikola Žigić es:Nikola Žigić fr:Nikola Žigić hr:Nikola Žigić id:Nikola Žigić it:Nikola Žigić lt:Nikola Žigić nl:Nikola Žigić ja:ニコラ・ジギッチ ko:니콜라 지기치 no:Nikola Žigić pl:Nikola Žigić pt:Nikola Žigić ru:Жигич, Никола sr:Никола Жигић fi:Nikola Žigić sv:Nikola Žigić tr:Nikola Žigić zh:尼古拉·日吉奇
