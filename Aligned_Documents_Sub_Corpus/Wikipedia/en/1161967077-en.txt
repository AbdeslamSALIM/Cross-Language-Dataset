See Aegukka.Aegukga is the national anthem of South Korea, though it is not legally recognized as such. The title literally means "The Song of Love for the Country," or "The Patriotic Song."It is believed that the lyrics were written at the time of the corner stone ceremony of the Independence Gate in Seoul in 1896 by Yun Chiho, a politician, or by An Chang-ho, a pro-independence leader and educator. Initially, Aegukga was sung to the Scottish folk tune "Auld Lang Syne" that American missionaries had taught. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (1919-1945) in Shanghai, China adopted it as their national anthem. At a ceremony celebrating the founding of South Korea on 15 August 1948, exactly three years after liberation from Japanese rule, the Scottish tune was finally replaced by the Finale of Korea Fantasia that Ahn Eak-tae had composed in 1935. The new "Aegukga" was later adopted under the Presidential Decree of 1948 by the then President Syngman Rhee (or Lee Seungman).Lyrics&nbsp;HangulHangul and hanjaRevised Romanization]]English translation1동해 물과 백두산이 마르고 닳도록하느님이 보우하사 우리나라 만세東海 물과 白頭山이 마르고 닳도록하느님이 保佑하사 우리나라 萬歲Donghae mulgwa Baekdusani mareugo daltorokHaneunimi bouhasa urinara manseUntil the day when the East Sea's waters and Mt.
