Dutch native Jonathan Berhane spotted her talent early on and introduced Denters to Grammy nominated songwriter and manager Billy Mann.

At the same time, Tennman Records announced that she would be opening for Timberlake at six venues during his 2007 European tour, making Denters the first amateur singer in history to go directly from a personal YouTube posting to commercially performing on a major stage.She has appeared on the The Oprah Winfrey Show, on an episode that was dedicated to YouTube, where her singing talent was discovered.Denters has been working with Justin Timberlake on her first ever album, which will be released either at the end of 2008 or at the beginning of 2009.Discography"Crazy Place" (2007), http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=-htJ4dGmA7A&amp;feature=user Tennman/Interscope – Charity songReferencesExternal linksEsmée Denters, official siteInterscope Records Official SiteEsmée Denters at YouTube  Category:1988 births Category:Dutch singer-songwriters Category:YouTube video producers  Category:English-language singers Category:Living people Category:Dutch female singers Category:People from Gelderlandda:Esmée Denters de:Esmée Denters es:Esmée Denters fr:Esmée Denters it:Esmée Denters nl:Esmée Denters ja:エスミー・デンターズ no:Esmée Denters pl:Esmée Denters pt:Esmée Denters fi:Esmée Denters sv:Esmée Denters
