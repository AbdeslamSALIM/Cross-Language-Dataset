He began his career at Uruguayan club Danubio, moving to Greece at the age of 16 to play for Olympiacos.Castillo spent seven years at Olympiacos, gradually developing into a regular starter over a three year period. Once established in the team Castillo helped Olympiacos to three consecutive league titles, prompting Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk to spend €20 million to secure his services in 2007. After only a handful of starts for Shakhtar Castillo was dropped for refusing to allow team-mate Cristiano Lucarelli to take a penalty. In December 2007 he moved on a year's loan to Manchester City of the English Premier League, paying a substantial amount of the loan fee himself.He made his international debut for Mexico in June 2007, and represented his country in the 2007 Copa America.Playing StyleNery Castillo Can play multiple positions very well. He can play up top as a lone striker as he did various times in the Copa america 2007 and terrorize defenses with his phenomenal dribbling skills and clinical finishing ability's. He can also play out on the left wing and expand the field with his Speed and passing abilitys. He is a very different type of mexican talent, than what mexico is used to having. He can run at defenders with ease and and break down defenses on his own with his speed and dribbling skills, Which also leeds to some critisizm of him for not letting the ball go in time, and making unneccesary dribbles.He has been called a selfish and immature player at times and Chivas del Guadalajara President Jorge Vergara who once had the desire to bring nery's skills to the mexican league has said he is a player who is only interested in himself and not the teamhttp://futblogmexicano.com/?p=1621&lt;/ref&gt;.Club careerEarly careerCastillo was born in the Mexican city San Luis Potosí, where his father, a Uruguayan professional footballer, played for San Luis. The family moved to South America while Castillo was still a small child. He started playing for club Danubio in the youth team. While participating with Danubio's youth team in a Brazilian tournament, Castillo was spotted by scouts from European clubs. He went on trial with Manchester United of England's Premier League, but Castillo failed to obtain a work permit and the door to join the club was closed.OlympiacosAt the age of 16 Castillo's father accepted an offer of the Greek club Olympiacos. Three years after he joined Olympiacos, Castillo became a regular starter in both the domestic and European competitions. He became a fan favourite with the Gate 7 Ultras(Greek)  and was even given the number seven shirt in deference to themAfter that point his career took a down slide. A rumoured transaction to the Italian side Inter Milan never happened, and changes in the management of his club combined with the arrival of former Brazil international Rivaldo relegated him from his starting role to the bench. Other off the field issues with the coach and teammates have contributed to increase the perception that Castillo is a problematic player.In early 2006 his father and agent began negotiations with the Mexican club Chivas de Guadalajara, but talks were interrupted because Olympiacos weren't interested in negotiating for the player at the time.Before this, in what Castillo thought was his last game for Olympiacos, he scored a free kick after "stealing" it from a team mate who was preparing to take it. He celebrated by running the length of the field and throwing his shirt to his fans at Gate 7. He was left looking somewhat sheepish without a shirt for the restart.During the 2006-2007 campaign Castillo was a solid starter. Many reports considered that the player had changed his attitude and solved off the field issues. The prospect of a more mature Castillo encouraged the officers of Olympiacos to renew his contract, extending its length four more years, and improving its economic conditions.Castillo was the leading scorer for Olympiacos during the preparatory phase for the 2006-2007 season, accumulating seven goals in friendly games. From then on his form only improved, scoring several goals in the UEFA Champions League and the domestic tournament, including a hat-trick against Panionios FC. Castillo ended the season second to Rivaldo in goals and assists for the club, which included three goals in five Champions League matches.Shakhtar DonetskOn 31 July 2007, Castillo joined Ukrainian side FC Shakhtar Donetsk on a five year contract for a fee of €20 million. This became the most expensive transfer for a Ukrainian club to date.Castillo scored his first goal for Shakhtar while playing against SV Salzburg in the Champions League. His stint was to be brief, though. Castillo had only played in a few games for Shakhtar when in a league match versus FC Naftovyk-Ukrnafta Okhtyrka, Shakhtar won a penalty kick. Castillo refused to give the ball to official penalty kick-taker Cristiano Lucarelli and took the penalty himself, which was saved. Castillo was immediately substituted from the game. Coach Mircea Lucescu commented "What Castillo did, from a professional point of view, I've never seen anything like it before in my whole life. There will be some measures taken against Castillo".. He has not played a game for Shakhtar since.On 15 December 2007 Castillo's agent told the Daily Mail: "There has been an agreement with Manchester City so that Nery can be with the club for one year on loan so he can prove himself and play active football." adding that City would have an option to buy Castillo once his loan period expires. Shaktar president and Ukraine's richest man Rinat Akhmetov then said that City's offer of £1 million was too low, instead offering "a one-year loan - five million euros and there will be no options, meaning a right to buy (Castillo)... If Castillo finds his game ... then in a year we'll decide whether to take him back to Shakhtar or sell. And the price could be 20, or 30, or 40, or 50 million euros."Manchester CityIt was announced on 18 December 2007 that Castillo had signed a one-year loan agreement with Manchester City, commencing on 1 January 2008. Reportedly Castillo was keen to make the move happen and in a highly unusual move paid half of the loan fee himself. Sven-Göran Eriksson commented "He was desperate to come to us, desperate to come to England, desperate to come to the Premier League" and said he had never seen a player pay for half of a deal before.He played his first match for Manchester City on 5 January 2008 in the third round of the FA Cup, away to West Ham United. However, in the replay on 16 January 2008, his first home appearance for the club, he was stretchered off after 32 minutes with a broken shoulder. &amp;newsid=524804 |title=Eriksson feels for unlucky Castillo |date=2008-01-19 |accessdate=2008-01-20 |publisher=Manchester City official web siteHe ended the season with 9 appearances, 7 of them coming in the Premier League. He did not manage any goals during these 9 appearances. Castillo found it difficult to stake his claim in the side with the arrival from CSKA Moscow of Jô, the return to fitness of Valeri Bojinov and the abundance of other strikers available, namely Benjani Mwaruwari, Felipe Caicedo and Daniel Sturridge.In August 2008 it became increasingly likely that Castillo would leave Manchester City with a new club taking up his loan from Shakhtar Donetsk. On 12 August, his agent Juan Carlos Padilla announced that there had been inquires from Spanish La Liga side Real Betis.Man City's Castillo wants Real Betis move On 14 August, Sven-Goran Eriksson, now in charge of the Mexican national side, left Castillo out of the Mexican national team's World Cup qualifier, citing that Castillo was in talks and should be given the chance to sort out his future. On 17 August, it had been revealed that Italian Serie A side A.S. Roma had joined the hunt to sign Castillo, though Padilla added that Betis had priority in the negotiations, as they were the first side to have expressed an interest.Roma linked with move for City loanee CastilloOn 25 August 2008 it was announced that Castillo was to be signed by Real Betis, subject to a deal being reached with Shakhtar Donetsk.  Castillo set to depart Man City In the end, however, no such deal could be reached, and Castillo remained at Manchester City for the beginning of the 2008-09 season. Castillo must fight for place - Agent  As of october 7 2008 Castillo has yet to see any action for manchester city and has been repeatedly been left of the squad of active players. Which leads to more problems on the international front. Sven Goran Erickson has said that he would not call him up to the national squad until he settles down with a club and is playing top flight footballStatisticsas of 26 May 2008SeasonClubLeagueAppsGoalsCupAppsGoalsContinentalAppsGoals2000-01GRE Olympiacos10????002001-02GRE Olympiacos10????002002-03GRE Olympiacos93????002003-04GRE Olympiacos267??2522004-05GRE Olympiacos266??4502005-06GRE Olympiacos172????002006-07GRE Olympiacos2512????532007-08UKR Shakhtar Donetsk6000412007-08ENG Manchester City |title=Manchester City player stats | accessdate=2008-01-12 |work=Manchester City official web site7020002008-09ENG Manchester City |title=Manchester City player stats | accessdate=2008-01-12 |work=Manchester City official web site000000International careerChoosing nationalityCastillo is eligible for citizenship in four countries; Uruguay because his father is from there; Italy due to his maternal grandparents; Greece because he resided there for more than six years and Mexico where he was born.His first experience of international football came when he was called up to a Uruguay U-17 training camp. However he was released before playing a game. Next the Greek coach Otto Rehhagel tried to secure his services for the Greece national football team. Greece were reportedly willing to pay Castillo $800,000, including fast-tracked citizenship as part of the offer.Ultimately Castillo decided to play for the country of his birth and joined the Mexico national football team.Mexico national teamCastillo made his debut for Mexico on 2 June 2007 against Iran. The game was held in his hometown San Luis Potosí and Mexico won the game 4-0.He went on to play in the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup where he scored his first international goal against Cuba.He was then included in the squad for the 2007 Copa America. A pre-tournament injury to Jared Borgetti gave Castillo a starting berth, and he proved influential in Mexico's first match of the tournament, scoring in a 2–0 win against Brazil. He scored again against Ecuador as Mexico secured a place in the knockout stages, and scored a brace in the quarter-final against Paraguay, the first goal a penalty. Overall he was the third highest goal scorer of the tournament with four goals, behind Juan Román Riquelme and Robinho.Goals#DateVenueOpponentScoreResultCompetition1.8 June 2007Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, United StatesCUB2 &ndash; 12 &ndash; 12007 CONCACAF Gold Cup2.27 June 2007Polideportivo Cachamay, Puerto Ordaz, VenezuelaBRA1 &ndash; 02 &ndash; 02007 CONMEBOL Copa America]]3.1 July 2007Estadio Monumental de Maturín, Maturin, VenezuelaECU1 &ndash; 02 &ndash; 12007 CONMEBOL Copa America]]4.8 July 2007Estadio Monumental de Maturín, Maturin, VenezuelaPAR1 &ndash; 06 &ndash; 02007 CONMEBOL Copa America]]5.8 July 2007Estadio Monumental de Maturín, Maturin, VenezuelaPAR3 &ndash; 06 &ndash; 02007 CONMEBOL Copa America]]HonoursClub honoursTeamAwardYear(s)GRE OlympiacosGreek Cup]]2005, 2006GRE OlympiacosGreek Super League]]2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07References   Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Danubio F.C. players Category:FC Shakhtar Donetsk players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Mexican footballers Category:Mexicans of Uruguayan descent Category:Mexico international footballers Category:Mexican expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:2007 Copa América players Category:Olympiacos footballers Category:People from San Luis Potosí Category:Premier League players Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Ukraine Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Mexican expatriate footballersar:نيري كاستيلو ca:Nery Alberto Castillo Confalonieri de:Nery Castillo el:Νέρι Αλμπέρτο Καστίγιο es:Nery Castillo fr:Nery Castillo it:Nery Castillo lt:Nery Castillo nl:Nery Castillo pl:Nery Castillo pt:Nery Castillo fi:Nery Castillo sv:Nery Castillo
