Driven from Naples in 1798, the Neapolitan royal family fled to Palermo, and the years from 1800 to 1802 were spent by Marie Amélie with her mother at the Austrian court. In 1806 they were again in flight before the armies of general Masséna, and it was during the second residence of her father's court at Palermo that she met the exiled Louis-Philippe, then duc d'Orléans, eldest son of the previous duke, also named Louis-Philippe (also known as Philippe Égalité).MarriageOn 25 November 1809 she married Louis-Philippe, at Palermo in Sicily. Like her mother, Maria had a very large family. Overall she and her husband had 10 children. They were:Prince Ferdinand Philippe d'Orléans, duc d'Orléans (3 September 1810-1842) married Duchess Helene Louise Elizabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (b.1814-d.1858)Princesse Louise Marie d'Orléans (3 April 1812-1850) later Queen consort of Léopold I of Belgium. Children included Leopold II and Carlota of Mexico.Princess Marie (12 April 1813-1839) married Duke Alexander of Württemberg (b.1804-d.1881).Prince Louis d'Orléans, duc de Nemours (25 October 1814-1896) married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Kohary.Princess Françoise d'Orléans (28 March 1816-1818)Princesse Clémentine d'Orléans (3 June 1817-1907) married August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, 5th Prince of Kohary.Prince François d'Orléans, prince de Joinville (14 August 1818-1900) married Princess Francisca of Brazil.Prince Charles d'Orléans, duc de Penthièvre (1 January 1820-1828)Prince Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale (16 June 1822-1897) married Princess Maria Carolina Augusta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (b.1822-d.1869), daughter of Leopoldo, Prince of Salerno.Prince Antoine d'Orléans (31 July 1824-1890) became a prince of Spain after marrying Infanta Luisa Fernanda of Spain (b.1832-d.1897), daughter of Ferdinand VII of Spain and sister of Isabella II of Spain.France  Returning to France in 1814, the Duke and Duchess of Orléans had barely established themselves in the Palais-Royal in Paris when the Hundred Days drove them into exile. Marie Amélie took refuge with her four children in England, where she spent two years at Orleans House, Twickenham. Again in France in 1817, her life at Neuilly until 1828 was the happiest period of her existence. Neither then nor at any other time did she take any active share in politics; but she was not without indirect influence on affairs, because her ultra-royalist and legitimist traditions prevented the court from including her in the suspicion with which her husband's liberal views were regarded. Her attention was absorbed by the care and education of her numerous family, even after the revolution of 1830 had made her queen of the French.During her second exile, from 1848 to the end of her life, she lived at Claremont, where her charity and piety endeared her to the many English friends of the Orleans family. Marie Amélie died in exile, at Claremont in Surrey in England.
