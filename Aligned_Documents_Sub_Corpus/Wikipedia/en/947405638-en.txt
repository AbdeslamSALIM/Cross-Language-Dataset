Excited atoms with very high values of the principal quantum number, represented by n'' in the Rydberg formula, are called Rydberg atoms, and a crater on the moon is also named ''Rydberg in his honour. Rydberg's faith that spectral studies could assist in a theoretical understanding of the atom and its chemical properties was justified in 1913 by the work of Niels Bohr (see hydrogen spectrum). An important spectroscopic constant based on a hypothetical atom of infinite mass is called the Rydberg ® in his honor.He was active at Lund University, Sweden, for all of his working life.See alsoRydberg matterRydberg stateReferencesMike Sutton, “Getting the numbers right – the lonely struggle of Rydberg” Chemistry World, Vol. 1, No. 7, July 2004.External links Category:Swedish physicists Category:People connected to Lund University Category:1854 births Category:1919 deathsde:Johannes Rydberg es:Johannes Rydberg eo:Johannes Rydberg fr:Johannes Rydberg it:Johannes Rydberg he:יוהנס רידברג ht:Janne Rydberg mr:योहान्स रिडबर्ग nl:Johannes Rydberg ja:ヨハネス・リュードベリ pl:Johannes Rydberg pt:Johannes Rydberg ru:Ридберг, Йоханнес Роберт sr:Јоханес Ридберг sv:Johannes Rydberg zh:约翰尼斯·里德伯
