The Rice Terraces are commonly referred to by Filipinos as the "Eighth Wonder of the World". filipinasoul.com, ‘The Best’ of the Philippines - its natural wondersnscb.gov.ph, FACTS &amp; FIGURES, Ifugao provinceAbout Banaue &gt; Tourist Attractions It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. The terraces are located approximately 1500 meters (5000 ft) above sea level and cover 10,360 square kilometers (about 4000 square miles) of mountainside. They are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps are put end to end it would encircle half the globe.Department of Tourism: Ifugao Province. Accessed September 04, 2008.The Banaue terraces are part of the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras, ancient sprawling man-made structures from 2,000 to 6,000 years old. They are found in the provinces of Apayao, Benguet, Mountain Province and Ifugao, and are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Locals to this day still tend to the rice and vegetables on the terraces, although more and more younger Ifugaos do not find farming appealing, often opting for the more lucrative hospitality industry generated by the Rice Terraces. The result is the gradual erosion of the characteristic "steps", which need constant reconstruction and care.External linksUNESCO World Heritage Site LinkThe Rice Terraces of Bangaan, IfugaoReferences  Category:World Heritage Sites in the Philippines Category:National Cultural Treasures in the Philippines Category:Filipino culture Category:Megastructurescs:Rýžové terasy filipínských Kordiller de:Reisterrassen von Banaue es:Arrozales en terrazas de las cordilleras de Filipinas fa:شالیزارهای پلکانی بانائو fr:Rizières de Banaue hr:Terase rižinih polja u Banaue id:Teras Sawah Banaue it:Terrazzamenti di Banaue he:טרסות האורז בפיליפינים nl:Rijstterrassen van Banaue ja:フィリピン・コルディリェーラの棚田群 pl:Tarasy ryżowe w Banaue pt:Arrozais em terraços das Cordilheiras das Filipinas fi:Banauen riisipenkereet tl:Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe vi:Ruộng bậc thang Banaue zh:菲律賓科迪勒拉山的水稻梯田
