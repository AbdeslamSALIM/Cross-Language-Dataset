Maya Mikhailovna Plisetskaya (; born November 20, 1925) is a retired Russian ballet dancer, frequently cited as the greatest ballerina of modern times. Maya Plisetskaya is a naturalized Spanish citizen.Early lifeMaya Plisetskaya was born in Moscow into a prominent family of Jewish artists. She went to school in Spitsbergen, where her father worked as an engineer and mine director.In 1938, her father was executed during the Stalinist purges, possibly because he had hired a friend who had been a secretary to Leon Trotsky. Her mother Rachel Plisetskaya (or Ra Messerer), a silent-film actress, was arrested and sent to a labor camp (Gulag) in Khazakstan,&lt;/ref&gt; together with Maya's seven-month old baby brother.&lt;ref&gt;They were sent to ALZHIR camp, a Russian acronym for the Akmolinskii Camp for Wives of Traitors of the Motherland, &quot;[[enemies of the people]]&quot; [http://www.kazakhembus.com/Pope_pays_Tribute.html] near [[Akmolinsk]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thereupon Maya was adopted by her maternal aunt, the ballerina [[Sulamith Messerer]], until her mother was released in 1941.&lt;ref name=autobiography&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Maya studied under the great ballerina of imperial school, Elizaveta Gerdt. She first performed at the Bolshoi Theatre when she had just turned 11 years of age. In 1943, she graduated from the choreographic school and joined the Bolshoi Ballet, where she would perform until 1990.==Career== [[Image:Plisecka.jpg|thumb|300px|Maya Plisetskaya in the 1964 production of Don Quixote.]]From the beginning, Maya was a different kind of ballerina. Unlike many ballerinas, she did not spend any time in the corps de ballet. She was named principal ballerina immediately after graduation. Her red hair and striking looks made her a glamorous figure on and off the stage. Her long arms had a fluidity that to this day remains unmatched; her interpretation of The Dying Swan, a short showcase piece made famous by Anna Pavlova, became Maya's calling card. Maya was known for the height of her jumps, her extremely flexible back, the technical strength of her dancing, and her charisma.Despite her acclaim, Maya was not treated well by the Bolshoi management. She was Jewish&lt;/ref&gt; in an [[anti-Semitic]] climate, her family had been purged during the Stalinist era and her personality was defiant, so she was not allowed to tour outside the country for six years after joining the Bolshoi.&lt;ref name=eaton/&gt; It wasn't until 1959 that [[Nikita Khrushchev]] permitted her to travel abroad,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the world got to see Maya Plisetskaya. She changed the world of ballet forever, setting the bar higher for ballerinas everywhere, both in terms of technical brilliance and dramatic presence.Maya's most acclaimed roles included Odette-Odile in Swan Lake (1947) and Aurora in Sleeping Beauty (1961). In 1958, she was honoured with the title of the People's Artist of the USSR and married the young composer Rodion Shchedrin, in whose subsequent fame she shared.After Galina Ulanova left the stage in 1960, Maya Plisetskaya was proclaimed the prima ballerina assoluta of the Bolshoi Theatre. In the Soviet screen version of Anna Karenina, she played Princess Tverskaya. In 1971, her husband wrote a ballet on the same subject, where she would play the leading role. Anna Karenina was also her first attempt at choreography.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[choreographer]]s who created ballets for her include [[Yury Grigorovich]], [[Roland Petit]], [[Alberto Alonso]], and [[Maurice Bejart]].In the 1980s, Plisetskaya and Shchedrin spent much time abroad, where she worked as the artistic director of the Rome Opera Ballet in 1984–5, then the Spanish National Ballet of Madrid from 1987–9. At the age of 65, she finally retired from the Bolshoi as a soloist. On her 70th birthday, she debuted in Bejart's number choreographed for her and entitled "Ave Maya". Since 1994, she has been presiding over the annual international ballet competitions called Maya. In 1996 she was named as President of the Imperial Russian Ballet.&lt;/ref&gt;She was forced to be member of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public, threatened to be left without passport for appearances abroad. When she did travel abroad, the Soviet secret police requested that she encourage the interest of Robert Kennedy.On the date of her 80th birthday, the Financial Times summed up current opinion about Maya in the following words: "She was, and still is, a star, ballet's monstre sacre, the final statement about theatrical glamour, a flaring, flaming beacon in a world of dimly twinkling talents, a beauty in the world of prettiness".&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Emperor [[Akihito]] presented to her the [[Premium Imperiale]], informally considered a [[Nobel Prize]] for Art.Awards and honorsMaya Plisetskaya has been honored on numerous occasions for her skills:First prize, Budapest International Competition, 1949.People's Artist of the RSFSR, 1951.People's Artist of the USSR, 1959.Anna Pavlova Prize, 1962.Lenin Prize, 1964.Hero of Socialist Labour, 1985.Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur, 1986.Triumph Prize, 2000.ReferencesExternal linksOfficial site of the Plisetskaya-Shchedrin FoundationThe Washington Post's tribute to Maya's 80th birthdayThe Ballerina Gallery - Maya Plisetskayale Gala des étoiles - Maya PlisetskayaA national treasure - Maya Plisetskaya Category:Prima ballerina assolutas Category:Russian ballet dancers Category:Spanish ballet dancers Category:People's Artists of the USSR Category:Lenin Prize winners Category:Russian Jews Category:Russian-Spaniards Category:1925 births Category:Living peopleca:Maia Plisètskaia cv:Плисецкая Майя Михайловна de:Maja Michailowna Plissezkaja et:Maia Plissetskaja es:Maia Plisiétskaia fr:Maïa Plissetskaïa it:Majja Michajlovna Pliseckaja nl:Maja Plisetskaja ja:マイヤ・プリセツカヤ pl:Maja Plisiecka ru:Плисецкая, Майя Михайловна sl:Maja Plisecka sr:Маја Михајловна Плисецкаја fi:Maja Plisetskaja sv:Maja Plisetskaja
