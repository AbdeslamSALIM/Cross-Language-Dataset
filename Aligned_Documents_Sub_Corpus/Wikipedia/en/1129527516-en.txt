   Chestnut (Castanea),Latin syllable stress Cas-tá-ne-a (including some chinkapin or chinquapin) is a genus of eight or nine species of deciduous trees and shrubs in the Beech family Fagaceae, native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.

By Fabio Mencarelli. Food and Agriculture Organisation United Nations. November 2001.Chestnuts should not be confused with either Horse Chestnuts (genus Aesculus), or Water Chestnut (family Cyperaceae); these are unrelated to Castanea and are named for producing respectively nuts of similar appearance but of no notable edibility, and tubers of similar taste from an aquatic herbaceous plant. Other trees commonly mistaken for the Chestnut tree are the Chestnut Oak (Fagaceae Quercus prinus) and the American Beech (Fagus grandifolia).Chestnut Tree in chestnuttree.net.EtymologyFor some, the name Castanea is derived from the old name for the Sweet Chestnut, either in LatinNew RHS Dictionary of Gardening.

For others the name comes from that of the town of Kastania in Thessaly, Greece; but it is more probable that on the contrary the town took its name from the most common tree growing around it. Among the Mediterranean climate zone, chestnut trees are rarer in Greece because they dislike chalky soils. Kastania is located on one of the relatively few sedimentary or siliceous outcrops. They grow so abundantly there, that the strangeness of the fact would have determined the place's name.

They are arranged in long catkins of two kinds, with both kinds being borne on every tree. Some catkins are made of only male flowers, which mature first. Each flower has eight stamens, or 10 to 12 for Castanea mollissima.Flora of Taiwan The ripe pollen carries a heavy sweet odour that some people find too sweet or unpleasant. Other catkins have these pollen-bearing flowers but also carry near the twig from which these spring, small clusters of female or fruit-producing flowers. Two or three flowers together form a four-lobed prickly calybium which ultimately grows completely together to make the brown hull, or husk, covering the fruits.The fruit is contained in a spiny (very sharp) cupule 2 to 3 inches or 5 to 11 centimetres diameter, also called "bur" or "burr".

At around the time when the fruits reach maturity, the burrs turn yellow-brown and split open in 2 or 4 sections. They can remain on the tree longer than they hold the fruit, but more often achieve complete opening and release the fruits only after having fallen on the ground and partly due to soil humidity.The Chestnut fruit has a pointy end with at the tip a small tuft called 'flame' in Italian, and a hilum – an oblong spot at the other end of the fruit. In many varieties the fruit is flattened on one or two sides. It has two skins. The first one, is a hard outer shiny brown hull or husk, called the pericarpus;[http://www.chestnutsaustralia.com.au/content/view/18/43/ Chestnut Know-How]. By David McLaren. Written for Chestnut Australia Inc. 1999. the industry calls it 'the peel'. Underneath the pericarpus is another thinner skin, also called "pellicle" or "episperm". The pellicle closely adheres to the seed itself, following the grooves usually present at the surface of the fruit. These grooves are of variable sizes and depth according to the species and varieties. They make the peeling in most cases difficult without the appropriate technique – (external link).The peeling technique most in use by the people who use it regularly. The fruit inside these shows two cotyledons with a creamy-white flesh throughout[http://www.chestnutbrook.com.au/what-are-chestnuts.html What Are Chestnuts].

Usually these varieties have only one large fruit per burr, well rounded (no flat face) and which is called "marron" ("Marron de Lyon" in France, "Marron di Mugello" in Italy, "Paragon", ...).The superior fruiting varieties among European Chestnuts have good size, sweet taste and easy-to-remove inner skins. American Chestnuts are usually very small (around 5 g), but sweet tasting with easy-to-remove pellicles. Some Japanese varieties have huge nuts (around 40 g), with typically difficult to remove pellicles. Chinese Chestnuts' pellicle is usually easy to remove and their sizes vary greatly according to the varieties, although usually smaller than the Japanese Chestnut.HistoryEuropeThe sweet chestnut was introduced into Europe from Sardis, in Asia Minor; the fruit was then called the 'Sardian Nut.'

Ancient Greeks like Dioscorides and Romans such as Galen, wrote of chestnuts to comment on their medicinal properties – and of the flatulence induced by eating too much of it.[http://www.cambridge.org/us/books/kiple/chestnuts.htm The Cambridge World History of Food – Chestnuts], edited by Kenneth F. Kiple and Kriemhild Connee Ornelas. To the early Christians chestnuts symbolized chastity. Until the introduction of the potato, whole forest-dwelling communities which had scarce access to wheat flour relied on chestnuts as their main source of carbohydrates. In some parts of Italy a cake made of chestnuts is used as a substitute for potatoes. In 1583 Charles Estienne and Jean Liébault write that "an infinity of people live on nothing else but (the chestnut)".Charles Estienne and Jean Liébault. L’agriculture et maison rustique. Paris.1583.

This tree measured over 50 feet in circumference at 5 feet from the ground in 1720. The Chestnut forests on Mount Etna contain many trees that are said to be even larger. Chestnut trees particularly flourish in the Mediterranean basin. In 1584 the Governor of Genua, who dominated Corsica, ordered to all farmers and landowners to plant four trees yearly, among which a Chestnut tree – plus Olive-, Fig- and Mulberry-trees (this assumedly lasted until the end of Genoese rule over Corsica in 1729). Many communities owe their origin and former richness to the ensuing Chestnut woods.The Chestnut Tree in terracorsa. In France the marron glacé, a candied chestnut involving 16 different processes in a typically French cooking style, is always served at Christmas and New Year's time. In Italy they are still given to the poor as a symbol of sustenance on St. Martin's Day, November 11 (in Modena at this occasion the chestnuts are soaked in wine before roasting and serving) and are also traditionally eaten on Saint Simon's Day in Tuscany.Their popularity has declined during the last few centuries, partly due to their reputation of "food for poor people".Traitement des maladies par les légumes, les fruits et les céréales.

Many people did not want to take chestnut bread as "bread" because chestnut flour does not rise.

The last decades' worldwide renewal may have profited from the huge reforestation efforts started in the 30's in the United States, to establish a variety / varieties of Castanea sativa which may be resistant to chestnut-blight, as well as the strain on cereal supplies.The main region in Italy for chestnut production is the Mugello region; in 1996 the European Community granted the IGP (Protected Geographic Indication; equivalent to the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) status to the Mugello Sweet Chestnut. It is markedly sweet, peels easily, is not excessively floury or astringent, and has notes of vanilla, hazelnut and more subtly of fresh bread. There is no "unpleasant" aroma such as yeast, fungus, mold or paper, which sometimes occur with other chestnuts.The IGP Mugello Sweet Chestnut. The main regions in France for chestnut production are the départements of Ardèche with the famous “Châtaigne d’Ardèche” (A.O.C), of the Var, and of the Lyon region. France annually produces over 1,000 tonnes but still imports about 8,000 tonnes, mainly from Italy.Candied chestnuts (in French).In Portugal's archipelago of Madeira, Chestnut liquor is a traditional beverage, and it's gaining popularity with the tourists and in continental Portugal.North AmericaNative Americans were eating the American Chestnut species, mainly Castanea dentata and some others, long before European immigrants introduced their stock to America and before the arrival of Chestnut blight. In some places such as the Appalachian Mountains and others, one in every four hardwoods was an American Chestnut. Mature trees often grew straight and branch-free for 50 feet, up to one hundred feet, averaging up to five feet in diameter. For three centuries most barns and homes east of the Mississippi were made from American Chestnut.American Chestnut Restoration. Salem Board & Beam. In 1911 the famous food book The Grocer's Encyclopedia noted that a cannery in Holland included in its "vegetables-and-meat" ready-cooked combinations, a "chestnuts and sausages" casserole besides the more classic "beef and onions" and "green peas and veal" - this to celebrate the chestnut culture that would bring whole villages out in the woods for three weeks each autumn (and keep them busy all winter), and to deplore the lack of food diversity in the United States's shop shelves.[http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/books/grocersencyclopedia/ency.html The Grocer's Encyclopedia - Encyclopedia of Foods and Beverages]. By Artemas Ward. New York. 1911.This was not long before America would measure the extent of the impending catastrophe.

The United States imported 4,056 metric tons of European in-shell chestnuts worth $10 million in 2007.[http://www.agmrc.org/agmrc/commodity/nuts/chestnuts/ AGricultural Marketing Resource Center: Chestnuts]. By Malinda Geisler, content specialist, AGricultural Marketing Resource Center, Iowa State University. Revised May 2008. But the U.S. chestnut industry is as yet in its infancy, producing less than 1 percent of total world production. Since the mid-twentieth century, most of the United States's imports are from Southern Italy with the large, meaty, and richly flavored Sicilian chestnut being considered among the best qualities for bulk sale and supermarket retail. But some imports come from Portugal and France. The next two largest sources of imports to the United States are China and South Korea.  The French varieties of marrons are highly favoured and sold at high prices in gourmet shops.Meanwhile, a 2005 study of the sector found that U.S.A. producers are mainly part-timers diversifying an existing agricultural business, or hobbyists.[http://www.centerforagroforestry.org/pubs/chestnutmarketreport.pdf University of Missouri Center for Agroforestry, 2005 - This report describes findings from a 2004 nationwide survey of the U.S. chestnut market. Another recent study indicates that investment in a new plantation takes 13 years to break even, at least within the current Australian market. But starting a small-scale operation demands only a relatively low initial investment, This is a factor in the small size of the present production operations, with half of them being within 3 to 10 acres. Another pre-determining factor in the small productivity of the sector, is that most orchards have been created less than 10 years ago so have young trees which are as now barely entering commercial production. Assuming a 10 kgs yield for a 10 year-old tree is a reliable conservative estimate, even though some exceptional specimens of that age have yielded 100kgs. So most producers earn less than $5,000 per year, with a third of the total not having sold anything so far.Moreover, the plantings have so far been mostly of Chinese species, but the products are not readily available. The American Chestnut Foundation recommends holding on a little while more before large-scale planting. This is because it and its associates (the American Chestnut Cooperators' Foundation and many others from education, research and industry sectors contributing to the program) are at the last stages of developing a variety that is as close as possible to the lost American chestnut, while having incorporated the blight-resistant gene of the Asiatic species. Considering the added-value bonus that Chestnut trees can be easily grown organically, and assuming the development of brands in the market, there is little doubt that everything else being equal, home-grown products would reach higher prices than imports – the high volume of which indicates a market with expanding prospects. As of 2008, the price for chestnuts sold fresh in the shell ranges from $1.50 per pound wholesale to about $5 per pound retail, depending mainly on the size.Australia, New ZealandThe Australian gold rush of the 1850s and 1860s saw the first recorded plantings of European Chestnut trees, brought in from Europe by the first settlers. Along the years, most but not all Chestnut tree plantations were Castanea sativa stock, which is still the dominant species. Some of these are still standing today. Some trees in northern Victoria are around 120 years old and up to 60 meters tall. Chestnuts grow well in the South-West of Western Australia, which has cold winters and warm to hot summers. As of 2008 the country has just under 350 Chestnut growers, annually producing around 1,200 tonnes of chestnuts of which 80% comes from North-East Victoria. The produce is mostly sold to the domestic fresh fruit market. Chestnuts are now slowly gaining popularity in Australia. A considerable increase in production is expected in the next 10 years, due to the increase in commercial plantation during the last fifteen years to twenty-five years. By far the most common species in Australia is the European Chestnut, but there are small numbers of the other species, as well as some hybrids.The Japanese Chestnut (Castanea crenata) does well in wet and humid weather and in hot summers (~30oC); and has been introduced in New Zealand in the early 1900s, more so in the upper North Island regionAsiaAlways served as part of the New Year menu in Japan, chestnuts represent both success and hard times – mastery and strength. The Japanese Chestnut (called Kuri) has been cultivated before rice-growingJapanese Chestnut in Japan House., and the Chinese Chestnut (Castanea mollissima) possibly for 2-6,000 years. China has about 300 Chestnut cultivars, commonly divided into 5 populations: Northern, Yangtze River Valley, Sichuan and Guizhou, Southern and Southwestern. Moreover, the Dandong chestnut (belonging to the Japanese Chestnut – Castanea crenata) is a major cultivar in Liaoning Province.

Rockridge Market Hall. When chestnuts are just starting to ripen, the fruit is mostly starch and is very firm under finger pressure from the high water content. As the chestnuts ripen, the starch is slowly converted into sugars; and moisture content also starts decreasing. Upon pressing the chestnut a slight 'give' can be felt: the hull is not so tense, there is space between it and the flesh of the fruit.Delmarvelous nursery (Chestnut Trees & Seed Nuts).

Society of Ontario Nut Growers., so at least two trees are needed for pollination.Soil requirementsCastanea likes a soil with good drainage and adequate moisture. The Chestnut tree prefers sloping, deep soils; it does not like shallow or heavy soils with impermeable, clay subsoils. To note that Chinese Chestnut prefers a fertile, well-drained soil, but it grows well in fairly dry, rocky, poor soils.Kentucky Division of Forestry. Although Castanea can grow in very acid soil, and while these soils are reasonably well tolerated, the preferred range is from pH 5.5-6.0. It does not grow well on alkaline soils such as chalk, but thrives on soils such as soils derived from granite, sandstone, or schist. On alkaline soils, Chestnut trees can be grown by grafting them onto oak rootstocks. Recently cleared land is best avoided to help resist the root rot, Armillaria mellia.Sun exposureCastanea likes a full sun position. An experiment with Castanea dentata seedlings in Ohio confirmed the need for sun for optimal growth.[http://abstracts.co.allenpress.com/pweb/esa2003/document/25264 Survival and growth in size and biomass of American Chestnut (Castanea dentata) seedlings under various silvicultural regimes in a mixed Oak forest ecosystem.] By Corinne McCament and Brian McCarthy. Ohio University, Athens, Ohio. Paper presented on 6 August 2003 at the ESA 2003 Annual Meeting. The butt of the tree is sometimes painted with white paint to protect the tree from sunburn until it has developed enough canopy. Wide spacing between the trees encourages low, broad crowns with maximum exposure to sunshine to increase fruit production. Where Chestnut trees touch there is virtually no fruit production. Current industrial plantings can range from 7m x 7m to 20m x 20m. The closer plantings, more popular, mean quicker increase in short-term production but "heavy pruning" or even "tree removal" later.WateringThe optimum rainfall for Chestnut trees is 800mm+ per annum, ideally in even distribution throughout the year. Mulching during summer is recommended. Rainfall below 700mm per annum needs be complemented, for example with a drip irrigation system. This should water the soil at the outer half of the circle formed by the drip line to encourage root growth. Independently from annual rainfall, it is recommended to water young trees at least during summer and early autumn. Once established it resists well to droughts.Encyclopaedia of Herbs and their Uses.

Chittendon. 1956 Oxford University Press 1951.PreservationBecause of their high water content, transpiration rates and consequent loss weight, for storage purposes they react as fresh fruits (not as nuts). They should be kept cool at all times including in shops when on display for sale. To preserve their freshness for a few months with no artificial refrigeration, the chestnuts can be soaked in cold water for about 20 hours immediately after harvest; after which they are dried in the shade, then layered in dry sand. On the other hand, chestnuts behave similarly to seeds in that they produce very little ethylene, and their respiration rate is low – varying between 5 and 20 mg/kg-h according to the temperature.PestsThe main threat to Chestnut trees comes from grey squirrels stripping its bark, from when the tree is about 8 years old and onwards through the life of the tree.Rabbits and wallabies can do great damage to young trees, which need guarding by some fence or by wrapping the tree trunk in sisal or other appropriate material. Deer and kangaroos can also be troublesome.Cattle and horses may require temporary fencing to prevent them from damaging fallen chestnuts at harvest time.The sulphur crested cockatoo can damage branches up to 10 mm in diameter by carrying out "beak maintenance" on young trees.Rosellas can also be troublesome at harvest time.

Chestnut - Agricultural Publisher. For Sarkpont Cc., Hungary.The most frequently occurring pests are the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and the mottled umber moth (Erannis defoliaria).The [http://uk.ask.com/web?qsrc=167&amp;o=41439048&amp;l=dis&amp;siteid=41439048&amp;q=Attelabus+nitens+picture&amp;dm=all Oak roller weevil] (''Attelabus nitens'') causes relatively less damage by rolling up the Chestnut leaves into a barrel shape to shelter its eggs and its developing larvae. The insects swarm from the end of April to mid-June, and damage the tree's flower buds during their feeding season.The larvae of the Oak-leaf-mining moth, also called the Tischerid moth (Tischeria ekebladella), dugs white, see-through mines in Chestnut's leaves. It lays its eggs in the leaves between May and June. The larvae cause white spots in the leaves by chewing them from the inside.The Oak aphid (Myzocallis castanicola) sucks on the apex of the tree's young shoots and leaves. Native to Europe and North America, it is also active in Hungary. Leaves do not roll up, but it delays the growth of shoots and damages young plantations's graft-shoot hosts. Commercial plantations and nurseries spray pesticides during the shoots’ growth period to fight the damage. The Chestnut mosaic virus is probably transmitted by Myzocallis castanicola aphids.[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3010278 Chestnut mosaic virus : Transmission by the aphid Myzocallis castanicola on Chestnut tree]. By J.-C. Desvignes and D. Cornaggia (CTIFL, Centre de Lanxade, La Force, France). In Phytoma, la défense des végétaux. 1996, no. 481, pp. 39-41 (6 ref.). ISSN 1164-6993.The Chestnut weevil (Curculio elephas) most often damages the Chestnut fruits. In Hungary it swarms in Chestnut orchards around August 20, particularly strongly around noon and in sunny weather. The eggs are laid into the Chestnut's cupules or around the peduncle joints. The larvae feed on the nuts and leave only nutchips and excrements within. While the chestnuts ripen, the larvae retreat into the ground after having chewed their way out of the nuts. On the following July they will turn into pupas. The larvae of the Chestnut weevil can only chew their way out of a fallen nut. So breeding occurs mostly where chestnuts lie on the ground for a sufficient length of time, or where the trees produce many small fruits which remain behind at the harvest. Timing the harvests to pick up the chestnuts as soon as they fall, reduces the numbers of the overwintering larvae. Regular soil work is also unfavourable to its life habits of this pest. Small Chestnut grafts are sprayed with chemicals. A warm aerosol-based protection has been developed for older trees, by Sifter and Bürgés in 1971.It is not recommended to plant Chestnut orchards beside Turkey Oak forests, because both trees are susceptible to the Chestnut weevil (who also uses the Turkey Oak acorn to develop) and the Turkey Oak trees can pass it on to the Chestnut trees.In Hungary, the most common moth threatening Chestnut trees is the [[Tortricidae|'acorn moth']] (Laspeyreisa splendana) and its subspecies. Its grayish-yellow larvae cause similar damage to that of the Chestnut weevil, but they moreover spin characteristic webs among the nutchips and larvae's excrements. This moth causes about 5-41% of the damage that occurs in western Hungaria's Chestnut plantations. Plantations need regular protection against these moths whose occurrence does not decrease.In New Zealand the grass grub beetle eats the soft new season foliage of Chestnut trees. They can entirely strip a young tree, in the late spring when they fly at dusk, often in huge numbers.DiseasesThe Chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica (formerly Endothia parasitica) affects Chestnut trees. The Eastern Asian species have co-evolved with this disease and are moderately to very resistant to it, while the European and North American species, not having been exposed to it in the past, have little or no resistance. Early in the 20th century, Chestnut blight destroyed about 4 billion American Chestnut trees, and reduced the most important tree throughout the east coast to insignificant presence. The American chinkapins are also very susceptible to Chestnut blight. The European and West Asian Chestnuts are susceptible, but less so than the American species. The resistant species (particularly Japanese Chestnut and Chinese Chestnut but also Seguin's Chestnut and Henry's Chestnut) have been used in breeding programs in the US to create hybrids with the American Chestnut that are also disease-resistant. The bark miner Spulerina simploniella (Lepidoptera: Gracilariidae) was found in intensively managed Chestnut coppices in Greece, but not in Chestnut orchards. The insect's larvae (and the rain) may be agents in the spreading of the disease. They mine under the thin periderm of young trees up to 10 years old, while the stem bark is still smooth. Rain during the pupation period (approximately covering the last week of May and first two weeks of June), and the actions of the larvae, may collude for conidiospores to come into contact with the freshly exposed phloem, and thus cause cankers.[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118712634/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 The role of Spulerina simploniella in the spread of Chestnut blight]. By S. Diamandis (NAGREF, Forest Research Institute, 570 06 Vassilika, Thessaloniki, Greece) and C. Perlerou. Received: 27.07.2004; accepted: 25.02.2005; editor: P. Raddi. DOI 10.1111/j.1439-0329.2005.00413.x."Ink disease" also appears in a number of other plants. The disease attacks the phloem tissue and the cambium of the roots and root collars about 10-20 centimeters above ground. Wet rot settles in as a result.It was named after the ink-black color of the tannic acid becoming oxygenated (oxydised) after seeping out, but that symptom is not a characteristic of the disease. The same ink-black colour can appear following other types of decays and mechanical injuries that make liquids seep through: these liquids can also oxydise after contact with air. Moreover, with some phytophtoric diseases, no tannic acid is generated.With the ink disease, the leaves turn yellow and later fall down; the fruits remain small, and the nuts prematurely drop out of the burrs. These dry and remain onto the trees throughout winter time. In acute cases, root decay make the trees dry out and wither away."Sudden Oak death", or phytophtora disease, is the longest-known Chestnut-tree disease leading to tree death. Of the two main pathogens for this disease, the one in European Chestnuts is since 1971 known to be Phytophtora cambivora. Phytophtora cinnamoni was discovered in Chestnut trees in the United States in 1932. Both trigger similar symptoms. Since then, it has also been proved to occur in most European Chestnut-growing countries. It is difficult to differentiate between the two latter pathogens. Chemicals seem of little effectiveness. Many countries impose strict prophylactic rules to preserve against the spread of the disease.Melanconis modonia is one of the pathogens that can infect trees through injuries and induce Chestnut trees' "bark death". It was first reported in Hungary by Hausz in 1972. The damage is of little consequence in older or stronger trees, but it affects saplings's graftings in nurseries. Coryneum perniciosum, one of the two conidium-like side forms of this fungus, occurs on all decayed, ligneous parts of a Chestnut tree. The symptoms of infection on young smooth trunks is similar that with the Chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria. For this reason it has persistently been wrongly thought of as the pathogen for the "ink disease". With Melanconis the bark sinks in and takes on brownish-red tones, with black lentil-like multicell conidium bodies and black cone-like stromas breaking through the bark. But unlike with Cryphonectria there are no orange-colored fruiting bodies. Prevention primarily includes keeping the tree in good shape; some further protections against Cryphonectria also help pretenting bark-death caused by Melanconis. The Chestnut mosaic virus is probably transmitted by the Oak aphid Myzocallis castanicola.[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3010278 Chestnut mosaic virus : Transmission by the aphid Myzocallis castanicola on Chestnut tree].

ISSN 1164-6993.Root rot is brought by the fungus Armillaria mellia. When planting Castanea, recently cleared land is best avoided to help resist this fungus. The disease is more prevalent on heavier and poorly-drained soil types. Leaf spot is the most common disease for Chestnut trees (Mycosphaerella maculiformis). It is known as cylindrosporium leaf spot disease, after its summer conidium form Cylindrosporium castaneae. The pathogens spend the winter in the white spots of the fallen leaves. At spring time it re-infects the new leaves. In or near June, tiny white spots on the leaves appear, which grow and turn brown over time. At the end of the summer, the spots entirely cover the leaf which turns yellow. In rainy and humid weather with large temperature fluctuation, the tree loses its leaves. If August is dry and warm the infected leaves roll up, the arteries twist, and the dead leaves dry on the tree until defoliage.This recurs yearly, even as the extent of the damage varies from year to year. Some species are more resistant than others.Among several foliage diseases of smaller significance for European Chestnut growing, Oak mildew infects the most trees (Microsphaera alphitoides). Younger trees suffer most: their shoots become short-jointed, growth is delayed and they develop sensitivity to frostbite. In older trees, the fungus usually infects only the tip of the shoots. The pathogens hibernate in the shoots and infect the leaves from there. The fungus grows on the top of the leaves, with the appearance of a coating only in mid-summer. The infected leaves' development slows down or stops, the distance between their vessels shrink, and the vessels themselves become curly.Breaking the tuft provides the most common entrance for fungi spores during storage. Cyboria, the most diffuse, turns the flesh black and spongy. Other fungi are known, such as Rhizopus, Fusarium, Collectotrichum.Uses]] ]]CulinaryThe fruit can be peeled and eaten raw (almost unknown in North-America), but it then can be somewhat astringent especially if the pellicle is not removed.[http://www3.unifi.it/ueresgen29/ds7.htm Description of European Chestnut].

The continental blockade following shortly after (1806-1814) increased the research into developing chestnuts as a source of sugar, but Napoleon chose beets instead.The nuts can also be eaten candied, boiled, steamed, grilled, roasted or fried (fritters), in sweet or savoury recipes. They can be used to stuff vegetables, poultry, fowl and other edibles. They are available fresh, dried, ground, canned (whole or in puree).Candied chestnuts (whole chestnuts candied in sugar syrup, then iced) are sold under the French name marrons glacés or Turkish name kestane şekeri ("sugared chestnuts"). They appeared in France in the 16th century. Towards the end of 19th century, Lyon is brought low by the collapse of the textile market, notably silk. Clément Faugier ingénieur des Ponts et Chaussées, is looking for a way to revitalize the regional economy. In 1882 at Privas, he invented the technology to make marrons glacés on an industrial scale (although a great deal of the over-twenty necessary steps from harvest to the finished product are still accomplished manually). Chestnuts are picked in autumn, and candied from the start of the following summer for the ensuing Christmas. Thus the marrons glacés eaten at Christmas are those picked the year before.“C'est le mois – Les marrons glacés synonymes de fêtes de fin d'année”. By Marie-Françoise Briand.

It also corrodes iron rapidly although copper, brass or stainless metals are not affected.Chestnut timber is decorative: light brown in colour, it is sometimes confused with Oak wood. Both woods' textures are also similar. When in a growing stage thus with very little sap wood, a Chestnut tree contains more timber of a durable quality than an Oak of the same dimensions. Young Chestnut wood has proved more durable than Oak for woodwork that has to be partly in the ground, such as stakes and fences.After most growth is achieved, Chestnut timber tends to split and warp more the older it is harvested; it becomes neither as hard nor quite as strong as Oak wood. The American Chestnut Castanea dentata served as an important source of lumber, because that species has long unbranched trunks. In England it was nevertheless formerly used indiscriminately with Oak for the construction of houses, mill-work and household furniture. It grows so freely in that country, that it was long considered a true native – partly because the roof of Westminster Hall and the Parliament House of Edinburgh were mistakenly thought of as Chestnut wood. But Chestnut wood loses much of its durability when grown beyond fifty years old, and despite the local Chestnut's quick growth rate it remains that the timber used for these two buildings is considerably larger than a 50-year-old Chestnut's girth. It has been now proved that they are of Durmast Oak, which grain and colour closely resembles that of Chestnut.It is therefore uncommon to find large pieces of Chestnut wood in building structures, but it has nevertheless always been highly-valued for small outdoor furniture pieces where durability is important, such as fencing and wooden outdoor cladding ('shingles') for covering buildings., pit-props In Italy, it is also used to make barrels used for aging balsamic vinegar. Of note the famous eighteenth century's "berles" in the French Cévennes: cupboards cut directly from the hollowed trunk.Chestnut museum in the Beaumedrobie country - [[Joyeuse], France]CoppicingMost wood production is done by coppice systems, cut on a 12-year rotation to provide small timber which does not split as badly as large logs. In southern England (particularly in Kent), Sweet Chestnut has traditionally been grown as coppices, being re-cut every ten years or so on rotation for poles, used for firewood, fencing (fence posts and chestnut paling) and especially to support the strings up which hops are grown.FuelDry Chestnut firewood is best burned in a closed log-burner because of its tendency to spit on an open fire.Sustainable forest management|Forestry]]An excellent soil-enriching understorey in Pine forests Sustainable forest management incorporates more mixed plantings of proven efficiency, as opposite to monosylviculture. A study presented in 1997 has evaluated positively the potential increase in productivity with mixed stands and plantations, comparatively to plots of only one species. The relative yield total values of the mixed plantings steadily increase with time. It has shown that Castanea sativa responds well to competitive pressure from Pseudotsuga menziesii, the latter also showing a higher productivity.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T6X-3VJRRSB-11&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=9938875c5feac45071595ecd5adf3b50 Dynamics of a broadleaved (Castanea sativa) conifer (Pseudotsuga menziesii) mixed stands in Northern Portugal].

Another study with Castanea dentata seedlings in Ohio concluded that reforestation efforts with Castanea is best achieved by planting Castanea in places with little or no arboreous land cover, because of the need for light.WildlifeThe tree is noted for attracting wildlife. The nuts are an important food for jays, pigeons, wild boar and squirrels. Several insects, notably the Chestnut weevil Curculio elephas, also feed on the seeds. The leaves are used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths); see list of Lepidoptera that feed on chestnut trees. American and Chinese chinquapins (Castanea pumila and Castanea henryi) have very small nuts that are an important source of food for wildlife.Other usesChestnut wood is a useful source of natural tannin, used for tanning leather before the introduction of synthetic tannins. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 6.8% tannin and the wood 13.4%. The bark imparts a dark colour to the tannin, and has a higher sugar content which increases the percentage of soluble non-tans, or impurities, in the extract; so it was not employed in this use.Chestnut in Search Conservation OnLine. Chestnut tannin has a naturally low pH value, relatively low salts content and a high acids content. It is one of the pyrogallol class of tannins. As it tends to give a reddish tone to the leather, it is most often used in combination with quebracho, mimosa, myrabolans, and valonia.   The wood seems to reach its highest tannin content after the trees reach 30 years old. The southern European Chestnut wood usually contains at least 10 to 13% more tannin when not higher, than Chestnut trees in northern climates. Today the largest producer of Chestnut wood extract for tanning is Italy. Fabric can be starched with chestnut mealLinen cloth can be whitened with chestnut mealThe leaves and the skins (husk and pellicle) of the fruits provide a hair shampoo.Artistic references[[Image:Roastedchestnuts.JPG|thumb|'Roasted California-grown chestnuts' The nuts are scored before roasting to allow venting and facilitate peeling]]The jazz standard "April in Paris" begins, "April in Paris / Chestnuts in blossom."In the Polish film, Ashes and Diamonds, two characters reminisce about the Chestnut trees that once lined a famous boulevard destroyed in the Warsaw Uprising."The Christmas Song" begins with the phrase "Chestnuts roasting on an open fire."
