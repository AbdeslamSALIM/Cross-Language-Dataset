Gampopa was renowned for the clarity of his perception and his knowledge of both Kadampa and, later, Mahamudra methods.Gampopa's position in the transmission lineage of the esoteric Mahamudra teaching is as follows:Tilopa (988-1069), the Indian yogi who experienced the original transmission of the MahamudraNaropa (1016-1100), who perfected the methods of accelerated enlightenment, described in his six yogas of Naropa.Marpa (1012-1097), the first Tibetan in the lineage, who translated the Vajrayana and Mahamudra texts into Old TibetanMilarepa (1052-1135), poet and master who overcame Marpa's reluctance to teach but nonetheless attained enlightenment in a single lifetimeGampopa, Milarepa's most important student, who integrated Atisha's Kadampa teaching and Tilopa's Mahamudra teaching to establish the Kagyu schoolThis lineage sequence, taken together, is called the "Five Founding Masters" by the Kagyu followers.Prior to studying under Milarepa, Gampopa had studied the kadampa traditions, which is a gradual path based on the lamrim teachings. He searched for, and eventually met Milarepa, and attained realization of ultimate reality under his guidance.Gampopa wrote The Jewel Ornament of Liberation and founded the Dagpo Kagyud school in 1125. It was the integrative teaching of Gampopa which unified Kadampa and Mahamudra teachings into the distinctive Kagyu approach.Gampopa also established various monastic institutions, taught extensively, and attracted many students.
