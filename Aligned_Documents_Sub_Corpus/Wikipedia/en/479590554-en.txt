Retiring from racing in 1998, he became director of Team Discovery (formerly U.S. Postal Service Pro Cycling Team), a US-based UCI ProTour cycling team. He produced eight Tour De France winners (Lance Armstrong from 1999-2005 and Alberto Contador in 2007)His greatest successes as a cyclist came at 1995 Tour de France when he won stage 7, which began in Charleroi and ended in Liège, Belgium, and took the yellow jersey in his home country. Bruyneel launched an escape and was joined by eventual winner Miguel Indurain. The Spaniard took the lead and rode the stage as a time-trial to gain time on his main rivals. Bruyneel, barely able to follow the tempo himself, beat Indurain in the sprint. Bruyneel admitted he felt somewhat uneasy about how he had won. The win into Liège afforded him a chance meeting with the King of his country during the prize presentations. That same year, he finished 3rd at the 1995 Vuelta a España and won the Aalst criterium.Earlier wins included the 1990 Tour de l'Avenir, the 1991 Rund um den Henninger Turm, the 1992 Grand Prix des Nations and Coppa Placci, and stage 6 (Evreux  Amiens) and finishing 7th at the 1993 Tour de France.In the 1996 Tour de France, he missed a curve when descending a hill in stage 7 (Chambéry  Les Arcs), and disappeared into a ravine. The frightening moment was captured by a camera team that was driving right behind the group of descenders. After long minutes of uncertainty, Bruyneel could be seen climbing out of the ravine, and getting back onto his bike to continue the stage.Bruyneel's book, We Might As Well Win, was published by Houghton Mifflin on June 4, 2008.As of the October 2007 negotiations with the Kazakh government, Bruyneel was signed to take over control of the embattled Astana Team and brought Levi Leipheimer and Alberto Contador with him for the 2008 season.On May 29, 2008, Bruyneel joined the Board of Directors of World Bicycle Relief.According to Bruyneel's personal web site, he is fluent in six languages (Dutch, English, Spanish, French, Italian and German).:: Johan Bruyneel::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Palmarès1988Izegem1989GingelomWavreBerlare1990HerseltTour de l'Avenir1991Rund um den Henninger-TurmGeraardsbergen1992Coppa PlacciGrand Prix des Nations1st, Stage 11, Vuelta a España1993GeraardsbergenTour de France:7th place overall classificationWinner stage 61995AalstTour de France:Wearing yellow jersey for one dayWinner stage 7Vuelta a España:3rd place overall classification1996Peer1997Flèche NamuroiseReferencesExternal linksOfficial Tour de France results for Johan BruyneelWritten WorkWe Might As Well Win: On the Road to Success with the Mastermind Behind a Record-Setting Eight Tour de France Victories ISBN 0618879374External linksOfficial website Category:Belgian cyclists Category:Belgian Tour de France stage winners Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Belgium Category:Belgian Vuelta a España stage winners Category:1964 births Category:Living peopleda:Johan Bruyneel de:Johan Bruyneel es:Johan Bruyneel fr:Johan Bruyneel it:Johan Bruyneel nl:Johan Bruyneel ja:ヨハン・ブリュイネール no:Johan Bruyneel pl:Johan Bruyneel vls:Johan Bruyneel
