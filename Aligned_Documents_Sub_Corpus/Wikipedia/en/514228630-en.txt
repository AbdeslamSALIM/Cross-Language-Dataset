with Helmut Berger in Arthur Schnitzler´s Reigen.]]Helmut Berger (born May 29 1944) is an Austrian actor.Berger (whose real name is Helmut Steinberger) was born in Bad Ischl, Austria, into a family of hoteliers and although he had no interest in gastronomy or the hospitality industry, he initially trained and worked in this area. At the age of 18, he moved to London, where he did odd-jobs whilst simultaneously taking acting classes. After studying languages in Perugia, Berger moved to Rome.In 1964, he first met Luchino Visconti, whose life partner he later became. Visconti gave him his first acting role in the movie Le streghe (1967) (in the episode "La strega bruciata viva"), but he attained international fame playing Martin von Essenbeck in Visconti's The Damned (1969).In The Damned, in what is perhaps his best known scene, he mimics the role of Lola, as played by Marlene Dietrich in Der blaue Engel. However, the role of Ludwig II of Bavaria in Visconti's Ludwig can be considered the pinnacle of his acting career. In Ludwig, Berger portrays the monarch from his blooming youth, to his dissolute final years –- and, in the process, reveals a nervous and paranoid king of decay drawn from his own weaknesses and psychological depths.In 1969, Helmut Berger was nominated for the Golden Globe award for his role in "The Damned", and in 1973 he won the European Oscar "David di Donatello" for his performance in "Ludwig". In 2007, he received the honour of a Special Teddy at the Berlin Film Festival for his overall professional achievements.Filmography1967 - The Witches (Luchino Visconti)1968 - The young Tigers (Antonio Leonviola)1968 - Sai cosa faceva Stalin alle donne?
