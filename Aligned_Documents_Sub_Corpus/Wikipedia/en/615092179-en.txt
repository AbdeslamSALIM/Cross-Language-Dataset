  Nile is a brutal / technical death metal band from Greenville, South Carolina that assembled in 1993. Their music and lyrics are inspired by Ancient Egyptian mysticism, history, religion, art, and the writings of H.P. Lovecraft.HistoryNile's music is written mostly by founding member and vocalist/guitarist Karl Sanders. It combines traditional and technical death metal with elements of Middle Eastern music, incorporating traditional Egyptian instruments in some songs. Nile's music is also characterized by its extreme complexity and speed – for which the band has received acknowledgment from many music fans and journalists and its extremely "heavy" riffing, due to Nile's guitar and bass tunings. Much of the lyrical content is based on Karl Sanders' interest in Egyptology and other ancient Middle Eastern cultures, such as Mesopotamia. Lengthy sleeve notes are included with the albums Black Seeds of Vengeance, In Their Darkened Shrines and Annihilation of the Wicked, explaining the inspiration or source for the lyrics of each song. Some songs, moreover, are based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, whose writing has strongly influenced the style and grammatical peculiarities of Nile's lyrics.In May 2006, Nile signed a recording contract with Nuclear Blast. On February 26, 2007, Nile entered the studio and began recording their fifth full-length album entitled Ithyphallic, which was their first release with Nuclear Blast. Karl Sanders had confirmed a release date of June 29 via a posting on the band's message board, which was later pushed back to July 20, 2007. As a special bonus, Nuclear Blast gave several fans the opportunity to listen to the new album two weeks before its release if they could decipher a hieroglyphic message, of which "papyrus" was the answer.On March 21, 2007, Nile was confirmed as a "Second Stage" act for Ozzfest 2007. A message from Karl Sanders via Nile's MySpace page indicated that they were excited to finally bring true death metal to an Ozzfest audience. In March/April 2008, Nile went on a USA headlining tour with Suicide Silence, The Faceless, Unexpect, and Warbringer.NILE-Catacombs | official page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In September/October 2008, Nile will set out on a European headlining tour with Grave, Omnium Gatherum and Severe Torture.
