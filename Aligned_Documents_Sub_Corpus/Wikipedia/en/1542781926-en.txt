Gerhard Herzberg, PC, CC, FRSC, FRS (December 25, 1904 &ndash; March 3, 1999) was a pioneering physicist and physical chemist, and Nobel Laureate in chemistry. Born in Germany, he fled to Canada in 1935, where he continued his distinguished scientific career.Herzberg's main work concerned atomic and molecular spectroscopy. He is well known for using these techniques that determine the structures of diatomic and polyatomic molecules, including free radicals difficult to investigate in any other way, and for the chemical analysis of astronomical objects.Herzberg served as Chancellor of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada from 1973 to 1980.Biography1904 Born and educated in Hamburg, Germany1928 Dr.Ing. degree at Darmstadt University of Technology under H.

The NSERC Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering, Canada's highest research award, was named in his honour in 2000. The Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is named for him. He was made a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science. Asteroid 3316 Herzberg is named after him.The main building of John Abbott College in Montreal is named after him. A public park in the College Park neighbourhood of Saskatoon also bears his name.References External linksHerzberg biography from the Nobel FoundationThe NSERC Herzberg MedalAbout Gerhard Herzberg NSERC bioScience.ca profileCanadian Science and Technology Museum Hall of FameGerhard Herzberg: An Illustrious Life in Science from the National Research Council of Canada PressEncyclopædia Britannica entry[http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/BAAS./0032//0001669.000.html Obituary in BAAS 32 (2000) 1669]Order of Canada Citation Category:1904 births Category:1999 deaths Category:Canadian chemists Category:Canadian Nobel laureates Category:Canadian physicists Category:Canadian astronomers Category:Chancellors of Carleton University Category:Companions of the Order of Canada Category:Cornell University faculty Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:University of Göttingen faculty Category:German chemists Category:German physicists Category:International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science members Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Nobel laureates in Chemistry Category:People from Hamburgar:غيرهارد هيرتسبيرغ ca:Gerhard Herzberg de:Gerhard Herzberg es:Gerhard Herzberg fr:Gerhard Herzberg gd:Gerhard Herzberg id:Gerhard Herzberg it:Gerhard Herzberg sw:Gerhard Herzberg mr:गेर्हार्ड हर्झबर्ग nl:Gerhard Herzberg ja:ゲルハルト・ヘルツベルク no:Gerhard Herzberg oc:Gerhard Herzberg pl:Gerhard Herzberg pt:Gerhard Herzberg ro:Gerhard Herzberg fi:Gerhard Herzberg sv:Gerhard Herzberg zh:格哈德·赫茨贝格
