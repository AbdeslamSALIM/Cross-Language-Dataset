Vézelay is a commune in the Yonne département in the Bourgogne région of France.It is principally noted for Vézelay Abbey (Basilica of St. Magdalene), sited here since the 9th century.HistoryAccording to legend, not long before the end of the first millennium a monk named Baudillon brought relics (bones) of Mary Magdalene to Vézelay from Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume. In 1058 the Pope confirmed the genuineness of the relics, leading to an influx of pilgrims that has continued to this day. Vézelay Abbey was also a major starting point for pilgrims to Santiago de Compostela, one of the most important of all medieval pilgrimage centres. This was crucially important in attracting pilgrims and the wealth they brought to the town.In 1189, the Frankish and English factions of the Third Crusade met at Vezelay before officially departing for the Holy Lands.DemographicsAs of the census of 1999, the population was 492.On 1 January 2006, the estimate was 473.WineBourgogne Vézelay is the local wine appellation.
