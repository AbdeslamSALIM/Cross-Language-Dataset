He is considered one of the best fighters to never win a Grand Prix.Biography &amp; CareerJérôme Le Banner was born in the French city of Le Havre, in the région of Normandy. Le Banner started training judo at the age of 6. When he was 14, Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury influenced him so much that he started practicing karate instead, while trying to incorporate techniques of Jeet Kune Do he had seen in the film. Jeet Kune Do gave him southpaw stance, which he has maintained throughout his career, even though he is right-handed.At the age of 18, he debuted in his first Full Contact Kickboxing competitions. By 20 he held the ISKA French title and soon after that, he won the European belt against Stéphane Reveillon, and the Intercontinental belt in South Africa against Mike Bernardo.On March 3, 1995 Jerome Le Banner made his K-1 debut, winning five round decision over Nokveed Devy. Two months later, on May 4, 1995 he made his first K-1 World Grand Prix appearance in Tokyo, Japan, knocking out both Masaaki Satake and Mike Bernardo, before losing to Peter Aerts in tournament finals.On December 7, 2002 at K-1 World Grand Prix 2002, after defeating Musashi in the quarterfinals, and Mark Hunt in the semis, Le Banner faced three time World Champion Ernesto Hoost in the tournament final. Following an evenly fought first two rounds, Hoost shattered Le Banner's arm with three roundkicks in the third. Despite suffering near career ending injury, Le Banner was able to recover and returned to the ring six months later in K-1 Paris 2003, winning the fight by punch combinations over Belarusian Vitaly Akhramenko.On December 2, 2006, after his loss against Semmy Schilt at K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 finals, Le Banner announced his semi retirement from tournament fighting, restricting future appearances to K-1's Superfight events.In early 2007, after his fight at K-1 World GP 2007 in Yokohama he was forced to have a knee surgery and was not expected to return to the ring until 2008, however due to his another fast recovery K-1 announced that Le Banner will participate on September 29, 2007 at the K-1 World GP 2007 in Seoul Final 16 against Russian kickboxer Ruslan Karaev. Just two days before the fight, Karaev had to pull out and was replaced by a former Korean Taekwondo practitioner, Yong Soo Park. It took Le Banner only 0'54" seconds to knock out Park in the first round by straight punch and qualify himself for K-1 World GP 2007 Final held in December 8, 2007 held at the Yokohama Arena, Japan.On December 8, 2007, in his 9th K-1 World GP appearance of his career, Le Banner defeated Choi Hong Man in the quarter finals by unanimous decision before facing the reigning K-1 champion Semmy Schilt in semis. Le Banner finished the first round up on scorecards. In the beginning of the second round Schilt landed a lowkick that seemed to hurt Le Banner's right knee, which he had surgery on in early 2007. The fight was eventually stopped by Le Banner's corner throwing in the towel to avoid further damage to an injured knee.Titles2002 K-1 World Grand Prix Finalist2001 K-1 World Grand Prix in Osaka Champion2000 K-1 World Grand Prix in Nagoya Champion1999 K-1 World Grand Prix 3rd Place1996 I.S.K.A.
