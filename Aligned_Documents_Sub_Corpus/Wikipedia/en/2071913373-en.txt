Also known as "The Limousine Album" among the fans.Following the Eurovision success of "Waterloo", ABBA saw the band gaining worldwide recognition. "I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do" topped the charts in Australia, as did "Mamma Mia" shortly thereafter. The latter also did well in Europe, while "SOS" became a hit in both the U.S. and UK. ABBA was first released on CD in West Germany in 1987 (later released internationally), with five bonus tracks of songs from Waterloo and Ring Ring, which had not been released on CD at that time. ABBA was released on CD in Sweden in 1988 featuring the original 11 tracks only. The album has been reissued in digitally remastered form three times; first in 1997, then in 2001 and again in 2005 as part of The Complete Studio Recordings box set.Track listingSide A:"Mamma Mia" (Andersson, Stig Anderson, Ulvaeus) – 3:32"Hey, Hey Helen" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 3:17"Tropical Loveland" (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus) – 3:06"SOS" (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus) – 3:23"Man in the Middle" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 3:03"Bang-A-Boomerang" (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus) – 3:04Side B:"I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do" (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus) – 3:17"Rock Me" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 3:06"Intermezzo No. 1" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 3:48"I've Been Waiting for You" (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus) – 3:41"So Long" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 3:06(P)1974(10-11)/1975(1-9)Polar Music International ABCD re-issues, bonus tracksABBA was first released on CD in 1987 with five additional tracks from the albums Waterloo and Ring Ring: "Waterloo" (Andersson, Stig Anderson, Ulvaeus) - 2:44 "Hasta Mañana" (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus) - 3:09 "Honey, Honey (Andersson, Anderson, Ulvaeus)" – 2:55 "Ring Ring" (Andersson, Stig Anderson, Ulvaeus, Neil Sedaka, Phil Cody) – 3:06 "Nina, Pretty Ballerina" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 2:53 ABBA was remastered and reissued in 1997 two further bonus tracks: "Crazy World" (Andersson, Ulvaeus) – 3:48 "Medley: Pick a Bale of Cotton/On Top of Old Smokey/Midnight Special" (Trad.
