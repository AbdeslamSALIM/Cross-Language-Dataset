Nearby is the Mount Amariana (1,906&nbsp;m). The commune includes aso the five frazioni of Cadunea (Friulian: Cjadugnee), Caneva (Cjanive), Casanova (Cjasegnove), Fusea (Fusee), Illegio (Dieç), Imponzo (Dimponç).HistoryThe existence of Tolmezzo (called Tolmetium) is first documented in the late 1st millennium CE, when it was part of the Patriarchate of Aquileia, but it has been suggested that the town stemmed from a very ancient pre-Roman settlement. in Roman times the area was crossed by one of the main Roman roads connecting Italy to what is now Austria.The city had a flourishing market, and was defended by a line of walls with 18 towers and by the castle of the Patriarchs. In 1420 it was annexed to the Republic of Venice, but its trades and industries did not suffer from the change, and the city maintained its privileges. In 1797, with the Treaty of Campo Formio, it was handed over to the Austrian Empire, and, after a short Napoleonic rule, it was included in the client Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia.Tolmezzo became part of the the new unified Kingdom of Italy in 1866.Main sightsThe Duomo (cathedral)Palazzo Campeis (late 18th century)   Category:Cities and towns in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Category:Cathedrals in Italy)de:Tolmezzo es:Tolmezzo eo:Tolmezzo fr:Tolmezzo fur:Tumieç id:Tolmezzo it:Tolmezzo nl:Tolmezzo ja:トルメッツォ nap:Tolmezzo pl:Tolmezzo pt:Tolmezzo sl:Tolmeč vo:Tolmezzo
