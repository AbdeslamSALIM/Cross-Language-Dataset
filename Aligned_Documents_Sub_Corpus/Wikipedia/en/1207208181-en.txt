  Fantômas is a fictional arch-villain and master criminal by French writers Marcel Allain (1885–1970) and Pierre Souvestre (1874–1914).One of the most popular characters in the history of French crime fiction, Fantômas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. His importance in the history of crime fiction cannot be overestimated, as he represents a transition from Gothic novel villains of the 1800s, to modern-day serial killers.OverviewFantômas was introduced a few years after Arsène Lupin, another well-known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fantômas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion.He is totally ruthless, gives no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fantômas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested rats, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand.Fantômas's background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867.In the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fantômas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German Principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison.C. 1895, Fantômas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, Hélène, whose father might be Fantômas, or an Indian Prince who was Fantômas' acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa.In 1897, Fantômas was in the United States of America and Mexico. There, he ruined his then-business partner, Etienne Rambert.In 1899, he fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the Transvaal as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham.Upon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him.Fantômas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he convinced Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, truly obsessed with the capture of Fantômas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jerôme Fandor who is employed at the newspaper La Capitale. Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fantômas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fantômas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was guillotined in his place.Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910.Fandor fell in love with Hélène and, despite Fantômas repeated attempts to break them up, married her.Fantômas' evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir's girl-friend was murdered by Fantômas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.The booksBy Allain &amp; Souvestre1. Fantômas (1911; transl. 1915; retransl. 1986)2.

Le Faux Magistrat (1914)The silent film pioneer Louis Feuillade directed five Fantômas serials starring René Navarre as Fantômas, Bréon as Juve, Georges Melchior as Fandor and Renée Carl as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial Les Vampires, which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual vampires) is also reminiscent of the Fantômas series.There was a 1920 20-episode American Fantômas serial directed by Edward Sedgwick starring Edward Roseman as Fantômas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fantômas' nemesis is detective Fred Dixon played by John Willard. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title Les Exploits de Diabolos (The Exploits of Diabolos). A novelization of this serial is presently being written by David White for Black Coat Press under the title '' Fantômas in America''. http://www.blackcoatpress.com/fantomasus.htmOther films6.

Their tone was generally much more light-hearted than the novels' and the characters were updated in a James Bond-like style including James Bond type gadgets like the flying Citroën DS of Fantômas with retractable wings that converts to an airplane.10.

Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by Claude Chabrol; episodes 2 and 3 by Luis Buñuel's son, Juan Luis Buñuel.Comic booksFrenchFantômas contre les Nains. A weekly color page written by Marcel Allain and drawn by Santini was published in Gavroche Nos. 24-30, 1941. This series was interrupted because of censorship; a sequel, Fantômas et l'Enfer Sous-Marin was written but not published.A daily Fantômas strip drawn by Pierre Tabary was syndicated by Opera Mundi from November 1957 to March 1958 (192 strips in total), adapting the first two novels.Seventeen Fantômas fumetti magazines adapting Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the book series were published by Del Duca in 1962 and 1963.A new weekly, Fantômas color page, written by Agnès Guilloteau and drawn by Jacques Taillefer, was again syndicated by Opera Mundi in 1969 and published in Jours de France.Finally, a series of Fantômas graphic novels written by L. Dellisse and drawn by Claude Laverdure were published by Belgian publisher Claude Lefrancq: 1. L'Affaire Beltham (1990); 2. Juve contre Fantômas (1991) and 3. Le Mort qui Tue (1995).MexicanDuring the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a Fantomas La Amenaza Elegante (Fantomas, the Elegant Threat) comic book series that was popular throughout Latin America. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a heroic character, and with no acknowledgement to the original books or films. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission.This Fantomas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white, skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in this version which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal Diabolik, and his use of it seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by Mexican wrestling. Apparently the series was also influenced by the James Bond movies, as Fantomas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals.He also was a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, and had a secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several agents, including the 12 "Zodiac Girls", beautiful women who assisted him personally, known only by their codenames&mdash;the signs of the zodiac. Although cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985; a character revival by rival Grupo Editorial Vid in Mexico in the 1990s didn't last long), it is from this comic that the character is best known in both Central America and South America. For more information on this version of the character check the link to the Fantomas Lives website below.Cultural influenceThe Fantômas novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the surrealists. Blaise Cendrars called the series "the modern Aeneid"; Guillaume Apollinaire said that "from the imaginative standpoint Fantômas is one of the richest works that exist." The painter René Magritte and the surrealist poet and novelist Robert Desnos both produced works alluding to Fantômas.The movies were also very popular in the Soviet Union.In the Venture Bros. episode ORB, Fantômas is shown as one of the original members of the Guild of Calamitous Intent and ancestor to the character of Phantom Limb.Pastiches, homages, and related charactersFantômas may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor, Zigomar, the creation of Léon Sazie, which first appeared as a serial in Le Matin in 1909, then as a pulp magazine (28 issues) in 1913, and again in Zigomar contre Zigomar for eight more issues in 1924.In France alone, Fantômas spawned numerous imitators. Among those are Arnould Galopin's Tenebras, Gaston René's Masque Rouge, Arthur Bernède's Belphégor, R. Collard's Demonax and Marcel Allain's own Tigris, Fatala, Miss Teria and Ferocias. http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/marcelallain.htmA number of Italian super-villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by Fantômas. Among the most famous are Diabolik, Kriminal, Killing and Satanik.It has been suggested  that the original 1963 Pink Panther film starring David Niven and Peter Sellers was influenced by Fantômas. In the film, Fantômas was transformed into Sir Charles Lytton, a.k.a. the Phantom, and Inspector Juve became Inspector Clouseau.Paperinik, a superhero alter-ego of Donald Duck created by Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi in 1969, is partly based on Fantômas. His predecessor Fantomius was obviously also named after Fantômas. In France the character is known as Fantomiald.Fantômas inspired Julio Cortazar’s 1975 novella Fantomas contra los vampiros multinacionales.In 1999, Mike Patton named his rock group Fantômas after the fictional character.There is a Marvel Comics character named Fantomex, first appearing in August, 2002. He was created by Grant Morrison and Igor Kordey for the title New X-Men.In one of the back-story sections of the graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II, Fantômas is described as being a member of Les Hommes Mysterieux, the French counterpart of the League, alongside Arsène Lupin, the sky-pirate Robur, and the The Nyctalope http://www.comp.dit.ie/dgordon/League/OtherLeagues/1910s/1910Mysterieux.html. In the follow-up, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, the League's encounter with Les Hommes is halted once Fantômas detonates a bomb which destroys the Opera Garnier.In the French version of the extended Wold Newton universe, Jean-Marc Lofficier has theorized that Fantômas may be the son of Rocambole and his lover and enemy, Ellen Palmure. http://www.coolfrenchcomics.com/wnu0e.htm.The character of Spectrobert in Gahan Wilson's book Everybody's Favorite Duck is a direct parody of Fantômas.Fantômas makes a brief appearance in Kim Newman's novel The Bloody Red Baron.Fantômas is a partial inspiration for the character of Phantom Limb on the Adult Swim cartoon The Venture Bros - his last name in fact is Fantômas. A picture similar in appearance to the masked villain can be seen hanging on the wall of his office at State University in The Invisible Hand of Fate. It is implied that Phantom Limb may actually be a descendant of the famous criminal, or a character who was inspired by or inspired him. Fantômas himself briefly appears in the series during a flashback in the season 3 episode ORB.External linksFantômas Liveshttp://www.nwlink.com/~erick/fantomas/fant-1.htmlFrench Wold Newton Universe - FantômasPicture of the Fantômas Citroën DS with retractable wings that converts to an airplanehttp://www.premiumwanadoo.com/fantomasfr/EnCours.phpExternal linksRuben Lara, Fantômas graphic artist, Interview - Spanish Category:Series of booksCategory:Fictional murderers Category:French characters in written fiction Category:Characters in pulp fictionde:Fantômas es:Fantômas eo:Fantômas fr:Fantômas it:Fantômas nl:Fantômas pl:Fantomas ru:Фантомас sv:Fantômas
