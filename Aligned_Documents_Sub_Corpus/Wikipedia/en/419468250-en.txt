His high hopes were put on hold when he injured his wrist during a youth match, somewhat stunting his development. He was a regular in the Reserve team.He made his first team debut in February 2002 in a Scottish Cup match against Forfar Athletic and his SPL debut against Aberdeen. McGregor did not play a single minute of competitive football during 2002&amp;ndash;3, an unused substitute in every match of Rangers' Treble success. The following season, McGregor made six appearances, twice in the League cup and four times in the league.Loan spellsIn 2004&amp;ndash;5 McGregor was loaned to Scottish Football League club St Johnstone, making his his debut in a Challenge Cup match against Alloa Athletic.

However, manager Alex McLeish then signed Dutch keeper Ronald Waterreus&quot;Keeper Waterreus joins Rangers&quot; BBC Sport website (31 January 2005) on deadline day, a move which angered McGregor.&quot;McGregor anger at keeper signing&quot; BBC Sport website (2 February 2005)For the 2005-06 campaign McGregor was on loan to Dunfermline Athletic, making his Pars debut in a 3&ndash;2 league defeat to Kilmarnock. He played in the League Cup final defeat to Celtic&quot;Dunfermline add two more to squad&quot; (BBC Sport website (29 August 2005) and made a total of 31 appearances, keeping seven clean sheets.Rangers first teamWhen new Rangers manager, Frenchman Paul Le Guen, arrived McGregor was deemed surplus to requirements and was made available for transfer in August. McGregor's wage demands were enough to scare off his possible SPL suitors and he remained at Ibrox after the summer transfer window closed.A bizarre pre-season cycling injury to Klos&quot;Gers keeper injured while biking &quot; BBC Sport website (24 May 2006) saw McGregor start the 2006&amp;ndash;07 season as back-up to Lionel Letizi. When Letizi was also injured, McGregor started the next match for Rangers, a 2-2 draw away to Kilmarnock. He went on to produce some impressive performances and was awarded the Scottish Premier League player of the month for September and then rewarded with a new contract. This deal committed him to Ibrox until 2009.McGregor was dropped after Letizi returned from injury. This decision by Le Guen was to backfire as Letizi was at fault for the goal conceded in a 1-0 home defeat to Inverness Caledonian Thistle. This led to many fans calling for McGregor to be reinstated in goal, but Le Guen remained faithful to the French goalkeeper and Letizi continued to play in the subsequent matches, until suffering another injury during the warm-up of Rangers' UEFA Cup match against Maccabi Haifa. McGregor returned in goal and would remain there for the rest of the season.McGregor was sent off during Rangers' UEFA Cup match at Ibrox against Israeli side Hapoel Tel Aviv, which they won 4-0. After Barry Ferguson's second goal, Italian referee Matteo Trefoloni gave a straight red card to the goalkeeper, for headbutting Hapoel substitute Luciano de Bruno. The incident was not caught on television cameras, and McGregor denied headbutting de Bruno, and he was given a two-match ban, reduced to a one-game ban on appeal. At the end of his first season as Rangers number one, McGregor was voted by his team-mate as Rangers' Player's Player of the Year at an award ceremony.McGregor signed a four year contract with Rangers in September 2007. He continued to be Rangers first choice the following season, despite the arrival and subsequent departure of Roy Carroll.
