  Eagles of Death Metal (EoDM) is an American band formed by Jesse Hughes and Josh Homme. Despite the name, Eagles of Death Metal is not a death metal band. Hughes in an interview with a Polish rock magazine Teraz Rock told the story of the band's name. He said that his friend, Lou, was trying to make Josh Homme like death metal. When he played Vader, Homme called them "The Eagles of death metal." Later, Josh Homme inspired him to write music that he thought would be The Eagles crossed with death metal, and their debut album was the result. In a 2003 interview Homme described the sound of the band as a combination of "bluegrass slide guitar mixed with stripper drum beats and Canned Heat vocals." Jesse Hughes is known and somewhat loved by fans for his over-enthusiastic and charismatic interaction with audiences at live performances.BiographyEagles of Death Metal formed in Palm Desert, California in 1998 and first appeared on Josh Homme's The Desert Sessions Volumes 3 &amp; 4, released that year. Over the next few years, Homme became distracted from the band due to the success of Queens of the Stone Age. However, the band finally released their debut album on March 2004: Peace, Love, Death Metal.The album appeared to be a favorite of advertisers, as several songs from it were used in American television commercials including those for Ask.com, Comcast, Payless ShoeSource, Nissan Motors, Budweiser, Pontiac Motors, Wendys, as well as in the trailer for the film Thank You for Smoking and for a promotional disc for the film Grindhouse which was available prior to the film's release at Hot Topic stores.The first song on the album, "I Only Want You," was also used on the soundtrack for the PS2 game Gran Turismo 4. Globe Shoes, a manufacturer of skateboard shoes, has featured the song in the montage section of episode 1 in their new series of skate films entitled, United By Fate. Recently, the track "Chase the Devil" from the album Death by Sexy was included in the soundtrack for Tony Hawk's Project 8. Not only that, the track "Don't Speak (I Came to Make a Bang!)" was part of the soundtrack for Electronic Arts' Need for Speed: Carbon. Recently, "Cherry Cola" was used in a Microsoft Zune commercial, and "Don't Speak" was featured in Epic Movie, where the band is seen playing it live; in addition, the song was used in a Guy Ritchie-directed Nike ad ahead of Euro 2008.The band returned on April 11, 2006 with their second effort Death by Sexy. During the first half of 2006 they toured in support of The Strokes and headlined their own U.S. tour with openers The Giraffes followed by dates opening for Peaches and performed with Joan Jett. In the fall of 2006 the band had an opening support slot with Guns N' Roses. During the first concert with Guns N' Roses, in Cleveland, Ohio on November 24, 2006, the band was not well received by the crowd at all. When Axl Rose came out to perform, he asked the crowd if they enjoyed "the Pigeons of Shit Metal," and announced that the show would be their last with Guns N' Roses. Shortly thereafter the band released a statement regarding the incident:They took further stabs at Guns N' Roses, claiming that there was aggravation between Axl Rose and Tommy Stinson (the bassist of GN'R). Later they also claimed that Rose had invited the band back for the rest of their scheduled dates as support act. The band also received full payment for the entire tour despite playing only a single show with the band.Hughes has brought up during interviews that new material has been written and their third album will be released this year. Currently, their website states that the album will be released in 2008.In a recent Rolling Stone interview on rollingstone.com, Josh Homme has noted that the new album will be titled Heart On, as the new material had been written on their tour through the heartland, which is where they got their "heart-on."Their myspace has recently announced that Heart On will be relased October 28th, 2008 and will be accompanied by a North American tour.MembersMembersJesse Hughes AKA: The Devil / Boots Electric (vocals, guitar, percussion)Josh Homme AKA: Carlo Von Sexron / Baby Duck (drums, guitar, bass, keys)Current Live membersJesse Hughes AKA: The Devil / Boots Electric (guitar, vocals)Dave Catching AKA: Darlin' Dave (guitar)Brian O'Connor AKA: Big Hands (bass, vocals)Gene Trautmann AKA: Teen Dream (drums)Other contributors on albums and/or on tourJoey Castillo AKA: The Sexi Mexi (drums)Jack Black AKA: Blackjack Claude Coleman AKA: SugardickSamantha Maloney AKA: Hot Damn Sweet SamDave Grohl AKA: DiabloWendy Ray Fowler AKA: Wendy Ramone / Wendy Ray Moan (backing vocals on Death by Sexy)Official album credits for Death by SexyBrody DalleTaylor HawkinsNick OliveriTim VanhamelMark LaneganMatt McGrathTroy Van LeeuwenLiam LynchStefan Olsdal of Placebo played bass with them when the two bands toured together in 2003.DiscographyAlbumsPeace, Love, Death Metal (2004)Death by Sexy (2006) US #113Heart On (2008)Singles"I Only Want You" (2004) US #198 UK #87"Speaking In Tongues" (2004) US #232"I Want You So Hard (Boy's Bad News)" (2006) UK #73"I Gotta Feelin (Just Nineteen)" (2006)"Cherry Cola" (2006)DVDDVD by Sexy (2006)Other appearances"The Gosso King of Crater Lake", "Hogleg" and "You Keep Talkin'" on The Desert Sessions: Volumes 3 &amp; 4 (1998)"I Only Want You" in Gran Turismo 4"Don't Speak (I Came To Make A Bang!)" in Need for Speed: Carbon, Epic Movie(2007), Lost Boys: The Tribe (2008) and Nike's "Take it to the Next level" ad.Nikesoccer: Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Commercial directed by: Guy RitchieComplex Blog » Guy Ritchie’s Next Level Nike Soccer Ad&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;"Speaking In Tongues" (Supernatural: Episode 1x01 - Pilot)(2005)Ask.com Commercial"Stuck In The Metal" in a Wendy's Commercial"Chase the Devil" in Tony Hawk's Project 8They made a cameo in Epic Movie as Aslo's Camp BandReferencesExternal linksOfficial siteLive photos from their show in Italy - February 21st 2007Live photos from their show at Pukkelpop '06 Inked Magazine Feature on Eagles of Death MetalCategory:2000s music groups Category:American rock music groups Category:California musical groupscs:Eagles of Death Metal de:Eagles of Death Metal es:Eagles of Death Metal fr:Eagles of Death Metal gl:Eagles of Death Metal is:Eagles of Death Metal it:Eagles of Death Metal nl:Eagles of Death Metal pl:Eagles of Death Metal pt:Eagles of Death Metal sk:Eagles of Death Metal fi:Eagles of Death Metal sv:Eagles of Death Metal
