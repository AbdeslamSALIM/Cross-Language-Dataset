 Plantago media, known as the hoary plantain, is a species of genus Plantago native to central Europe and introduced to parts of the north-east United States. Its generic name is derived from the Latin for sole; like other members of Plantago, it should not be confused with the plantain, a starchy banana.DescriptionPlantago media grows in damp grassy meadows up to an altitude of 2000 m. A slender stalk of between 5 to 50 cm develops from a basal rosette of finely-haired leaves. Delicate pink-white flowers are borne between May and September. P. media is hermaphrodite and is pollinated by wind or insects, particularly bees.The plant is edible and has long maintained a reputation for medicinal effects as an astringent for treating wounds; in antiquity it was employed against toothache and eye infections. Archeological finds testify to its use during the Roman era in Britain. The seeds are a laxative.References category:Plantaginaceae category:Medicinal plants Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Estonia Category:Flora of the United Kingdomar:لسان الحمل الصغير da:Dunet Vejbred de:Mittlerer Wegerich es:Plantago media fr:Plantain intermédiaire hsb:Wowči jazyčk lt:Plaukuotasis gyslotis nl:Ruige weegbree pl:Babka średnia sr:Средња боквица
