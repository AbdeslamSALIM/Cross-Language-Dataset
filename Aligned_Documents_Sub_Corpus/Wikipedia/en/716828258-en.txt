  Mdina, Imdina, Città Vecchia, or Città Notabile, (English: Notabile, or Medina)http://www.geody.com/geospot.php?world=terra&amp;map=col&amp;ufi=-18857&amp;alc=mdn is the old capital of Malta. It is a medieval town, with narrow quiet streets, situated in the centre of the island. It is also known as the "Silent City". It commands a magnificent view of the island.HistoryEvidence for settlement in Mdina goes back to over 4000 BC. It was possibly first fortified by the Phoenicians around 700 BC, probably because of its strategic location on one of the highest points on the island and as far from the sea as possible but owes its present architecture to the Arab period, from 870 until the Normans conquered Malta in 1091. The Arabs also gave it its present day name. They surrounded the city with thick defensive fortificationss and a wide moat, separating it from its nearest town, Rabat. When Malta had earlier been under control of the Roman Empire, the Roman Governor built his palace there. Legend has it that it was here, in around 60 CE, that the Apostle St. Paul lived after being shipwrecked on the islands.A strong earthquake in 1693 destroyed a large number of buildings in Mdina. After the earthquake the cathedral was rebuilt on the designs of the Maltese architect Lorenzo Gafa.PresentToday, no cars (other than those of a limited number of residents, emergency vehicles, wedding cars and hearses) are allowed in Mdina and there is a calming atmosphere as one walks along its narrow streets and ways. The city displays an unusual mix of Norman and Baroque architecture, including several palaces, most of which serve as private homes. The cathedral is worth visiting and is fronted by a large square.Places of interest]]St. Paul's Cathedral, MdinaVilhena PalacePalazzo Falson (Norman House)St. Agatha's ChapelSt. Nicholas' ChapelNatural History MuseumMdina DungeonsCarmelite Church & ConventMdina ExperienceBenedictine MonasteryBastion SquareSportsFounded in 2006, the Mdina Knights are currently enjoying a positive moment in the third division league organised by Malta's football governing body, the Malta Football Association.Mdina Main RoadsMisraħ il-Kunsill Ċittà Notabile (Notabile City Council Square)Pjazza San Pawl (St Paul Square)Pjazza San Publiju (St Publius Square)Pjazza ta' l-Arċisqof (Archbishop Square)Pjazza Tas-Sur (Bastion Square)Pjazzetta Beata Marija Adeodata Pisani (Blessed Maria Adeodata Pisani Square)Triq Inguanez (Inguanez Street)Triq is-Sur (Bastion Street)Triq San Pawl (St Paul Street)Triq Santu Rokku (St Roch Street)Triq Villegaignon (Villegaignon Street)Popular cultureIn White Wolf's World of Darkness, Mdina is the European capital of clan Lasombra.External linksSelf Guided ToursMdina for TouristsMdina - GuidetoMalta.netA local's Guide to Mdina - 101malta.comA Map of Attractions in Mdina - 101malta.comPhoto Gallery Image:Mdina002.jpg|Defensive walls of the city Image:Mdina007.jpg|View of Mdina from neighbouring town Rabat Image:Mdina003.jpg|Mdina Gate, the city's main entrance Image:Malta-Mdina-Gate.jpg|Mdina Gate, the city's main entrance Image:Mdinakathedraal.jpg|The Cathedral of St. Paul in the centre of Mdina Image:Malta-Mdina-Cathedral-Detail.jpg|Cathedral's interior Image:Mdina004.jpg|Palazzo Falzon (Norman House) Image:Mdina005.jpg|Typical narrow medieval street Image:Malta 05 Mdina door.jpg|Typical Maltese door in Mdina Image:Mdina006.jpg|Canon inscription    Coordinates:   Category:Towns in Maltacs:Mdina cy:Mdina a Rabat (Malta) de:Mdina es:Mdina fr:Mdina it:Medina (Malta) he:מדינה (מלטה) la:Urbs Notabilis lt:Mdina mt:Mdina nl:Mdina ja:イムディーナ pms:Mdina pl:Mdina pt:Mdina ru:Мдина scn:Mdina fi:Mdina sv:Mdina
