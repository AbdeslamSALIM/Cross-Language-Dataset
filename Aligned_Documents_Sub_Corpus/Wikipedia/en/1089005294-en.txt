 Central European Time (CET) is one of the names of the time zone that is 1&nbsp;hour ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. It is used in most European and some North African countries.Its time offset is normally UTC+1. During daylight saving time, Central European Summer Time (CEST) is used instead (UTC+2). The current time offset is UTC+.UsageCentral European Time usage in EuropeThe following countries and territories use Central European Time during the winter only, between 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of October and 1:00 UTC on the last Sunday of March:Albania, regularly since 1974Andorra, regularly since 1985Austria, regularly since 1980Belgium, regularly since 1980Bosnia and Herzegovina, regularly since 1983Croatia, regularly since 1983Czech Republic, regularly since 1979Denmark (metropolitan), regularly since 1980France (metropolitan), regularly since 1976Germany, regularly since 1980Gibraltar, regularly since 1982Hungary, regularly since 1980Italy, regularly since 1966LiechtensteinLuxembourg, regularly since 1977Macedonia, regularly since 1983Malta, regularly since 1974Monaco, regularly since 1976Montenegro, regularly since 1983Netherlands (metropolitan), regularly since 1977Norway, regularly since 1980Poland, regularly since 1977San Marino, regularly since 1966Serbia, regularly since 1983Slovakia, regularly since 1979Slovenia, regularly since 1983Spain (except Canary Islands), regularly since 1974Sweden, regularly since 1980Switzerland, regularly since 1981Tunisia, since 2005Vatican, regularly since 1966Before World War II, Lithuania used CET (MET) in the years 1920–40. During the war Germany implemented this time in all occupied territories. In France, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg CET was kept. After the war Monaco, Spain, Andorra and Gibraltar implemented CET.Ireland and the United Kingdom experimentally adopted CET in the years 1968–71; however, this experiment proved unpopular and short-lived, mainly due to the increased number of road accidents (many involving children walking to school) in the dark winter mornings. Portugal used CET in the years 1966–76 and 1992–96.Central European Time usage in AfricaThese African countries use Central European Time (see West Africa Time) throughout the year:AlgeriaAngolaBeninCameroonCentral African RepublicChadDemocratic Republic of the Congo (western part)Republic of the CongoEquatorial GuineaGabonNigerNigeriaNamibia uses UTC+1 between March and October and in the rest of the year observes daylight saving time (UTC+2)AnomaliesSince political, in addition to purely geographical, criteria are used in the drawing of time zones, it follows that actual time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines. The CET (UTC+1) time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 7°30′ E and 22°30′ E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a "physical" UTC+1 time, actually use another time zone (UTC+2 in particular – there are no "physical" UTC+1 areas that employ UTC); contrariwise, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+1, even though their "physical" time zone is UTC (typically), UTC-1 (westernmost Spain), or UTC+2 (e.g. the very easternmost parts of Norway, Poland, and Serbia). Following is a list of such "incongruencies":Gibraltar maintained UTC+1 all year until the opening of the land frontier with Spain in 1982 when it followed its neighbour and introduced CEST.Areas that use UTC+1Countries (or parts thereof) west of 7°30′ W (&quot;physical&quot; UTC-1) that use UTC+1 The westernmost part of Spain (Galicia, e.g. the city of A Coruña); Cape Finisterre in Galicia, at 9°16′ W, is the westernmost place where CET is applied Countries (or parts thereof) between 7°30′ W and 7°30′ E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC) that use UTC+1 Andorra Belgium France, except for the absolutely easternmost part, in Alsace, incl. Strasbourg, and except for Corsica The very westernmost part of Germany, incl. the cities of Saarbrücken, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Aachen, and Trier The absolutely westernmost part of Italy, incl. the cities of Aosta in Aosta Valley and Cuneo in Piedmont Luxembourg Monaco Netherlands The westernmost part of Norway, incl. the cities of Bergen and Stavanger Spain, except for the westernmost part (see above) The part of Switzerland west of Bern (inclusive), also incl. cities such as Geneva, Lausanne, and Fribourg Countries (or parts thereof) east of 22°30′ E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+2) that use UTC+1 The easternmost part of the Republic of Macedonia, including the city of Strumica The easternmost part of Serbia, in the Pirot District, including the city of Pirot The easternmost tips of Hungary and Slovakia, bordering to the north and south respectively the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), a bit to the east of Vásárosnamény, Hungary – Uzhhorod, Ukraine (both at 22°18′ E) line The easternmost part of Poland, including the cities of Lublin and Białystok The northeast of Sweden, in the Norrbotten province, including the cities of Kalix and Haparanda The northeast of Norway, lying north of Finland, roughly coinciding with the county of Finnmark; for instance Vadsø, the capital of Finnmark, has a longitude of 23°49′ E. Actually, the easternmost town in Norway, Vardø, lies at 30°51′ E, which is so far east, so as to be east even of the central meridian of EET (UTC+2), i.e. east of Istanbul and Alexandria. The sun reaches its highest point at 10:56 (when not DST).It is also interesting to note that the Norwegian-Russian border (incl. border passings such as Kirkenes) is the only place where CET (UTC+1) borders Moscow time (UTC+3), resulting in a two hours time change for the passenger crossing that border. More so, there exists a "tri-zone" point (where UTC+1, UTC+2, and UTC+3 meet) at the Norway-Finland-Russia tripoint (look for the town of Nautsi in this map). This is the only "tri-zone" point within Europe. It is interesting to perform the following mental experiment when looking at this map: Go to the westernmost point of the red area (the Jäniskoski-Niskakoski area); this belongs to Russian jurisdiction, hence the time there is UTC+3. Then, take a northeastern (NE) direction (that is an eastwards direction); you will soon be crossing into Finnish territory, thus moving to the UTC+2 time zone. Continuing in that direction, you will eventually reach the Finland-Norway border and enter Norway, thus passing into the UTC+1 time zone. So, moving in a (north–)easterly direction, you will be moving from UTC+3 to UTC+2 to UTC+1! A note for time zone tourists: If you need a visa to enter Russia it is illegal to cross the border outside border controls.Areas geographically located within UTC+1 longitudesCountries (or parts thereof) west of 22°30′ E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+1) that use UTC+2 The westernmost part of Greece, including the cities of Patras, Ioannina and the island of Corfu The westernmost parts of the Bulgarian provinces of Vidin and Kyustendil The westernmost part of Romania, including most of the area of the counties of Caraş-Severin, Timiş (capital Timişoara), Arad, and Bihor, as well as the westernmost tips of the counties of Mehedinţi and Satu Mare The westernmost tip of Ukraine, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia, at the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), essentially comprising the city of Uzhhorod and its environs. (Although CET is used as local, non-official time in Transcarpathia).
