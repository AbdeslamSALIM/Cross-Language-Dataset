birth name: Sobekhotep (Amenemhat)throne name: Sekhemre KhutawySobekhotep II was an Egyptian king of the 13th Dynasty.He is known from several monuments, including a statue, several Nile level records in Nubia and from building works at Madamud and Luxor. The Nile level records provide a year date 'four', showing that he reigned at least three years.The Papyrus Boulaq 18, an administrative document of the Theban palace dates under this king and names the 'king's wife' Ay, the vizier Ankhu and other officials.There is some dispute in Egyptology over the position of this king in the 13th Dynasty. The throne name Sekhemre Khutawyre appears in the Turin King List as 19th king of the 13th Dynasty. However, the Nile level records and his appearance on a papyrus found at Lahun indicate, that he might date to the early 13th Dynasty. In both monument types so far only kings of the late 12th and early 13th Dynasty are mentioned.In the Turin King List appears as first king Khutawyre and it is therefore possible that the writer of the list confused Khutawyre with Sekhemre Khutawy (compare: Wegaf).See alsoList of PharaohsReferencesK.S.B.
