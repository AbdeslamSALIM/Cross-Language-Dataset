Part of the county's territory was given to Plumas County in 1854 and to Tehama County in 1856.Its name is derived from the Marysville or Sutter Buttes, which lay within the boundaries when it was created. The word butte is derived from the Teutonic word meaning "a blunt extension or elevation." In the French language, it signifies "a small hill or mound of earth detached from any mountain range." Butte is the only California County whose name is a French word. There is also Butte Creek which flows through Butte County, and has buttes.On June 21, 1879, Black Bart robbed a stagecoach going from La Porte, California to Oroville, California.In mid-June 2008, Butte was one of two California counties to announce that county officials would stop performing civil marriage ceremonies, but will continue issuing marriage licenses as required by law.

The San Francisco Chronicle noted that the other county, Kern County, made a similar announcement after lawyers told Kern County Clerk Ann Barnett she could not refuse to marry same-sex couples.Lagos, Marisa.
