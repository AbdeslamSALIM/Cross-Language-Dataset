 ntupdate = [[October 17]] [[2007]] |Cristiano Lucarelli (born October 4, 1975 in Livorno) is an Italian footballer who plays as forward for Italian Serie B club Parma F.C.Club careerA journeyman striker, Lucarelli had stints with eight different teams (including a brief run in Spain before signing with hometown A.S. Livorno Calcio in 2003. While playing for Torino F.C. the previous season, he attended a match that saw Livorno emerge victorious and earn promotion to Serie B, and he was among a throng of fans who rushed the pitch afterwards in celebration. He made an immediate impact in Livorno's return to Serie A in the 2003-04 season, scoring 29 goals in 38 matches and instantly winning a space in the hearts of Amaranto fans. He won the Golden Boot Award as Serie A's top goalscorer the following season, with 24 in 35 matches as Livorno finished in eighth place.A rarity in the football world in terms of club loyalty, he rejected several better-paying offers from other Italian and European clubs (among them a €3 million offer from FC Zenit Saint Petersburg in July 2006) to remain with Livorno. He was once quoted as saying, "Some football players pay a billion for a Ferrari or a yacht; with that money I bought myself Livorno’s shirt. That’s all."He scored his 100th Serie A goal as part of a hat-trick in a 4-1 defeat of Catania on April 1, 2007.Unfortunately, Lucarelli's seemingly perfect relationship with the team soured after a conflict with club president Aldo Spinelli arose over the firing of coach Daniele Arrigoni in March 2007, during which he openly stated his desire to leave. It became permanently damaged a month later, when Lucarelli received a frosty reception from supporters after a sluggish 1-1 home draw with Reggina, with many fans going as far as to accuse Livorno of match-fixing. Lucarelli, hurt by the fans' criticism, reiterated his plans to leave Livorno at the end of the season.In May, he was quick to snuff out rumors of a move to Serie A rivals ACF Fiorentina, and continued to remain ambiguous about his future with Livorno, claiming that he would make a decision on June 6; five days later, Lucarelli announced that he would be staying home for next season due to a lack of offers from other teams, despite fresh rumors about Palermo, Parma and Sampdoria being interested in his services.However, on July 13, Lucarelli agreed to join Shakhtar Donetsk for £6 million, signing a three-year contract worth £2.8 million a season, thus becoming the first Italian to play in Ukraine. The news resulted in a flood of negative responses from fans on his official website. He replied to the furor at a press conference, “I am going, but I didn’t hold a gun to anyone’s head...Shakhtar signed me for a figure that was below the buy-out clause of my contract. That means the club made its considerations and thought that £6m was good for a player going on 32.”Lucarelli scored his first European goal for Shakhtar in their 2-0 group stage win over Celtic FC on September 18, 2007.On January 15, 2008, Lucarelli was sold to Parma F.C. for ₤4 million, and he signed a three-and-a-half year, ₤1.2 million contract.Passion and controversyLucarelli's passion for his home club often resulted in many questionable incidents. The May 2005 issue of Calcio Italia magazine reported that he had paid for a bus that brought a cadre of traveling Livorno fans back to the city after they had been arrested for rioting. He has the A.S. Livorno logo tattooed on his left forearm, and his jersey number, 99, was an homage to left-wing ultras group Brigate Autonome Livornesi, which was founded in 1999.He was also of an increasingly rare breed of Italian footballer who openly brought his politics onto the pitch; his goal celebration consisted of a dual clenched-fist salute, a gesture made famous by the Communist party. He has openly admitted that he, like most of Livorno's fanbase, is a supporter of communism. One of his cell phone ringtones was The Red Flag, and he once gregariously declared, “We Livorno get no favors from the referees because we are Communists!” but later retracted this statement.He is a staunch admirer of Che Guevara, whose face is frequently displayed on Livorno fans' banners and T-shirts during matches. This first came to the fore in 1997, when, after scoring for Italy's Under-21 side, he celebrated by pulling his jersey over his face to reveal a shirt bearing the revolutionary's image. Despite his insisting that it was not a political gesture, he was consequently blackballed from the national team for several years until Marcello Lippi called him up as a starter for a friendly in 2005.Lucarelli met Guevara's daughter, Aleida Guevara, after the 2004-05 Serie A season; one subject of discussion was the possibility of Livorno travelling to Cuba to play a charity match, but it never came to fruition.International careerLucarelli has been capped six times for the Italy senior squad. His aforementioned debut was during a 2005 friendly tournament in the United States and Canada, where he scored his first national goal in a 1-1 draw against Serbia and Montenegro at the Rogers Centre in Toronto. He was left off the Italy roster for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but was recalled by new coach Roberto Donadoni - who had briefly coached Lucarelli at Livorno earlier in the year - for a friendly against Croatia on August 16, 2006.Due to a rash of injuries among the Azzurri, Lucarelli was summoned for a pair of June Euro 2008 qualifiers against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. He came on as a substitute for Filippo Inzaghi in the 58th minute of Italy's narrow 2-1 victory over the Faroes on June 2, but did not play in a 2-0 defeat of Lithuania on June 6. Lucarelli also substituted for Inzaghi in the 65th minute of a Euro 2008 qualifying match versus France on September 8, 2007. He scored his first brace in Italy's 2-0 friendly win over South Africa on October 17th.TriviaHis younger brother, Alessandro, is currently playing for Parma F.C. also. The brothers were Livorno teammates before, during the 04-05 campaign.ReferencesCristiano Lucarelli: Striking for Che - Football Italia, 2/06Lucarelli to leave Livorno - Sky Sports, 4/15/07Di Canio vs. Lucarelli: An Ideological Battle Seen in Salutes - Culture of Soccer, 5/1/07Lucarelli denies Viola claim - Sky Sports, 5/8/07Lucarelli: It's about time... - Sky Sports, 5/29/07Lucarelli staying at home - Football Italia, 6/12/07title=Il trasferimento di Cristiano Lucarelli - livornocalcio.it, 7/13/07 (in Italian)Lucarelli: I'm no traitor - Football Italia, 7/14/07Lucarelli makes Shakhtar vow - UEFA, 8/20/07Bomber italiani.... addio... - Realsoccer.it, 7/18/07 Lucarelli keeps his cool - Football Italia, 10/17/07Parma seal Lucarelli deal - Football Italia, 1/15/08External linksOfficial Site (in Italian)99 Amaranto: a documentary about Lucarelli (in Italian and English)Coverage of Lucarelli's participation at an University College London Seminar in May 2007    Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristiano Lucarelli, Cristianoar:كريستيانو لوكاريلي ca:Cristiano Lucarelli da:Cristiano Lucarelli de:Cristiano Lucarelli es:Cristiano Lucarelli fr:Cristiano Lucarelli id:Cristiano Lucarelli it:Cristiano Lucarelli hu:Cristiano Lucarelli nl:Cristiano Lucarelli ja:クリスティアーノ・ルカレッリ no:Cristiano Lucarelli pl:Cristiano Lucarelli pt:Cristiano Lucarelli ru:Лукарелли, Кристиано fi:Cristiano Lucarelli sv:Cristiano Lucarelli uk:Лукареллі Крістіано zh:基斯坦奴·盧卡利尼
