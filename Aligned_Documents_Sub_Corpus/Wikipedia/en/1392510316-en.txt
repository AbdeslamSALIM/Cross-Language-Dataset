Despite his youth, he quickly became an essential part of the Boca Juniors' midfield, and is considered a quality player, often compared with fellow countryman Fernando Redondo. His solid performance attracted Spanish powerhouses Real Madrid  , and FC Barcelona  .Real MadridOn Wednesday, November 15 2006, Real Madrid President Ramón Calderón confirmed the signings of Gago as well as compatriot Gonzalo Higuaín, and puts through a policy of signing younger players to gradually replace the older stars in the squad. However, news later put reports of Higuaín's departure to Real Madrid to rest as River Plate rejected a 10 million euro bid for the striker stating they would prefer him remain until at least June 2007. During the 2006 South American transfer saga, Gago's name was also linked with AC Milan. However, Ariedo Braida, Milan's top transfer guru was quoted as saying, "They (Gago and Higuaín) only want to go to Real Madrid". The transfer was finally agreed on December 19 2006 for 20,400,000 euro.Gago made his debut for Real Madrid in the 2-0 La Liga defeat against Deportivo La Coruna on January 7, 2007.  This promised to be an exciting start for the extremely talented midfielder, however due to the poor performance of the entire Real Madrid outfit, Gago's apparent talent was not withstanding, and, after being at fault for the opening goal by breaking from the rest of the defensive wall at a free-kick, he was substituted for Ronaldo  . However, a week later, against Real Zaragoza at Santiago Bernabeu, Gago's performance lifted along with that of his team mates. His defensive game picked up considerably as he fought hard in midfield, while also demonstrating vision by delivering several through balls to the attackers. Real Madrid defeated Real Zaragoza 1-0  , with a goal from Ruud van Nistelrooy, created by fellow new signing Gonzalo Higuaín.On May 20 2007, With the score tied at 2-2 against Recreativo, Real Madrid looked set to return the lead back to rivals Barcelona until Fernando Gago gave a last minute assist to Roberto Carlos who scored at the end of the match and the squad left Huelva with just three "finals" left to play. Real managed to beat Recreativo 3-2 at the Nuevo Colombino and went on to win the league that year as well.In his second season at the club, Gago displayed his true ability with a series of top class performances in the centre of Madrid's La Liga winning midfield. He managed to claim a first team spot in place of Mahamadou Diarra and was a key figure in the clubs second successive league title.Club career statistics(correct as of 1 June, 2008)ClubSeasonLeagueCupEuropeOtherTotalAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsAppsGoalsAssistsBoca Juniors2004-052000000000002002005-06310000000000031002006-0737100000000003710Total7010Real Madrid2006-07130120020000017012007–0831034016001004204Total5905Career Total12915Personal lifeGago, Sergio Agüero and Lionel Messi had all been teammates as children back in ArgentinaReal Madrid C.F.
