Albertaceratops (meaning "Alberta horned face") was a genus of centrosaurine horned dinosaur from the middle Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Oldman Formation of Alberta, Canada, and Judith River Formation of Montana, USA.  It is known from a single complete skull (TMP.2001.26.1) found in August 2001 and skull and postcranial fragments. This genus is unusual in combining long brow horns with an otherwise centrosaurine skull, as centrosaurines normally possess short brow horns. Over its nose was a bony ridge, and on its frill were two large outwardly-projecting hooks. A phylogenetic analysis carried out by its describer, Michael J. Ryan, found it to be the most basal centrosaurine.Ryan, M.J. (2007). A new basal centrosaurine ceratopsid from the Oldman Formation, southeastern Alberta. Journal of Paleontology 81(2):376-396. Michael Ryan currently works at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History in Cleveland, OH.Before it was officially published, it was known as "Medusaceratops" (meaning "Medusa horn face"), a name that came out of Ryan's 2003 dissertation. The dinosaur's current species' name, A. nesmoi, is derived from the name of Cecil Nesmo, a rancher living in Manyberries, Alberta, a town of less than 100 people located 71 km south of Medicine Hat. The rancher was thus honored in recognition of his efforts to aid fossil hunters.ReferencesExternal linksDrawing of the skull, by Julius T.
