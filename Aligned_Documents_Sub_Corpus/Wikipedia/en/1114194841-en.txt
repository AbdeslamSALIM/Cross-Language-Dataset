  at Helsinki (2007)]]  at Belgrade (2008)]] Although geographically not in Europe, Israel is allowed to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest as a member of the EBU and did so for the first time in 1973.To date there have been three Israeli victories in the contest. Izhar Cohen and Alphabeta won in Paris in 1978 with the uptempo A-Ba-Ni-Bi. On home ground in Jerusalem the following year, Israel won again, this time with the anthemic Hallelujah performed by Gali Atari & Milk and Honey. Unusually Israel did not defend the title in 1980 (see below). The third and possibly most controversial victory came in Birmingham in 1998. Transsexual Dana International took top honours with the song Diva, angering many people at home.Apart from the victories, Israeli entries have had a mixed reception at the contest. Avi Toledano (1982) and Ofra Haza (1983) scored well with big revivalist numbers but by 1986 this all singing, all dancing style was starting to wear thin. Attempts to do something different such as with Rita's sensuous ballad in 1990 or Ping-Pong's disco effort (2000) failed badly. Ping-Pong, however, were noted for their largely optimistic lyrics and message of reconciliation and peace in Western Asia. They went as far as waving Syrian flags at the end of their performance, angering many Israelis.Shiri Maymon's performance in Kiev (2005) brought Israel back to the top five and ensured a place in the Athens 2006 final. In Eurovision 2006 Israel was represented by singer Eddie Butler with the song "Together We Are One", only to finish 23rd with 4 points. IBA's Eurovision committee chose the band Teapacks to represent Israel in the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest Semi-Final in Helsinki, who finished in 24th place out of a field of 28 and failing to reach the final. Israel had to, once again, compete in the semi final in Belgrade 2008, from which they passed on to the final once again.Israel earliest selections were picked by the Israel Broadcasting Authority. Critique evolved after Ilanit was sent twice, culminating in a rule that the winner of the already established Hebrew Song and Chorus Festival would also present Israel at Eurovision. The Eurovision Song Contest winners of 1978 and 1979 were selected by this method.In 1980, however, the winner of song and choral festival, a band called Ha'akhim ve ha'akhiyot with the song "Pizmon Chozer", did not attend the Song Contest: After winning the contest in 1978 and 1979, the IBA was unable to organise the event for the second time in a row. The organization of the festival was subsequently handed over to The Netherlands. Because much time had already passed, it turned out to be difficult to find a suitable date for the Song Contest. In the end a date was chosen that coincided with a memorial day in Israel and the country was forced to withdraw. This made Israel the only country to date that hasn't been able to defend its title.ContestantsYearArtistTitleFinalScoreSemiScore1973IlanitEy Sham (אי שם)4971974]]KaveretNatati La Khayay (נתתי לה חיי)7111975]]Shlomo ArtziAt Va'Ani (את ואני)11401976]]Shokolad Menta MastikEmor Shalom (אמור שלום)6771977]]IlanitAhava Hi Shir Lishnayim(אהבה היא שיר לשניים)11491978]]the Alphabeta]]A-Ba-Ni-Bi (א-ב-ני-בי)11571979]]Milk and Honey]]Hallelujah]] (הללויה)11251981]]Hakol Over HabibiHalayla (הלילה)7561982]]Avi ToledanoHora]] (הורה)21001983]]Ofra HazaKhay (חי)21361985]]Izhar CohenOlé, Olé (עולה, עולה)5931986]]Moti Giladi &amp; Sarai TzurielYavo Yom (יבוא יום)1971987]]Datner &amp; KushnirShir Habatlanim (שיר הבטלנים)8731988]]Yardena AraziBen Adam (בן אדם)7851989]]Gili &amp; GalitDerekh Hamelekh (דרך המלך)12501990]]Rita]]Shara Barkhovot (שרה ברחובות)18161991]]Duo DatzKan]] (כאן)31391992]]Dafna DekelZe Rak Sport (זה רק ספורט)6851993]]Sarah'le Sharon & The Shiru GroupShiru (שירו)2441995]]LioraAmen]] (אמן)8811998]]Dana InternationalDiva]] (דיווה)11721999]]Eden]]Yom Huledet (Happy Birthday)(יום הולדת)5932000]]PingPong]]Sameyakh]] (שמייח)2272001]]Tal SondakEn Davar (אין דבר)16252002]]Sarit HadadNadlik Beyakhad Ner (Light A Candle)(נדליק ביחד נר)12372003]]Lior NarkisMilim La'Ahava (Words For Love)(מילים לאהבה)19172004]]David D'OrLeha'amin (להאמין)XX11572005]]Shiri MaimonHasheket Shenish'ar (השקט שנשאר)415471582006]]Eddie Butler]]Together We Are One]]234XX2007]]TeapacksPush The Button]]XX24172008]]Boaz]]The Fire In Your Eyes91245104Voting history (1975-2008)Israel has given the most points to...RankCountryPoints1UK1332FRA1073NED1034ESP925SWE91Israel has received the most points from...RankCountryPoints1FRA1412SUI1213FIN1154POR1135GER106NOTE: The totals in the above tables include only points awarded in Eurovision finals, and not the semi-finals since 2004.HostingsYearLocationVenuePresenter1979]]Israel JerusalemInternational Convention Center]]Yardena Arazi, Daniel Pe'er1999]]Israel JerusalemInternational Convention Center]]Dafna Dekel, Sigal Shachamon, Yigal Ravid Eurovision Song Contest Category:Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contestda:Israel i Eurovision Song Contest de:Israel beim Eurovision Song Contest el:Συμμετοχή του Ισραήλ στη Eurovision es:Israel en el Festival de la Canción de Eurovisión fr:Israël au Concours Eurovision de la chanson it:Israele e l'Eurofestival he:ישראל באירוויזיון nl:Israël en het Eurovisie Songfestival pl:Izrael w Konkursie Piosenki Eurowizji ru:Израиль на конкурсе песни Евровидение fi:Israel Eurovision laulukilpailussa tr:Eurovision'da İsrail
