(2004)]] Volare S.p.A., operating as volareweb.com, is a low-fares airline based in Italy.HistoryAt one time the airline operated flights from Italy to Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, Estonia and Romania. In addition to these routes, Volare operated frequently to London Luton Airport. The airline suspended its operations in November 2004 and filed for bankruptcy. Since then, the airline has come out of bankruptcy and, for a period, it was flying only Italian domestic routes. As of May 2008, Volare flies to 20 destinations across Italy and Europe. Volare's charter and leisure subsidiary Air Europe flies to other long-haul international destinations.New OwnersAfter bankruptcy, the Volare Group was put up for sale by the Italian Government in December 2006. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid yet, however, Air One tried to block the sale by going to court. Air One was unsuccessful but Alitalia had to create Volare SpA in order to takeover Volare Group. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).In Italy, the sale of Volare is considered a soap-opera due to the multiple obstacles placed on the sale of the airline to Alitalia.As of 1 January 2008, Volareweb is an integral part of the Alitalia Group and will serve as the company's Italian low-cost subsidiary. Furthermore, due to Alitalia's hub switch from Milan-Malpensa to Rome-Fiumicino, several flights from Malpensa have been discontinued (such as Kraków and Timişoara) and have been transferred to Volare.DestinationsVolare Airlines flies to the following airports from its hub at Malpensa (at September 2008):Paris (Orly Airport)Athens (Athens International Airport)Alghero (Fertilia Airport)Brindisi (Brindisi Airport)Cagliari (Cagliari-Elmas Airport)Catania (Catania-Fontanarossa Airport)Lamezia Terme (Lamezia Terme International Airport)Milan (Malpensa International Airport) HubPescara (Abruzzo International Airport)Venice (Venice Marco Polo Airport)Luqa (Malta International Airport)Oslo (Oslo Gardermoen Airport)Kraków (John Paul II International Airport)Łódź (Władysław Reymont Airport)Warsaw (Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport)Wrocław (Copernicus Airport)Porto (Francisco de Sá Carneiro Airport)Timişoara (Traian Vuia International Airport)Málaga (Malaga Airport)Valencia (Valencia International Airport)FleetThe Volare Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of July 2008):+ Volare Airlines FleetAircraftTotalRegistrationsNotesAirbus A320-200]]4F-OHFR / F-OHFU / I-WEBA / I-WEBBMcDonnell Douglas MD-832G-FLTL / SX-BEVG-FLTL operated by Flightline (UK)SX-BEV operated by EuroAirExternal linksVolare AirlinesVolare Airlines FleetReferencesCategory:Airlines of Italy Category:European Regions Airline Association Category:Low-cost airlines Category:Alitalia Category:Former IATA membersde:Volare Airlines es:Volare Airlines fr:Volare Web id:Volare Airlines it:Volare Airlines nl:Volare Airlines (Italië) ja:ヴォラーレ・エアラインズ (イタリア) pl:Volare Airlines fi:Volare
