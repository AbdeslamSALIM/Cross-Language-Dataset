He was then brought into the youth squad of Holland based team Rabobank in 1997, where Kroon won a number of amateur races in two years. In 1999, he moved to the senior squad of Rabobank, where he rode until 2005. He gathered but a handful of wins in his six years at Rabobank, most notably stage 8, on Bastille Day, of the 2002 Tour de France. Kroon and his Rabobank team mate Erik Dekker approached the finish in a seven man group, and with the help of the more experienced Dekker, Kroon won a stage win in his first ever Tour de France participation.Kroon takes stage victory, BBC Sport, July 14, 2002 During his time at the Rabobank team, Karsten Kroon at some point lead the mountain jersey competition in each of the three Grand Tours, though his lead didn't hold to the end in any of the races.On August 10 2005 it was announced that he, until 2007, was to ride for Team CSC.
