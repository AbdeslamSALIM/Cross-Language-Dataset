Deloor was serving in the Belgium army at Fort Eben-Emael near Maastricht but when the German army invaded the fort on May 10 1940, Deloor together with some 1,200 Belgians were taken prisoner. In Stalag II-B or the prisoner-of-war camp II-B, Deloor was able to work in the kitchen due to a German officier that was interested in sports. When Deloor returned from the war, he came back to a plundered house and decided to start a new life in the United States of America in 1949. After ten years in New York he moved to Los Angeles. He lost his first wife in 1966 but remarried.
