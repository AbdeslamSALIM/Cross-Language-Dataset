Marcus Annius Florianus (died 276), commonly known as Florian in English, was a Roman Emperor who ruled in 276.Florian was reportedly a maternal half-brother to Marcus Claudius Tacitus. According to sources, he was chosen by the army in the West to succeed Tacitus in 276, without the Roman Senate consensus. However he minted coins bearing the "S C" legend, thus showing some bonds to the Senate.He was fighting against the Eruli when the army in the East elected Probus. He had the support of Italia, Gaul, Hispania, Britain, Africa, and Mauretania. The two rival emperors met in battle in Cilicia. Florianus had the larger army, while Probus was an experienced general, and avoided a direct clash. When it was clear Probus was superior, Florianus was assassinated by his own troops. He had been emperor for 88 days. A prophecy circulated that a descendant would one day restore the Senate and rule as far as Ceylon.In the Middle Ages the von Blumenthal family claimed descent from him, apparently because both names refer to flowers.ReferencesPrimary SourcesAurelius Victor, Epitome de Caesaribus …"Florian succeeded him.
