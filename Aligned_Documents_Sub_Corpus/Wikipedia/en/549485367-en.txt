The city has a population of 237,968 ().Paraná is not only the head of the provincial government, but also an important river port for the transshipment of cereals, cattle, fish, and lumber from the surrounding region. The principal industries installed are the manufacture of cement, furniture, and ceramics. The centre of the city gathers colonial churches, European styles such as that of the 3 de Febrero Theatre or the Government House, the mixed styles of the city's Cathedral, and modern towers like those near the Parque Urquiza park.The city is connected to the city of Santa Fe on the other side of the Entre Ríos by the Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel inaugurated in 1969. The General Justo José de Urquiza Airport (IATA PRA) at coordinates  is 7.5 kilometres from the city, and services regular flights to Buenos Aires.HistoryDuring the 16th century, inhabitants of the city of Santa Fe settled also at the other side of the Paraná River. Known as de la otra Banda del Paraná ("from the other side of the Paraná") and Baxada del Paraná ("Ford of the Paraná"), the settlement never had an official foundation, and it slowly grew as a satellite town of Santa Fe.On October 23, 1730 the local chapel was granted by the clerical authorities in Buenos Aires the status of parish church; that date was adopted as the beginning of the official history of the town.In 1813 it achieved status of village, and in 1822 it was named capital of the territory of the present province. Between 1854 and 1861 it was the capital of the Confederación Argentina ("Argentine Confederation") during the rule of the local caudillo Justo José de Urquiza, that gave the city a rapid growth. In 1883 it regained its title of capital of the province.In 1994 Paraná hosted the Convención Reformadora de la Constitución Nacional Argentina ("Convention for the reform of the National Constitution"), together with its neighbour capital of Santa Fe.External linksParana Circuit in Google MapsReferencesOfficial website (Spanish)Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos (Spanish)   Category:Settlements established in the 16th century Category:Cities, towns and villages in Entre Ríos Province Category:Capitals of Argentine provinces Category:Paraná Rivergn:Parana (Argentina) bg:Парана (град) de:Paraná (Entre Ríos) el:Παρανά (πόλη) es:Paraná (Argentina) eu:Parana (Entre Rios) fr:Paraná (Argentine) it:Paraná (Argentina) lt:Parana (miestas) lij:Çittæ de Paraná (Argentinn-a) nl:Paraná (Entre Ríos) no:Paraná (Argentina) pl:Parana (miasto w Argentynie) pt:Paraná (Argentina) simple:Paraná, Argentina bat-smg:Parana zh:巴拉那
