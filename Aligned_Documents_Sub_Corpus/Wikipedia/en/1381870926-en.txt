Today only Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein remain members of EFTA (of which only Norway and Switzerland are founding members). The Stockholm Convention was subsequently replaced by the Vaduz Convention.This Convention provides for the liberalisation of trade among the member states. Three of the EFTA countries are part of the European Union Internal Market through the Agreement on a European Economic Area (EEA), which took effect in 1994; the fourth, Switzerland, opted to conclude bilateral agreements with the EU. In addition, the EFTA states have jointly concluded free trade agreements with a number of other countries.An important development was the conclusion by Switzerland in 1999 of a set of bilateral agreements with the European Union covering a wide range of areas, including movement of persons, transport and technical barriers to trade. This development prompted the EFTA States to modernise their Convention to ensure that it will continue to provide a successful framework for the expansion and liberalization of trade among them and with the rest of the world.The EFTA UPDATE on 1 June 2002. The main areas in which the Convention has been modernised include: Mutual recognition of conformity assessments; Intellectual property rights; Movement of persons, social security and mutual recognition of diplomas; Investment and services; Land and air transport; Public procurement; Agriculture;Membership history[[Image:EFTA countries.PNG|thumb|left|300px| ]]Its original members were the United Kingdom, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and Portugal. During the 1960s these countries were often referred to as the Outer Seven, as opposed to the Inner Six of the then-European Economic Community.Now, the Seven and a Half - TIME&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; Finland became an associate member in 1961 (becoming a full member in 1986), and Iceland joined in 1970. The United Kingdom and Denmark joined the European Communities in 1973 (together with Ireland), and hence ceased to be EFTA members. Portugal also left EFTA for the European Community in 1986. Liechtenstein joined in 1991 (previously its interests in EFTA had been represented by Switzerland). Finally, Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the European Union in 1995 and hence ceased to be EFTA members.Current membersFlagStateOfficial nameAccessionPopulationArea (km²)CapitalGDP in millions (PPP)GDP per capita (PPP)IcelandIcelandIceland1970|01|1310000103000Reykjavík12,17240,277LiechtensteinLiechtensteinPrincipality of Liechtenstein1991|01|134247160.4Vaduz1,78625,000NorwayNorwayKingdom of Norway1960|05|34721600385155Oslo257,40055,600SwitzerlandSwitzerlandSwiss Confederation (''Confoederatio Helvetica '')1960|05|3759140041285Bern296,20038,706General SecretariesGeneral Secretaries of EFTA:1960-1965:  Frank E.

In addition, in connection with the EEA Agreement of 1992, two other EFTA organisations were established, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court.EEA-related institutionsThe EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA). Since Switzerland is not an EEA member, it does not participate in these institutions.The EFTA Surveillance Authority performs the European Commission's role as "guardian of the treaties" for the EFTA countries, while the EFTA Court performs the European Court of Justice's role for those countries.The original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court or the EFTA Surveillance Authority, and instead had the European Court of Justice and the European Commission were to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice informed the Council of the European Union by way of letter that they considered that giving the EU institutions powers with respect to non-EU member states would be a violation of the treaties, and therefore the current arrangement was developed instead.LocationsThe EFTA Secretariat is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The EFTA Surveillance Authority has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium (the same location as the headquarters of the European Commission), while the EFTA Court has its headquarters in Luxembourg (the same location as the headquarters of the European Court of Justice).Portugal FundThe Portugal Fund was established in 1975 when Portugal was still a member of EFTA, to provide funding for the development and reconstruction of Portugal after the Carnation Revolution. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985, the remaining EFTA members decided to nonetheless continue the Portugal Fund, so Portugal would continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-interest loan from the EFTA member states to Portugal, to the value of 100 million US dollars. Repayment was originally to commence in 1988, but EFTA then decided to postpone the start of repayments until 1998. The Portugal Fund has now been dissolved by the Member States.International conventionsEFTA also originated the Hallmarking Convention and the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention, both of which are open to non-EFTA states.Relationship to the European Economic AreaThe EFTA members, except for Switzerland, are also members of the European Economic Area (EEA).International RelationshipsEFTA has several free trade agreements with non-EU countries as well as declarations on cooperation and joint workgroups to improve trade. Currently, the EFTA States have established preferential trade relations with 20 States and Territories, in addition to the 27 Member States of the European Union.Free Trade AgreementCanadaChileColombiaCroatiaEgyptIsraelJordanSouth KoreaLebanonRepublic of MacedoniaMexicoMoroccoPalestinian National AuthoritySingaporeSouthern African Customs Union (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, Swaziland, South Africa)TunisiaTurkeyCurrently negotiating with Thailand and the Gulf Co-operation Council (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates)Declarations on CooperationAlbaniaAlgeriaColombiaMercosur (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay)PeruSerbiaUkraineJoint workgroupsIndiaIndonesiaTrade News8 May 2008 EFTA and Algeria hold 3rd round of free trade negotiations5 May 2008 Free Trade Agreement between EFTA and SACU24 April 2008 EFTA and the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) Finalize Free Trade Negotiations25 July, 2008: EFTA interested on Free Trade Agreement with Malaysia EFTA &amp; Hong Kong keen on FTA with Malaysia, says MuhyiddinFuture of EFTA Norwegians have rejected in referendums to join the EU on two occasions. At the time of the first referendum (1972) their neighbours the Kingdom of Denmark joined. The second time (1994) two other Nordic neighbours, Sweden and Finland joined the EU. The two last governments of Norway have been unable and unwilling to advance the question, as they have both been coalition governments consisting of both proponents and opponents.Iceland is not likely to join the EU in the near future due to political indifference towards the Union.Since Switzerland rejected the EEA in 1992, referendums on EU membership have been initiated, the last time in 2001. These were rejected by clear majorities.In mid-2005, representatives of the Faroe Islands have hinted at the possibility of their territory joining EFTA. However, the chances of the Faroes' bid for membership are uncertain because, according to the EFTA Convention, only states may become members of the Association. If the Faroe Islands gain independence there is a strong possibility that they may opt out of the EU altogether as Greenland has done.United KingdomThe United Kingdom benefited from the lack of common tariffs for EFTA members, by importing goods from the Commonwealth of Nations and selling them on to other EFTA members. Due to the advancement of the EEC and the decision to focus on Europe, rather than the United States and Commonwealth nations such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as trading partners, the United Kingdom chose to apply for EEC membership in 1961 (however, it did not become a member until 1973).See alsoCentral European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA)Enlargement of the European UnionEuro-Mediterranean free trade area (EU-MEFTA)Free trade areas in EuropeEuropean Union Association Agreement, which covers many more countriesTrade blocSchengen AgreementReferencesExternal linksOfficial EFTA siteThe history of EFTA in detailMission of Norway to the EUThe European Commission's Delegation to Norway and IcelandEuropean Free Trade Association European Navigator Category:European Free Trade Association Category:1960 establishments Category:Trade blocsfrp:Associacion eropèèna de libro-èchanjo cs:Evropské sdružení volného obchodu da:EFTA de:Europäische Freihandelsassoziation et:EFTA es:Asociación Europea de Libre Comercio eo:Eŭropa Liber-Komerca Asocio eu:Europako Merkataritza Askearen Elkartea fr:Association européenne de libre-échange fy:Jeropeeske Frijhannelassosjaasje hr:EFTA ie:Association europan del comercie líber is:Fríverslunarsamtök Evrópu it:Associazione europea di libero scambio he:איגוד הסחר החופשי האירופי lt:ELPA hu:Európai Szabadkereskedelmi Társulás mk:Европска Слободна Трговска Асоцијација nl:Europese Vrijhandelsassociatie ja:欧州自由貿易連合 no:EFTA oc:Associacion Europèa de Liure Escambi pl:Europejskie Stowarzyszenie Wolnego Handlu pt:Associação Europeia de Livre Comércio ro:Asociaţia Europeană a Liberului Schimb ru:Европейская ассоциация свободной торговли sk:Európske združenie voľného obchodu sr:Европска слободна трговинска асоцијација fi:Euroopan vapaakauppajärjestö sv:Europeiska frihandelssammanslutningen th:สมาคมการค้าเสรียุโรป tr:Avrupa Serbest Ticaret Birliği uk:Європейська асоціація вільної торгівлі cbk-zam:EFTA zh:欧洲自由贸易联盟
