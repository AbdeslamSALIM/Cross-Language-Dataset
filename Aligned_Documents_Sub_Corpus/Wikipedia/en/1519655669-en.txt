The album prominently features lead singer Sharon den Adel's vocals as well as guitarist Robert Westerholt's gruff death metal growls.The album's style is very instrumental compared to the band's later works. Many of the songs have longer instrumental sections and fewer lyrics. On several songs Westerholt provides growling (in contrast to later albums on which it is rarely used).The lyrics focus on darkness, death, emptiness, ghosts, and war instead of fantasy, love, and nature on later albums. Enter has been classified as gothic doom by some critics.It, along with The Dance were re-released in the US on September 18, 2007 by the label Season of Mist.Track listing"Restless" &ndash; 6:06"Enter" &ndash; 7:14"Pearls of Light" &ndash; 5:14"Deep Within" &ndash; 4:30"Gatekeeper" &ndash; 6:43"Grace" &ndash; 5:09"Blooded" &ndash; 3:37"Candles" &ndash; 7:07Category:1997 albums Category:Within Temptation albumsda:Enter (Within Temptation) de:Enter (Album) es:Enter fr:Enter (Within Temptation) hr:Enter (album) it:Enter lv:Enter nl:Enter (Within Temptation) no:Enter pl:Enter (album) pt:Enter ro:Enter (album Within Temptation) ru:Enter (альбом) fi:Enter (albumi) sv:Enter tr:Enter (albüm)
