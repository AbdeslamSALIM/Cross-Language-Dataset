In the 250cc class, Kato finished third after debuting at his home circuit in Suzuka, Mie, his favorite track. The next year, he won the Japanese Championship, and again entered the Japanese Grand Prix with a wild card, winning the race at this occasion.In spite of these successes, Kato didn't ride his first full Grand Prix season until 2000, when he started in the 250cc, riding a Honda. He won four races that season (of which two in Japan), and placed third in the championship. In 2001, he dominated the 250cc championship. He won no less than 11 races - a record - and easily won the title.The following season, Kato moved up to the MotoGP class (formerly 500cc) racing for Honda Racing Corporation (HRC) in the Fortuna Fausto Gresini team. Some strong performances on the Honda NSR500 two-stroke bike in the first half of the season including second place at the French GP at Le Mans, meant he was given a full factory supported four-stroke Honda RC211V for the rest of the season, his best result on the RC211V was a second place at the Czech GP at Brno.For 2003, Kato remained at the Gresini team now with sponsorship from Telefónica movistar brought by new teammate Sete Gibernau joining from Suzuki. Tragically, Kato sustained fatal injuries in a crash at the opening round of the championship at Suzuka and died on April 20th 2003.Racing highlights1993All Kyushu Area Championship: SP250, GP125, GP250 classes.Ranking: Championship winner in all 3 classes.1994All Japan Road Race Championship: GP250 class.First win at round 9 at TI Circuit in Aida, Okayama.Ranking: Seventh.1995All Japan Road Race Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Fifth.1996All Japan Road Race Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Second.Kato participated as a wild card rider at the world grand prix championship GP250 race in Japan and finished third.1997All Japan Road Race Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Championship winner.Kato again participated as a wild card rider at the world grand prix championship GP250 race in Japan and won the race.Kato raced the Suzuka 8 Hours in Japan and finished ninth.1998All Japan Road Race Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Eighth.Kato again participated as a wild card rider at the world grand prix championship GP250 race in Japan and won the race a second time.1999All Japan Road Race Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Second.2000Grand Prix World Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Third.Kato was awarded the Rookie-of-the-Year prize in the GP250 class.Kato, teaming with fellow Japanese rider Tohru Ukawa, won the Suzuka 8 Hours in Japan.2001Grand Prix World Championship: GP250 class.Ranking: Championship winner.Kato set a new grand prix world record by winning 11 races throughout the 2001 season.

He was estimated to have hit the wall near the final chicane of the circuit at around 125mph (200 km/h).Many questions were raised regarding the actions of the corner workers immediately following the crash. Kato was thrown back onto the track after hitting the wall and was lying next to the racing line  . Normally, when a motorcycle and/or rider are incapacitated on the race track, a red flag is waved and the race stopped so the track can be safely cleared. This did not happen following Kato's accident. Instead, the corner workers dragged his body off the track and threw him on a stretcher, actions that are not in accordance with tending to someone with suspected neck and spinal cord injuries. The race was not stopped.Kato spent two weeks in a coma following the accident before dying as a result of the injuries he sustained. The cause of death was listed as brain stem infarction. Many of the MotoGP riders wore black armbands or placed small #74's on their leathers and bikes at the following race in South Africa to pay tribute to the fallen racer. His teammate, Sete Gibernau, has worn a #74 on his racesuit since winning the race in his memory. There has not been a Grand Prix motorcycle race held at Suzuka following Kato's crash with safety issues at the facility being cited as the reason.Later in July, during the Suzuka 8 Hours race, Honda paid tribute to Daijiro, who twice won the race, by bearing his racing number of the Sakurai Honda bike of Tadayuki Okada and Chojun Kameya who crashed on the second lap, after slipping on some spilt oil on the first corner of the track, along with two other bikes of Nicky Hayden and Atsushi Watanabe. Once Tady and two others returned to the pits with their broken bikes, the former 500cc rider was permitted to go back out with a spare bike, as a mark of respect, but was ineligible to win since his original bike was badly damaged and two hours later, Tady returned to the pitlane to retire the bike in a mass applause from the crowd. At the end of the race, the other Sakurai bike of Yukio Nukumi and Manabu Kamada who would win the race, went on to the rostrum to show off Daijiro's helmet bearing his number at the front of his visor and a photo of him on the as a mark of respect. Soon afterwards the FIM retired his number.ReferencesExternal linksDaijiro Kato's Official Website (mostly in Japanese)Amateur video of Kato's crash at YouTubePhotos from Kato's memorial service on SuperbikePlanet.comFind A Grave Memorial  [[Olivier Jacque]]
