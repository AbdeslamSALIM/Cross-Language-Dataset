By 1989, Huawei started developing and later marketing its own PBX. After accumulating knowledge and resources on PBX business, Huawei achieved its first breakthrough into mainstream telecommunication market in 1993, by launching C&amp;C08 digital telephone switch, which had a switching capacity of over 10K circuits. Until that time, Chinese domestic telecom companies were not able to build switches with such capacity. Huawei's switches were first deployed only in small cities and rural areas.

In 1996, Huawei captured its first overseas contract, providing fixed-line network products to Hongkong's Hutchison-Whampoa. Later, in 1997, Huawei released its GSM product and eventually expanded to offer CDMA and UMTS.From 1998 to 2003, Huawei contracted with IBM for management consulting, and underwent significant transformation of its management and product development structure. After 2001, Huawei increased its speed of expanding into oversea market. By 2004, its overseas sales had surpassed that of the domestic market.
