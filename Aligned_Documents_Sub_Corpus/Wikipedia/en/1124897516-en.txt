connected many civilisations across Asia.ANCIENT SILK ROAD TRAVELLERS]] ]] , 1892]]The history of Asia can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions, East Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian steppe.The coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and China shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.The steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The earliest known such central expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans which spread their languages into the Middle East, India, and in the Tocharians to the borders of China. The northern part of the continent, covering much of Siberia was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the tundra. These areas were very sparsely populated.The centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The Caucasus, Himalaya, Karakum Desert, and Gobi Desert formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty. While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force. Thus the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.OutlineNeolithicBronze AgeIron Age Alexander the Great conquered an area from Turkey to India in the 4th century BC. The Roman Empire would later control parts of western Asia. The Achaemenid, Seleucid, Parthian and Sassanian empires were based in Ancient Persia. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the Silk Road, which connected China, India, the Middle East and Europe. The religions of Hinduism and Buddhism, which began in India, were an important influence on South and East Asia.Middle AgesThe Islamic caliphate and other Islamic states took over the Middle East starting in the 7th century, and later expanded into India and Indonesia. The Crusades would be fought from the 12th century, in Christian Europe's attempt to retake the Holy Land from the Muslims. The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe.Modern periodThe Russian Empire began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, eventually taking control of all of Siberia and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The Ottoman Empire controlled Turkey and the Middle East from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing Dynasty, although this was in decline by the nineteenth century and had been overthrown in 1912.Several European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the 1900s, such as British India, French Indochina and Portuguese Macau and Goa. The Great Game between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The Trans-Siberian Railway, crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as Persia, Thailand and most of China. In the twentieth century, Imperial Japan expanded into China, Korea and Southeast Asia during the Second World War. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the Cold War, the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as CENTO and SEATO. Conflicts such as the Korean War, Vietnam War and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the Japanese post-war economic miracle. The Arab-Israeli conflict has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.History by country[[History of the Middle East]]History of ArmeniaHistory of IraqHistory of MesopotamiaHistory of IranHistory of PersiaHistory of the LevantHistory of IsraelHistory of JordanHistory of LebanonHistory of PalestineHistory of SyriaHistory of Saudi ArabiaHistory of TurkeyHistory of AnatoliaHistory of the Republic of Turkey[[History of South Asia]]History of IndiaHistory of the Republic of IndiaHistory of South IndiaHistory of AssamHistory of BengalHistory of the PunjabHistory of PakistanHistorical regions of PakistanHistory of SindhHistory of PunjabHistory of MehrgarhHistory of the Indus ValleyHistory of AfghanistanHistory of BangladeshHistory of East BengalHistory of East PakistanHistory of NepalHistory of BhutanHistory of TibetHistory of Sri LankaHistory of the Maldives[[History of East Asia]]listed by area in alphabetical orderHistory of ChinaHistory of Hong KongHistory of JapanHistory of KoreaHistory of MacauHistory of MongoliaHistory of Russian Far EastHistory of Ryukyu IslandsHistory of SiberiaHistory of TibetHistory of TaiwanHistory of VietnamHistory of Vladivostok[[History of Central Asia]]History of AfghanistanHistory of KazakhstanHistory of KyrgyzstanHistory of MongoliaHistory of UzbekistanHistory of Turkmenistan[[History of Southeast Asia]]History of BurmaHistory of CambodiaHistory of IndonesiaHistory of LaosHistory of MalaysiaHistory of the PhilippinesHistory of SingaporeHistory of ThailandHistory of VietnamSee alsoExploration of AsiaList of conflicts in AsiaImperialism in AsiaHistory of EurasiaHistory by continentReferences   Category:History of Asia Category:World historyar:تاريخ آسيا ca:Història d'Àsia cs:Dějiny Asie de:Geschichte Asiens es:Historia de Asia fr:Histoire de l'Asie ko:아시아의 역사 hr:Povijest Azije he:היסטוריה של אסיה lv:Āzijas vēsture lt:Azijos istorija nl:Geschiedenis van Azië no:Asias historie pl:Historia Azji pt:História da Ásia ru:История Азии simple:History of Asia fi:Aasian historia sv:Asiens historia th:ประวัติศาสตร์เอเชีย vi:Lịch sử châu Á zh:亚洲史 hi hello how r u?
