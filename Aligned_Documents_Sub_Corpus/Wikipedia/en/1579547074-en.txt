With an area of 1,091 km² (421 square miles) and a population of 34,361, it is one of Ireland's smallest counties. Agricultural activities include cattle and sheep rearing, and the production of oats and potatoes.HistoryThe territory now comprising County Longford was traditionally known as Annaly (Anghaile in Irish) or Teffia (Teabhtha in Irish) and formed the territory of the Farrell clan. After the Norman invasion of the 12th century, Annaly was granted to Hugh de Lacy as part of the Liberty of Meath. An English settlement was established at Granard, with English Cistercian monasteries being established at Abbeylara and Abbeyshrule, and Augustinian monasteries being established at Abbeyderg and at Saints' Island on the shore of Lough Ree. Monastic remains at Ardagh, Abbeylara, Abbeyderg, Abbeyshrule, Inchcleraun Island in Lough Ree and Inchmore Island in Lough Gowna are reminders of the county's long Christian history.However, by the 14th century, English influence in Ireland was on the wane. The town of Granard was sacked by Edward Bruce's army in 1315, and the O'Farrells soon recovered complete control over their former territory.The county was officially shired in 1586 in the reign of Elizabeth I, but English control was not fully established until the aftermath of the Nine Years War. County Longford was added to Leinster by James I in 1608 (it had previously been considered part of Connacht), with the county being divided into six baronies and its boundaries being officially defined. The county was planted by English and Scottish landowners in 1620, with much of the O'Farrell lands being confiscated and granted to new owners. The change in control was completed during the Cromwellian plantations of the 1650s.The county was a centre of the 1798 rebellion, when the French expeditionary force led by Humbert which had landed at Killala were defeated outside the village of Ballinamuck on 8 September by an English army led by Cornwallis. Considerable reprisals were inflicted by the British on the civilian inhabitants of the county in the aftermath of the battle.A revolutionary spirit was again awoken in the county during the Irish War of Independence when the North Longford flying column, led by Seán Mac Eoin, became one of the most active units on the Irish side during that war.GeographyMost of Longford lies in the basin of the River Shannon, which forms its western boundary, much of it in the form of a large lake, Lough Ree. The northeastern part of the county, however, drains towards the River Erne, and much of Lough Gowna is within the county boundary. Lakeland, bogland, pastureland, and wetland typify Longford's generally low-lying landscapes: the highest point is Carn Clonhugh (also known as Cairn Hill) in the northwest of the county at 279 m (916 feet). Cairn Hill is the site of a television transmitter broadcasting to much of the Irish midlands. In general, the northern third of the county is hilly, forming part of the drumlin belt stretching across the northern midlands of Ireland. The southern parts of the county are low-lying, with extensive areas of raised bogland, and the land being of better quality for grazing and tillage.Image:Royal Canal Longford long.JPG|The Royal Canal, KeenaghTowns &amp; villagesBallinamuck, BallymahonDrumlishEdgeworthstownGranardKeenagh, KillasheeLanesborough, LongfordMoydow,Newtowncashel, NewtownforbesDemographicsLongford’s population growth during the period 2002-2006 (10.6%) has been stronger than the National average (8.2%).See alsoList of abbeys and priories in the Republic of Ireland (County Longford)ReferencesExternal linksCounty Longford Official WebsiteLongford County CouncilLongford AncestryFarrells of Longford&lt;!-- see [[WP:SUBCAT#Topic_article_rule]] --&gt;Category:County Longford Longford Leinsterar:مقاطعة لونجفورد ast:Condáu de Longford br:Kontelezh An Longfort bg:Лонгфорд (графство) ca:Comtat de Longford cy:Swydd Longford da:County Longford de:County Longford es:Condado de Longford eo:Graflando Longford eu:Longfordeko konderria fr:Comté de Longford ga:Contae an Longfoirt gv:Coontae Lhongfort it:Longford (contea) lt:Longfordo grafystė mk:Лонгфорд nl:County Longford ja:ロングフォード州 no:Longford (grevskap) nn:County Longford pl:Hrabstwo Longford pt:Condado de Longford ro:Comitatul Longford ru:Лонгфорд (графство) fi:Longfordin kreivikunta sv:Longford (grevskap) tg:Вилояти Лонгфорд zh:朗福德郡
