, Australia suffering from drought conditions]]A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. Generally, this occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation. It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region. Although droughts can persist for several years, even a short, intense drought can cause significant damageLiving With Drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; and harm the local economyAustralian Drought and Climate Change, retrieved on June 7th 2007.

Having adequate drought mitigation strategies in place can greatly reduce the impact. Recurring or long-term drought can bring about desertification. Recurring droughts in the Horn of Africa have created grave ecological catastrophes, prompting massive food shortages, still recurring. To the north-west of the Horn, the Darfur conflict in neighboring Sudan, also affecting Chad, was fueled by decades of drought; combination of drought, desertification and overpopulation are among the causes of the Darfur conflict, because the Arab Baggara nomads searching for water have to take their livestock further south, to land mainly occupied by non-Arab farming peoples.Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion Approximately 2.4&nbsp;billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers.Big melt threatens millions, says UN India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades.

Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a "tipping point" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the rainforest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate. According to the WWF, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.[http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/index.cfm?uNewsID=64220 Climate change a threat to Amazon rainforest, warns WWF], World Wide Fund for Nature, March 22, 2006.

Paradoxically, some proposed short-term solutions to global warming also carry with them increased chances of drought.[http://environment.newscientist.com/article/dn12397-sunshade-for-global-warming-could-cause-drought.html Sunshade' for global warming could cause drought] 02 August 2007 New Scientist, Catherine BrahicBy far the largest part of Australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback. A 2005 study by Australian and American researchers investigated the desertification of the interior, and suggested that one explanation was related to human settlers who arrived about 50,000 years ago. Regular burning by these settlers could have prevented monsoons from reaching interior Australia.Sensitivity of the Australian Monsoon to insolation and vegetation: Implications for human impact on continental moisture balance, Geological Society of America In June 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term, maybe irreversible, severe ecological damage for the whole Murray-Darling basin if it does not receive sufficient water by October.Australian rivers 'face disaster', BBC News Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future, a government-commissioned report said on July 6, 2008.Australia faces worse, more frequent droughts: study, Reuters The Australian of the year 2007, environmentalist Tim Flannery, predicted that unless it made drastic changes, Perth in Western Australia could become the world’s first ghost metropolis, an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population.Metropolis strives to meet its thirst, BBC NewsCausesGenerally, rainfall is related to the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, combined with the upward forcing of the air mass containing that water vapour. If either of these are reduced,the result is a drought. Factors include:Above average prevalence of high pressure systems;Winds carrying continental, rather than oceanic air masses (ie. reduced water content);Ridges of high pressure areas form with behaviors which prevent or restrict the developing of thunderstorm activity or rainfall over one certain region;El Nino, La Nina (and other oceanic and atmospheric temperature cycles) and global warming;Deforestation and erosion adversly impacting the ability of the land to capture water; Kenya: Deforestation exacerbates droughts, floods&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Climate change has a substantial impact on agriculture[[NOAA] DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WEST] December 2002 throughout the world, and especially in developing nations.Record rise in wheat price prompts UN official to warn that surge in food prices may trigger social unrest in developing countriesFuel costs, drought influence price increasehttp://usinfo.state.gov/af/Archive/2005/Oct/26-779234.html Nigerian Scholar Links Drought, Climate Change to Conflict Africa Oct, 2005ConsequencesPeriods of drought can have significant environmental, agricultural, health, economic and social consequences.

For example, subsistence farmers are more likely to migrate during drought because they do not have alternative food sources. Areas with populations that depend on subsistence farming as a major food source are more vulnerable to drought-triggered famine. Drought is rarely if ever the sole cause of famine; socio-political factors such as extreme widespread poverty play a major role. Drought can also reduce water quality, because lower water flows reduce dilution of pollutants and increase contamination of remaining water sources.Stages of drought.]]As a drought persists, the conditions surrounding it gradually worsen and its impact on the local population gradually increases. Droughts go through three stages before their ultimate cessation:http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/brochures/climate/Drought.pdf NOAA factsheet, retrieved April 100th 2007Meteorological drought is brought about when there is a prolonged period with less than average precipitation. Meteorological drought usually precedes the other kinds of drought.Agricultural droughts are droughts that affect crop production or the ecology of the range. This condition can also arise independently from any change in precipitation levels when soil conditions and erosion triggered by poorly planned agricultural endeavors cause a shortfall in water available to the crops. However, in a traditional drought, it is caused by an extended period of below average precipitation.Hydrological drought is brought about when the water reserves available in sources such as aquifers, lakes and reservoirs falls below the statistical average. Like an agricultural drought, this can be triggered by more than just a loss of rainfall. For instance, Kazakhstan was recently awarded a large amount of money by the World Bank to restore water that had been diverted to other nations from the Aral Sea under Soviet rule.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6538219.stm BBC article on the World Bank loan to save the Aral Sea Similar circumstances also place their largest lake, Balkhash, at risk of completely drying out.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3397077.stm BBC article from 2004 concerning the risk of Kazakhstan losing the lakeDrought mitigation strategiesDesalination of sea water for irrigation or consumption.Drought monitoring - Continuous observation of rainfall levels and comparisons with current usage levels can help prevent man-made drought. For instance, analysis of water usage in Yemen has revealed that their water table (underground water level) is put at grave risk by over-use to fertilize their Khat crop.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm BBC's From Our Own Correspondent on khat water usage Careful monitoring of moisture levels can also help predict increased risk for wildfires, using such metrics as the Keetch-Byram Drought Index or Palmer Drought Index.Land use - Carefully planned crop rotation can help to minimize erosion and allow farmers to plant less water-dependent crops in drier years.Rainwater harvesting - Collection and storage of rainwater from roofs or other suitable catchments.Recycled water - Former wastewater (sewage) that has been treated and purified for reuse.Transvasement - Building canals or redirecting rivers as massive attempts at irrigation in drought-prone areas.Water restrictions - Water use may be regulated (particularly outdoors). This may involve regulating the use of sprinklers, hoses or buckets on outdoor plants, the washing of motor vehicles or other outdoor hard surfaces (including roofs and paths), topping up of swimming pools, and also the fitting of water conservation devices inside the home (including shower heads, taps and dual flush toilets).Cloud seeding - an artificial technique to induce rainfall.Cloud seeding helps alleviate drought&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;See alsoMaya collapseClimate changeDrought in AustraliaDroughts and famines in Russia and USSRDrought in the United StatesFood securityUnited Nations Convention to Combat DesertificationWater crisisDust BowlSahel drought''Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed'', a 2005 book by Jared DiamondReferencesExternal linksWater scarcity from FAO Water (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)Category:Basic meteorological concepts and phenomena Category:Climatology Category:Droughts Category:Hydrology Category:Weather hazardsgn:Kyve'y ay:Awti pacha bs:Suša ca:Sequera cs:Sucho da:Tørke de:Dürre es:Sequía eo:Trosekeco fa:خشکسالی fr:Sécheresse gan:乾旱 gl:Seca ko:가뭄 hr:Suša it:Siccità he:בצורת la:Aritudo lt:Sausra hu:Aszály mr:दुष्काळ nl:Droogte ja:旱魃 no:Tørke nn:Tørke pl:Susza pt:Seca ro:Secetă qu:Ch'akiy ru:Засуха simple:Drought sr:Суша fi:Kuivuuskausi sv:Torka tr:Kuraklık uk:Засуха zh-yue:乾旱 zh:干旱
