 ?| deathplace=Rome, Italy|  Pope Saint Marcellinus, according to the Liberian Catalogue, became bishop of Rome on June 30, 296; his predecessor was Pope St Caius. He is not mentioned in the Martyrologium hieronymianum, or in the Depositio episcoporum, or in the Depositio martyrus.St Marcellinus’ pontificate began at a time when Diocletian was Roman Emperor, but had not yet started to persecute the Christians. He left Christianity rather free and so the church’s membership grew. Caesar Galerius led the pagan movement against Christianity and arrived to bring up Diocletian against Christianity in the year 302: first Christian soldiers had to leave the army, later the Church's property was confiscated and Christian books were destroyed. After two fires in Diocletian’s palace he took harder measures against Christians: they had either to apostatize or they were sentenced to death.The Liber Pontificalis, basing itself on the Acts of St Marcellinus, the text of which is lost, relates that during Diocletian’s persecution Marcellinus was called upon to sacrifice, and offered incense to idols, but that, repenting shortly afterwards, he confessed the faith of Christ and suffered martyrdom with several companions. Other documents speak of his defection, and it is probably this lapse that explains the silence of the ancient liturgical calendars. In the beginning of the 5th century Petilianus, the Donatist bishop of Constantine, affirmed that Marcellinus and his priests had given up the holy books to the pagans during the persecution and offered incense to false gods. St Augustine contents himself with denying the affair. The records of the pseudo-council of Sinuessa, which were fabricated at the beginning of the 6th century, state that Marcellinus after his fall presented himself before a council, which refused to try him on the ground that prima sedes a nemine iudicatur ("The first See is judged by none").According to the Liber Pontificalis, Marcellinus was buried, on April 26, 304, in the cemetery of Priscilla, on the Via Salaria, 25 days after his martyrdom; the Liberian Catalogue gives as the date October 25. The fact of the martyrdom, too, is not established with certainty. After a considerable interregnum he was succeeded by Marcellus, with whom he has sometimes been confused. During his pontificate, Armenia became the first Christian nation in 301.Saint Marcellinus' feast day is celebrated on April 26 along with that of Saint Cletus. The feast is properly commemorated as Saints Cletus and Marcellinus, Popes and Martyrs.ReferencesExternal information[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09637d.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Pope St. Marcellinus]        Category:3rd century births Category:304 deaths Category:Popes Category:Papal saints Category:4th century archbishops Category:3rd century archbishopsaf:Pous Marcellinus br:Marcellinus bg:Марцелин (папа) ca:Marcel·lí I cs:Marcellinus da:Pave Marcellinus 1. de:Marcellinus (Bischof von Rom) et:Marcellinus el:Πάπας Μαρκελλίνος es:Marcelino eo:Marceleno fr:Marcellin (pape) gl:Marcelino, papa ko:교황 마르첼리노 hr:Marcelin id:Paus Marselinus it:Papa Marcellino he:מרקלינוס ka:მარცელინე (პაპი) sw:Papa Marcellinus la:Marcellinus hu:Marcellinus pápa mk:Папа Марцелус nl:Paus Marcellinus ja:マルケリヌス (ローマ教皇) pl:Papież Marcelin pt:Papa Marcelino ro:Papa Marcelin ru:Марцеллин (папа римский) sk:Marcelín sr:Папа Маркелиније fi:Pyhä Marcellinus sv:Marcellinus tl:Marcelino th:สมเด็จพระสันตะปาปามาร์เซลลินุส uk:Марцелін
