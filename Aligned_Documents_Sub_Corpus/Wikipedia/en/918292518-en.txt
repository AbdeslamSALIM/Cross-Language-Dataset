Żelechów was a private town, first owned by the family of Ciołek (who later changed their surname to Żelechowski). It was a local center of trade and an important city until the Deluge (the war with Sweden). At that time the town was greatly devastated, and dozens of people died (also due to diseases).

The owners of the town changed frequently, one of them was Ignacy Wyssogota Zakrzewski - the first President of Warsaw.After the Partitions of Poland Żelechów belonged to Austria. Then in the time of the Napoleonic Wars it was within the borders of the Duchy of Warsaw, and after the Congress of Vienna it was finally placed in Congress Poland, which was in fact controlled by Russia.

During the January Uprising near Żelechów, few skirmishes took place.After the uprising the Russian government took the decision to punish those who fought against them, who where generally nobility. Nearby peasants received land (which later belonged to nobility), and the city from that time onward was not owned by a single person. To keep the peace in the area, two cavalry companies and an artillery unit were placed in Żelechów. They brought prosperity, because their needs had to be supported by the townspeople. In that time, Żelechów started to be especially well-known as a shoe production center.In 1880 a great fire burned a large part of the town, but it was rebuilt quickly with brick houses replacing wooden ones. In 1919 about 7,800 inhabitants lived in the city. During the interwar period about 800 firms resided in Żelechów (mainly shops and handicrafts). In 1939 in Żelechów lived about 8,500 inhabitants, who were mostly Jews (5,800 people).When the Nazis defeated Poland, they created a ghetto in a small area in the city, placing about 10,000 Jews there, mainly from Żelechów but also from other cities of Poland. In September of 1942, the liquidation of the ghetto began, where people were transported to Treblinka extermination camp, but due to the chaos many tried to escape. About 1,000 died in Żelechów this time shot by Nazis. In July 17 of 1945 the Red Army entered Żelechów, ending the war there. At this time about 4,000 people lived in Żelechów, and this number has not changed much to this day.Historic buildingsParish, neo-baroque church. Construction begun in 1692 and ended in 1728.
