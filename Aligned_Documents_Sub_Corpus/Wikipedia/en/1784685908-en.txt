More recent examples are Glen Little, Stuart Elliott, Andy Kirk and Andy Smith, with Elliott a member of the Northern Ireland squad.HistoryIn 1914 Glentoran won the Vienna Cup, becoming the first Irish team to win a European trophy, although as this competition took place several decades before the formation of UEFA it is not recognised as such.[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/article2249104.ece Belfast Telegraph]George Best watched Glentoran with his grandfather as a youth, but was rejected by the club for being "too small and light". However Best did make one appearance for Glentoran, in the club's centenary match against Manchester United.BBC NewsIn 1964-65, Glentoran faced Panathinaikos in the European Cup and drew 2-2 at home and lost 3-2 away. In the following season's Fairs Cup, they faced Antwerp resulting a 1-0 defeat away and 3-3 draw at home. The Cup-Winners' Cup in 1966-67 saw Glentoran draw 1-1 with Rangers in front of a packed Oval before losing the away leg 4-0.  Glentoran's finest hour came in a European Cup encounter with Benfica in 1967. The tie was played over two legs, the first being at the Oval. Glentoran scored a penalty early on and held out for nearly 60 minutes until football great Eusébio equalised. The match ended 1-1. The return tie was at Benfica's famous Estádio da Luz. Part-time Glentoran were expected to crumble under the pressure of the occasion, but again held out for a famous draw. Benfica advanced to the next round on the away goals rule. Glentoran were the first team ever to lose out to this rule. UEFAIn the late 1960s the club ran the Detroit Cougars football franchise in the North American Soccer League. Glentoran FCIn 1973-74, Glentoran reached the quarter-finals of the Cup-Winners' Cup. They faced Borussia Mönchengladbach in the quarter-finals and were beaten 2-0 and 5-0. Four seasons later they faced Juventus in a European Cup match and lost 1-0 at home (Warren Feeney missing a late penalty) and 5-0 away.In 1981-82, Glentoran reached the second round of the European Cup and faced eventual semi-finalists CSKA Sofia. After a 2-0 defeat away, Glentoran went 2-0 up in the return leg to force the game into extra time. The final result was 2-1, Glentoran going out 3-2 on aggregate. On the 23 April, 2005 Glentoran defeated their rivals Linfield in the second last game but one of the league season. In the 93rd minute of the match Glentoran, who needed victory in order to have a chance of clinching the league title, scored a goal via their centre forward (and former Linfield player) Chris Morgan. The goal sealed the victory for Glentoran. There were confrontations between the two sets of fans following the match. Hooliganism was commonplace at matches between the clubs in the past. However this has reduced significantly in recent years.BBC NewsAfter eight years in charge of Glentoran, Roy Coyle resigned as manager after a string of indifferent results. On 14 February, 2006 the club announced that former Newry City manager Paul Millar was to take over the manager's position.BBC News Since his takeover performances improved and he led his team into the Irish Cup final with rivals Linfield. Despite taking the lead in the first half, Linfield won the game with 2 goals from Peter Thompson. He also lead his new club to their biggest ever defeat against their bitter cross-city rivals Linfield in a 6-0 defeat at Windsor Park. The Glens have sought to reduce the gap between them and Linfield by signing Kyle Neill and Gary Hamilton from Portadown and re-signing former fan's favourite Gary Smyth. Also arriving was another former player, Jason Hill, former Portadown and Newry City player Cullen Feeney and promising young keeper Ciaran McLaughlin from Ards.Paul Millar was sacked as manager on May 17th 2007 after less than 15 months in the job, after two successive seasons finishing second in the League behind Linfield. He had the backing of chairman Stafford Reynolds, but the majority of the board (and fans) wanted his departure. Fans were disappointed with the style of football displayed by the team in the later months of his reign. Poor displays in the second half of the 2006/2007 season would see Glentoran drop a 5-point lead at the top of the Carnegie Irish Premier League, finishing with an 8-point deficit behind rivals Linfield.On May 24th 2007 former Crusaders and Glenavon manager Roy Walker was appointed as Glentoran manager along with assistant manager Billy Sinclair. Walker previously led Crusaders to two league titles in 1995 and 1997. After leaving football management for 7 years Walker became a football analyst with BBC Radio Ulster. He was quoted in saying "Glentoran were my boyhood team and are probably the only club which could have attracted me back." BBC News: Walker takes over as Glens bossHowever, on May 26th 2007 it was revealed that Walker may not be able to take up the post, due to not possessing the necessary UEFA coaching qualifications. BBC News: Walker unable to take Glens jobLess than one week later Glentoran appointed head coach Alan McDonald as manager. Roy Walker was offered a place on the board but stated in the Belfast Telegraph that he would not accept the offer until director of football Tom Dick stood down. Mr Dick then did so, but also criticised the club chairman Stafford Reynolds. Reynolds replied with a statement confirming that he would step down, but only if the right man could be found to take over. Alan McDonald, the new manager, has so far secured former Glentoran player Rory Hamill, Daryl Fordyce from Portsmouth, winger Jamie McGovern from West Bromwich Albion and Dungannon Swifts winger David Scullion and has given Chris Morgan and Tim McCann new contracts. Darren Lockhart left the club at the same time to join Crusaders on a one year load deal along with defender Gary Smith. In January Glentoran managed to bring in Shane Mcabe from Dungannon and Darren Boyce from Coleraine[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/article2670537.ece Belfast Telegraph]Redevelopmentand the Detroit Cougars.]] In March 2003, the club's board of directors advised the shareholders of Glentoran Recreation Company Ltd to sell the Oval to a property development holding company called Girona. To date no new ground has materialised. A campaign waged by a group of volunteer supporters called Rest In East, was then set up to keep the club in east Belfast. The club's Board of directors have suggested moving close to a town called Comber, well outside the city bounds of Belfast, which the majority of supporters firmly oppose.On November 3, 2005 a fans forum voted 417-0 in favour of forming Glentoran Community Trust, the first supporters' trust to be formed in Northern Ireland. It was officially formed on 15 May, 2006 and registered with the Registry of Companies Belfast under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1965 -1978. The trust sits completely independent of the parent club, giving the ordinary non-shareholding supporter a voice.IFA On the 29th January 2008, the GCT took another historic step in giving the fans a voice, when one of its members, Stephen Henderson was elected to the board of directors by the shareholders of Glentoran FC.TriviaIn 1995 Glentoran played their traditional Boxing Day match against Linfield on a snow-covered pitch. In the first half the orange ball was damaged, and not having a replacement the teams were forced to play with a white ball for the remainder of the game. The incident was used as a "What Happened Next" question on the BBC's A Question of Sport.youtube videoThe 1985 Irish Cup final between the big two saw another famous incident. Glentoran supporters brought a cockerel, the club's emblem, to the match. Glentoran supporters also brought a pig, painted in the blue of rivals Linfield. The two animals stayed on the sidelines for the duration of the match. Glentoran fans also brought a cockerel to the 2006 Irish Cup final, it too stayed on the sidelines for the duration, Glentoran eventually won the game 2-1 to maintain their unbeaten post-war record against Linfield in Irish Cup finals. This run of 5 victories over Linfield in post-war finals which started in 1966 continued until Glentoran's defeat in the 2006 final.[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1606907,00.html Observer]In Roy Coyle's first cup final in charge he gave up the right to lead the team out, instead he asked long serving Kitman Teddy Horner have this honour.HonoursSenior honoursIrish League: 221893/94, 1896/97, 1904/05, 1911/12, 1912/13, 1920/21, 1924/25, 1930/31, 1950/51, 1952/53, 1963/64, 1966/67, 1967/68, 1969/70, 1971/72, 1976/77, 1980/81, 1987/88, 1991/92, 1998/99, 2002/03, 2004/05Irish Cup: 201913/14, 1916/17, 1920/21, 1931/32, 1932/33, 1934/35, 1950/51, 1965/66, 1972/73, 1982/83, 1984/85, 1985/86, 1986/87, 1987/88, 1989/90, 1995/96, 1997/98, 1999/00, 2000/01, 2003/04Irish League Cup: 61988/89, 1990/91, 2000/01, 2002/03, 2004/05, 2006/07City Cup: 181896/97, 1898/99, 1910/11, 1911/12, 1913/14, 1914/15, 1915/16, 1916/17, 1918/19, 1931/32, 1950/51, 1952/53, 1956/57, 1964/65, 1966/67, 1969/70, 1972/73, 1974/75Gold Cup: 151916/17, 1941/42, 1950/51, 1959/60, 1961/62, 1965/66, 1976/77, 1977/78, 1982/83, 1986/87, 1991/92, 1994/95, 1998/99, 1999/00, 2000/01Ulster Cup: 91950/51, 1952/53, 1966/67, 1976/77, 1981/82, 1982/83, 1983/84, 1988/89, 1989/90Floodlit Cup: 21987/88, 1989/90County Antrim Shield: 251900/01, 1901/02, 1910/11, 1915/16, 1917/18, 1924/25, 1930/31, 1939/40, 1940/41, 1943/44, 1949/50, 1950/51, 1951/52, 1956/57, 1967/68, 1970/71, 1977/78, 1984/85, 1986/87, 1998/99, 1999/00, 2000/01, 2001/02, 2002/03, 2007/08Vienna Cup: 11913/14Inter-city Cup: 11943/44Blaxnit Cup: 11972/73Intermediate honoursIrish League B Division/B Division Section 2/Reserve League: 91958/59†, 1985/86†, 1986/87†, 1989/90†, 1992/93†, 1995/96†, 1997/98†, 2001/02†, 2002/03†Irish Intermediate Cup: 91894/95†, 1898/99†, 1909/10†, 1913/14†, 1916/17†, 1918/19†, 1931/32†, 1941/42†, 1962/63†Steel &amp; Sons Cup: 91904/05†, 1908/09†, 1910/11†, 1914/15†, 1918/19†, 1932/33†, 1937/38†, 1957/58†, 1965/66†, 1966/67†, 1989/90†, 2000/01†, 2001/02†† Won by Glentoran II (reserve teamJunior honoursIrish Junior Cup: 11889/90†† Won by Glentoran II (reserve teamCurrent squad                              Notable former playersBilly BinghamDanny BlanchflowerGary BlackledgeBarney BowersTommy BriggsTommy BreenWalter BruceBilly CaskeyJim ClearyLiam CoylePeter DohertyAlex ElderStuart ElliottJohnny JamesonAndy KennedyAndy KirkGlen LittleJimmy McAlindenGary McCartneyJimmy McIlroyCon MartinTerry MooreGerry MullanFred RobertsAlex YoungChris WalkerReferencesExternal linksOfficial Glentoran FC WebsiteGlentoran Community Trust - the first ever Supporters Trust in Northern IrelandRest in East - Fans' Campaign to keep the club in East BelfastForza TV - Glentoran Match Highlights &amp; InterviewsBallymacGSC.com - Popular Supporters Club Website &amp; Away Bus InformationIrish Football Club Projectnifootball.co.uk (fixtures, results and tables of all leagues in Northern Ireland)    Category:Sport in Belfast Category:Glentoran F.C.
