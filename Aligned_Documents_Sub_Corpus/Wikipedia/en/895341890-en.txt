  is a Japanese hard rock duo comprised of  and Koshi Inaba (稲葉 浩志 Inaba Kōshi, lyrics, vocals).They have released 41 consecutive #1 singles, 23 #1 albums, and sold more than 77 million records in Japan alone.ORICON STYLE: B'z got their 22nd #1 album, ranked No.1 in history and dominates all the 6 main ranking sections. Under the recommendation of Steve Vai, B'z were the first artists from Asia to have their handprints and signatures put up in the Hollywood's RockWalk.Duo B'z enters L.A. Rockwalk The Japan Times HistoryEarly works: 1988-1990Tak Matsumoto, who was already a professional guitarist, has been extremely busy with various recording sessions and live performances. On May 21, 1988, Tak released his first solo album, Thousand Wave. He saw this as a finishing of a chapter as a solo guitarist, and began his search for band members. He later met vocalist Koshi Inaba, who would later start the band with him. At the time, Japan's music scene was loaded with many new bands being created. With all the digital sounds in mainstream music, the only sounds that they felt could not be expressed and replicated were the guitar and the human voice. As a result, they decided to keep it a two-man unit. On September 21 1988, B'z, with their first album, B’z, and single, "Dakara Sono Te Wo Hanashite (だからその手を離して)", made their debut. Their music was very much a product of its times, with synthesizers and samplers sharing equal time with Tak's guitar, producing an experimental sound, very different from their well-known hard rock sound of today.Instead of immediately performing live after a debut, as many Japanese bands were doing, B'z chose to have a clear vision of how they wanted to perform and decided to wait until they had enough material to play for at least 90 minutes. The two concentrated on recording, raising the quality of their music. Their efforts resulted in a second album, Off the Lock, released on May 21, 1989. With this second album came their first series of live performances known better to their fans as "Live-Gym". "Live-Gym #00" started in Nagoya, continuing into Osaka, and finishing in Tokyo. Tickets were sold out on the day they became available. On October 21, their first mini album, Bad Communication was released. The title track was a blend of rock and dance music, and was still a classic to their "Live-Gyms." Their first nationwide tour, B'z Live-Gym #001, finished with 16 shows around the country.On February 21, 1990, the third album Break Through was released. To promote it, they started a tour with 22 shows nationwide. Their single "Taiyō no Komachi Angel," was released on June 13 and was able to peak at #1 on the Oricon Chart. Since the release of the single, each of their singles have since debut at #1 on the Oricon charts. Wicked Beat, their second mini album, was then released on June 21. In contrast to the many promotional efforts for Break Through, Wicked Beat received little promotion and the duo went back to the studio and began recording. Their 4th album, Risky was released on November 7 and went platinum. Their "Risky" tour, totaling 49 performances, also started in November. Their first music video, Film Risky, was recorded in New York and London within 4 weeks, and was released on December 16. With a barrage of releases, 1990 came to be the busiest year for B'z.Transitioning into hard rock music: 1991-1992The third mini album, Mars was released on May 29, 1991. Little promotion was done for it and after releasing only two singles, B'z released their fifth album, In the Life, on November 27. The release of the album marked B'z shielding away from their advanced-digitally sounds and more towards rock. Their first live video, "Just Another Life" was out on December 11. For promotion, B'z also embarked on their "In the Life '91-'92" tour, with 66 performances total. The tour started in December and manage to flow into the next year. The total number of "Live-Gym" they did during this year exceeded 100.In the summer of 1992, the "Pleasure '92-Time" tour took place with 12 performances in 3 major cities. The arena-class tour had amazing features such as: a huge lighting set, called the "Starfish", and seats that rotated 360 degrees. October 28 marked the release of their sixth album, Run, and proved to be more hard rock oriented than the previous. On December 9, they released a slightly different mini album Friends. Different from Run, its concept is somewhat similar to that of a movie soundtrack.Switching to blues: 1993-1994In the early 1993, the "Run" tour concluded after 49 performances in 21 locations. In the following year, they held an open-air concert for the first time, called "Jap the Ripper". The show took place in Bentenjima of Hamamatsu-city, Shizuoka on July 31 and August 1. The successful event gathered 50 thousand people per day, totaling 100,000 people in the end. Following this, B'z concentrated on recording once again, this time, producing a two-disc seventh album, The 7th Blues. The album title not only came from it being their seventh album, but also after the seventh chord, that is frequently used in Blues. Becoming much more "bluesier" and soulful, this album evidently shows their lean towards blues, the roots of rock music.On February 9, 1994 the "B'z Live-Gym '94 - The 9th Blues" tour started. The tour became their longest and biggest tour thus far, managing 87 performances in the year. During the tour, the album, The 7th Blues, was released on March 2. The tour finished in Sapporo's Tsukisamu Green Dome on December 24. This album was a kind of "fans trap", because they made it to "clean" their fandom and just keep the rock and blues loving people with them.Adopting J-pop: 1995-1998In the first half of 1995, B'z spent their time recording and after creating numerous demos, they held the "Pleasure '95 Buzz Stadium" tour with 12 shows in 7 cities. Their eighth album, Loose, was released on November 22. Loose was concentrated on the original concept of a two-man band. While combining rock with pop sounds, this album is well balanced with a variety of sounds. The album sold over 3 million copies, marking it as the best seller for B'z.The B'z Live-Gym '96 "Spirit Loose" tour, started on March 15, 1996 and held 44 performances in 21 locations. The show opened featuring a short B'z action movie, shot in Los Angeles. A short while afterwards, B'z released their 6th mini-album titled Friends II on November 25. The album displayed more of an adult oriented rock.On January 29, 1997, member Inaba's first solo album, Magma, was released. He had been recording the album since the previous year, writing all the music and lyrics. The album, which topped the charts, showcased another side of him, different from that of his usual image in B'z. In March, the dome tour "Pleasure '97 Fireball" consisted of 9 performances in 5 locations. Tickets for each dome, which have a capacity of about 30 to 50 thousand people each, were all sold out. The tour included stops at Tokyo (3 nights), Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Maebashi, all being successful. On November 19, their ninth full album Survive showcased yet another new direction in sound and style.B'z's first promotional effort for the album included performances in concert halls in Akita, Hakodate, Kōchi, Shiga, and Nagasaki, before plunging into the main tour. "B'z Live-Gym '98 Survive" started on January 24 1998. On May 20, B'z released their first official compilation album, B'z The Best &quot;Pleasure&quot;, which also marked their 10th year since debuting. Every song included in this album was a huge hit, and was highly acclaimed and its first shipment had sold more copies than any other Japanese artist in history. On June 6, the "Survive" tour had successfully ended.Going hiatus: 1998-1999In the mid 1998, B'z entered a period of both rest and recording. Both Tak and Koshi had wanted to start on their own solo projects since the "Survive" tour, and finally got a chance to begin. During the period, on September 20, their second best-of album, B'z The Best &quot;Treasure&quot; was released. After a lengthy period, on December 16, Koshi released his first solo maxi single, "Toku-made."Though not much activity were involve with the bang in the beginning of 1999, Tak released his first solo maxi single, "The Changing" on March 25, marking it as being the first time he ever sung on a released record. The single entered in at No. 2 its first week on the charts. On April 14, he released the album, Knockin' "T" Around, which contains many other tracks with full vocals and also includes, the Formula-1 '99 theme song, Go Further. The album has both instrumental and vocal tracks. However, even before the release of the album, B'z had already started recording again.Returning to the music scene: 1999-2000B'z started off the year of 1999 by busily promoting their recent singles and their tenth album Brotherhood, which was released on July 14. In July, another dome-class tour began starting in Sapporo. The title of the tour, B'z Live-Gym '99 "Brotherhood" included 14 performances in 7 locations. They did away with extra stage acts and concentrated on their musical performance, playing songs from the new album and many hits from the past. On August 28 and 29, they played in the Yokohama International Stadium. B'z concert was the first ever to be held in this stadium and gathered a stunning 140,000 people in just two days. Although the second day at Yokohama experienced heavy rain, the tour ended successfully. Shortly afterward, B'z started recording again and continued to do so throughout the rest of the year without rest.On February 23 2000, they released the album B'z The &quot;Mixture&quot;, which included re-mastered tracks of past songs, songs from past singles that were not the featured track, remixes, and a new song.
