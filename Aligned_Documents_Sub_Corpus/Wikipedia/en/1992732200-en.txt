The Temple of Saturn (Latin: Templum Saturni or Aedes Saturnus) is a monument to the agricultural deity Saturn that stands at the western end of the Forum Romanum in Rome. It represents the oldest surviving structure in that area, having been established between 501 and 498 BC.ArcheologyGradual collapse has left nothing but the remains of the front portico standing, but the eight surviving columns and partially intact pediment (displaying the inscription Senatus Populusque Romanus incendio consumptum restituit, meaning "The Senate and People of Rome restored what fire had consumed") represent one of the iconic images of Rome's ancient architectural heritage.HistorySome sources attribute it to the King Tarquinius Superbus, others to Lucius Furius, although the latter dedication could belong to a reconstruction after the fire set by the Gauls (early 4th century BC).It was also called 'Aerarium', because the Roman national treasure was kept there. The temple marks the beginning of the Clivus Capitolinus, the old road that takes you up the hill of the Capitol.The present ruins represent the third incarnation of the Temple of Saturn, replacing the second incarnation destroyed in the fire of 283 CE.InteriorAccording to the sources, the statue of the god in the interior, veiled and provided with a scythe, was wooden and filled with oil. The legs were covered with linen bents, which were released only on December 17, the day of the Saturnalia.While dedicated to the god Saturn, the temple's chief use was as the seat of the treasury of the Roman Republic (aerarium),Site for course on Temples of Castor and Pollux and Saturn storing the Republic's reserves of gold and silver. Also the state archives, the insignia and the official scale for the weighing of metals were housed in the temple. Later, the aerarium was moved to another building, while the archives were transferred to the nearby Tabularium. The temple's podium, in concrete covered with travertine, was used for bill-posting.==Notes==  Category:5th century BC architecture Category:3rd century architecture Category:Ancient Roman architecture Saturn Category:Central banks Category:Defunct banksbs:Hram Saturna cs:Saturnův chrám de:Tempel des Saturn es:Templo de Saturno fr:Temple de Saturne it:Tempio di Saturno he:מקדש סטורנוס hu:Saturnus temploma nl:Tempel van Saturnus pl:Świątynia Saturna pt:Templo de Saturno ru:Храм Сатурна (Римский форум) fi:Saturnuksen temppeli sv:Saturnustemplet
