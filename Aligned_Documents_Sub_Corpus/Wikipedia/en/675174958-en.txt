  Admiral is the rank, or part of the name of the ranks, of the highest naval officers. It is usually considered a full admiral (equivalent to full general) and above Vice Admiral and below Admiral of the Fleet/Fleet Admiral. It is usually abbreviated to "Adm." or "ADM". Where relevant, Admiral is a 4 star rank.HistoryThe word Admiral in Middle English comes from Anglo-French amiral, "commander", from Medieval Latin admiralis, "emir", admirallus, "admiral", from Arabic amir-al-'' أمير الـ, "commander of the" (as in ''amir-al-bahr أمير البحر, "commander of the sea")Merriam-Webster on-line dictionary Crusaders learned the term during their encounters with the Arabs, perhaps as early as the 11th century. The Sicilians and later Genoese took the first two parts of the term and used them as one word, amiral, from their Catalan opponents. The French and Spanish gave their sea commanders similar titles while in Portuguese the word changed to almirante. As the word was used by people speaking Latin or Latin-based languages it gained the "d" and endured a series of different endings and spellings leading to the English spelling "admyrall" in the 14th century and to "admiral" by the 16th century.Although temporary navies were established for engagement in naval battles beforehand, the Chinese established their first permanent, standing navy in 1132 AD, during the Song Dynasty. China's main headquarters and office for the admiral at that point was established at Dinghai, with the main base near what is now modern Shanghai.The word Admiral has today come to be almost exclusively associated with the highest naval rank in most of the world's navies, equivalent to the Army rank of (Full) General.The rank of Admiral has also been subdivided into various grades, several of which are historically extinct while others are used by most present day navies. The Royal Navy used colours (red, white, and blue, in descending order) to indicate the seniority of its admirals until 1864; for example, Horatio Nelson's highest rank was Vice Admiral of the White. The generic term for these naval equivalents of army generals is Flag Officer. Some navies have also used army-type titles for them, such as the Cromwellian General at Sea.Admiral insignia by country Image:RAN-Admiral-shoulder.gif|Australian admiralRoyal Australian Navy Image:Navy sleeve Adm.png|Canadian admiral Canadian Forces Maritime Command Image:Arlmirante armada chile.jpeg|Chilean Admiral Chilean Navy Image:China-Navy-Admiral.gif|Admiral of People's Republic of China People's Liberation Army Navy Image:UK-Navy-OF9.gif|Danish admiral (Denmark) Suomen Merivoimat -- Image:Grade-amiral.svg|French admiral Marine Nationale Image:GE-NAVY-OF-9 Adm.png|German admiralDeutsche Marine Image:IT-Navy-OF-10.png|Italian admiral Italian Navy Image:Almirante hombrera SEMAR.gif| Mexican admiral Mexican Navy Royal Netherlands Navy -- Image:POL PMW pagon1 admirał.svg|Polish admiralMarynarka Wojenna Image:RO-Navy-OF-10s.png|Romanian admiralForţele Navale Române  Image:SP Almirante General.gif|Spanish admiral Armada Española Image:Ukraine Admiral shoulderboard.svg|Ukrainian admiral Ukrainian Navy Image:UK-Navy-OF9.svg|UK admiralSleeve laceRoyal Navy Image:OF9 RN ADM new.gif|UK admiralShoulder boardRoyal Navy Image:US Navy O10 insignia.svg|US admiral (US Navy)See alsoComparative military ranksNebraska admiralReferences  Category:Admirals Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Naval ranksar:أمير البحر az:Admiral bs:Admiral bg:Адмирал ca:Almirall cs:Admirál da:Admiral (søofficer) de:Admiral et:Admiral es:Almirante eo:Admiralo fa:دریادار fr:Amiral gd:Àrd-mharaiche hr:Admiral id:Laksamana it:Ammiraglio he:אדמירל lv:Admirālis hu:Tengernagy ml:അഡ്മിറല്‍ ms:Laksamana nl:Admiraal ja:海軍大将 no:Admiral nn:Admiral pl:Admirał pt:Almirante ro:Amiral ru:Адмирал sq:Admirali scn:Ammiragghiu sk:Admirál sl:Admiral fi:Amiraali sv:Amiral vi:Đô đốc tr:Amiral uk:Адмірал ur:امیر البحر zh:海軍上將
