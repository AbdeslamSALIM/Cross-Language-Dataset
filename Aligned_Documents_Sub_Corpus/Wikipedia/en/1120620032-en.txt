 foot_notes     = | OJSC Gazprom, (; long version: Открытое Aкционерное Oбщество Газпром; sometimes transcribed as Gasprom)Gazprom is a contraction of 'Газовая промышленность' (Gazovaya Promyshlennost), meaning 'gas industry'. is the largest Russian company. Gazprom is publicly traded as   ; . Gazprom is the largest extractor of natural gas in the world. With sales of US$31 billion in 2004, it accounts for about 93 percent of Russian natural gas production; with reserves of 28,800 km³, it controls 16 percent of the world's gas reserves (as of 2004Numbers from the Financial Times: "Energy of the State", March 14 2006; older data is available online at Gazprom reserve statistics, including the Shtokman field.) After acquisition of the oil company Sibneft, Gazprom, with  of reserves, ranks behind only Saudi Arabia, with , and Iran, with , as the world's biggest owner of oil and oil equivalent in natural gas. By the end of 2004 Gazprom was the sole gas supplier to at least Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Finland, Macedonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Slovakia, and provided 97 percent of Bulgaria's gas, 89 percent of Hungary's, 86 percent of Poland's, nearly three-quarters of the Czech Republic's, 67 percent of Turkey's, 65 percent of Austria's, about 40 percent of Romania's, 36 percent of Germany's, 27 percent of Italy's, and 25 percent of France's. The European Union as a whole gets about 25 percent of its gas supplies from this company.Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Apart from its gas reserves and the world's longest pipeline network (150,000 km), it also controls assets in banking, insurance, media, construction and agriculture.As measured by its market capitalization as of May 2008 (US$348 billion),http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7140744&lt;/ref&gt; Gazprom is the world's third largest corporation.Reuters: Gazprom overtakes China Mobile as world No.3 stockBloomberg: Gazprom Passes GE, China Mobile, Becomes World No. 3 Former Gazprom chairman Dmitry Medvedev hopes that the company's market capitalization will quadruple to reach one trillion dollars by 2017, and that this would make it the world's biggest corporation.Russia's Gazprom Plans Pipeline to Italy | All American Patriots&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;History1989-1992: InceptionA separate Soviet gas industry was created in 1943. Large natural gas reserves discovered in Siberia, Ural and Volga region in the 1970s and 1980s enabled the Soviet Union to become a major gas producer. Gas exploration, development, and distribution were centralized in a state ministry.In July 1989 President, Mikhail Gorbachev merged the ministries for oil and gas as part of his economic reforms, into a single industry, the Ministry of the Oil and Gas Industry of the USSR. A separate Soviet gas industry was again created in the early 1990s, before the break up of the USSR. In September 1990, the Gazprom board discussed transforming Gazprom into a joint-stock company. In 1991-92 talks were held between Russia, Ukraine and Belarus over creating a tripartite joint-stock company with all three states holding shares.The plan, however, was abandoned by June 1992, and Gazprom in Russia became a state company. In November 1992, Gazprom became a joint-stock company (Russian: OAO), and it was to be partly privatized as a single unit. In contrast, the oil monopoly was initially broken up into three separate companies before privatization. Gazprom was privatized in 1994, with the state holding 40 percent of shares. 15 percent were to be sold to workers and management at preferential prices. The leadership of Gazprom was able to keep control over privatisation by ensuring that sales of shares took place at closed auctions, with the company determining who could attend the auctions. Viktor Chernomyrdin and Nikolay Tsvyk headed Gazprom.1993-1997: PrivatizationAfter the new Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Chernomyrdin to be his Prime Minister in December 1992, the political influence of Gazprom increased markedly. On January 26, 1993, Rem Viakhirev became the Chairman of both the Board of Director and Managing Committee.As the new government was committed to economic reform, Gazprom began to be privatized, becoming a joint-stock company according to the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of November 51992 and the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation of February 171993, and starting to distribute shares under the voucher method, where every Russian citizen received vouchers to purchase shares of formerly state-owned companies. However, trading these shares was heavily regulated, and the by-laws of the company prohibited foreigners to own more than 9 percent of the shares.Gazprom slowly established credibility in the western capital markets with an offering of one percent of its equity to foreigners in October 1996 in the form of Global Depository Receipts and a successful large bond issue of US$2.5 billion in 1997.On the second annual shareholders' meeting on May 31, 1996, Alexander Kazakov, the chairman of Russia's State Property Committee, was appointed the Chairman of the Board of Directors, as the Russian law on JSC required the Chairman of the Board of Director and the Chairman of the Managing Committee positions to be occupied by different persons.1998-2000: ScandalsIn 1998 Chernomyrdin was fired from his position of Russia's Prime Minister by President Boris Yeltsin. At the same time, the Russian government suddenly started demanding billions of dollars in back taxes from Gazprom. When tax prosecutors started to seize assets of Gazprom, the company gave in and paid. The company's records started showing a loss for the first time. The reasons are unclear and were explained either by an aging pipeline transport network, corruption, or pre-existing losses that appeared because of more transparent accounting policies.Gazprom conducted dubious transactions with the gas-trading company Itera and a Gazprom/Itera joint-venture, Purgaz, in the late 1990s, which allegedly benefited various management members and their relatives. Additionally, large-scale asset-stripping of Gazprom was going on by corrupt management and board members through various transactions involving the Gazprom daughter Stroytransgaz and the regional gas company Sibneftegaz. The Gazprom auditor PwC apparently had signed off and covered these transactions.Gazprom: Russia's Enron?, BusinessWeek online, February 18, 2002The investment fund Hermitage Capital Management, a minority shareholder of Gazprom, reported on the scandals in October 2000: "Investors are valuing this company as if 99 percent of its assets have been stolen. The real figure is around 10 percent so that's good news".Gazprom and Hermitage Capital: Shareholder Activism in Russia, 2002, Stanford Graduate School of Business Case IB-36On the fourth annual shareholders' meeting on June 26, 1998, Farit Gazizullin, the new Chairman of Russia's State Property Committee, was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.On the fifth annual shareholders' meeting on June 30, 1998, Viktor Chernomyrdin became the Chairman of the Board of Directors.On the seventh shareholders' meeting on June 30, 2000 (the sixth took place on August 26, 1999), Deputy Head of Russia's Presidential Administration Dmitry Medvedev occupied this position.2001-2003: Reform yearsRussian President Vladimir Putin was actively pursuing reforms in the management of the company in the years following the scandals. This was aided by shareholder activism by Hermitage CEO William Browder and former Russian finance minister Boris Fyodorov.On May 30, 2001, the Board of Directors replaced Rem Vyakhirev, whose contract had expired, with Alexei Miller as the new CEO to guide the reforms; Rem Viakhirev was moved to the position of Chairman of the Board at the 8th shareholders' meeting on June 29, 2001, temporarily replacing Dmitry Medvedev who became his deputy.In April 2001 Gazprom took over NTV, Russia's only nationwide state-independent television station held by Vladimir Gusinsky's Media-Most holding, which caused major changes in its editorial policy.BBC News | EUROPE | Russian TV station loses freedom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;BBC News | EUROPE | Russian NTV viewers on the streets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;Putin is out to get me, says media tycoon | World news | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; On November 8, 2001 by the decision of a Moscow court of May 4, 2001, a block of shares comprising 25 percent of stock capital of the Media-Most holdings was transferred to Gazprom Media, a media holding founded in 1998 and owned by Gazprom. In July 2002 Gazprom Media acquired all Gusinsky's shares in media companies of the holding, which resulted in dramatic changes of their editorial policy and closure of some publications.BBC News | EUROPE | Russian NTV handed to Gazprom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In June 2005 Gazprom Media purchased the influential Russian newspaper Izvestia.Until 2004, the Russian government held a 38.37 percent stake in the company, and had a majority on the company’s board of directors. Gazprom provides 25 percent of all Russian tax revenues (averaging over US$4 billion annually between 1993-2003) and accounts for 8 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. Non-Russian investors may legally buy Gazprom shares only through Depositary Shares, which cost more than locally-traded shares.In 2004, Putin announced that Gazprom was to acquire the state-owned oil-company Rosneft and that this will "eventually lead to the lifting of foreign ownership restrictions on Gazprom shares," as the stake of the Russian government in Gazprom will rise from 38.37 percent to a controlling position.Hermitage news item about the raising of the stake of the Russian government to a controlling interest in 2004However, Gazprom was foiled both in its attempt to acquire Rosneft, and its earlier attempt to buy the core asset of Yukos, when Yukos filed for bankruptcy in Houston. Fearing that it might fall foul of US law, Gazprom backed away from buying Yukos' main asset when the Russian government auctioned it in December 2004, leaving the more gung-ho Rosneft to buy it. After Rosneft had appropriated such a large and controversial asset, the technicalities of merging it into Gazprom became too complicated. Instead, Rosneft remained independent, to the delight of its own management. The state increased its stake in Gazprom to over 50 percent instead by paying cash for a 10.4% stake, thus fulfilling the main pre-condition for the abolition of restrictions on foreign ownership of Gazprom shares.On July 26, 2004, Gazprom sold 49.979% out of its 100 percent share of the SOGAZ insurance group to an unnamed purchaser for 1.69 billion Russian rubles,Новости компании - Rusbonds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; and 26 percent more of SOGAZ in August 2004 for 879.3 million rubles.Who sold SOGAZ? by Pavel miledin et al., Vedomosti #144 (1184), August 132004 (in Russian, subscription required)Новости компании - Rusbonds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; In January 2005 it turned out that ABRos, a subsidiary of Russia Bank, held a 49.97 percent share of SOGAZ.http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml?2005/01/21/85958 SOGAZ sold to St. Pete] by Pavel Miledin et al., Vedomosti #9 (1290), January 212005 (in Russian, subscription required, full text freely available here: http://www.lenpravda.ru/reading1.phtml?id=7787).Новости компании - Rusbonds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;2005-2006Russian Government controlIn June 2005, Gazprombank, Gazpromivest Holding, Gazfond and Gazprom Finance B.

They have been campaigning on the Sakhalin issue for more than five years because of concerns about the fate of the very endangered whales. Construction of an off-shore pipeline near to the feeding ground was completed and monitoring of the whales using photo-identification techniques revealed a number of the whales have become skinny since construction work began, creating fears that their feeding habits are being disrupted.

Since the activity of SEIC was put under strict control of the Russian environmental watchdog, Rosprirodnadzor, which IFAW and other world renowned NGOs have been insisting on for the last six years.
