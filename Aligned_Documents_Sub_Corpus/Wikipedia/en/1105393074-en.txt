]] An activity diagram is a diagram that shows activities and actions to describe workflows.Glossary of Key Terms at McGraw-hill.com. Retrieved 20 July 2008. In the Unified Modeling Language an activity diagram represents the business and operational step-by-step workflows of components in a system. An activity diagram shows the overall flow of control.OverviewIn SysML the activity diagram has been extended to indicate flows among steps that convey physical element (e.g., gasoline) or energy (e.g., torque, pressure). Additional changes allow the diagram to better support continuous behaviors and continuous data flows.In UML 1.x, an activity diagram is a variation of the UML State diagram in which the "states" represent activities, and the transitions represent the completion of those activities.ConstructionActivity diagrams are typically used for business process modeling. They consist of:Initial node.Activity final node.ActivitiesThe starting point of the diagram is the initial node, and the activity final node is the ending. An activity diagram can have zero or more activity final nodes. In between activities are represented by rounded rectangles.See alsoFlowchartControl flow graphData flow diagramEvent-driven process chainState diagramPseudocodeReferencesExternal linksUML 2.0 Specification DocumentsIntroduction to UML 2 Activity DiagramsUML 2 Activity Diagram GuidelinesUML 2 Activity and Action ModelsCategory:UML diagrams Category:SysMLde:Aktivitätsdiagramm es:Diagrama de actividades fr:Diagramme d'activité it:Activity diagram lt:Veiklos diagrama nl:Activiteitendiagram pl:Diagram aktywności pt:Diagrama de atividade sk:Diagram aktivít fi:Aktiviteettikaavio tr:Faaliyet Diyagramı uk:Діаграма діяльності
