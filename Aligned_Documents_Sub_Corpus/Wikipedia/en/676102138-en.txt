It is located 6.4 km. (4 miles) from the center of Paris. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe.NameThe name Levallois-Perret comes from two housing developments (Village Levallois and Champerret) started by landowner Jean-Jacques Perret in 1822 (Champerret) and developer Nicolas-Eugène Levallois in 1845 (Village Levallois), and which resulted in the incorporation of the commune (see history section below).HistoryOn the territory of what is now Levallois-Perret there existed before the French Revolution the village of Villiers and the hamlet of Courcelles (aka La Planchette), which left their names to two Paris Métro stations. At the time of the creation of French communes during the French Revolution, these were part of the commune of Clichy, while the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine extended over what is now the southwestern part of Levallois-Perret.Landowner Jean-Jacques Perret started some housing developments in 1822 in the northeast of the commune of Neuilly-sur-Seine, in a place soon called Champerret ("champ perret" meaning "field of Perret"), which gave its name to one station of the Paris Métro. Later in 1845 Nicolas-Eugène Levallois started some housing developments for landowner André Noël on his land near La Planchette (in the commune of Clichy). The land developed by Nicolas-Eugène Levallois soon became know as the Village Levallois.In the 1860s the Village Levallois and Champerret had grown to the point of forming a single built-up area. Several demands were made to the authorities for the incorporation of the area as a commune.On June 30, 1866 the commune of Levallois-Perret was eventually created by detaching that part of the territory of Clichy where the Village Levallois stood and merging it with that part of the territory of Neuilly-sur-Seine where stood Champerret.Levallois-Perret became an important center of the early French automotive industry with the implantation of companies such as Clément-Bayard, Delage or the coachbuilder Chapron. Citroën purchased the Clément-Bayard factory and the famous Citroën 2CV was produced in Levallois for nearly forty years. Levallois-Perret was also an important centre of cosmetics industry in the early 20th century. It is also home to the large European commercial real estate company Atisreal.The Northern part of famous Ile de la Jatte in river Seine where French impressionist painters created many of their master pieces, is part of the commune of Levallois-Perret.DemographicsImmigrationTwin citiesMolenbeek-Saint-Jean (Belgium)the Schöneberg district, Berlin (Germany)Nearest municipalitiesClichyNeuilly-sur-SeineAsnieresCourbevoieParisAdministrationLevallois-Perret is divided in two cantons:Levallois-Perret-Nord (North), includes a part of Levallois-Perret and Clichy (pop: 40,400)Levallois-Perret-Sud (South), a part of (pop: 36,532)TransportLevallois-Perret is served by three stations on Paris Métro Line 3: Louise Michel, Anatole France, and Pont de Levallois&amp;nbsp;– Bécon.It is also served by Clichy&amp;nbsp;– Levallois station on the Transilien Paris&amp;nbsp;– Saint-Lazare suburban rail line.The municipality of Levallois-Perret operates two free bus lines circulating the town.MiscellaneousThe City's [[Coat of Arms]]The traditional coat of arms for the city puts emphasis on the importance of industry in the city's history.
