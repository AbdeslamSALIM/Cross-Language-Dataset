 Bellinzona (bɛllin'dzoːna in French Bellinzone bɛlɛ̃'zon, in archaic German Bellenz 'belents and Bilitio bi'litsjo in Latin) is the capital city of the canton Ticino in Switzerland. The city is famous for its three castles (Castelgrande, Montebello, Sasso Corbaro) that are UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 2000. It is the 45th largest city of Switzerland.GeographyThe city lies east of the Ticino River, at the foot of the Alps. It stretches along the river valley, surrounded by the Saint Gotthard massif.HistoryBellinzona has always occupied an important geographic location in the Alps. Several key alpine passes, including the Nufenen, St. Gotthard, Lukmanier, San Bernardino and the Poebene, all meet in the area around Bellinzona making it a key trading center.While the region has been occupied since the early Neolithic ageOfficial Website-Prehistoric Settlement accessed July 7, 2008, see also  it wasn't until the late 1st Century BC that a fort was built in the area during the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. While the fort fell into disrepair in the following centuries, it was rebuilt and greatly expanded in the 4th Century AD. During the reign of Diocletian and Constantin a chain of castles and watchtowers were built to protect northern Italy from invasion. Bellinzona's location was recognized as a key point in the defenses and a large castle was built to protect the walls. The town that grew up around the fortifications was known as Bilitio.Following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire the successor states, which included the Ostrogoths around 500 AD, the eastern Byzantine Empire towards the middle of the 6th Century, and the Longobards from 568/70, all took control of Bellinzona and used the castle to assert control of the surrounding passes. Under the Longobards, Bellinzona became the site of a permanent garrison to protect the region from raids by the neighboring Frankish and Alemannic tribes. From Bellinzona the Longobards controlled the traffic on the important trade route from Varese over Ponte Tresa, the Monte Ceneri Pass, Biasca and finally over the Lukmanier Pass into Chur. Some researchers believe that Bellinzona may have been the capital of a county that included most of the valleys in Ticino.At around 774 the Frankish Kingdom (that would become the Carolingian Empire) gained control of the Ticino valley including Bellinzona.About 2 centuries later the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, seeking to restore the power of glory of ancient Rome and expand into Italy, opened the Lukmanier and St. Bernard passes. Control of Bellinzona was a key part of this expansion. The city was taken from Milan and given as a gift to the Bishop of Como, who supported the Ottonian dynasty. In 1002, following the death of Otto III, Marquis Arduino of Ivrea declared himself King of Italy and ratified the bishop's ownership of the Castelgrande and the city. Two years later, after Arduino had been defeated by Henry II the King of Germany, Henry II's man Enrico II reratified the gift of the Castlegrande on the Bishop of ComoOfficial Website-High Middle Ages. The city is mentioned in medieval sources in 1218 as Bilizione.During the Investiture Controversy of the late 11th Century the city of Bellinzona with its castle came under the control of the Hohenstaufens of Swabia. However, in 1180, Frederick I  The Three Castles, officially listed as the Three Castles, Defensive Wall and Ramparts of the Market-Town of Bellinzone, have been an UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2000. The group is composed of Castelgrande, castle Montebello, castle Sasso Corbaro and fortified walls. The Castelgrande is located on a rocky peak overlooking the valley, with a series of fortified walls that protect the old city and connect to the Montebello. The third castle (Sasso Corbaro) is located on a isolated rocky promontory south-east of the other twoUNESCO listing for Bellinzona.''Castelgrande''[[Image:Bellinzona Torre Bianca.JPG|thumb|The Torre Bianca or white tower of the Castelgrande]] The site of the Castelgrande has been fortified since at least the late 1th Century BC and until the 13th Century it was the only fortification in Bellinzona. During its history the castle has been known as the stronghold (before the 13th Century), the Old Castle in the 14-15th Centuries, Un Castle after 1506 and Saint Michael's Castle from 1818Official Website-Castelgrande.The Castelgrande hill includes a nearly vertical side on the north and a steep southern side, but is nearly flat and 150-200m in diameter. The natural shape of the hill has encouraged every man-made fortification to follow the same contours. While the Roman fort is not visible the Roman foundations were used by the High Middle Ages castle which followed. Of the High Middle Ages castle the only visible parts are a few pieces of wall that are still standing. Much of the visible castle dates from 1250-1500 with extensive renovations and some expansion in the last two centuries. Most of the area inside the castle walls is now flat, open space.Records from the 11th to 15th Centuries as well as archeological evidence indicate that the castle grounds were once full of buildings. However most of these were pulled down by the Dukes of Milan to free up interior space. The open space was divided into 3 large baileys which served to provide temporary housing for troops that could be stationed in Bellinzona. Under the Dukes of Milan the outer fortifications were extended and strengthened. The walls were raised, extended and towers were added. The western walls were totally rebuilt and connected to the city walls.[[Image:Bellinzona Castelgrande.JPG|thumb|left|View of Castelgrande from Piazza del Sole]] The castle can be reached by taking an elevator from the foot of the rock to the castle grounds or by climbing steep, narrow streets from the city center through the city wall onto the castle grounds.Montebello[[Image:ChateauMontebelloBellinzona.jpg|thumb|''Montebello'' castle located on a rocky hilltop east of town is connected to Castelgrande by the city walls]]Sasso CorbaroTriviaOn July 21, 1985, Swiss swimming sprinter Dano Halsall set a world record in the 50 m freestyle in Bellinzona's local pool, clocking in at 22.52 seconds.ReferencesExternal linksBellinzona official websiteRabadan carnivalUnesco  Category:Cities in Switzerland Category:Cantonal capitals of Switzerland Category:World Heritage Sites in Switzerland Bellinzona (capital)frp:Belinzona da:Bellinzona de:Bellinzona es:Bellinzona eo:Belinzono eu:Bellinzona fr:Bellinzone hr:Bellinzona id:Bellinzona it:Bellinzona he:בלינצונה la:Bilitio lmo:Belinzona nl:Bellinzona (gemeente) ja:ベッリンツォーナ pms:Belinzòna pl:Bellinzona pt:Bellinzona ro:Bellinzona rm:Bellinzona ru:Беллинцона sq:Belinkona simple:Bellinzona sl:Bellinzona sr:Белинцона fi:Bellinzona sv:Bellinzona uk:Беллінцона vo:Bellinzona zh:貝林佐納
