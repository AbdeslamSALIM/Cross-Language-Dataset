This ended the independent status of the Kingdom of Manipur, the last kingdom to be incorporated into British India.During the Second World War, Manipur was the scene of many fierce battles between the Japanese and Allied forces. The Japanese were beaten back before they could enter Imphal, and this proved to be one of the turning points of the War.After the War, the Manipur Constitution Act, 1947, established a democratic form of government with the Maharaja as the Executive Head and an elected legislature. In 1949, King Prabodhchandra was summoned to Shillong, capital of the Indian province of Assam. He signed a Treaty of Accession, merging the kingdom into India. The legislative assembly was dissolved on the integration of the state with the republic of India in October 1949. Manipur was a union territory from 1956 and later became a full-fledged state in 1972.Maharaja Bhagyachandra, king of Manipur from 1759–98, is a legendary figure in Manipur. The inventor of the Ras Lila dance,Manipuri, The - Banglapedia he is also credited with spreading Vaishnavism in Manipur after his grandfather Pamheiba Rajah made Hinduism the official religion and for creating a unified Manipur. Manipur — Culturalpursuits.com Geography, vegetation and climateGeographyin its upper course in Manipur]] Manipur is one of the eight states of Northeast India, and one of the Seven Sister States. The state is bounded by Nagaland in the North, Mizoram in the South, Assam in the west, and by the borders of the country Myanmar in the east as well as in the south. The state capital of Manipur is Imphal. The state lies at latitude of 23°83’N - 25°68’N and longitude of 93°03’E - 94°78’E. The total area covered by the state is 22,327 sq. km. The capital lies in an oval shaped valley of approximately 700 sq.miles surrounded by blue mountains and is at an elevation of 790 metres above the sea level. The slope of the valley is from north to south. The presence of the mountain ranges not only prevents the cold winds from the north from reaching the valley but also acts as a barrier to the cyclonic storms originating from the Bay of Bengal. Within the State of Manipur, there are two major river basins, viz. the Barak River Basin (Barak Valley) and the Manipur River Basin. The total water resources of the two basins have been estimated to be 1.8487 million hectare metre in the form of annual yield.The Barak river, the largest river of Manipur, originates from the northern hills and is joined by a number of tributaries such as Irang, Maku, Tuivai, etc. and thereafter enters Cachar District of Assam. The Manipur river basin has eight major rivers such as Imphal, Iril, Nambul, Sekmai, Chakpi, Thoubal and Khuga. All these rivers originate from the surrounding hills. Almost all the rivers in the valley area are in the mature stage and, therefore, deposit the load in the Loktak lake.The rivers draining the Manipur Hill Area are comparatively young due to the hilly terrain through which they flow. These rivers are corrosive in nature and assume turbulent form in rainy season. Important rivers draining the western area include Maku, Barak River, Jiri, Irang and Leimatak. Rivers draining the eastern part of the State include Chamu, Khunou and other short streams.Physiographically, Manipur may be characterised in two distinct physical regions - an outlying area of rugged hills and narrow valleys and the inner area represents the features of flat plain topography with all associated land forms. These two areas are not only distinct in respect of physical features but are also conspicuous with regard to various floras and faunas.The valley region would have been a monotonous, featureless plain but for a number of hills and mounds rising above the flat surface. The Loktak lake is an important geographic feature of the central plain area. The total area occupied by all the lakes is about 600 Sq.km. The altitude ranges from 40m at Jiribam to as high as 2,994m at Mt.Iso Peak near Mao above MSL.The soil cover can be divided into two broad types, viz. the red ferruginous soil in the hill area and the alluvium in the valley. The soil generally contains small rock fragments, sand and sandy clay and are of varieties. The top soil on the steep slopes are very thin. In the plain areas, especially flood plains and deltas, the soil is of considerable thickness. Soil on the steep hill slopes is subjected to high erosion resulting into formation of sheets and gullies and barren rock slopes. The normal pH value ranges from 5.4 to 6.8.DistrictsManipur has currently nine administrative districts.DistrictAreaPopulationHeadquartersBishnupur496208368BishnupurChurachandpur4570227905ChurachandpurChandel3313118327ChandelImphal East709394876PorompatImphal West519444382LamphelSenapati3271283621SenapatiTamenglong4391111499TamenglongThoubal514364140ThoubalUkhrul4544140778UkhrulVegetationThe natural vegetation occupies an area of about 14,365 sq. km. which is nearly 64% of the total geographical area of the State. The vegetation consists of a large variety of plants ranging from short and tall grasses, reeds and bamboos to trees of various species. Broadly, there are four types of forests below:Tropical Semi-ever Green.Dry Temperate ForestSub-Tropical PineTropical Moist DeciduousTeak, Pine, Oak, Uningthou, Leihao, Bamboo, Cane, etc. are important forest resources growing in plenty. In addition, rubber, tea, coffee, orange, cardamom, etc. are also, grown in hill areas.Food and cash crops occupy the main vegetation cover in the valley.Climatelying on the border of Manipur and Nagaland has a temperate climate]]  The climate of Manipur is largely influenced by the topography of this hilly region which defines the geography of Manipur. Situated at an elevation of 790 meters above the sea level, the state of Manipur is wedged between hills from all sides. This north eastern corner of India is blessed with a generally amiable climate though the winters can be a little chilly.The maximum temperature recorded in the summer months of Manipur is 32 degree Celsius. In winter the mercury often falls to sub zero temperature making it frosty in the wintertime.Snowfall sometimes occurs in some hilly regions due to the Western Disturbance. The coldest month in Manipur is January and July experiences the maximum summer temperature. The ideal time for tourism in the state, in terms of the climate of Manipur, is from the months of October till February, when the weather remains bright and sunny without the scorch of the sun.The hilly state is drenched in rains from the months of May and continues till the middle of October. It receives an average rainfall of 1467.5 mm, annually. However, the rain distribution varies from 933 mm in Imphal to 2593 mm in Tamenglong. The downpour ranges from light drizzles to heavy showers.The normal rainfall of Manipur enriches the soil and helps in agricultural processes and irrigation. The South Westerly Monsoon picks up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and heads towards Manipur, hits the Eastern Himalaya ranges and produces a massive amount of rain in the state.PopulationManipur has a population of 23.88 lakhs (2001 Census). Of the total population, 58.9% live in the valley and the remaining 41.1% are in the hill areas. The hills are inhabited mainly by the tribals and the valley by the Meiteis (including Meitei Muslims known as Meitei Pangal or Pangal). The distribution of area, population and density, literacy rate, etc. as per the 2001 Census provisional figures are as below:Total Population  	               23,88,634

Courses on Manipuri Language and Literature are offered as a subject up to M.A. level in both Central and State Universities. It is the main language of communication among all different tribes and people inhabiting Manipur. English Language is also slowly gaining ground as a common language of communication here.Meetei Mayek (Manipuri script)Meetei Mayek is a script, commonly referred as Mayek, which is being used since the ancient times. Though it was not in vogue for a certain period, its revival in recent past has gained popularity.Tribal LanguagesThere are 29 different dialects spoken in Manipur. Five main tribal dialects recognised by Government of Manipur for medium of instruction & examination up to class V are :Tangkhul, language of Tangkhul peopleHmar, language of Hmar peoplePaite, language of Paite peopleLushai, language of Lushai peopleThadou/Kuki, language of Kuki peopleTransportationTulihal Airport, the airport of Imphal, connects the state capital with Delhi, Calcutta and Guwahati. National Highway NH-39 links Manipur with the rest of the country through the railway stations at Dimapur in Nagaland at a distance of 215 km. from Imphal. Highway NH-53 connects Manipur with another railway station at Silchar in Assam, which is 269 km. away from Imphal. Road network of Manipur, having a length of 7170 km, connects all the important towns and far off villages.ReligionThe people of Manipur, especially the majority meetei, follow several rites and rituals including Hindus and Bhudhist, which can be traced down to its unique historical past.However,after indept analysis and observation, the universal faith of the majority meetei people can be considered as Sanamahism. Manipur preserves an ancient indigenous religion rich in mythology and colorful in ritual, known today as Sanamahi.Meeteis traditionaly take oath in the name of Sanamahi and Pakhangba the two sons of the creator Taibang Mapu Sidaba, which can translated as the immortal lord of the universe.The Sanamahi faith is consistent with the equality of mankind as enshrined in Islam and Christainity etc. that all man are equal in the eyes of god since man is made on the image of god. It is this similar concept of creation which influanced the seven proto meetei barbarian tribes of Magnang, Luwang, Khuman, Khabagnanba, Angom, Moirang and Chenglei to unite under the nomenclature Meetei. The word Meetei is a combination of two words "Mee" image also human being and "Tei" to guild or mould. It conceptually means created on the image of god. Meeteis have a strong sence of egaliterianism born out of this belief that man is made on the image of god which comes into ideologocal conflict with Hinduism.However, flexible meetei society have successfully absorved some aspects of hindu rites and rituals, myth and mythology. This even influanced not only the day to day life of the meetei but also their literature. Especially the epic stories of Mahabharatta and Ramayanna inculcate into the mind of the meeteis that truth triumph in the end.The sorrounding tribes of Manipur, except for few, have successfully adopted Christainity as a faith while still preserving their ancient culture.The pre-christain tribal folklore has a very rich tradition which is closely connected to the evolution and developement of meetei culture and religion. Even though there are several tribes in Manipur, tribal population can be broadly devided into Naga and Kukis which is a legacy of British colonial administration. In addition to this, there is small Manipuri Muslim community traditionally called the Pagnan. The majority of this Manipuri Muslim community are the descendent of captured Muslim merceneries and meetei women. So, even though, Islam in faith the culture of the Manipuri Muslim are very closedly related to the meeteis.Early meeteis including some tribes were the devotees of a Supreme deity "Lainingthou Soralel" following the footprint of their Godly ancestors. That particular kind of ancestor worship and animism, with the central focus of worship on Umang Lai - that is, local governing deities worshipped in sacred groves. Some of the local gods(Lais) they worship are Atiya Sidaba, Pakhangba, Sanamahi, Leimaren, Oknarel, Panganba, Thangjing, Marjing, Wangbaren, Koubru. The religious life of the people, even when they adopted Hinduism,retained many characteristics inherited from their prehistoric ancestors. The essentials of this religion remain recognizable to the present day. Hinduism has a long tradition in Manipur, however Vaisnavism penetrated Manipur during the reign of King Kyamba and King Khagemba in the 15th century. Towards the end of the 17th century and at the advent of the 18th century, a great force of the Neo-Vaisnavism (Gaudiya Vaishnavism) came and spread in Manipur. Over the last couple of decades there has been a revival of Sanamahi religion and this is evident in the significant growth of the 'other' religion category in the 2001 census. Around 10% of the population of population identified themselves under this category. Sanamahi religion is the original religion of the Meetei people living in Manipur. Due to the changing demographic profile of the state, Sanamahism will now be included in the next Government of India population census in 2011.Other religions prevalent in the region are:Christianity Christianity in the hill tracts of north-eastern region spread as a result of the British religious policy in the area. At present almost all of the hill tribal population is Christian. All groups of Nagas and Kukis of Manipur have adopted Christianity. The Bible is available in Tangkhul, Thadou, Lushai and Meitei dialects. Christianity is the second largest religion in the state accounting for 35% of the population.IslamMost of the muslims in Manipur are descendants of Bengali immigrants and are commonly referred to as Pangans. Muslims form about 8% of the population.Culture of Manipur, founded by Ratan Thiyam]] Theatre and society in Manipur, as in many parts of the world, have concomitant relationship as they progress along each other. Manipuris are a culturally enthusiastic people. Cultural spirit has never been allowed to be blown out despite its geographical aloofness from the outside world. This is the main reason for it to be still thriving valiantly in Manipur valley.Theatre has always been part of the Laiharaoba festivals since time immemorial.Theatre in Manipur today can be broadly divided, based on their texts, into religious and secular. The former is the adaptation of religious epics or some episodes from them, performed mainly in the sacred sphere such as temples. Within this Gouralila (the story of the childhood days of Gouranga Mahaprabhu), Sanjenba ( an episode from the play between Krishna and his cows and his Gopis ), Udukhol (an episode from Krishna's childhood days) can be incorporated. They are seasonal performances commanding spiritual devotions among the audience. On the other hand secular theatre is mostly confined in themes which are not religious and is performed in the secular or profane spheres. Within these are Shumang lila and Phampak lila (stage drama). Though the religious genre is loved profoundly by the audience,the torch of theatre is being held aloft by the secular ones. Among the latter also Shumang lila commands a very wide rustic popularity among the audience though the stage drama still doesn't lack its serene and dignified position mostly because of its community based themes and styles.Etymologically Shumang lila is the combination of "Shumang" (courtyard) and "Lila" (play or performance).It is performed in an area of 13/13ft in the centre of any open space.It is performed in a very simple style without any raised stage or any set designing or heavy props such as curtains, background scenary, visual effects etc. but with only one table and two chairs , kept on one side of the performance space. Its claims of being the theatre of the masses can be exemplified by the way it is performed in the middle of an audience which surrounds it from all sides leaving only one passage which serves as both entrance and exit connecting the performance space with the green room. Shumang lila is performed by a touring band of 12-13 professional artistes on invitation basis. These troupes may be either exclusively female (Nupi Shumang Lila) or exclusively male (Nupa Shumang lila). Though the male characters are enacted by the female artistes in the case of the former what is most intriguing is the enactment of the female roles by the male artistes or nupishabis (male actresses), in the case of the latter. They are feminine par excellence in their looks, bodily gestures and facial expressions guised in the masculine souls. Historically the actual seed of Shumang lila was sown in Phagee lila (farce), performed during the reign of Ningthourel Chandrakirti (1850-1886), though the traces of it were already present in the episode of Tangkhul-Nurabi Loutaba of Laiharaoba festival. Then it was succeeded by such plays as Ramlila, Sabha parba, Kabul lila etc. But the real Shumang lila with various rasas (sentiments) was ushered in with the epic play Harishchandra (1918). Then it was followed by others such as Meiraba charan,Thok lila etc. One of the most successful plays of this era was Moirang parba (an epic play based on the legendary lovers-Khamba and Thoibi of Moirang).On the other hand, the world of Phampak lila ( stage drama ) performed in the proscenium theatre is similar, in form, to the Western theatrical model and Indian Natyasastra model though its contents are indigenous. The so called modern theatre descended on Manipuri theatre culture with the performance of Pravas Milan (1902) under the enthusiastic patronage of Sir Churchand Maharaj (1891-1941). The pace of theatrical movement was geared up with the institution of various groups such as Manipur Dramatic Union (MDU) (1930), Arian Theatre (1935), Chitrangada Natya Mandir (1936), Society Theatre (1937), Rupmahal (1942), Cosmopolitan Dramatic Union (1968), The Chorus Repertory Theatre of Ratan Thiyam (1976) etc. These groups started experimenting with various types of plays apart from historical and pauranic ones.Today Manipuri theatre is well respected because of various excellent productions shown in various parts of the country and the abroad. Manipuri plays, both Shumang lila and stage lila,have been a regular feature in the annual festival of National School of Drama,New Delhi.Indigenous games of ManipurThe indigenous games of Manipur can be classified as Outdoor and Indoor.OutdoorMuknaMukna Kangjei (Khong Kangjei)Sagol Kangjei (Polo)Yubi Lakpi (Coconut Rugby)Oo-LaobiHiyang-TannabaArambai HunbaMukna (Manipuri wrestling)Mukna is a very popular form of wrestling. It has fundamental rules agreed by all Mukna organizations and with Royal Consent. Traditionally the game is controlled and organised by Pana Loisang of the Ruler of the state and village organizations. There are four Panas-Ahallup, Naharup, Khabam and Laipham who control all fixtures and time for the games and State Meet in which Final is invariably graced by the ruler and presents the Title of Jatra (Champion) for the year along with reward of Thum Nama ( A ful bag of salt) and Ngabong Phi (hand made cloth of coton yarn), exemption of all state duties and Ningham Samjin dress (traditional).The game has two categories (1) Takhatnabi (League), (2) Naitom (Knockout). The young talents work and play all the year round with dedication for the title of 'Jatra' (Champion) of Mukna of Manipur.Mukna Kangjei (Khong Kangjei)Mukna Kangjei is a game which combines the arts of mukna (wrestling) and Kangjei (Cane Stick) to play the ball made of seasoned bamboo roots.The origin of the game goes back well to Aniconicworship. People celebrate 'Lai Haraoba' (festival to please traditional deities) and include this item to mark the end of the festival. It was believed that Khagemba Ningthou (King) - (1597-1652) patronised this game. In later generation, the game is organised in the villages. Presently, associations are formed in Panas with rules and regulations of Mukna Kangjei.The game is played by two teams each consisting of seven players. All players hold a natural cane stick with root, gradually increasing the size of the root, to the length of about seven inches to play the ball made out of seasoned bamboo roots of approximately a diameter of four inches.The players put on Mukna Kisi Phijet ( dress of cloth knot) to secure protection and holding each other. At present a short pant is added below Kisi ( like cloth belt with knots).The game starts by throwing the ball in front of the panjenbas (leaders) of the two teams standing face to face to each other on the line. If possible they can pick up the ball and run. The process of running and obstructing each other to put the ball on the goal line of the ground is allowed, Pun onba (change of side) and end of the game is given by the command of the umpire. The rules for the game is known as Kangjei lon. It has improved a lot and was demonstrated during the Fifth National Games 1999 at Imphal.Sagol KangjeiTo Manipuris according to Chaitharol-Kumbaba, a Royal Chronicle of Manipur King Kangba who ruled Manipur much earlier than Nongda Lairen Pakhangba (33 AD) introduced Sagol Kangjei (Kangjei on horse back). Further regular playing of this game commenced in 1605 during the reign of King Khagemba under newly framed rules of the game.The game requires perfect control of the pony, the stick and the ball with profiency of riding. The sense of 'fair Play' was the main guided factor of this game.This is played between two teams of Seven players a side. During the time of the late Sir Chandrakirti Singh, K.C.S.I Maharaja of Manipur introduced regular game at Mapal Kangjeibung (now near Tikendrajit Park) on the ground of Sana-Lamjei (length 160 and 80 width in dimension)being one Lamjei equal to 6 ft. The game can be played in smaller ground also if occasion demands. Earlier, there was no definite rules for foul in traditional Sagol Kangjei.Manipur has produced players of outstanding calibres like Jubaraj Bir Tikendraji (Senapati of Manipur Army) as legendary player described by Mrs. Grimhood (1887-90). After 1891, Manipur produced outstanding players like (L) Ojha Tombi and Shyamjai Sharma who never had the chance to play in international tournament. From the history it is an established fact and accepted that Manipur is the birthplace of Polo of the World.Yubi LakpiYubi (Coconut) Lakpi (capturing) is like rugby except that its an Individual game. Before the start of the game, players rub their bodies with mustard oil and water to make slippery to catch each other.A coconut properly soaked with oil is place in front of the Chief guest of the function.The players put on kisi (Langot) on an underpant properly tied in front. A senior Jatra is the umpire of the game to start and check fouls of the players. Before the start the coconut is placed in front of the seat of the Chief Guest. Official game is held on the occasion of the Yaoshang Festival of Shri Shri Govindajee at palace ground and with Royal presence.OolaobiOolaobi is an outdoor game mainly played by the female. Meitei mythology believes that UmangLai Heloi-Taret (Seven deities-seven fairies) played this game on the Courtyard of the temple of UMANG LAI LAIREMBI.Number of the participants were not fixed but are divided into two groups ( size now as per agreement). Players are divided as:- (1) Raiders (Attackers) (2) Defenders (Avoiders) Action of raider:Say "oo" without stopping as long as they can continue and try to touch the avoiders. If a raider touches an Avoider is out.This process goes on till avoiders are out or surrender.If a raider fails to say "oo" or out of breadth, Raider is out. Points are counted on the elimination of Raiders/Defenders. Change of Side:If Raiders are tired they declare for change. Now time limit is decided for change. The outline principles of Woo-Laobi is very much similar to that of Kabaddi in India.The ground (court) is not marked, normally the open space available within the premises of the house or temple is used for the game. This game, is very much liked by the girls and also became a source of talent in Kabaddi.Hiyang TannabaHiyang Tannaba (Boat Race) : Hiyang tannaba (Hi Yangba Tannaba) is a tradinional function of the Panas. This is held during the month of November. This was introduced during the time of Ningthourel Khunjaoba, the second son of King Khagemba, who dug the Kangla Moat around the Palace to make it impregnable in the year of 1660 after he ascended the throne in 1652.In the traditional function two boats "Tanahi" (Race Boat) are detailed for leaders known as "Tengmai Lappa". In each boat forty Hiroys (Boatsman) operate the boat.The boat which reaches the finishing line is the winner and all boatsman raise their (Nows) oars high in the air as a sign of reaching the finishing line first and thus the winner of the race is declared. The leader pays his respect to the deity and the King of Manipur.Arambai HunbaPeople of Manipur are very fond of riding horses specially those who are in the village near the breeding areas. Since the ponies are easily available , the young boys get the chance of riding ponies without saddle on horse back. Sometimes they ride horse using a rope in place of regular bridle throwing branches of small trees in place of Arambai. This practice helped the Manipur Arambai force as a martial art which was very much required during the advance and withdrawal of forces.This art was very popular as an indigenous game of the youth of Manipur. This game is displayed even now , during the festival "Kwak Jatra" after Durga Puja.Indoor Indigenous GamesKangKang is played by both male and female Meities of Manipur. Manipuris believe Kang is a game played by deity " Panthoibi". It is also believed that Manipuris began to play this game well before Vaishnavism came to Manipur.It is culturally a fine game of Manipur specially of Meiteis. It is played under a shed of building on an earth ground ( court) smoothly levelled to suit the course of the 'Kang' the target on the court. It is well marked for the respective positions of the players of both to hit the target on the court. It has rules and regulations formed by the associations to suit the occasions of the games either for tournaments or Friendly. The dignitaries of the Palace,even Queen and King also participated on social functions. In olden days 'Kang' was played during summer, starting from Cheiraoba (Manipur New Year) to Kang Chingba. Presently the game is played in several touranaments throughout the year, organised by the Associations. Rules and regulations have been modified to suit the improved process of the game.Festivals of ManipurThe various festivals of Manipur are Ningol Chakouba, Yaoshang, Ramjan ID, Kut, Gan-ngai, Chumpha, Christmas, Cheiraoba, Kang and Heikru Hidongba. Most of these festivals are usually celebrated on the basis of lunar calendar. Almost every festival celebrated in other states is observed here and it makes Manipur a mini metropolis.Ningol Chakouba (November)A social festival of the Meiteis where the women (Ningol) are invited (Chakouba) to a feast at their parental house along with their children. Along with the feast, gifts are given for them as well as the children. It is the festival that binds and revives the family relations between the girls married away and the parents. Nowadays, other communities had also started celebrating this festival. It is held every year mostly during the month of November. Sometimes it falls in October.[[Yaoshang]] (February/March)A riot of colours and water and the various chanting of the devotees of Lord Krishna is what you will come across during this festival.

It is observed during the month of April.ProblemsThe implementation of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in 1958 resulted in the designation of Manipur as a "disturbed area" .There have been some minor border disputes with Myanmar (formerly Burma), which were resolved through treaty of Yandaboo.Manipur as a state in India is also involved in a border dispute with another state Nagaland.There have been a few social upheavals in the recent past, resulting in mounting tensions between the Meiteis (the valley people) and the Nagas residing in Manipur.The long-standing demand to include the Meitei language in the 8th schedule was finally granted by the 71st amendment of the Constitution in 1992.On November 20, 2004 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh fulfilled a long-standing demand of the Manipuri people by officially handing over the historic Kangla Fort(which was being used as headquarters of Paramilitary forces since 1915) to Manipur state government. Kangla Fort is now open to general public.The Prime Minister also upgraded Manipur University into a Central University and laid the foundation stone for a 97.9 km long, Jiribam - Imphal, broad gauge rail line project. The line ends at Tupul, 25 km away from Imphal.United National Liberation Front (UNLF) is one of the largest unrest causing armed organisation in the state and it purports to work for independent manipur.Ordinary Manipuris are tired of the rebels' influence as apart from disruption of life and economy they issue diktats and rulings on moral and social behaviour, enforced with the threat of violence. Extortion is also rampant in Manipur. Most professions are forced to pay the rebels regular sums of money that are locally called 'tax'.

Manipur's culture and the present mix of the races stem from the influences of the Vaishnavism and the embedded traditional values in the region. Its rich culture excels in every aspects as in martial arts, dance, theater and sculpture. The charm of the place is the greenery with the moderate climate making it a tourists haven. The beautiful and seasonal Shirui Lily at Ukhrul (district), Sangai (Brow antlered deer) and the floating islands at Loktak Lake are one of the rare things found at Manipur.
