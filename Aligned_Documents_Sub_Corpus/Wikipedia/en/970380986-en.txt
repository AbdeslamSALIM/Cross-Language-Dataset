Launstroff is a village and commune in the Moselle département of France.See alsoCommunes of the Moselle departmentCategory:Communes of Moselle [[Launstroff is a small agricultural community consisting of 50 -60 houses, with few exceptions over fifty years old, located in France 1½Km from the border with Germany. There are no shops, restaurants or hotels in the village. It has a junior school, a church and a village hall all located close to the centre of the village. In the village square, next to the church, is a war memorial to those who gave their lives in the Great War and World War 2. During WW2 there are records of US troops being in the village which is located almost on the Siegfried Line. I have visited the village on many occasions over the past decade, (walking holidays), throughout this time one of the village residents has been engaged in renovating WW2 military vehicles; when passing by his home you are likely to see an old ambulance, jeep or similar on his drive. The village has a bus service linking it to nearby communities in France. There is no link by public transport into Germany and no rail link. The village is surrounded by pathways and lies on several cycle routes recommended by tourist offices on both sides of the border. This is also an area where many large stone sculptures can be found. For further information on these search for 'Steine an der Grenze'. Just outside the village, running along the international border, many smaller carved stones can be found marking the border as it has changed over the last 250 years.ceb:Launstroff de:Launstroff es:Launstroff fr:Launstroff it:Launstroff lb:Launstroff nl:Launstroff pl:Launstroff pt:Launstroff vi:Launstroff vo:Launstroff
