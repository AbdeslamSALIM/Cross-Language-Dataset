 in gray and neutral countries in yellow.]] The Central Powers (German: "Mittelmächte"; Hungarian: "Központi hatalmak";Turkish: "İttifak Devletleri"; Bulgarian: "Централни сили") was one of the two sides that participated in World War I. They fought against the Allies, and consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria. The name Central Powers is derived from the location of these countries; all four were located between the Russian Empire in the east and France and the United Kingdom in the west.Germany and Austria-Hungary became allies on the 7 October, 1879, and were joined later on (20 May, 1882) (see Triple Alliance) by Italy, which intended to limit the alliance to defensive purposes only.The Triple Alliance (First 8 Articles) The World War I Document Archive, Brigham Young University Library, accessed 2008-04-21 Triple Alliance, 1882 Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, accessed 2008-04-21 When World War I began, the petition made by Germany and Austria-Hungary for Italian intervention was rejected by the Italian Government on the grounds of these two countries declaring war on Serbia, rather than taking defensive action against it. Italy eventually entered World War I on May 23, 1915, but it fought against Germany and Austria-Hungary rather than with them.Following the outbreak of war in Europe during August 1914, the Ottoman Empire intervened at the end of October by taking action against Russia, resulting in declarations of war by the Triple Entente.Bulgaria, still resentful after its defeat in July 1913 at the hands of Serbia, Greece, Romania and the Ottoman Empire, was the last nation to enter the war against the Entente, invading Serbia in conjunction with German and Austro-Hungarian forces in October 1915.Other movements supported the efforts of the Central Powers for their own reasons, such as the Irish Nationalists who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in April 1916; they referred to their "gallant allies in Europe". During the years 1917 and 1918, the Finns under C.G.E. Mannerheim and the Ukrainian and Lithuanian nationalists fought Russia for a common cause. The Ottoman Empire also had its own allies in Azerbaijan and the Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus. The three nations fought alongside each other under the Army of Islam in the Battle of Baku.Bulgaria signed an armistice with the Allies on 29 September,1918, following a successful Allied advance in Macedonia. The Ottoman Empire followed suit on 30 October,1918 in the face of British and Arab gains in Palestine and Syria. Austria and Hungary concluded ceasefires separately during the first week of November following the disintegration of the Habsburg Empire, and Germany signed the armistice ending the war on the morning of 11 November,1918 after the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, a succession of advances by Australian, Canadian, Belgian, British, French and US forces in north-eastern France and Belgium.+ Central Powers by date of surrenderFlagNameSurrenderedBulgaria|1878Bulgaria]]1918|09|29Ottoman EmpireOttoman Empire1918|10|30Austria-HungaryAustria-Hungary1918|11|4German EmpireGerman Empire1918|11|11Leaders, Mehmed V, Franz Joseph: The three emperors of the Central Powers.]]Austria-HungaryFranz Josef I - Emperor of Austria-HungaryKarl I - Emperor of Austria-HungaryConrad von Hötzendorf - Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General StaffArthur Arz von Straussenburg - Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General StaffAnton Haus - Commander-in-Chief of the Austro-Hungarian NavyMaximilian Njegovan - Commander-in-Chief of the Austro-Hungarian NavyGerman EmpireWilhelm II - German EmperorErich von Falkenhayn - Chief of the German General StaffPaul von Hindenburg - Chief of the German General StaffReinhard Scheer - Commander of the Imperial High Seas FleetErich Ludendorff - Deputy Chief of Staff of the German ArmyWilhelm Souchon - German Naval Advisor to the Ottoman EmpireOtto Liman von Sanders - German Army Advisor to the Ottoman EmpireOttoman EmpireMehmed V - Sultan of the Ottoman Empireİsmail Enver - Commander-in-Chief of the Ottoman ArmyBulgariaFerdinand I - Czar of BulgariaVladimir Vazov - Bulgarian Lieutenant GeneralNikola Zhekov - Bulgarian Lieutenant GeneralSee alsoTriple EntenteParticipants in World War IAxis powers (allies of Nazi Germany in WWII)Allies of World War IReferencesCategory:World War I by country Category:Military history of Austria-Hungary Category:German Empire Category:History of Bulgaria Category:Ottoman Empire Category:World War I Category:Military alliancesar:قوات المحور be-x-old:Цэнтральныя дзяржавы bg:Централни сили ca:Potències Centrals cs:Centrální mocnosti da:Centralmagterne de:Mittelmächte et:Keskriigid es:Potencias Centrales eo:Centraj Potencoj fr:Empires centraux fy:Sintrale Steaten fur:Imperis Centrâi gl:Potencias Centrais ko:동맹국 id:Blok Sentral is:Miðveldin it:Imperi centrali he:מעצמות המרכז lv:Centrālās lielvalstis lt:Centrinių valstybių sąjunga hu:Központi hatalmak ms:Kuasa Tengah nl:Centrale mogendheid ja:中央同盟国 no:Sentralmaktene nn:Sentralmaktene pl:Państwa centralne pt:Impérios Centrais ro:Puterile Centrale ru:Центральные державы sk:Ústredné veľmoci sl:Centralne sile fi:Keskusvallat sv:Centralmakterna th:ฝ่ายมหาอำนาจกลาง vi:Liên minh Trung tâm tr:İttifak Devletleri uk:Центральні держави ur:مرکزی طاقتیں zh:同盟國 (第一次世界大戰)
