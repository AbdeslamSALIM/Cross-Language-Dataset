He is one of a small group of people who have enjoyed success in three major entertainment media in the United States. Newsweek has called him the most powerful actor on the planet.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith has been nominated for a Golden Globe, two Academy Awards, and has won multiple Grammys.Smith rose to fame as a rapper under the name the Fresh Prince in the late 1980s. Smith's most notable television role was that of William &quot;Will&quot; Smith in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. In his film work, his notable roles include Agent J in Men in Black and its sequel, Men in Black II, Detective Del Spooner in I, Robot, Muhammad Ali in Ali, as well as his role in the blockbuster Independence Day and more recently as Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happyness with his son Jaden Smith and as Robert Neville in I Am Legend with his daughter Willow Smith. He is the only actor in history to have eight consecutive films gross over $100 million in the domestic box office.Life and careerEarly life and educationSmith, an African American,Will Smith: So perfect it's disgusting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; was born and raised in West Philadelphia and Germantown in Northwest Philadelphia. His mother, Caroline (née Bright), was a school administrator who worked for the Philadelphia school board, and his father, Willard Christopher Smith, Sr., was a refrigeration engineer.Will Smith Biography (1968-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; He was raised Baptist.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/movies/5377381.html His parents divorced when he was thirteen. Smith's charming and sly demeanor in school resulted in the nickname "Prince", which eventually turned into the "Fresh Prince". While still in his teens, Smith began rapping and eventually began collaborating with Jeff Townes (a.k.a. D.J. Jazzy Jeff), whom he met at a party. He attended Overbrook High School in West Philadelphia. D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince was born with Smith handling the rhymes and Townes overseeing the mastery of mixing and scratching – the combination was a pop and hip-hop hit during the 1980s and early 1990s.While it is widely reported that Smith turned down a scholarship to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he never applied to MIT, although he was admitted to a "pre-engineering program" there. According to Smith, "My mother, who worked for the School Board of Philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at MIT. I had pretty high SAT scores and they needed black kids, so I probably could have gotten in. But I had no intention of going to college."CareerSmith started as the MC of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, with his childhood friend Jeffrey &quot;DJ Jazzy Jeff&quot; Townes as turntablist and producer as well as Ready Rock C (Clarence Holmes) as the human beat box. The trio was known for performing humorous, radio-friendly songs, most notably "Parents Just Don't Understand" and "Summertime." They gained critical acclaim for winning the first ever Grammy in the Rap category (1988). He had a line in "Voices That Care", a 1991 Gulf War song by a celebrity group. Smith spent money freely during his early career and underpaid his income taxes. The Internal Revenue Service eventually assessed a $2.8 million tax debt against Smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income.  Smith was nearly bankrupt in 1990 when the NBC television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, around him. The show was successful and launched his acting career. Smith set himself the goal of becoming "'the biggest movie star in the world'," studying box office successes' common characteristics. Although he made a notable dramatic film debut in Six Degrees of Separation while still appearing in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Smith's film career took off with his role in the buddy cop action film Bad Boys (1995) along with co-star Martin Lawrence.After The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended May 20, 1996, Smith began a successful solo music career while simultaneously starring in a series of films. The first two films were hugely successful summer blockbusters: Independence Day (1996), in which he played a fearless and confident fighter pilot, and Men in Black (1997), where he played the comic and confident Agent J against Tommy Lee Jones' deadpan Agent K. Smith's acting in Men in Black won critical praise. He originally rejected the lead role in Men in Black, but wife Jada Pinkett Smith coaxed him into acceptance. The two films established Smith's commercial reputation as a bankable star whose appeal across age, race, and gender lines could "open" a film at the box office, a reputation Smith would begin to term a "Big Willie Weekend". In 1998 he starred with Gene Hackman in Enemy of the State which had a seemingly far-fetched plot at the time but has become more and more plausible as the 'surveillance society' becomes more of a reality. Smith turned down the role of Neo in The Matrix in favor of Wild Wild West. Despite the failure of Wild Wild West, Smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that Keanu Reeves's performance as Neo was superior to what Smith would have achieved.Smith has no Matrix Regrets Smith then went on to gain leading roles in several box office successes including Men in Black II, Bad Boys II, Hitch, and I, Robot.Smith is one of only two hip-hop artists to receive an Oscar nomination in an acting category (Best Actor, Ali, 2001), for his portrayal of the boxer Muhammad Ali, formerly known as Cassius Clay, in the biopic. He was again nominated for Best Actor Oscar for his role in another true-life movie, The Pursuit of Happyness, where he played Chris Gardner in his rags-to-riches story.Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith created the UPN (later CW) sitcom All of Us, which was loosely based on their lives. The show debuted on UPN in September 2003 and aired there for three seasons before moving to The CW in October 2006 for one more season. The CW cancelled All of Us in May 2007.Smith appeared as himself in Jersey Girl delivering the Silent Bob speech that appears in nearly all Kevin Smith movies. The lead character's situation is due to the claim, "Will Smith is just a rapper."Smith also released a string of hit singles, often associated with his most recent film, throughout the late 1990s. The most notable of these were his #1 hit theme song "Men in Black", the #1 hit "Gettin' Jiggy Wit It" (which made jiggy a catchphrase for a while in 1998), and a cover of "Just the Two of Us", an affectionate message to his young son. His first two solo albums went platinum, but his third, on Columbia Records, was a sales disappointment compared to his past efforts, and after a quick Greatest Hits release that was almost not advertised at all, he was dropped by the label. He signed a recording contract with Interscope Records and released the successful Lost &amp; Found in 2005. The album was propelled solely on the smash hit single, "Switch", which appealed to the mainstream a la "Summertime". The single stayed atop the charts for months and returned Smith to the forefront of hip-hop.In 2005, Smith was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records for attending a record breaking three premieres in a 24-hour time span. On July 2, 2005, Smith served as host for the Live 8 concert in his native Philadelphia in front of an enormous crowd, and later performed a set with DJ Jazzy Jeff. Smith appeared at Nickelodeon Kid's Choice awards in 2005 performing "Switch", as well as the Black Entertainment Television awards in 2005. He appeared in the second game of the NBA Finals (San Antonio vs. Detroit) performing "Switch" in 2005. Smith also made a special appearance in the reality talent contest show "Indian Idol", when he visited India.Smith was considered for the role of John Smith in the movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith; Brad Pitt eventually received the role.Who was considered for Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith?

Smith donated $4,600 to the presidential campaign of Democrat Barack Obama.Smith has said he has studied multiple religions including Scientology and he has said many complimentary things about Scientology and other faiths. He and his wife are close friends of prominent Scientologists Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, which has led to rumors that Smith is also a Scientologist. Although Smith has said, "I just think a lot of the ideas in Scientology are brilliant and revolutionary and non-religious." and, "Ninety-eight percent of the principles in Scientology are identical to the principles of the Bible.... I don't think that because the word someone uses for spirit is 'thetan' that the definition becomes any different"&lt;/ref&gt;, he has denied having joined the Scientology Church, saying "I am a Christian. I am a student of all religions, and I respect all people and all paths."&lt;/ref&gt;. After Jada made the film Collateral with Cruise in 2004, the couple donated USD$20,000 to Scientology's literacy campaign, called HELP, The Hollywood Education and Literacy Program, which is the basis for Scientology's home-schooling system.&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing work on the film Hancock, Smith gave crew members gift cards for a Scientology personality test at any Church of Scientology center as a wrap present; this despite the fact that initial personality tests given by the organization are usually free.DiscographyBig Willie Style (1997)Willennium (1999)Born to Reign (2002)Lost and Found (2005)FilmographyYearFilmRoleNotes1990Saturday Morning VideosHostTVIn Living ColorVarious CharactersTVThe Perfect Date - "ABC Afterschool Specials"HawkerTVThe Fresh Prince of Bel-AirWilliam "Will" Smith]]TV (1990-1996)1992Blossom]]''Fresh PrinceTV, CameoWhere the Day Takes YouManny1993Made in America]]''Tea Cake WaltersSix Degrees of Separation]]''Paul1995Bad Boys]]''Detective Mike Lowrey1996Independence Day]]''Captain Steven "Steve" Hiller, USMC1997Men in Black]]''James Darrell Edwards / Agent J]]1998Enemy of the State]]''Robert Clayton Dean1999Torrance RisesCameoWild Wild WestCaptain James "Jim" West2000Welcome to HollywoodHimselfThe Legend of Bagger VanceBagger Vance2001Ali]]''Muhammad AliAcademy Award Best Actor Nomination2002Men in Black IIJames Darrell Edwards / Agent J]]Girlfriend by B2KHimselfMusic video2003Bad Boys IIDetective Mike Lowrey2004A Closer WalkNarratorDocumentaryJersey Girl]]''HimselfUncredited CameoAmerican ChopperHimselfTV, CameoI, Robot]]''Detective Del SpoonerProducerShark TaleOscarVoice2005There's a God on the MicDocumentaryHitch]]''Alex "Hitch" HitchensProducer2006The Pursuit of Happyness&lt;!-- Correct spelling --&gt;Chris GardnerProducer, Academy Award Best Actor Nomination2007I Am Legend]]''Dr. Robert NevilleSaturn Award for Best Actor2008Hancock]]''John HancockAlso a producerLakeview TerraceProducerThe Secret Life of Bees]]''ProducerSeven PoundsBenPost ProductionBox office grossesYearTitleBudgetGross (US)Gross (Worldwide inc US)1993Made in America]]''N/A$44,942,695$104,942,6951993Six Degrees of Separation]]''N/A$6,410,676 Lifetime Gross, Will Smith Boxofficemojo.com N/A1995Bad Boys]]''$23m$65,807,024$141,407,0241996Independence Day]]''$75m$306,169,268$816,969,2681997Men in Black]]''$90m$250,690,539$589,390,5391998Enemy of the State]]''$90m$111,549,836$250,649,8361999Wild Wild West$170m$113,745,408$222,105,6812000The Legend of Bagger Vance$80m$30,695,227$39,459,4272001Ali]]''$107m$58,183,966$87,713,8252002Men in Black II$140m$190,418,803$441,818,8032003Bad Boys II$130m$138,396,624$273,339,5562004I, Robot]]''$120m$144,801,023$347,234,9162004Shark Tale$75m$160,861,908$367,275,0192005Hitch]]''$70m$179,495,555$368,100,4202006The Pursuit of Happyness$55m$163,566,459$307,069,0592007I Am Legend]]''$150m$256,393,010$584,137,4422008Hancock]]''$150m$222,626,000$603,823,955Further readingDoeden, Matt (2007).
