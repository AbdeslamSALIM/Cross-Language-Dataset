Discovery effectively wore down the remnants of the race leader, Davide Rebellin's, Gerolsteiner team, allowing Contador to launch an authoritative attack on the final climb. With Rebellin leading the chase, Contador held off his competitors in the final kilometers, winning him this prestigious race.In the 2007 Tour de France, he won the 14th stage at the mountaintop finish of Plateau-de-Beille, and was second in the general classification to Michael Rasmussen. Upon Rasmussen's removal from the race after stage 17, Contador assumed the overall lead and the yellow jersey. In stage 19, a time trial, he managed to keep hold of the yellow jersey by a margin of only twenty-three seconds over challenger Cadel Evans and went on to win his first Tour de France, the first win for the Discovery Channel team since Lance Armstrong's victory in 2005.After the announcement of the future termination of team Discovery Channel, Contador announced on October 23 2007 that he would move to Astana for 2008. 2008 seasonduring the 21th stage of 2008 Giro d'Italia.]] On February 13, 2008, the organizer of the Tour de France announced that Astana would not be invited to any of their events in 2008. Consequently, Contador was unable to defend his 2007 Paris-Nice and 2007 Tour de France victories. Unable to defend his Paris-Nice victory, he then went on to win his second Vuelta a Castilla y León and the Vuelta al País Vasco by winning the opening stage and the final individual time trial. His next scheduled race and objective was the Dauphiné Libéré but his team received a last minute invitation to the 2008 Giro d'Italia one week prior to the start of the race. Contador was allegedly on the beach when he was told he was going to ride the Giro.http://www.velonews.com/article/76007 Johan Bruyneel alluded to this on Belgian television by saying: "I'm not going to repeat the words I could hear him shout over the phone, but let's just say it wasn't pretty". during the 20th stage of 2008 Vuelta a España.]]Despite the lack of preparation, he finished second in the first individual time trial and took the maglia rosa after the 15th stage up to Passo Fedaia. Alberto Contador was proclaimed winner of the Giro the 1st June 2008 in Milan. He became the first non-Italian to win the Giro d'Italia since Pavel Tonkov in 1996 and also the second Spanish rider ever to win the Giro after Miguel Indurain won it in 1992 and in 1993. He later emphasized the importance of this win by saying that "taking part in the Giro and winning it was a really big achievement, bigger than if I'd had a second victory in the Tour de France".At the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, Contador competed in the road race and the individual road time trial. He did not finish in the road race, in which 53 of the 143 starters did not complete the course in particularly hot and humid conditions. He placed fourth in the individual time trial, 8 seconds behind his Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer.Contador entered the 2008 Vuelta a España as the main candidate to win. His biggest challenger was likely to be compatriot Carlos Sastre, who had won the Tour de France just a month before. Contador won Stage 13 by attacking on the fabled Angliru and this resulted in him capturing the Golden jersey as the leader of the race. He extended his lead by winning Stage 14 to Fuentes de Invierno and maintained his lead in subsequent flat stages and the final time trial. In the final standings, Contador finished 46 seconds ahead of teammate Levi Leipheimer and more than four minutes ahead of Carlos Sastre. The win made him the fifth cyclist to win all three Grand Tours, after Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Eddy Merckx, and Bernard Hinault. In the process he also claimed the following records: first Spaniard, youngest (age 25), and shortest amount of time (14 months). He also becomes only the third cyclist to complete the Giro/Vuelta double, joining Merckx (1973) and Giovanni Battaglin (1981).Doping allegationsContador was kept out of the 2006 Tour de France due to alleged connections with the Operación Puerto doping case. However, he and four other members of his team at the time, Astana-Würth, were eventually cleared of all charges on July 26, 2006 by the Spanish courts and later two out of the five (including Contador) were cleared by the UCI. Each received a written document signed by Manuel Sánchez Martín, secretary for the Spanish court, stating that "there are not any type of charges against them nor have there been adopted any type of legal action against them."Andrew Hood, Astana 5' cleared by Spanish courts, VeloNews, July 26, 2006In 2006 a document from the summary of the investigation (documento 31) was released. In it Contador initials (A.C.) were associated with a hand-written note next to his name saying, "Nada o igual a J.J." (Spanish for "Nothing or like J.J."). JJ were the initials of Jörg Jaksche, who later admitted to be guilty of blood doping prepared by the Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes in 2005. |date=July 27, 2007 |author=Juan Gutiérrez |publisher=As.com |accessdate=2008-05-30 Alberto Contador was questioned in December 2006 by the magistrate in charge of the Puerto file. The rider declared to Judge Antonio Serrano that he did not know Eufemanio Fuentes personally. According to Le Monde, he refused then to undergo a DNA test that would have judged whether or not he had any link to the blood bags that were found in the investigation.On July 28 2007 the French daily Le Monde, citing what it claimed was an investigation file it had access to, stated that Contador's name appeared in several documents found during Operación Puerto. |date=July 28, 2007 |author= |publisher=Le Monde |accessdate=2008-05-30  According to some sources, Contador's name is mentioned on a list of then-Liberty Seguros teammates that appear on a document later to identified as a list of training schedules for members of the team. A second reference includes initials of riders’ name that appeared on another training document (e.g. A.C. for Alberto Contador), although neither of those two references could be linked to doping practices.On July 30 2007 German doping expert Werner Franke accused Contador of having taken drugs in the past and being prescribed a doping regimen by Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes, who was connected with Operación Puerto. He passed his evidence on to the German authorities on July 31, 2007. Contador denied the accusations, saying "I was in the wrong team at the wrong time and somehow my name got among the documents." On August 10, Alberto Contador publicly declared he's a clean rider in face of suspicions about his alleged links to the Operación Puerto blood-doping ring. "I have never doped and I have never participated in an act of doping," said Contador, reading from his prepared statement. "I won the Tour clean. It’s impossible for me to understand the attacks made against me, questioning my integrity as a sportsman, from people who don’t know me but feel they can make such judgments. My commitment against doping is total and I will always be willing to cooperate." Contador was joined by Discovery Channel team manager Johan Bruyneel, Spanish sports minister Jaime Lissavetzky and members of his family.Major achievements2003 &ndash; ONCE-EroskiTour de Pologne1st, Stage 8 (ITT)Vuelta a Castilla y León4th Overall classification2004 &ndash; Liberty SegurosVuelta a Aragón'''Winner mountains classificationSetmana Catalana5th Overall classification2005 &ndash; Liberty Seguros-Würth Cycling TeamVuelta al País Vasco3rd Overall classification'''Winner points classification1st, Stage 6 (ITT)Tour Down Under1st, Stage 5Setmana Catalana'''Winner overall classification'''Winner combination classification1st, Stage 3Tour de Romandie4th Overall classification1st, Stage 4Tour de France31st Overall classification3rd Youth classification2006 &ndash; Astana-Würth TeamTour de Suisse1st, Stage 8Tour de Romandie2nd Overall classification1st, Stage 3Vuelta al País Vasco5th Overall classification2007 &ndash; Discovery Channel Pro Cycling TeamVuelta a Castilla y León'''Winner overall classification'''Winner combination classification'''Winner spanish rider classification1st, Stage 4Paris-Nice:'''Winner overall classification'''Winner young rider classification1st, Stage 41st, Stage 7Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana1st, Stage 4Tour de FranceWinner overall classificationWinner youth classification1st, Stage 142008 &ndash; Team AstanaVuelta a Castilla y León'''Winner overall classification1st, Stage 11st, Stage 4Vuelta a País Vasco'''Winner overall classification1st Stage 11st Stage 6Giro d'ItaliaWinner overall classificationVuelta a EspañaWinner overall classificationWinner combined classification1st, Stage 131st, Stage 14Grand Tour Results (3 victories)2005200620072008'''Tour de France20px]] General classification31-1-20px]] Mountains classification90+-2-20px]] Points classification122-10-20px]] Youth clasification3-1Stages won0-1-'''Giro d'Italia20px]] General classification---120px]] Mountains classification---2220px]] Points classification---820px]] Youth clasification---Stages won---0'''Vuelta a España20px]] General classification---120px]] Mountains classification---320px]] Points classification---220px]] Combination clasification---1Stages won---2ReferencesExternal links     [[Óscar Pereiro]] |
