 Aerovías de México, S.A. de C.V., operating as AeroMéxico, is an airline based in Mexico City, Mexico. It is the largest airline in Mexico. It operates scheduled domestic services and international services to Asia, Europe, Central America, South America and USA. Its main base is Mexico City International Airport, with secondary hubs at General Mariano Escobedo International Airport, Monterrey and General Ignacio Pesqueira Garcia International Airport in Hermosillo. AeroMéxico is the only Latin American airline that flies to Asia, and the only airline in Mexico with scheduled services to Europe. Aeromexico was one of the founding members of Sky Team.The airline together with its feeder Aeroméxico Connect holds the 24.8% of the domestic market share, becoming the Mexican airline with the highest participation on the market. Internationally, Aeroméxico holds the 12.8% of the global market share becoming the second Mexican airline after Mexicana. Aeroméxico and Aeroméxico Connect together operate a total of 650 daily flights to 67 destinations in 3 continents, with a global fleet of 105 airplanes.History1934 The airline was established as Aeronaves de México on 15 September 1934, by Antonio Díaz Lombardo. The first plane was a Stinson SR and Julio Zinser piloted it. He inaugurated the maiden flight on the Mexico City - Acapulco route on 14 September 1934.  When World War II began, the airline continued to grow with the help of Pan Am, which owned 25% of the new Mexican airline. Aeroméxico saw few changes for the next two decades. However, during the 1950s, renovation began, and the airline took over various small competitor companies across the country, including Aerovias Guest (the second airline of the country at that time) that held the routes to Madrid and Paris. Aeroméxico added aircraft including the legendary Douglas DC-3 and its successor, the Douglas DC-4.1950s During the late 1950s, the Douglas DC-4's were replaced by some Douglas DC-6 and 3 Bristol Britannia the first turboprop passenger plane in the fleet and in 1958, services were inaugurated to Idlewild Airport (now JFK) using the same Bristol Britannia. The Mexico City-New York route would prove profitable for "Aeronaves" and its North American competitors. The airline was nationalised in 1959.1960s In the early 1960s fleet of Aeronaves de Mexico (Aeromexico) included Douglas DC-3, Douglas DC-6, and Bristol Britannia aircraft. Starting in 1961, "Aeronaves" began replacing its piston-engined planes with new jets. The first jet-engined aircraft were a pair of Douglas DC-8's. The planes were used on routes within Mexico and to New York City. Between 1962 and 1963, Aeronaves de Mexico (Aeromexico) took over Aerovias Guest Mexico the second airline, and they were merged, under the name Aeronaves de Mexico. Later in the 1960s more DC-8's were added and service to Europe was resumed, the service was operated by two Mexicana's, Comet IVC those planes were dry leased by Aerovias Guest Before the merger. 1970sThe 1970s brought dramatic changes for Aeroméxico. In 1970, under a government plan, Mexican domestic airlines were rationalized into an integrated air transport system under the control of Aeronaves de Mexico. The system included eight smaller carriers, although these were later disbanded. During the early-1970s, the remaining DC-6 and Bristol Britannia aircraft were retired. A new color scheme (orange and black) was introduced and the airline changed its name from "Aeronaves de México" to its current, shortened version of Aeroméxico in February 1972. Aeromexico, as one of the launch customers of the Douglas DC-10-30s program, received the first two planes in 1974, registered as XA-DUG and XA-DUH. That same year the airline also took delivery the first seven Douglas DC-9-32s. During this period the airline's popularity and visibility grew dramatically. This was due in part to Aeroméxico's involvement in Mexican movies. Basically, every time a character in any movie produced in Mexico had to fly somewhere, they supposedly flew on Aeroméxico. Service to Canada was initiated and in late-1970s, two more DC-9-15s were added to the fleet.1980s The early 1980s brought times of expansion. A new color scheme was introduced (orange paint and silver), two DC-10-15 and a DC-10-30 planes were added in 1981, N10038 and N1003N, and in 1982, N3878P later XA-RIY. Aeromexico as one of the launch customers of the McDonnell Douglas MD-82, a stretch version of the DC-9, received the first two planes in late 1981. During the period between 1980 and 1981, eight more DC-9-32 aircraft were added. The late 1980s were tough times for Aeroméxico. On August 31, 1986, the company suffered the only fatal accident outside of Mexico when Aeroméxico Flight 498, a Douglas DC-9, approaching Los Angeles International Airport was struck by a small Piper aircraft. Both aircraft then fell to earth in the Los Angeles suburb of Cerritos, California. All 64 passengers and crew on board the DC-9-32 were killed, as were three on the Piper. Fifteen victims on the ground were also killed. After three years and a long trial, the plane crew and the airline were found not to blame. This was because the pilot of the Piper had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. This accident cost 82 people their lives. In April 1988, the state owned company was declared bankrupt. The main reasons were lack of organization, a fleet with an average of 20 years without a renovation plan and a depredating administration by the Mexican Government. The company was grounded for three months. In August, a privatization program was underway. This involved retiring the ten Douglas DC-8's along with the remaining five DC-9-15 aircraft.1990s The early 1990s were turbulent times, with the rise in fuel costs due to the first Gulf War, and a domestic fare war caused by start up airlines like TAESA, Saro, Aviacsa, among others, as well as constant labor problems. In April 1991 the first two 767-200s were introduced to the fleet starting to replace DC-10's in services to Europe, New York and Tijuana, another two 767-300's joined the fleet early 1992, all this was part of a renovation and expansion program to introduce 26 757's/767's, Direct service to Madrid and Paris from Mexico City with 767's was introduced as well services to Frankfurt via Paris and Rome via Madrid. Later that year Grupo AeroMexico was among other investors that failed to consummate the acquisition of Continental Airlines. After failing to invest in Continental, AeroMexico acquired the bankrupt Aeroperú from the Peruvian government. They tried to use the same path that led AeroMexico to the leadership in the domestic market with AeroPeru. In October 1992 2 more 767-300's were added to the feet totaling 6. On 1993 Aeromexico Group took over Mexicana the second largest airline in the Mexican market under the same management there was a great dispute in June 93 with the pilot union regarding Aeromonterrey. Between 1994 and 1995 the six DC-10 aircraft in the fleet were finally retired. Their last revenue flight was in Mid February 1995. In December 1994 3 months after Carlos Salinas left the office the first of several devaluations in the next 18 months started, and there was a huge economic crisis in the country AeroMexico had to cut capacity flights to Frankfurt and to Rome were canceled, 4 MD80's 4 767's returned to the lessors, early retirement for pilots and another staff was on their way, a new 767 was due on April 95 and was transferred to Lan Chile flights to Madrid and Paris were operated by 2 767-300's. In 1996 Cintra was created in order to avoid the two main carriers went bankrupt some 757's of the original AeroMexico renovation program ended up un Mexicana and AeroPeru. The market and the airline recovered between 1996 and 1998 8 Md-80's were leased back as well another 2 767-200's.The sale of Grupo Cintra was scheduled after several delays in September 1999, and with the looming presidential elections in 2000, everything was delayed once again. The ruling party lost the election after 70 years in office and all the policies changed. Due to the recession in 2000 the new government put everything on hold waiting for better economic conditions to start the stock sell-off, and just when they were everything was about to start, the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred and nothing materialized since the two main carriers Mexicana and AeroMexico (as most Legacy carriers) were losing large amounts of money.2000slanding at Vancouver International Airport]]  In the period between 2000-2005 AeroMéxico had an average fleet of 60 aircraft in main line, plus 20 in Aerolitoral, as well as five CEO's during this time. After 9/11 and the Gulf War, it was forced to put in movement an ambitious fleet renovation program. On 2003, the airline purchased its first Boeing 737-700 aircraft to start replacing its aging DC-9 and MD-80 aircraft. On March 29, 2006 AeroMéxico CEO, Andrés Conesa announced the inauguration of direct flights between Japan and Mexico City via Tijuana. This was after the purchase of two Boeing 777-200ER. This makes Aeroméxico the fourth airline in Latin America to fly to Asia, after Varig and the now defunct airlines TAESA and VASP. However, because of Varig's current financial situation, Aeroméxico is currently the sole airline with this service until Varig restarts flights to Asia. On June 29, 2006, the International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and AeroMéxico announced that the airline will operate three Boeing 787 airplanes. Aeromexico will lease the three 787-8s from ILFC with deliveries scheduled to begin in early 2010, another two planes on lease from ILFC will be in service by 2011. From 2006, Consorcio AeroMéxico S.A. de C.V., the parent company of AeroMéxico at the time, was facing large debts and couldn't make any profits to pay them off. This forced the company to offer AeroMéxico for sale in 2007. In early October of the same year, a week-long auction was held, with Grupo Financiero Banamex competing against the Saba family. Finally, in October 17, 2007, Banamex had the highest bid, and the airline was sold to the bank for USD$249.1 million. Destinations In an attempt to gain more worldwide presence and strengthen its network to make connections easier and more frequent, Aeroméxico has started to develop new international markets. Beginning in 2006 the airline started operations to Tokyo from Mexico City vía Tijuana, several international and long-haul international operations have also started. Few long-haul aircraft have been introduced since, therefore many of the new destinations are not served on a daily basis due to the lack of capable aircraft.+ Aeroméxico new destinationsDestinationAircraftCommencingManagua, NicaraguaMcDonnell Douglas MD-87, downgraded to Embraer ERJ-190Late 2007San Pedro Sula, HondurasMcDonnell Douglas MD-87, downgraded to Embraer ERJ-190Late 2007Barcelona, SpainBoeing 767-200ERLate 2007Buenos Aires, ArgentinaBoeing 767-200ER/Boeing 767-300ERLate 2007Georgia]], USABoeing 737-700/Boeing 737-800Late 2007 (Resumed operations)Detroit, Michigan, USABoeing 737-700April, 2008Shanghai, ChinaBoeing 777-200ERMay, 2008Rome, ItalyBoeing 767-200ERJuly, 2008Salt Lake City, USABoeing 737-700November, 2008FleetThe Aeroméxico fleet consists of the following aircraft (as of 29 August 2008) http://www.ch-aviation.ch/aircraft.php?search=set&amp;airline=AM&amp;al_op=1: + Aeroméxico FleetAircraftTotalPassengers  (Premier/Tourist)RoutesNotesBoeing 737-70033  (10 orders)124 (12/112)Domestic/International short-long haul  Mexico and USABoeing 737-8006150 (24/126)Domestic/International short-medium haul  Mexico, Peru, and USABoeing 767-200ER3181 (21/160)International long haul  Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Monterrey, and South AmericaXA-OAM leased from LAM - Linhas Aéreas de MoçambiqueBoeing 767-300ER2  (2 orders)209 (21/188)Domestic/International long haul  Paris, Monterrey, and South AmericaBoeing 777-200ER]]4277 (49/228)Domestic/International long haul  Tijuana, Madrid, Paris, São Paulo, Tokyo, ShanghaiBoeing 787-8(5 orders)International long haulMcDonnell Douglas MD-822142 (12/130)Domestic/International short-medium haul  Mexico, USAMcDonnell Douglas MD-830142 (12/130)Domestic/International short-medium haul  Mexico, USATransfered to Khors Ukraine(UR-CDM); some were transfered to Aeromexico TravelMcDonnell Douglas MD-879109 (12/97)Domestic/International short-medium haul  Mexico, USAMcDonnell Douglas MD-882142 (12/130)Domestic/International short-medium haul  Mexico, USAAs of 29 August 2008, the average age of the Aeroméxico fleet is 7.5 years (http://www.airfleets.net/ageflotte/Aeromexico.htm).Boeing 767-200ER ]]Aircraft Tail Regs.:Boeing 737-752: N904AM, N906AM, N851AM, N842AM, XA-AAM, XA-BAM, XA-CAM, N850AM, N852AM, XA-GAM, XA-HAM, XA-NAM, N853AM, N855AM, XA-LAM, XA-PAM, XA-QAM, XA-VAM, XA-WAM, XA-MAY, XA-ZIM, EI-DRD, EI-DNB, EI-DNC, XA-GMV, XA-MAH, XA-CTG, XA-CYM, XA-GOL, XA-AGM, EI-DREBoeing 737-76Q: N908AM, N997AMBoeing 737-852: EI-DRA, EI-DRB, EI-DRC, XA-MIA, XA-ZAM, XA-JOYBoeing 767-283/ER: XA-TOJBoeing 767-284/ER: XA-JBCBoeing 767-2B1/ER: XA-OAMBoeing 767-3Q8/ER: XA-APBBoeing 767-383/ER: XA-MIRBoeing 777-2Q8/ER: N774AM, N776AM, N745AM, N746AMMcDonnell Douglas MD-82: XA-MRM, N501AMMcDonnell Douglas MD-83: XA-TLHMcDonnell Douglas MD-87: N205AM, XA-TXH, N214AM, N216AM, N754RA, XA-TPM, XA-TWT, N803ML, XA-TWAMcDonnell Douglas MD-88: XA-AMS, XA-AMTRetiredStinson SR ReliantTravel AirBellanca PacemakerBeechcraft 17 StaggerwingAvro AnsonBoeing 247DLockheed ConstellationBristol BritanniaConvair 340Douglas DC-3Douglas DC-4Douglas DC-6Douglas DC-8-50McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31/32McDonnell Douglas DC-10-15McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30Boeing 757-200Subsidiaries Aeroméxico Connect formerly Aerolitoral is a regional airline based at General Mariano Escobedo International Airport in Monterrey.

The unsuspecting DC-9's left horizontal stabilizer was destroyed causing the plane to rapidly fall and eventually crash into a residential neighborhood in Cerritos, California causing 15 deaths and 8 injuries on the ground. There were no survivors from the plane. The Piper Cherokee's cockpit roof was sheared off on impact, killing the pilot and two passengers. The plane soon fell into an elementary school playground. The NTSB later revealed that the Piper Cherokee was unauthorized to be in the Terminal Control Area, which is restricted airspace. The aircraft's pilot appeared to be lost and unknowingly made his way into the airspace without alerting the tower of his presence.ReferencesExternal linksAeroméxicoConsorcio AeroméxicoAeroméxico Fleet Detail     Category:Airlines of Mexico Category:IATA members Category:Latin American Air Transport Association Category:Airlines established in 1934 ca:Aeroméxico da:AeroMexico de:Aeroméxico es:Aeroméxico fr:Aeroméxico gl:Aeroméxico ko:아에로멕시코 id:Aeroméxico it:Aeroméxico he:אירומקסיקו nah:Aeroméxico nl:Aeroméxico ja:アエロメヒコ航空 no:Aeroméxico pl:Aeroméxico pt:Aeroméxico fi:AeroMéxico sv:Aeroméxico zh:墨西哥國際航空
