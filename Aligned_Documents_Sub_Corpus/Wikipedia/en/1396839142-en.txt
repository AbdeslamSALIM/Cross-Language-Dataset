It is 19 kilometres long and is located approximately 3 nautical miles (6 km) south of Ibiza in the Mediterranean Sea. Its major villages are Sant Francesc Xavier, Sant Ferran de ses Roques, El Pilar de la Mola and La Savina.The island was reachable by ship only from Ibiza and this made it the quietest of both islands but in recent years regular lines from the Spanish mainland have increased the amount of tourism. It is known for its many pristine beaches and the fact that nude sunbathing is allowed on most of its beaches.North of Formentera is the small island of Espalmador (Illa de s'Empalmador). Espalmador is separated from Formentera by a shallow sandbar, and during low tide, it is possible for one to wade between the two islands. This area is a popular stopping point for those in yachts heading between Ibiza and Formentera.Formentera comprises one municipality, also called Formentera, and has a population of 7,461 (2002). Its land area is 83.24 km² (32.14 sq mi).A local dialect of Catalan is spoken in Ibiza, while the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Italian and German can be heard extensively in the summer.HistoryThe island's name is usually said to derive from the Latin word frumentarium, meaning "granary". The island had been occupied by the Carthaginians before passing to the ancient Romans. In succeeding centuries, it passed to the Visigoths, the Byzantines, the Vandals, and the Arabs. It was conquered by the Catalan, added to the Crown of Aragon and later became part of the medieval Kingdom of Majorca.2007 windsurfing world championshipFrom September 1st to the 7th Formentera hosted the 2007 Techno 293 OD World Championships in windsurfing for juniors under 15 and youths under 17.Techno 293 OD World ChampionshipsGallery Image:Esglesia Sant Francesc.jpg|Church in Sant Francesc Image:Formentera sat.png|Satellite picture of Formentera Image:Formentera_cliffs.jpg|The coastline near Cala Saona Image:S'espalmador.jpg|Island of Espalmador ReferencesExternal linksTown council websiteThe Official Tourism Portal of FormenteraLocal government websiteCategory:Islands of the Balearic Islands Category:Municipalities in the Balearic Islandsals:Formentera ast:Formentera ca:Formentera cs:Formentera de:Formentera et:Formentera es:Formentera eo:Formentero eu:Formentera fr:Formentera gl:Formentera hr:Formentera it:Formentera hu:Formentera nl:Formentera ja:フォルメンテラ島 no:Formentera pl:Formentera pt:Formentera ro:Formentera ru:Форментера sr:Форментера fi:Formentera sv:Formentera tr:Formentera
