  Hatebreed is a Grammy award nominated five-piece band from Bridgeport and New Haven, Connecticut. The band was founded in November 1994 by Jamey Jasta, Dave Russo, Larry Dwyer, and Chris Beattie. The current lineup is Jamey Jasta (lead vocals), Frank "III Gun" Novinec (guitar), Chris Beattie (bass guitar), Sean Martin (lead guitar/backup vocals), and Matt Byrne (drums).Biography]]  Hatebreed was formed in 1994 in Bridgeport, Waterbury and New Haven, Connecticut from the ashes of a previous band called Jasta 14 for the purpose of creating a "back to basics" hardcore punk band.&lt;/ref&gt; They began by recording a three song demo and selling it to locals. Those three songs would eventually be released on a split seven inch with New York's Neglect in 1995. They followed that up with the highly acclaimed EP Under the Knife in 1996, and the following year released Satisfaction is the Death of Desire on Victory Records, then the home of some of the biggest bands in metalcore. Satisfaction sold more copies than any other debut in the history of the record company.A constant touring schedule pushed them beyond the boundaries of the hardcore punk scene, and tours with national metal bands such as Slayer, Deftones, Entombed and Napalm Death brought them to the attention of many non-hardcore/metalcore fans. These influences were apparent on the band's next two releases, 2002's Perseverance, and especially 2003's The Rise of Brutality.After the release of The Rise of Brutality, the band took part in the 2004 Unholy Alliance tour in Europe with Slayer, Slipknot and Mastodon. In June, 2006, Hatebreed went on an extensive European tour which included a performance at the Download Festival in Donnington, UK. Immediately following this European tour, they played the main stage at Ozzfest 2006 alongside DragonForce, Lacuna Coil, Avenged Sevenfold, Disturbed, and co-headliners System of a Down.The band's latest album, Supremacy was released in August, 2006, their first through Roadrunner Records, featuring new guitarist Frank Novinec (who had previously spent time playing with Ringworm, Terror, and Integrity). Jasta described it as an "all-out onslaught of completely adrenaline-charged, in-your-face brutality".Hatebreed still maintains tight connections to the hardcore community, evidenced by the lineup for the their 10 year anniversary show at Toad's Place on November 25 and November 26, 2005 in New Haven: Neglect, One 4 One, Irate, and reunions by All Out War and Skarhead.]] Aside from his frontman duties, Jasta is also the host of the MTV2 television program "Headbangers Ball" and runs Stillborn Records, home of Subzero, Full Blown Chaos. Jasta's other side-projects include Icepick featuring Lord Ezec / Danny Diablo (Crown of Thornz, Skarhead), Frank "3 Gun" Novinec, Zeuss (acclaimed music producer) and Derek Kerswill in addition to the band Kingdom of Sorrow which at this point features Kirk Windstein (Crowbar, Down).On September 13, 2006, former guitarist Lou "Boulder" Richards committed suicide at the age of 35. Richards played on 1997's Satisfaction Is The Death Of Desire and 2002's Perseverance before leaving the band later that year. Jasta issued the following statement regarding Richards' passing:Hatebreed headlined the second stage on the 2007 Ozzfest tour.Jamey Jasta confirmed that Hatebreed is working on a new album in an interview shown during the Headbanger's Ball.Hatebreed will release a concert DVD titled "Live Dominance" on September 2nd, 2008, and the next Hatebreed album will be a cover album.
