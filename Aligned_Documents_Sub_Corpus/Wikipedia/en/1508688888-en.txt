 The Collège de France is a higher education and research establishment (Grand établissement) located in Paris, France, in the 5th arrondissement, or Latin Quarter, across the street from the historical campus of La Sorbonne at the intersection of Rue Saint-Jacques and Rue des Ecoles. It also provides teaching, but to professors and researchers.It was created in 1530 at the request of King Francis I of France. Of humanist inspiration, this school was established as an alternative to the Sorbonne to promote such disciplines as Hebrew language, Ancient Greek and Mathematics. Initially called Collège Royal, and later Collège des Trois Langues (Latin: Collegium Trilingue), Collège National, Collège Impérial, it was named Collège de France in 1870.What makes it unique is that attendance is free and open to anyone, even though some high-level courses are not open to the general public. The school's goal is to "teach science in the making" and therefore the professors are chosen from among the foremost researchers of the day, with no requirement other than that of being at the top of their fields. They are chosen from a variety of disciplines, in both science and the humanities. Even though the motto of the Collège is "Docet Omnia," Latin for "It teaches everything," its goal can be best summed up by Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phrase: "Not preconceived notions, but the idea of free thought" which is burned in golden letters above the main hall of the Collège building.The Collège does not grant degrees, but has research laboratories, as well as one of the best research libraries of Europe, with sections focusing on history with rare books, humanities, social sciences, but also chemistry or physics. Gresham College is perhaps the London equivalent.FacultyThe faculty of the Collège de France currently comprises fifty-two Professors, elected by the Professors themselves from amongst eminent French scholars in a wide range of subjects. Chairs cover a range of subjects including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, history, archaeology, linguistics, oriental studies, philosophy, the social sciences and other fields. In addition, two chairs are reserved for foreign scholars who are invited to give lectures.Present Chairs, College of FrancePast faculty include (see also full list since 1530):Raymond AronJean François Boissonade de FontarabieEtienne BaluzeRoland BarthesÉmile BenvenisteHenri BergsonClaude BernardMarcelin BerthelotYves BonnefoyPierre BoulezPierre BourdieuFernando Henrique CardosoJean-François ChampollionGeorges CuvierMarie Henri d'Arbois de JubainvilleJean DarcetJacques-Arsène d'ArsonvalPierre-Gilles de GennesÉmile DeschanelGeorges DumézilLucien FebvreOronce FineMichel FoucaultFerdinand André FouquéEtienne FourmontJean-Baptiste GailCharles GideIan HackingEugène Auguste Ernest HavetFrançoise HéritierFrédéric JoliotStanislas JulienSylvestre François LacroixRené LaënnecPaul LangevinRené LericheEmmanuel Le Roy LadurieClaude Lévi-StraussAndré LichnerowiczEdmond MalinvaudHenri MasperoLouis MassignonMaurice Merleau-PontyJules MicheletJean-Baptiste MorinAlexis Paulin ParisPaul PelliotFrançois Pétis de la CroixGuillaume PostelEdgar QuinetPetrus RamusHenri Victor RegnaultJean-Pierre-Abel RémusatJean-Baptiste SayJean-Pierre SerreFrançois SimiandPaul ValéryJean-Pierre Vernant==External links==Collège de FranceCategory:Collège de France Category:Education in Paris Category:Grands établissements Category:1530 establishments Category:5th arrondissement of Parisbg:Колеж дьо Франс cs:Collège de France de:Collège de France es:Collège de France eu:Collège de France fr:Collège de France it:Collège de France he:קולז' דה פראנס la:Collegium Franciae nl:Collège de France ja:コレージュ・ド・フランス no:Collège de France nn:Collège de France pl:Collège de France pt:Collège de France ru:Коллеж де Франс sk:Collège de France sv:Collège de France vi:Collège de France zh:法兰西学院 (大学)
