He went on to in the Ricardo Zamora Trophy for the 2005-06 season, after allowing just 28 goals in 37 matches, a goals per match ratio of 0.78. He was also eventually awarded the captain's armband, appearing in 125 games in the first division and 56 in the second, as well as competing in the UEFA Champions League (in 2003-04, although backing up Pablo Cavallero in the domestic league, he would appear in 5 group stage matches, as Celta proggressed to the round-of-16 game) and in the UEFA Cup.Pinto signed on loan for FC Barcelona on January 18, 2008. He arrived as cover for the injured Albert Jorquera after the latter damaged knee ligaments during the festive break. He made his debut on April 26, in a match against Deportivo La Coruña, which Barcelona lost 2-0. His second match also ended in defeat, as Barcelona lost 3-2 (despite being 2-0 up) at home to Real Mallorca.On May 30, 2008, Barcelona signed Pinto on a permanent deal, for two years and €500,000.HonoursCelta de Vigo:Spanish Cup: Runner-up 2001-02==Individual awards==2005-06 Zamora TrophyReferencesExternal linksStats at Liga de Fútbol Profesional Celta Vigo profile   Victor Valdes |after= Roberto Abbondanzieri|years=2005-06  Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish footballers Category:Football (soccer) goalkeepers Category:La Liga footballers Category:Celta de Vigo footballers Category:Real Betis footballers Category:FC Barcelona footballersca:José Manuel Pinto Colorado de:José Manuel Pinto es:José Manuel Pinto fr:José Manuel Pinto gl:José Manuel Pinto Colorado id:José Manuel Pinto it:José Manuel Pinto he:חוזה מנואל פינטו nl:José Manuel Pinto ja:ホセ・マヌエル・ピント・コロラド no:José Manuel Pinto pl:José Manuel Pinto pt:José Manuel Pinto Colorado ru:Пинто, Хосе Мануэль sq:José Manuel Pinto fi:José Manuel Pinto sv:José Manuel Pinto Colorado zh:何塞·曼努埃尔·平托
