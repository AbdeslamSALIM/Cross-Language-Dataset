   The Lycopodiaceae (class Lycopodiopsida, order Lycopodiales) is a family of primitive vascular plants, including all of the core clubmosses. These plants bear spores on specialized structures at the apex of a shoot; they resemble a tiny battle club, from which the common name derives. They are non-flowering and do not produce seeds.The genera Huperzia, Phlegmariurus and Phylloglossum, the species of which were generally included in a more broadly defined Lycopodium in older classifications, are treated in the separate family Huperziaceae in some classifications; they differ in producing spores in small lateral structures in the leaf axils. There is as yet no consensus on the recognition of Huperziaceae as a separate family; a more broadly defined Lycopodiaceae, including these genera, is still recognized in some classifications.UsesThe spores have been used by violin makers for centuries as a pore filler. This filler is commercially available through Howard Core and Associates.In Cornwall, club mosses gathered during certain lunar phases were historically used as a remedy for eye disease.== References and external links ==Growing Lycopodiaceae On CultureSheet.orgWagner, W.
