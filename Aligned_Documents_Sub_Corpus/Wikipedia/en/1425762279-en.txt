The flowers are single, hermaphrodite, and have five actinomorphic (equal in shape and size) petals. The fruit is produced in a capsule.The Parnassiaceae is sometimes treated as part of the Saxifragaceae, rather than as a separate family, though genetic research by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group shows that they are only distantly related to this family.Category:Celastrales da:Leverurt-familien de:Herzblattgewächse es:Parnassiaceae fr:Parnassiaceae ja:ウメバチソウ科 lt:Mandrauninkiniai nl:Parnassiafamilie pl:Dziewięciornikowate pt:Parnassiaceae ru:Белозоровые zh:梅花草科
