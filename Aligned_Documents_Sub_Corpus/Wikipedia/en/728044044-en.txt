In the same year, it made a profit of 2.7 billion yuan, with an operating revenue of 44.9 billion yuan and total expenses standing at 42.4 billion yuan.Channel News Asia Air China statsIt is the 4th largest airline in Asia, 5th largest in the world in terms of domestic cargo traffic and 17th largest airline in the world by terms of fleet size.History]]livery parked at the airline's hub Beijing Capital International Airport]]BeginningAir China was established on July 1, 1988. Its formation was a result of the government's decision to split the operating divisions of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) into separate airlines.  The CAAC was restructured in late 1987 and divided into six airlines, namely Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, China Northern, China Southwest, and China Northwest. Air China, based in Beijing, was given chief responsibility for intercontinental flights, and took over the CAAC's long haul aircraft (Boeing 747s, 767s, and 707s, as well as medium-haul 737s) and routes when it was granted its autonomy on July 1, 1988.  on a day of hazy smog (background)]]At the time of its launch 1988, Air China had 6,000 employees and served 31 international and 30 domestic destinations. It was China's largest airline company and the national flag carrier. In 1989, Air China posted a net profit of $106 million on revenues of $383 million. In that same year, Air China entered a joint venture with Lufthansa, which provided 40 percent of the capital, or $220 million, to create the Beijing Aircraft Maintenance Center (Ameco Beijing). It specialized in the upkeep of the Boeing aircraft that comprised Air China's fleet."Air China Launches New Service, Works on Image," USA Today, October 9, 1991, p. 8B. The venture was expanded with another $218 million (¥n1.2 billion) in 1992. Ameco Beijing employed nearly 4,000 people, a little fewer than 50 of them from Lufthansa.Bangsberg, P.T., "Lufthansa, China Plan More Funds for Aircraft Maintenance Venture," Journal of Commerce, June 24, 1992, p. 2B. Air Transport World reported the company preferred to source its needs through joint ventures due to the country's lack of hard currency.Vandyk, Anthony, "Air China: New Name, New Heights," Air Transport World, February 1991, p. 54. Its Beijing Air Catering was 40 percent owned by a large Hong Kong caterer.Flynn, Ann Amelia, "China's Airlines Take Wing," China Business Review (Washington), May/June 1993, p. 14.painted with Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics livery at Beijing Capital International Airport]]DeregulationFurther deregulation of the aviation business took place in 1994, enabling foreign investment in airports and facilitating the import of aircraft built outside mainland China."Air China to Stand Alone," Airfinance Journal, March 1995, p. 8. By 1996 the country had 108 airports with scheduled airline services and around 30 different airlines. In 1997, Air China reported sales of $1.38 billion (¥n11.5 billion). The fleet had grown to 65 aircraft and the carrier was flying 144 routes overall. By October 1997, Air China was planning a public stock offering.Harding, James, "Air China Plans Overseas Float," Financial Times (London), October 15, 1997. China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines had listed on the Hong Kong and New York exchanges earlier in the year. Air China delayed plans based due to poor financial performance and a downturn in business caused by the Asian financial crisis. About 16 million passengers flew Air China in 1998.Early in 2000, Air China teamed with China National Aviation Co. Group (CNAC), the CAAC's Hong Kong-listed commercial arm, to establish a Hong Kong branch (95% owned by Air China). Direct flights to London from Hong Kong soon began. Air China faced competition at its home base from Air France, which increased its four flights a week to Beijing, begun in 1997, to daily service. British Airways also wanted to increase its frequencies (it was operating 18 flights a week to China).Lo, Joseph, "Star Alliance Beckons Air China," South China Morning Post, Bus. Sec., May 24, 2001, p. 2.ConsolidationIn mid-2000, the CAAC repeated earlier calls for a consolidation of the ten airlines it controlled into three.Chang, Leslie, "China Intends to Merge 10 Airlines Into Three," Wall Street Journal, July 24, 2000, p. A21. (Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern were to each acquire the smaller airlines.) However, the CAAC blocked a proposed merger in September 2000 between Air China and China Southern on anti-competitive grounds."CAAC Blocks China Southern Merger with Air China," AFX-Asia, September 28, 2000.In January 2001, the CAAC's ten airlines announced they had agreed on a merger plan.Ng, Eric, "Air China Set to Announce Lead Bank for Listing," South China Morning Post, Bus. Sec., July 16, 2001, p. 4. Air China was to acquire China Southwest Airlines and China International Airlines, the country's fourth strongest domestic airline. This was to create a group with assets of ¥n56 billion (HK$ 52.5 billion), including 118 aircraft.Holland, Tom, "China Break-In," Far Eastern Economic Review, October 25, 2001, p. 41. On October 28, 2002, Air China consolidated with China National Aviation Corporation and China Southwest Airlines.During 2004, Air China absorbed Zhejiang Airlines (a subsidiary of CNAC). On 15 December 2004 the company listed its shares on the Hong Kong and London Stock Exchanges. Air China has shareholdings in Air China Cargo (51%), Air Macau (51%) and also holds majority shares of Shandong Airlines. On June 9, 2006, a joint announcement revealed a new shareholding structure in which Air China will acquire a 17.5% stake in Cathay Pacific, while the latter will own 20% of the former.There are still ongoing plans for further consolidation of the Chinese airline industry and Air China will likely continue to play an important part in these plans.OperationsAir China operates in four segments:Air China Ltd 0753.HK (Hong Kong) Reuters.comAirline Operations segment, which comprises the provision of air passenger and air cargo services;Engineering Services segment, providing aircraft engineering services, such as aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul services;Airport Terminal Services segment, offering ground services that include check-in services, boarding services, premium class lounge services, ramp services, luggage handling services, loading and unloading services, cabin cleaning and transit services,Others segment, which comprises the provision of air catering services and other airline-related services.SubsidiariesAir China Cargo, flight logistics companyAir China Business Jet, business jet companyFinancial performanceFor fiscal year ending December, 2006:Sales: $5,747.4MOne year growth: 21.1%Net income: $422.7MIncome growth: 38.1%Destinationsin Star Alliance livery, landing at Vancouver International Airport]] Air China's route network extends from China to Asia, Middle East, Western Europe, and North America. The majority of the routes operate from its Beijing hub.It currently operates a significant number of Asian, Australian and European destinations from Shanghai Pudong International Airport. This will also extend to North America when it adds an additional San Francisco service, complementing its service from Beijing and complementing United Airlines codeshares on the route. It also has some international routes operating and connecting from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport, Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport, Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport, Dubai International Airport, Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, Kunming Wujiaba International Airport, Madrid Barajas International Airport, Nanning Wuxu International Airport and Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport.Today, Air China is increasing its international presence, starting service on 13 new routes between 2008/9.

The service began with the Boeing 767-300 aircraft but because of its popularity, the service has been upgraded to A330-200. However, Air China ended service to Sao Paulo in September 2008. This was Air China's longest route.Routes to Australia, Frankfurt, Madrid currently operated by Airbus A330-200 may be replaced by Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The Boeing 787 Dreamliners will be used on flights to Toronto and Washington, D.C. when they are launched.Air China is launching many flights to European destinations, as it believes these services will become very popular in the coming years. The airline has already stated they are happy to make losses on these routes at first, but hopefully they will build up a good brand image in Europe, so as to make them a premier choice for those flying to China.FleetPassengerAs of September 2008, Air China fleet includes the following aircraft: + Air China FleetAircraftTotalPassengers  (First/Business/Ecomomy)RoutesNotesAirbus A319-10033  (2 orders)128 (8/120)Domestic, AsiaAirbus A320-2006164 (8/156)Domestic, AsiaAirbus A321-2006  (18 orders)185 (16/169)DomesticAirbus A330-20019  (21 orders)283 (12/271)  240 (36/215)Domestic, Sydney, Melbourne, Frankfurt,  Paris, Vancouver, Madrid, Hong Kong, London (seasonal), Stockholm, Dubai, Athens, Munich.Features new business class  Two in Star Alliance Livery (B-6091, B-6093)Airbus A340-3006255 (8/28/219)Domestic, Rome, Milan, Frankfurt, London-Heathrow (seasonal)Features new first and business classBoeing 737-30041128 (8/120)Domestic, Fukuoka, Ho Chi Minh, Osaka, Pyongyang.Boeing 737-6006110 (8/102)DomesticBoeing 737-70020126 (8/118)Domestic, AsiaBoeing 737-80046  (44 orders)167 (8/159)Domestic, AsiaB-5176 in Olympic liveryBoeing 747-4004344 (10/42/292)  346 (10/42/294)Domestic, Shanghai, Frankfurt, New York-JFKFeatures new first and business classBoeing 747-400M]]8307 (18/40/249)  280 (10/24/246)Los Angeles, San Francisco, Paris-CDG, Rome-Fiumicino, Frankfurt, London (Seasonal)Being retrofitted to feature new first and business classBoeing 757-20012200 (8/192) 201 (8/193)Domestic, AsiaBoeing 767-200ER3214 (18/196)Domestic, DubaiTo be phased out by 2008Boeing 767-3003225 (10/26/189)Southeast AsiaTo be phased out by 2010Boeing 767-300ER3225 (10/26/189)Delhi, SingaporeTo be phased out by 2010Boeing 777-20010345 (49/296)  314 (12/49/253)Domestic, Seoul-Incheon, Tokyo-Narita, Singapore, Munich, MoscowBoeing 777-300ER(15 orders)UnknownLos Angeles, New York-JFK, San Francisco, Frankfurt, Warsaw (When Launched)Entry: 2011Boeing 787-8(15 orders)Sydney, Toronto, Washington DC, Warsaw (When Launched)Entry into service: Fourth Quarter 2009Cargo fleetAs of January 2008, Air China's average fleet age was 7.8 years old.

These aircraft are to be delivered between 2007 and 2010. However, Air China has no plans to order the Airbus A380 in their fleet, because they think that it just makes more sense by using one kind of Jumbo jet. Before, Airbus has stated that Air China were to be the next few customers to order the A380, however, it may order the A380 superjumbo since they did not have a plan to rule out purchases of the big Airbus plane in the future.Airbus, Again in 2008, Air China bought 20 Airbus A330 aircraft, scheduled to be delivered in 2011 - 2014 to meet expected growth and demand.
