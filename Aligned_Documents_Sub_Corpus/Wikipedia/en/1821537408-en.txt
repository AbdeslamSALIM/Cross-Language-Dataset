 Criminal Minds is an American crime drama that premiered September 22, 2005 on CBS. It is produced by The Mark Gordon Company in association with ABC Studios and CBS Paramount Network Television. The show follows the adventures of a team of profilers from the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) at Quantico, Virginia. Criminal Minds differs from many criminal system procedural dramas by focusing on the criminal rather than the crime itself.Criminal Minds initially starred Mandy Patinkin as Jason Gideon and Thomas Gibson as Aaron Hotchner. On July 17, 2007, it was announced that Patinkin had been granted a request to be released from his role on the show. Patinkin was replaced by Joe Mantegna, who joined the cast several episodes later after Patinkin left the show.The series' third season, which premiered on September 26, 2007, was interrupted in late 2007 by the industry-wide writer's strike. It aired its last pre-strike episode on January 23, 2008. Following the resolution of the strike, the show returned to air on April 2 2008.On May 14, 2008, Criminal Minds was renewed for a fourth season. The fourth season premiered on September 24, 2008.The series is now in syndication on both ION Television and A&amp;E Network.CharactersCurrent charactersFBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent Aaron "Hotch" Hotchner: Played by Thomas Gibson, Hotch was formerly assigned to the FBI Field Office in Seattle, Washington. Currently, he is the head of the BAU team. He has a son named Jack by way of an ex-wife. Hotch's attempts to balance his family life and his job successfully is an ongoing theme on the show. After a two-week suspension for releasing a serial killer, Hotch requested a transfer by Erin Strauss, who was pressuring him for such a request. This pleased his wife, until Agent Morgan begged Hotch to come help on a case in Milwaukee and while he was packing up his desk, Garcia handed him the case file and lied to him, telling him that his transfer was held up and that JJ wanted him to have the file. Hotch decided to stay with the BAU against his wife's wishes—when he returned to Virginia, his wife and son were gone. In episode 3x11 (Birthright) he was served with divorce papers as he was leaving the office; he is seen signing them in a later episode. In episode 3x01 (Doubt) it was revealed that Hotchner had previously worked as a prosecutor - more specifically, episode 3x19 (Tabula Rasa) indicated he had been with the District Attorney's office. In 1x08 (Natural Born Killer), when he is interrogating Vincent Perotta, Hotchner comments on the fact that it is logical for some of the abused to become killers. In response to further conversation with Perotta, Hotchner counters his assertion that some abused children become killers by saying: "Some grow up to catch them." This comment seems to pretty clearly imply that Hotchner was also abused as a child. His hearing has been damaged as a result of the car explosion he was caught in within Season 3.FBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent David Rossi: Played by Joe Mantegna, David was in early retirement until his voluntary return to the BAU. He had retired in order to go on lecture and book tours but returned to settle some unfinished business which wasn't immediately specified. In episode 3x11 (Birthright) Rossi revealed his reasons for returning to Sheriff Caulfield. He held out a charm bracelet with the names of three children from one of his first cases. The children had watched their parents get beaten to death and he promised them he would find out who did it. Each year on Christmas Eve, Rossi calls the children to let them know he hasn't forgotten them and he hasn't given up on solving the case of their parents' murders. He kept with this tradition through his return to the BAU, though none of the children had replied to his most recent call. Rossi finally told Caulfield that the case had gone unsolved for 20 years; it was finally solved in episode 3x14 (Damaged).[[Image:Criminal cast main.jpg|thumb|The cast of Criminal Minds|right|260px]]FBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent Derek Morgan: Played by Shemar Moore, Morgan is a confident and assertive everyman character, the son of an African-American father and Caucasian mother. He has a black belt in Judo, runs FBI self-defense classes, and previously served in a bomb squad unit and as a Chicago police officer. He and his two sisters (Sarah and Desirée) grew up in a tough urban Chicago neighborhood. After the death of his father when he was ten, Morgan struggled somewhat; youthful fighting earned him a juvenile criminal record. He was taken under the wing of a local youth center coordinator, Carl Buford. Buford acted as a surrogate father to Morgan and helped Morgan to obtain a college football scholarship, but also sexually abused him — episode 2x12 (Profiler, Profiled) revealed and focused on this.FBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent Dr. Spencer Reid: Played by Matthew Gray Gubler, Doctor Reid is a genius who graduated from high school at age 12. In his youth, his father left him and his mother, no longer able to deal with the paranoid schizophrenia of Reid's mom. Reid grew up learning nearly everything he knows from books, with his mother often reading to him. Still, Reid knew the way his mother was living wasn't healthy. When he was eighteen, he had his mother placed in a mental institution. She is still there and Reid has stated that he sends letters every day because of the guilt he feels for not visiting her. Reid is also worried about the fact that his mother's illness can be passed on genetically; he once told Morgan that "I know what it's like to be afraid of your own mind." After being kidnapped by a serial killer with multiple personalities and tortured and drugged for days, Reid developed an addiction problem. This problem was discovered by Hotch and Gideon over time, as well as an old friend of Reid's in New Orleans. He has since become clean; in episode 3x16 (Elephant's Memory) he attended a support group meeting for addicts in law enforcement. He said he'd been experiencing cravings recently and spoke of the teenage suspect shot in front of him before being interrupted by a page from work. Reid has an eidetic memory, meaning that he can remember an exceedingly large amount of information with extraordinary detail. In the season four episode 4x03 (Minimal Loss) he and his fellow agent are held hostage by a cult resulting in him feeling guilty over his fellow agent getting beaten by the cult leader. At the end of the episode his fellow agent tells him not to feel guilty because it was her decision.FBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent Jennifer "JJ" Jareau: Played by AJ Cook, JJ acts as the team's liaison with the media and local police agencies. She is not actually a profiler, having once declined Hotchner's suggestion to "take the classes" to qualify as one.Criminal Minds: North Mammon recap She once went on a date to a Washington Redskins game with Reid but little has come of it romantically. JJ graduated from East Allegheny High School near Pittsburgh, PA, where she was the captain of the varsity soccer team her senior year and earned an athletic scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh. When she and Reid split up the night of Reid's abduction, JJ walked into a dark barn and was attacked by several ferocious dogs, which she shot and killed. This had a huge emotional impact but has not come up since. Recently she shot and killed a man in a hostage situation at the BAU which so far seems to have had only minor effects. She is pregnant with Detective William LaMontagne Jr's baby and he has asked her to marry him. At the end of the season three finale he indicates that he's willing to give up his shield in order to help take care of the baby and allow her to continue to do her job but he is still worried about her safety and the safety of their child.FBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent Emily Prentiss: Played by Paget Brewster, Prentiss is the daughter of an ambassador. In her first appearance, she recognizes Hotch from one of his first commands: security clearance for her mother. Her arrival surprises both Hotch and Gideon, as neither of them had signed off on the transfer. Prentiss insists her parents have not pulled strings for her. Ultimately she joins the team at the end of episode 2x09 (The Last Word) on a probationary basis. She replaces Agent Elle Greenaway. She is a graduate of Yale and has been working for the FBI for a little under ten years, primarily in the Midwest. She is fluent in Arabic from her childhood spent traveling and residing in the Middle East; she can also speak some Spanish and Russian. After being pressured by Section Chief Erin Strauss to assist in the end of Hotch's career, she resigned from the FBI. However, Garcia managed to keep her departure on hold in the computer system just long enough for the rest of the team to convince her to stay with the BAU. Upon her return, Section Chief Strauss remarked that neither Prentiss, Hotch, nor the rest of the team would be able to climb the ladder to the top because of all this, thus putting an end to some of Prentiss's future ambitions. In the third episode of season 4 episode 4x03 (Minimal Loss) her and her fellow agent are held hostage by a cult.FBI Audio/Visual Technician Penelope Garcia: Played by Kirsten Vangsness, Garcia is the team's Audio/Visual Technician at BAU Headquarters in Quantico, VA. When she speaks with Morgan they use pet names such as "hot stuff" or "sweet cheeks". Although they haven't pursued a romantic relationship, Garcia did show mild jealousy at the sight of Morgan dancing with two other women. Her parents died in an auto accident due to a drunk driver when she was eighteen and she now helps counsel the families auto-accident victims in her spare time. In episode 3x09 (Penelope) Garcia admitted that after her parents died she dropped out of Caltech and went "underground" but continued to teach herself computer coding. She had been on one of the FBI's hackers lists and they recruited her from there, hence her job with the BAU. She is into online games, specifically MMORPGs. She has broken down crying several times due to the fact that one area of her job is to listen to and watch terrifying things in her office to analyze them for the team. However, according to Agent Hotchner, she "fills her office with figurines and color to remind herself to smile as the horror fills her screens." Garcia was shot in episode 3x08 (Lucky) by a man with whom she had just gone on a date but she survived the gunshot when the bullet, which was aimed at her heart, ricocheted into her stomach.Recurring charactersHaley Hotchner:Played by Meredith Monroe, she is the wife of series regular Agent Hotchner. Together they have a newborn son named Jack. Jack's name was revealed in episode 2x04 (Psychodrama). Their marital issues are a running theme and by the end of episode 3x02 (In Name and Blood, also entitled In Birth and Death) it looks as though Haley and Jack have left. At the end of episode 3x03 (Scared to Death) Hotch mentions to Morgan that he isn't sure if Haley is coming back. At the end of episode 3x11 (Birthright) Haley has Hotch served with divorce papers as he is leaving the office for the day.FBI Section Chief Director Erin Strauss:Played by Jayne Atkinson, she is the BAU's direct superior. Her job lies in administration, and she has no actual field experience. She is under the impression that Hotchner's team is unorganized and pose a threat to the BAU, prompting her to enlist Emily Prentiss to spy on the team (a request that was denied) and to attempt Hotch's removal from the BAU with a pending investigation on his methods. She resigns her attention from the team eventually, but not before making sure that none of them will ever be able to move up in any higher positions within the FBI.Detective William LaMontagne Jr: Played by Josh Stewart, Detective LaMontagne was first seen in 2x18 (Jones) as a New Orleans detective investigating a serial killer case which had initially belonged to his father, who had been a detective before unfortunately being killed in Hurricane Katrina. The killer was believed to have suffered the same fate but when evidence to the contrary arose, Detective LaMontagne took over the case using the work his father had done and a single word carved on the wall of his father's home, left as a clue. Detective LaMontagne called in the BAU to assist him and they were ultimately successful in capturing the murderer. In this episode we first see the attraction between JJ and LaMontagne. In 3x16 (In Heat) it is revealed that they have been involved for over a year and in 3x17 (The Crossing) we discover JJ is pregnant; in the season three finale (Lo-Fi) we discover that LaMontagne is willing to give up his job to raise the baby with JJ and that he has asked her to marry him.Former charactersFBI BAU Supervisory Special Agent Jason Gideon: Played by Mandy Patinkin, Gideon was the BAU's best profiler. He helped both Morgan and Reid through separate bouts of nightmares. Prior to the series he was said to have had a nervous breakdown after sending six men into a warehouse with a bomb in it. All six agents were killed and he was heavily criticized for his decision. Gideon is also skilled at chess, having continually beaten Dr. Reid. After a series of emotional cases, Gideon began to feel burned out. The last straw was Hotchner's two-week suspension, for which Gideon felt responsible. He retreated to his cabin during the suspension and left a letter for Dr. Reid, whom he knew would be the one to come looking for him. When Reid arrived at the cabin, it was empty except for the letter and Gideon's badge and weapon. Gideon was last seen remarking to a Nevada diner waitress that he didn't know where he was going or how he'd know when he got there, leaving the diner and subsequently driving off in his vehicle.FBI BAU Special Agent Elle Greenaway:Played by Lola Glaudini, Elle was formerly assigned to the FBI Field Office in Seattle, Washington, and recently assigned to the BAU as an expert in sexual offense crimes. Her father was a police officer but was killed in the line of duty. She is half Cuban and speaks Spanish. After she was shot she returned to the BAU rather quickly, against the advice of the rest of the team. Not long after, she staked out and shot a serial rapist in cold blood because of his crimes against women (and, probably, her part in accidentally ensuring his freedom). Her ability as a profiler was questioned by Hotchner and Gideon because of this, even though the local police force deemed it self-defense. She turned her badge and her gun over to Hotch, declaring that it wasn't "an admission of guilt."EpisodesDVD releasesCBS Home Entertainment released season one of Criminal Minds on DVD in Region 1 on November 28, 2006.
