The word Fluminense derives from Latin flumen, "river", rio in Portuguese. It is also the name for a native of the state of Rio de Janeiro.Football is the most heralded sport among fans and management. Fluminense won once the national championship, in 1984, and won in 1970 the Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa, which was a predecessor of the national championship. The club also won the Brazil Cup in 2007, and won two Rio-São Paulo Tournaments, the major football competition in Brazil before a national league was formed. Fluminense is also the record holder for Rio de Janeiro State Championship (known as Campeonato Carioca) titles.Fluminense is, together with Botafogo, Vasco da Gama and Flamengo, one of the four major football clubs of the city. Other noteworthy clubs in Rio include Bangu and América.OriginsOscar Cox introduced football to Rio. He played in Switzerland during his studies in Lausanne. When he returned to Rio, aged 22, he gathered a group of men who also wanted to play this as-yet relatively unknown sport. After playing some matches in Rio and in São Paulo, they decided to found a club.The foundation meeting took place on 21 July 1902, at the home of Horácio da Costa Santos on Rua Marques de Abrantes 51. Oscar Cox was elected the first president.The first match was on 19 October 1902 on the Paysandu Cricket Club field against Rio FC. Fluminense won 8-0 and the first goal was scored by Horácio da Costa Santos. The team won the first championship they played, in 1906, the Campeonato Carioca, the State Championship of Rio de Janeiro. They also won the next three competitions in 1907, 1908 and 1909.In 1911, they were again champions, and won all matches in Campeonato Carioca. However, a huge crisis took place at the end of this year, when nine players from the main team quit the club after quarreling over who should manage the team. These nine players decided to join Flamengo, which hitherto had only been engaged in rowing. By founding the football section of Flamengo, they started one of the most famous rivalries in Brazilian football: the Fla-Flu. The first of these derbies took place on 17 July 7 1912. Although Flamengo had nearly all the players who had won the championship the previous year, Fluminense, which retained only Oswaldo Gomes and James Calvert from that side, prevailed with the final score being 3-2.On 27 July 1914, Fluminense hosted the first match of the Brazilian national team which faced the visiting English club side Exeter City F.C. at Laranjeiras Stadium. Brazil won 2-0 and Flamengo's own Oswaldo Gomes scored the first goal http://paginas.terra.com.br/esporte/rsssfbrasil/miscellaneous/matbrlaranj.htm .StadiumFluminense's own stadium is Estádio das Laranjeiras, built in 1905. The maximum capacity is 8,000 people but it was previously 25,000 http://www.flumania.com.br/laranjeiras1919.jpg. Public interest in refurbishment of the stadium took place in the sixties, when the club sold a part of its grounds for the construction of what is now the Rua Pinheiro Machado. Laranjeiras is the oldest stadium in Brazil, and is heritage listed. The club is planning to build a new one outside the traditional Laranjeiras district (Rio de Janeiro's South Zone). Generally, Fluminense hosts matches at the Maracanã stadium.The average attendance for league matches per 2007 is 17,071.Total Atendance of Fluminense in Titles Won in Maracanã Era.Matches when Fluminense won titles out from MaracanãMatches when Fluminense won titles in MaracanãFansFans are called "tricolores", a reference to the team's three colours (claret, white and green).One of the team's most famous chants is "A Bênção, João de Deus" ("Bless us, John of God"), a song that was composed in honour of the pope John Paul II on his first visit to Brazil in 1980. The tradition is that Fluminense fans spontaneously started singing the famous song when the team was to decide the 1980 state championship on a penalty shootout against their arch-rivals Vasco da Gama. Fluminense won the championship.Fluminense's supporters are usually related to Rio de Janeiro's upper classes, in opposition to those who support Flamengo. However, the popularity of the club reaches beyond the city limits. There are an estimated 2 million Fluminense supporters all over Brazil and abroad. Only one-third of the fans actually live in Rio de Janeiro State.The Olympic CupFluminense's greatest honour was not won on a football pitch. Among its collection of national and international trophies stands the diploma received in 1949 regarding the award of the IOC's Olympic Cup ("Coupe Olympique").The Cup is a non-competitive award, instituted by Pierre de Coubertin in 1906, for distinguished service in upholding the ideals of the Olympic Movement and to recognise the particular merits of institutions or associations and their services rendered to sport. The Cup is on permanent exhibition at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne.HonoursOfficial trophiesBrazilian Champions 1984Torneio Roberto Gomes Pedrosa 1970Copa do Brasil 2007 http://www.canalfluminense.com.br/camp/copadobrasil2007/Rio-São Paulo Tournament 1957, 1960South Zone of Taça Brasil 1960Campeonato Carioca (Rio de Janeiro State Championship) (30x): 1906, 1907(1), 1908, 1909, 1911, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1924, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1946, 1951, 1959, 1964, 1969, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1995, 2002 (sub judice http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campeonato_Carioca), 2005Copa Rio:1952 (World Cup Clubs)Taça Guanabara: 1966, 1969, 1971, 1975, 1983, 1985, 1991, 1993.Taça Rio: 1990, 2005Torneio Municipal : 1938 e 1948Torneio Extra : 1941Torneio Aberto : 19351 shared with BotafogoYouth tournamentsFIFA Champions-Under-18 : 2005.FIFA Champions-Under-15 : 2005, 2008.International Youth Tournament (Under-20) in United Arab Emirates: 2008Monthey Youth Tournament (Under-20, in Monthey, Switzerland): 2006.Obendorf Youth Tournament (Under-20, in Obendorf, Germany): 2001.Copa São Paulo de Juniores (Under-20): 1971, 1973, 1977, 1986 and 1989.Campeonato Carioca de Juniores (Rio de Janeiro State Championship Under-20): 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1955, 1968, 1970, 1975, 1976, 1988, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2008.Copa Macaé de Juvenis: 2002, 2003Copa Santiago de Futebol Juvenil: 1999Milk Cup: 2007Manchester United Premier Cup: 2005, 2008Friendly tournamentsCopa Rio (International) 1952Copa International de Verão do Rio de Janeiro (Brazil): 1973Copa Viña del Mar (Chile): 1976Tournoi International de Paris 1976, 1987Teresa Herrera Trophy, (La Coruña, Spain): 1977Tournament in Seoul: 1984Kirin Cup: 1987Tournament in Kiev: 1989Moscatel de SetúbalTrophy (Portugal): 1915/1918Vulcain Trophy Fluminense vs. Sporting Lisboa (in Brazil): 1928Copa General Manuel A.
