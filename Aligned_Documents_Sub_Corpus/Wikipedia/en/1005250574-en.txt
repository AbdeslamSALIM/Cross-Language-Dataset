  Kotor (Cyrillic script: Котор; ; Greek Askrèvion, Ασκρηβιον; Italian Cattaro) is a coastal town in Montenegro. It is located in a most secluded part of Gulf of Kotor. The town has a population of 13,510, and is the administrative center of the Kotor municipality.The old Mediterranean port of Kotor, surrounded by an impressive city wall built by Republic of Venice and the Venetian influence remains dominant among the architectural influences. The Bay of Kotor (Boka Kotorska), one of the most indented parts of the Adriatic Sea is sometimes called the southern-most fjord in Europe (though it is actually a submerged river canyon). With the nearly overhanging limestone cliffs of Orjen and Lovćen one of the great Mediterranean landscapes is created.In recent years, Kotor has seen a steady increase in tourists attracted by both the natural beauty of the Gulf of Kotor and the old town of Kotor itself.HistoryKotor, first mentioned in 168 BC, was settled during Ancient Roman times, when it was known as Acruvium, Ascrivium, or Ascruvium and was part of the Roman province of Dalmatia.Kotor has been fortified since the early Middle Ages, when Emperor Justinian built a fortress above Acruvium in AD 535, after expelling the Goths, and a second town probably grew up on the heights round it, for Constantine Porphyrogenitus, in the 10th century, alludes to Lower Kotor. The city was plundered by the Saracens in 840. Until the 11th century the Dalmatian language was spoken in Kotor.In 1002, the city suffered damage under occupation of the First Bulgarian Empire, and in the following year it was ceded to Serbia by the Bulgarian Tsar Samuil, but the locals revolted in alliance with the Republic of Ragusa, and only submitted in 1184, as a protected state, preserving intact its republican institutions, and its right to conclude treaties and engage in war. It was already an episcopal see, and, in the 13th century, Dominican and Franciscan monasteries were established to check the spread of Bogomilism.In the 14th century the commerce of Kotor, as the city was then called, rivaled that of the nearby Republic of Ragusa, and provoked the jealousy of Venice. Kotor was part of the Venetian Albania province of the Venetian Republic from 1420 to 1797, except for periods of Ottoman administration between 1538-1571 and 1657-1699. Those four centuries gave to the city the typical Venetian baroque architecture, that has contributed to make Kotor an UNESCO "world patrimony".Under Venetian rule, Kotor was besieged by the Ottoman Empire in 1538 and 1657, visited by the plague in 1572, and nearly destroyed by earthquakes in 1563 and 1667. Under the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, it passed to the Habsburg Monarchy. However, in 1805, it was assigned to the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg. After the Russians retreated, Kotor was united in 1810 with the French Empire's Illyrian Provinces. Kotor was then captured by British naval Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns). Working jointly with Montenegran forces he attacked the mountain fortress, hauling ships' cannon and mortars to positions above the fort using block and tackle. The French garrison had no alternative but to surrender, which it did on 5 January 1814.It was then restored to the Austrian Empire by the Congress of Vienna.In World War I, Kotor was one of the three bases of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, homeport for the Austrian Fifth Fleet consisting of pre-dreadnought battleships and light cruisers. The area was the site of some of the fiercest battles between local Montenegrin Slavs, and Austria-Hungary. After 1918, the city (called Cattaro until then) became a part of Yugoslavia and became known as Kotor officially. Between 1941 and 1943 Italy annexed the area of Kotor to the Italian "Governorship of Dalmatia", but after 1945 it became a part of the then Socialist Republic of Montenegro within Yugoslavia's second incarnation.In 1979 (April 15) a major earthquake hit the Montenegrin coastal area. The victims were approximately 100 people. Half of Kotor's Old Town was destroyed. St. Tryphon's Cathedral was partly damaged.Up until the beginning of the 20th century, Catholics constituted the majority in Kotor as well as in other places around the Gulf of Kotor.Kotor is still the seat of the Croatian Catholic Bishopric of Kotor, which covers the entire gulf.Population(Not yet a State Party to the World Heritage Convention) | Type = Cultural | Criteria = i, ii, iii, iv | ID = 125 | Region = Europe and North America | Year = 1979 | Session = 3rd | Extension = 1979-2003 | Link = http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/125 Kotor is the administrative centre of Kotor municipality, which includes towns of Dobrota, Risan and Perast, as well as many small hamlets around the Bay of Kotor.
