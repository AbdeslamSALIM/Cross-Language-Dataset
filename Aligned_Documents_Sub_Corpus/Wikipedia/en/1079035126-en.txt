 ]] Rupert's Land, also sometimes called "Prince Rupert's Land", was a territory in British North America, consisting of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, that was de facto owned by the Hudson's Bay Company for 200 years. The area once known as Rupert's Land is now mainly a part of Canada, but a small portion is now in the United States of America. It was named after Prince Rupert of the Rhine, a nephew of Charles I and the first Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company.Areas once belonging to Rupert's Land include all of Manitoba, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southern Nunavut, northern parts of Ontario and Quebec, as well as parts of Minnesota and North Dakota and very small parts of Montana and South Dakota.Colonial historyIn 1670, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) was granted a charter by King Charles II, giving it a trading monopoly over the watershed of all rivers and streams flowing into Hudson Bay, thereby making the HBC de facto owners of the whole of Rupert's Land. This covered an area of 3.9 million square kilometres (1.5 million sq&nbsp;mi), over one-third the area of Canada today.On 19 November, 1869 the Hudson's Bay Company sold Rupert's Land to the newly formed Canadian Government for £300,000. Control was originally planned to be transferred on December 1 of that year, but due to setbacks caused by the Red River Rebellion the government assumed control on 15 July, 1870. The region then became known as The Northwest Territories.See also49th parallel northBritish Arctic TerritoriesHudson's Bay CompanyHudson's Bay Company ArchivesFurther reading * Category:Former British colonies Category:British North America Category:Fur trade Category:Watersheds of Canadacs:Země prince Ruperta de:Ruperts Land et:Ruperti maa es:Tierra de Rupert fr:Terre de Rupert it:Terra di Rupert nl:Rupertland ja:ルパート・ランド no:Rupert's Land pl:Ziemia Ruperta pt:Terra de Rupert ru:Земля Руперта
