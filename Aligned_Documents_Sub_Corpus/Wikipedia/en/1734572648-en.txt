Venni Vetti Vicci was certified platinum by the RIAA on July 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;''Rule 3:36'' (2000)Ja Rule would return during the summer of 2000, with his new single "Between Me and You", which featured Def Soul act Christina Milian. The single was quickly followed by Ja's second effort, Rule 3:36, which was released on October 10, 2000. 3:36 also featured singles "Put It On Me," and "I Cry." The album featured guest appearances from Lil Mo, Vita, Christina Milian, label mates Jayo Felony, and Black Child. Rule 3:36 debuted at #1 on the Billboard Charts, eventually going 3x Platinum.''Pain Is Love'' (2001)Soon after the release of Rule 3:36, Irv Gotti signed R&B singer Ashanti to the label, which led to Lil Mo ending her collaborations with the label. During the late summer of 2001, Ja Rule released "Livin' It Up", the lead single from his third studio album, Pain Is Love. The second single was the "I'm Real (remix)", and the third was "Always On Time", and the last was "Down Ass Bitch". Pain Is Love featured guest appearances from Case, The Murder Inc. Family, Missy Elliott, Jodie Mack, Tweet, Jennifer Lopez and a recording from the late Tupac Shakur. Along with its critical success it was also a commercial success, reaching 3x Platinum certification.''The Last Temptation'' (2002)Ja Rule shaved his head during the promotion of his fourth studio album, The Last Temptation. His fourth album was released on November 19, 2002. The album was certified platinum.''Blood In My Eye'' (2003)Blood In My Eye was his fifth album and the last released under the "Murder Inc." label, which would rename itself "The Inc." several days after the album release. It peaked at #6 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, Ja Rule met with Minster Louis Farrakhan, who wanted to intervene and prevent escalating violence in the feud between 50 Cent and Ja Rule.''R.U.L.E.'' (2004)Ja Rule's sixth studio album R.U.L.E. was released in November 2004. Its lead single was "Wonderful" featuring R. Kelly and Ashanti, followed by the street anthem "New York" featuring Fat Joe and Jadakiss and the love song "Caught Up" featuring Lloyd and Ashanti. In 2005, the RIAA certified R.U.L.E. and its single "Wonderful" gold. Critical reception of this album was poor, as with Blood in My Eye.Hiatus, departure from The Inc. (2005-2007)On December 6, 2005, The Inc. released Exodus, a greatest hits album. "Me" was the only new song in that album. Exodus was the last album on Ja Rule's contract with Def Jam. After the release of this compilation, Ja Rule took a hiatus from recording music.In 2005, The Inc. Records would come under investigation because of the drug trades by Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff, who was associated with Irv Gotti. This would all lead to Def Jam Recordings refusing to renew The Inc.'s contract. From 2005 to 2006, Irv would search for other labels, until finally reaching a deal with Universal Records.''The Mirror'' (2007-present)The first single of his eighth album The Mirror, "Uh-Ohhh!", featuring Lil Wayne, came out in August 2007. Following singles were "Body" featuring Ashley Joi and "Sunset" featuring The Game. All these singles failed in sales.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, The Mirror was to be released on September 12, 2007, then delayed to November 13. That release date was delayed, and the JaRule.net website later listed a 2008 release timeframe for The Mirror.&lt;/ref&gt;Personal lifeCriminal chargesIn 1999, he along with the rest of Murder Inc. were brought up on charges for assaulting 50 Cent, which led to a restraining order against them for 50. Also in 2003, he punched a man in Toronto for shouting at him in a crowd because of the 50 Cent feud. He would end up suing Ja Rule, but they settled out of court. In 2004, police investigated whether a feud involving The Inc. led to fatal shooting outside a nightclub party hosted by Ja Rule. In July 2007, Ja Rule was arrested for gun and drug possession charges along with Lil Wayne.HomophobiaIn the September 2007 issue of Complex magazine, Ja Rule was mistakenly reported to have expressed that homosexuals are to be blamed for the problems and destruction in the United States, and was disgusted at MTV's promotion of LGBT television shows. He also spoke out about how hip hop is being blamed for more issues than homosexuality, and perpetuated the belief that gays are evil and corrupting music and television.His comments prompted a strong rebuke from GLAAD, who issued a public statement stating, "No fair-minded person can look at Ja Rule’s interview with Complex Magazine and believe for one second that his children could be more harmed by what they might see on television than by the vulgarity and prejudice that comes out of their father’s mouth. Now that media have seen Ja Rule’s intolerance unmasked by his own words, they have a responsibility not to provide in the future a platform for his ugly, vulgar displays of prejudice.”It was later revealed that GLAAD had been mistaken and that he was actually mis-quoted in an interview with online MySpace interview channel The Hook Up on October 24, 2007. He went on in a January 2008 issue of XXL Magazine to state his words were taken out of context. He is quote as stating:PhilanthrophyJa Rule founded the L.I.F.E Foundation, which opens its doors to underprivileged children through various programs such as art, music, poetry and sports.&lt;/ref&gt;DiscographyAlbums1999: Venni Vetti Vecci2000: Rule 3:362001: Pain Is Love2002: The Last Temptation2003: Blood in My Eye2004: R.U.L.E.2008: The MirrorCompilations2000: The Murderers2002: Irv Gotti Presents: The Inc.2005: ExodusAwards and nominationsYearAward/Nomination2001Source Hip-Hop Music Award Won for Single of the Year - "Put It on Me"MTV Video Music Awards nomination for Best Rap Video - "Put It on Me"2002I'm Real (Murder Remix)]]"MTV Video Music Awards nominated for Best Hip-Hop Video - "Always on Time"American Music Award nominated for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop ArtistGrammy Awards nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group - "Put It on Me"Grammy Awards nominated for Best Rap Album - Pain Is LoveGrammy Awards nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration - "Livin' It Up"World Music Awards Won for World's Best-Selling Rap ArtistBET Awards Won for Best Male Hip-Hop Artist ArtistGQ Men of the Year Award Won for Musician of the YearTeen Choice Awards Won for Male Artist of the YearNAACP Image Awards Won for Best Rap/Hip-Hop ArtistSoul Train Music Award nomination for Best Rap/Soul or Rap Album of the Year - Pain Is Love2003Source Award Won for R&B/Rap Collboration of the Year - "Thug Lovin'"American Music Award nomination for Favorite Hip-Hop/R&B Male ArtistGrammy Awards nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration - "Always on Time"2004Source Award Won for Fat Tape Song of the Year - "Clap Back"Acting careerDuring his break from rapping, Ja Rule co-starred in the movie The Fast and the Furious with Vin Diesel.
