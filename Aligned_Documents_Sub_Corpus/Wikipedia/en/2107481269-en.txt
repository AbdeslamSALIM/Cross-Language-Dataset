| deathplace=Rome| other=Sixtus|   Pope Saint Sixtus III was pope from July 31, 432 to August 18, 440.The name of Sixtus is often connected with a great building boom in Rome: Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill was dedicated during his pontificate and he built Santa Maria Maggiore, whose dedication to Mary the Mother of God reflected his acceptance of the Ecumenical council of Ephesus which closed in 431. At that council the debate over Christ's human and divine natures turned on whether Mary could legitimately be called the "Mother of God" or only "Mother of Christ". The council gave her the Greek title Theotokos (literally "God-bearer", or "Mother of God"), and the dedication of the large church in Rome is a response to that.Prior to being made pope Sixtus was a patron of Pelagius, who was later condemned as a heretic. Brown, Peter. "Pelagius and his Supporters." Journal of Theological Studies. 1968.XIX.1(93-114).One of his main concerns was in restoring peace between Cyril of Alexandria and the Syrians.He also maintained the rights of the pope over Illyria and the position of the archbishop of Thessalonica as head of the Illyrian church.References External linksOpera Omnia by Migne Patrologia Latina with analytical indexes        Category:Popes Category:Papal saints Category:5th century archbishops Category:Year of birth unknown Category:440 deathsaf:Pous Sixtus III bg:Сикст III ca:Sixt III ceb:Papa Sixto III cs:Sixtus III. da:Pave Sixtus 3. de:Sixtus III. et:Sixtus III el:Πάπας Σίξτος Γ΄ es:Sixto III eo:Siksto la 3-a fr:Sixte III gl:Sisto III, papa ko:교황 식스토 3세 hr:Siksto III. id:Paus Siktus III it:Papa Sisto III jv:Paus Sixtus III sw:Papa Sixtus III la:Sixtus III hu:III.
