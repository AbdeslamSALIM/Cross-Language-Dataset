The Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) or International Federation of Gymnastics (IFG) is the governing body of competitive gymnastics. Its headquarters is in Lausanne, Switzerland. It was founded on July 23, 1881 in Liège, Belgium, making it the oldest international sport organisation. Originally called the European Federation of Gymnastics, it had three member countries &mdash; Belgium, France and the Netherlands &mdash; until 1921, when non-European countries were admitted, and it was renamed to its current name.The federation draws up the rules, known as the Code of Points, which regulate how gymnast's performance is evaluated. Six gymnastics disciplines are governed by the FIG: Artistic gymnastics (further classified as Men's Artistic Gymnastics &mdash; MAG and Women's Artistic Gymnastics &mdash; WAG), Rhythmic gymnastics (RG), Aerobic gymnastics (AER), Acrobatic gymnastics (ACRO) and Trampolining (TRA).Additionally, the federation has been considered the authority responsible for determining whether gymnasts are old enough to participate in the Olympics. Despite there being controversies regarding the reported ages of Chinese gymnasts He Kexin and Yang Yilin in the 2008 Olympics, the International Olympic Committee has deferred to the FIG age verifications.OrganizationThe main governing bodies of the federation are the President and Vice-Presidents, the Congress, held every two years, the Executive Committee, the Council and seven Technical Committees &mdash; for each of the disciplines (WAG and MAG have distinct ones; for GG it's called General Gymnastics Committee).As of 2007 there are 128 federations affiliated to the FIG and 2 associated federations, as well as four Continental Unions:European Union of Gymnastics (UEG)Pan-American Gymnastic Union (PAGU)Asian Gymnastic Union (AGU)African Gymnastics Union (UAG)An Italian, Bruno Grandi, has been the elected president since 1996Major competitionsOlympic competitionWorld Gymnastics ChampionshipsGymnastics World CupReferencesExternal linksOfficial siteAffiliated federations Gimnasia Argentina Gymnastics Australia Brazilian Gymnastics Federation British Gymnastics Gymnastics Canada Chinese Gymnastics Association Fédération Française de Gymnastique Irish Gymnastics Association Federazione Ginnastica d'Italia Japan Gymnastic Association Mexican Gymnastics Federation GymSports New Zealand Romanian Gymnastics Federation USA GymnasticsCategory:1881 establishments Category:Gymnastics organizations Category:IOC Recognised International Federationsbg:Международна федерация по гимнастика de:Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique es:Federación Internacional de Gimnasia fr:Fédération internationale de gymnastique ga:Cónaidhm Idirnáisiúnta na Gleacaíochta hr:Međunarodna gimnastička federacija it:Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique nl:Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique ja:国際体操連盟 pl:Międzynarodowa Federacja Gimnastyczna pt:Federação Internacional de Ginástica ro:Federaţia Internaţională de Gimnastică ru:Международная федерация гимнастики zh:国际体操联合会
