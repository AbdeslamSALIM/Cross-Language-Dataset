The Māori name for the South Island, Te Wai Pounamu, meaning "The Water/s of Greenstone" (greenstone being jade), possibly evolved from Te Wāhi Pounamu which means "The Place Of Greenstone". The island is also known as Te Waka a Māui which means "Māui's Canoe".The South Island takes the definite article when used as a noun whereas maps, headings or tables and adjectival expressions use South Island. This pattern can be found in a number of other names, such as the United Kingdom, the Vatican and the Internet.Examples:My mother lives in the South IslandThe North Island is smaller in area than the South IslandI'm visiting the South IslandThe major South Island peaks are all in the Southern AlpsNote also that places are said to be in the South Island rather than on the South Island.The South Island is often called "the Mainland". Today this expression is used humorously, although still with pride by "Mainlanders", since while it is a somewhat larger landmass than the North Island, only about a quarter of New Zealand's four million inhabitants live in the South Island. However, in the early stages of European (Pākehā) settlement of the country, the South Island was pre-eminent, with the majority of the European population and wealth focussed there due to gold rushes. It was not until the early 20th century that the North Island population overtook the South, with 56% of the population living in the North in 1911. In Māori legend, the South Island existed first, as the boat of Maui, while the North Island was the fish that he caught. However, the South Island has never been the main site of Māori population.HistoryEarly inhabitants of the South Island were the Waitaha. They were largely absorbed via marriage and conquest by the Kāti Mamoe in the 1500s.Ngāti Mamoe were in turn largely absorbed via marriage and conquest by the Ngāi Tahu who migrated south in the seventeenth century. While today there is no distinct Ngati Mamoe organisation, many Ngai Tahu have Ngati Mamoe links in their whakapapa and, especially in the far south of the island.Around the same time a group of Māori migrated to Rekohu (the Chatham Islands), where, by adapting to the local climate and the availability of resources, they developed a culture known as Moriori — related to but distinct from Māori culture in mainland New Zealand. A notable feature of the Moriori culture, an emphasis on pacifism, proved disadvantageous when Māori warriors arrived in the 1830s aboard a chartered European ship. [http://www.teara.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/Moriori/4/en Moriori - The impact of new arrivals - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand] "]]The first Europeans known to reach the South Island were the crew of Dutch explorer Abel Tasman who arrived in his ships Heemskerck and Zeehaen. Tasman anchored in Golden Bay, at the northern end of the island, (he named it Murderers Bay) in December 1642 and sailed northward to Tonga following a clash with local Māori. Tasman sketched sections of the two main islands' west coasts. Tasman called them Staten Landt, after the States-General of the Netherlands, and that name appeared on his first maps of the country. Dutch cartographers changed the name to Nova Zeelandia in Latin, from Nieuw Zeeland, after the Dutch province of Zeeland. It was subsequently Anglicised as New Zealand by British naval captain James Cook of [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark Endeavour]] who visited the islands more than 100 years after Tasman during (1769&ndash;1770).In the early 18th century, Ngāi Tahu a Māori tribe who originated on the east coast of the North Island began migrating to the northern part of the South Island. There they and Kāti Mamoe fought Ngāi Tara and Rangitāne in the Wairau Valley. Ngāti Māmoe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ngāi Tahu. Ngāi Tahu continued to push south, conquering Kaikoura. By the 1730s, Ngāi Tahu had settled in Canterbury, including Banks Peninsula. From there they spread further south and into the West Coast.In 1827-1828 Ngāti Toa under the leadership of Te Rauparaha successfully attacked Ngāi Tahu at Kaikoura. Ngāti Toa then visited Kaiapoi, obstensibly to trade. When they attacked their hosts, the well-prepared Ngāi Tahu killed all the leading Ngāti Toa chiefs except Te Rauparaha. Te Rauparaha returned to his Kapiti Island stronghold. In November 1830 Te Rauparaha persuaded Captain John Stewart of the brig Elizabeth to carry him and his warriors in secret to Akaroa, where by subterfuge they captured the leading Ngāi Tahu chief, Te Maiharanui, and his wife and daughter. After destroying Te Maiharanui's village they took their captives to Kapiti and killed them. John Stewart, though arrested and sent to trial in Sydney as an accomplice to murder, nevertheless escaped conviction.In the summer of 1831-1832 Te Rauparaha attacked the Kaiapoi pā (fortified village). After a three-month siege, a fire in the pā allowed Ngāti Toa to overcome it. They then attacked Ngāi Tahu on Banks Peninsula and took the pā at Onawe. In 1832-33 Ngāi Tahu retaliated under the leadership of Tuhawaiki and others, attacking Ngāti Toa at Lake Grassmere. Ngāi Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ngāti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped. Fighting continued for a year or so, with Ngāi Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ngāti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ngāi Tahu territory.By 1839 Ngāi Tahu and Ngāti Toa established peace and Te Rauparaha released the Ngāi Tahu captives he held. Formal marriages between the leading families in the two tribes sealed the peace.On June 17, 1843, Māori natives and the British settlers clashed at Wairau in what became known as the Wairau Affray. Also known as the Wairau Massacre in most older texts, it was the first serious clash of arms between the two parties after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and the only one to take place in the South Island. Four Māori died and three were wounded in the incident, while among the Europeans the toll was 22 dead and five wounded. Twelve of the Europeans were shot dead or clubbed to death after surrendering to Māori who were pursuing them.In the 1870s and 1880s, several thousand Chinese men, mostly from the Guangdong province, migrated to New Zealand to work on the South Island goldfields. Although the first Chinese migrants had been invited by the Otago Provincial government they quickly became the target of hostility from white settlers and laws were enacted specifically to discourage them from coming to New Zealand.Manying Ip. 'Chinese', Te Ara&mdash;the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21-Dec-2006, http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/NewZealandPeoples/Chinese/en&lt;/ref&gt;In the 19th century, some maps named the South Island as Middle Island or New Munster, and the name South Island or New Leinster was used for today's Stewart Island/Rakiura.In 1907 the Minister for Lands gave instructions to the Land and Survey Department that the name Middle Island was not to be used in future. "South Island will be adhered to in all cases".PoliticsThe South Island is guaranteed 16 of the 69 electorates in the New Zealand House of Representatives. In addition, 10 list MPs are based in the South Island, including the current Deputy Prime Minister.Local Government RegionsThere are seven local government regions covering the South Island and all its adjacent islands and territorial waters. Four are governed by an elected regional council, while three are governed by territorial authorities (the second tier of local government) which also perform the functions of a regional council and thus are known as unitary authorities. There is one exception to this, Nelson City, is governed by an individual Territorial authority to its region (Tasman Region). The Chatham Islands Council is often counted by many as a unitary authority, but it is officially recognised as a part of the region of Canterbury.  CanterburyMarlboroughNelsonOtagoSouthlandTasmanWest CoastTerritorial AuthoritiesThere are 25 territorial authorities within the South Island: 4 city councils, 20 district councils and the Chatham Islands Council.

The Main North Line from Picton to Christchurch and the Main South Line from Lyttelton to Invercargill via Dunedin together comprise the South Island Main Trunk Railway. The secondary Midland Line branches from the Main South Line in Rolleston and passes through the Southern Alps via the Otira Tunnel to the West Coast and its terminus in Greymouth. In Stillwater, it meets the other secondary route, the Stillwater - Westport Line, which now includes the Ngakawau Branch. A number of other secondary routes are now closed, including the Otago Central Railway, the isolated Nelson Section, and the interdependent Waimea Plains Railway and Kingston Branch. An expansive network of branch lines once existed, especially in Canterbury, Otago, and Southland, but these are now almost completely closed. The branch lines that remain in operation serve ports (Bluff Branch and Port Chalmers Branch), coal mines (Ohai Branch and Rapahoe Branch), and a dairying factory (Hokitika Branch). The first 64 km of the Otago Central Railway remain in operation for tourist trains run by the Taieri Gorge Railway (TGR). The most significant freight is coal from West Coast mines to the port of Lyttelton for export.Passenger services were once extensive. Commuter trains operated multiple routes around Christchurch and Dunedin, plus a service between Invercargill and Bluff. Due to substantial losses, these were cancelled between the late 1960s and early 1980s. The final services to operate ran between Dunedin and Mosgiel, and they ceased in 1982.Tony Hurst, Farewell to Steam: Four Decades of Change on New Zealand Railways (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1995), 96. Regional passenger trains were once extensive, but are now limited to the TranzCoastal from Christchurch to Picton and the TranzAlpine from Christchurch to Greymouth. The Southerner between Christchurch and Invercargill, once the flagship of the network, was cancelled on 10 February 2002. Subsequently, the architecturally significant Dunedin Railway Station has been used solely by the TGR's tourist trains, the Taieri Gorge Limited along the Otago Central Railway and the Seasider to Palmerston. Rural passenger services on branch lines were provided by mixed trains and Vulcan/88 seater railcars but the mixeds had largely ceased to exist by the 1950s and the railcars were withdrawn in the mid-1970s.The South Island saw the final use of steam locomotives in New Zealand. Locomotives belonging to classes long withdrawn elsewhere continued to operate on West Coast branches until the very late 1960s, when they were displaced by DJ class diesels. In comparison to most countries, where steam locomotives were last used on insubstantial rural and industrial operations, the very last services run by steam locomotives were the premier expresses between Christchurch and Invercargill: the South Island Limited until 1970 and the Friday and Sunday night services until 1971. This was due to the carriages being steam-heated. The final steam-hauled service in New Zealand, headed by a member of the J&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; class, ran on 26 October 1971.David Leitch, Steam, Steel and Splendour (Auckland: HarperCollins, 1994), 89.Water Transport  ''Arahura'' in the Marlborough Sounds after crossing the Cook Strait.]]The South Island is separated from the North Island by Cook Strait, 24 km wide at its narrowest point, but requiring a 70 km ferry trip to cross.Ports and harboursContainer ports: Lyttelton (Christchurch), Port Chalmers (Dunedin)Other ports: Nelson, Picton, Westport, Greymouth, Timaru, Bluff.Harbours: Akaroa, Otago Harbour, Half Moon Bay (Stewart Island/Rakiura), Milford Sound.Freshwater: Queenstown and Kingston (Lake Wakatipu), Te Anau and Manapouri (Lake Manapouri)Air TransportSouth Island AirportsLOCATION &nbsp;&nbsp;ICAO]] &nbsp;&nbsp;IATA]] &nbsp;&nbsp;AIRPORT NAMEAlexandra]]NZLXALRAlexandra AerodromeAshburton]]NZASASGAshburton AerodromeBalclutha]]NZBABalclutha AerodromeBlenheim]]NZWBBHEBlenheim Airport (Woodbourne)]]Chatham IslandsNZCICHTChatham Islands / Tuuta AirportChristchurch]]NZCHCHCChristchurch International Airport (long-distance)Cromwell]]NZCSCromwell Racecourse AerodromeDunedinNZDNDUDDunedin International Airport (limited)Gore]]NZGCGore AerodromeGreymouthNZGMGMNGreymouth AirportHaast]]NZHTHaast AerodromeHokitikaNZHKHKKHokitika AirportInvercargillNZNVIVCInvercargill AirportKaikouraNZKIKBZKaikoura AerodromeLake PukakiNZGTGTNGlentanner AerodromeMilford SoundNZMFMFNMilford Sound AirportMount Cook]]NZMCMONMount Cook AerodromeMotuekaNZMKMZPMotueka AerodromeNelson]]NZNSNSNNelson Airport]]OamaruNZOUOAMOamaru AerodromePicton]]NZPNPCNPicton AerodromeQueenstown]]NZQNZQNQueenstown Airport (limited)RangioraNZFFForest Field AerodromeStewart Island/RakiuraNZRCSZSRyans Creek AerodromeTakakaNZTKKTFTakaka AerodromeTe Anau / ManapouriNZMOTEUManapouri AerodromeTimaruNZTUTIURichard Pearse AirportTwizelNZUKTWZPukaki AerodromeWanakaNZWFWKAWanaka AirportWestport]]NZWSWSZWestport Airport]]WigramNZWGWigram AerodromeGeography, 2006.]] The South Island with an area of 151,215&nbsp;km² (58,093 square miles) is the largest land mass of New Zealand, it contains about one quarter of the New Zealand population and is the world's 12th-largest island. It is divided along its length by the Southern Alps, the highest peak of which is Aoraki/Mount Cook at 3754 metres (12,316&nbsp;ft). There are eighteen peaks of more than 3000 metres (9800&nbsp;ft) in the South Island. The east side of the island is home to the Canterbury Plains while the West Coast is famous for its rough coastlines, very high proportion of native bush, and Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers.ClimateThe climate in the South Island is mostly temperate. The Mean temperature for the South Island is 8 °C (46 °F).From NIWA Science climate overview. January and February are the warmest months while July is the coldest.Most areas have between 600 and 1600&nbsp;mm of rainfall with the most rain along the West Coast and the least rain on the East Coast, predominantly on the Canterbury Plains. Christchurch is the driest city receiving about 640&nbsp;mm (25&nbsp;in) of rain per year.There are three main factors that influence New Zealand's climate:Statistics New Zealand http://www2.stats.govt.nz/domino/external/web/nzstories.nsf/0/38785455f46e0195cc256b1e007b6b0e?OpenDocument page.Its latitude zone location where the prevailing winds flow westerly.Its oceanic environment.The mountains, especially the Southern Alps.GeologyNational ParksAbel Tasman National ParkAoraki/Mount Cook National ParkFiordland National ParkKahurangi National ParkMount Aspiring National ParkNelson Lakes National ParkPaparoa National ParkRakiura National ParkWestland National ParkOther Native Reserves and ParksHakatere Conservation Park Hakatere Conservation Park, Department of Conservation website, retrieved 21 January 2008.Geographic Features Arthur's PassBanks PeninsulaCatlinsDoubtful SoundFarewell SpitHaast PassMackenzie BasinMarlborough SoundsMilford SoundSouthern Alps Glaciers:Fox GlacierFranz Josef GlacierRivers:Hokitika RiverEducationPrimarySecondaryTertiaryThe South Island has several tertiary level institutions:Aoraki PolytechnicChristchurch Polytechnic Institute of TechnologyLincoln UniversityNelson Marlborough Institute of TechnologyOtago PolytechnicSouthern Institute of TechnologyTai Poutini PolytechnicTelford Rural PolytechnicUniversity of CanterburyUniversity of OtagoHealthcareHealthcare in the South Island is provided by six District Health Boards (DHBs).
