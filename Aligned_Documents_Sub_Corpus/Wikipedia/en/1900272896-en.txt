He rides for the Bouygues Télécom, formerly known as Brioches la Boulangère and Bonjour. He comes from the Alsace region but later moved to Martinique), where he was nicknamed "petit blanc" due to his small stature and pale complexion. He is considered by many to be France's sweetheart (le chouchou) because of his young looks and his habit of sticking out his tongue in races. Of all the active cyclists, he was awarded the most yellow jerseys in the Tour de France (as of 2008).In 2003, Voeckler captured two stages and the overall title in the Tour de Luxembourg.In 2004 suddenly came to international prominence in the world of cycling. After seizing the French championship, the lightly regarded Voeckler entered the 2004 Tour de France. After escaping with five other riders during the fifth stage, Voeckler gained significant time against the peloton, and earned the maillot jaune. Remarkably, he defended his jersey for ten days, even on stages not well suited to his strengths. With the maillot jaune on his shoulders, and intense media attention all around him, Voeckler only rode stronger. He survived the dreaded Pyreneean climbs, seconds ahead of the eventual winner, Lance Armstrong. Voeckler finally surrendered the jersey to Armstrong on stage 15 in the French Alps. Voeckler then also lost the white jersey (le maillot blanc, held by the best rider under 25) to Vladimir Karpets. But by then Voeckler was already a national hero.The 2005 season was busy as Voeckler rode many races, including some not considered a fit for his style of riding. His only win 05 came in stage 3 of the Four Days of Dunkirk.In 2006 he won a fifth stage in Vuelta al País Vasco. At the Dauphiné Libéré, Voeckler finished second on Stage 1. He also won the 2006 Paris-Bourges. In 2007 garnered a stunning win at the Grand-Prix de Plouay Ouest-France, in which he beat the favorites with a late breakaway. For 2008, Voeckler's early season was highlighted with an overall win at the Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling).Major results20031st, Overall, Tour de Luxembourg (and two stage wins)1st, Classic Loire Atlantique1st, Stage 8, Tour de l'Avenir200418th Overall, Tour de FranceMaillot jaune (Stage 5-14)Maillot blanc (Stage 5-18) National Cycling Championships Road Race1st, A travers le Morbihan1st, Stage 4, Route du Sud20051st, Stage 3, Four Days of DunkirkTour de FrancePolka dot jersey (Stage 2)20061st, Paris-Bourges1st, Stage 5, Vuelta al País Vasco1st, Stage 1 & GC, Route du Sud1st, Paris-Bourges2nd, Stage 1, Dauphiné Libéré20071st, Mountains classification, Paris-Nice1st Overall, Tour du Poitou Charentes et de la Vienne1st, Grand-Prix de Plouay Ouest-France20082nd, Stage 1, Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)1st overall Circuit de la Sarthe (cycling)1st overall Grand Prix de Plumelec-MorbihanTour de France: Mountains classification leader (After Stages 1-5)External linksProfile on Bouygues Télécom official websiteCyclingnews interview during the 2004 Tour de France.
