The US edition of the LP, with a slightly different track list, came out the following month, under the title England's Newest Hit Makers.Recorded at Regent Sound Studios in London over the course of five days in January and February 1964, The Rolling Stones was produced by then-managers Andrew Loog Oldham and Eric Easton. The Rolling Stones was originally released by Decca Records in the UK, while the US England's Newest Hitmakers appeared on the London Records label, with the track "Not Fade Away" (the a-side of the band's third UK single) replacing "Mona (I Need You Baby)".The majority of the tracks reflect the band's love for authentic R&amp;B material. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (whose professional name until 1978 omitted the s in his surname) were very much fledging songwriters during early 1964, contributing only one original composition to the album: "Tell Me (You're Coming Back)". Two numbers are credited to "Nanker Phelge" - a pseudonym the band used for group compositions from 1963 to 1965. Phil Spector and Gene Pitney both contributed to the recording sessions, and are referred to as "Uncle Phil and Uncle Gene" in the subtitle of the Nanker Phelge instrumental "Now I've Got a Witness".The album cover photo was taken by David Bailey. The cover of the UK edition bears no title or identifying information other than the photo and the Decca logo - an "unheard of" design concept originated by manager Andrew Oldham.Upon its release, The Rolling Stones became one of 1964's biggest sellers in the UK, staying at #1 for 12 weeks, while England's Newest Hitmakers reached #11 in the US, going gold in the process.In August 2002, England's Newest Hitmakers was reissued as a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO, while its British counterpart has remained out of print since 1987.UK Track listing"Route 66" (Bobby Troup) – 2:20"I Just Want to Make Love to You" (Willie Dixon) – 2:17"Honest I Do" (Jimmy Reed) – 2:09"Mona (I Need You Baby)" (Ellas McDaniel) – 3:33Left off of the US edition of the album in favour of "Not Fade Away""Now I've Got a Witness (Like Uncle Phil and Uncle Gene)" (Nanker Phelge) – 2:29"Little by Little" (Nanker Phelge/Phil Spector) – 2:39"I'm a King Bee" (James Moore) – 2:35"Carol" (Chuck Berry) – 2:33"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)" (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards) – 4:05"Can I Get a Witness" (Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Eddie Holland) – 2:55"You Can Make It If You Try" (Ted Jarrett) – 2:01"Walking the Dog" (Rufus Thomas) – 3:10US Track listing"Not Fade Away" (Norman Petty/Charles Hardin) – 1:48Replaces "Mona (I Need You Baby)" from the UK edition"Route 66" (Bobby Troup) – 2:20"I Just Want to Make Love to You" (Willie Dixon) – 2:17"Honest I Do" (Jimmy Reed) – 2:09"Now I've Got a Witness (Like Uncle Phil and Uncle Gene)" (Nanker Phelge) – 2:29"Little by Little" (Nanker Phelge, Phil Spector) – 2:39"I'm a King Bee" (James Moore) – 2:35"Carol" (Chuck Berry) – 2:33"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)" (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards) – 4:05"Can I Get a Witness" (Brian Holland/Lamont Dozier/Eddie Holland) – 2:55"You Can Make It if You Try" (Ted Jarrett) – 2:01"Walking the Dog" (Rufus Thomas) – 3:10PersonnelMick Jagger - Lead vocals, harmonica, percussionKeith Richards - Guitar, vocalsBrian Jones - Guitar, harmonica, vocals, percussionCharlie Watts - Drums, percussionBill Wyman - Bass guitar, vocalsIan Stewart - Organ, pianoGene Pitney - Piano on "Little by Little"Phil Spector - Maracas on "Little by Little"ChartsAlbumYearChartPosition1964UK Top 20 Albums11964Billboard Pop Albums111965Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart1SinglesYearSingleChartPosition1964"Not Fade Away"UK Top 50 Singles31964"Not Fade Away"The Billboard Hot 100481964"Tell Me (You're Coming Back)"The Billboard Hot 10024ReferencesExternal linksRolling Stones No. 1   Category:1964 albums Category:ABKCO Records albums Category:Albums produced by Andrew Loog Oldham Category:Albums with alternate track listings Category:Debut albums Category:Decca Records albums Category:London Records albums Category:The Rolling Stones albums Category:Number-one albums in the United Kingdomcs:The Rolling Stones (album) da:The Rolling Stones (album) de:The Rolling Stones (Album) es:The Rolling Stones (álbum) fr:The Rolling Stones (album) it:The Rolling Stones (album) ka:The Rolling Stones (ალბომი) nl:The Rolling Stones (album) ja:ザ・ローリング・ストーンズ (アルバム) no:The Rolling Stones (album) pl:The Rolling Stones (album) fi:The Rolling Stones (albumi) sv:The Rolling Stones (England's Newest Hitmakers)
