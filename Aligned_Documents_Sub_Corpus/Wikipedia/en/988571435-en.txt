The Motacillidae are a family of small passerine birds with medium to long tails. There are around 65 species in 6 genera and they include the wagtails, longclaws and pipits. The longclaws are entirely restricted to the Afrotropics, and the wagtails are predominately found in Europe, Africa and Asia, with two species migrating and breeding in Alaska. The pipits have the most cosmopolitan distribution, being found across mostly in the Old World but occurring also in the Americas and oceanic islands such as New Zealand and the Falklands.DescriptionWagtails, pipits, and longclaws are slender, small to medium sized passerines, ranging from 14 to 17 centimetres in length, with short necks and long tails. They have long, pale legs with long toes and claws, particularly the hind toe which can be up to 4cm in length in some longclaws. There is no sexual dimorphism in size. Overall the robust longclaws are larger than the pipits and wagtails. Longclaws can weigh as much as 64 g, whereas the weight range for pipits and wagtails is 15-31 g. The plumage of most pipits is dull brown and reminiscent of the larks, although some species have brighter plumages, particularly the Golden Pipit of north-east Africa. The adult male longclaws have brightly coloured undersides. The wagtails often have striking plumage, including grey, black, white, and yellow.Most motacillids are ground-feeding insectivores of slightly open country. They occupy almost all available habitats, from the shore to high mountains. Wagtails prefer wetter habitats to the pipits. A few species use forests, including the Forest Wagtail, and other species use forested mountain streams, such as the Grey Wagtail or the Mountain Wagtail.Motacillids take a wide range of invertebrate prey, especially insects are the most commonly taken, but also including spiders, worms, and small aquatic molluscs and arthropods. All species seem to be fairly catholic in their diet, and the most commonly taken prey for any particular species or population usually reflects local availability.With the exception of the Forest Wagtail, they nest on the ground, laying up to six speckled eggs.Species and generaFAMILY: MOTACILLIDAEGenus ''Anthus'': typical pipits(c.40 species; see genus page)Genus ''Tmetothylacus''Golden Pipit, Tmetothylacus tenellusGenus ''Motacilla'': typical wagtailsWhite Wagtail Motacilla alba - possibly paraphyleticPied Wagtail Motacilla alba yarrelliiBlack-backed Wagtail Motacilla (alba) lugensJapanese Wagtail Motacilla grandisWhite-browed Wagtail Motacilla madaraspatensisMekong Wagtail Motacilla samveasnaeAfrican Pied Wagtail Motacilla aguimpCitrine Wagtail Motacilla citreola - possibly paraphyleticBlue-headed Wagtail Motacilla flava - paraphyleticGrey Wagtail Motacilla cinereaCape Wagtail Motacilla capensisMadagascar Wagtail Motacilla flaviventrisMountain Wagtail Motacilla claraGenus '' Dendronanthus''Forest Wagtail, '' Dendronanthus indicus''Genus '' Macronyx'': longclawsCape Longclaw, Macronyx capensisYellow-throated Longclaw, Macronyx croceusFuelleborn's Longclaw, ''Macronyx fuellebornii ''Sharpe's Longclaw, Macronyx sharpeiAbyssinian Longclaw, Macronyx flavicollisPangani Longclaw, Macronyx aurantiigulaRosy-breasted Longclaw, Macronyx ameliaeGrimwood's Longclaw, Macronyx grimwoodi.References==External links== Motacillidae videos on the Internet Bird Collection* Category:Bird familiesca:Motacillidae de:Stelzen und Pieper et:Västriklased es:Motacillidae eo:Motaciledoj fr:Motacillidae hr:Pliske it:Motacillidae lt:Kieliniai hu:Billegetőfélék nl:Kwikstaarten en piepers ja:セキレイ科 no:Erlefamilien pl:Pliszkowate pt:Motacillinae ru:Трясогузковые se:Beštorat fi:Västäräkit sv:Ärlor och piplärkor vi:Họ Chìa vôi tr:Kuyruksallayangiller uk:Плискові zh:鶺鴒科
