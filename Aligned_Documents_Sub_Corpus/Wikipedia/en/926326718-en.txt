The name is formed from the beginning of each country's name; it was possibly created for the Benelux Customs Union,Revue de l'Institut International de Statistique (1947) Vol. 15, No. 1/4. ( page 43 although according to The Economist it was coined somewhat earlier, in August 1946, by that newspaper's correspondent in Belgium.Going Dutch However, it is now used in a more generic way. The Benelux region has a total population of about 27,598,666 and occupies an area of approximately 74,640 km² (28,819 sq mi). Thus, the Benelux has a population density of 370/km² (958/sq mi).PoliticsA Benelux Parliament (originally referred to as Interparliamentary Consultative Council) was created in 1955. This parliamentary assembly is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourgish parliament.The treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union (Benelux Economische Unie/Union Économique Benelux) was signed February 3, 1958 and came into force in 1960 to promote the free movement of workers, capital, services, and goods in the region. Its secretariat-general is located in Brussels. The unification of the law of the three Benelux countries is mainly achieved by regulations of its Council of Ministers, that only bind the three states, but are not directly applicable in their internal legal orders. There is also a large number of Benelux conventions in a wide range of subject matters.LawIn 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed. It entered into force in 1975. The Court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three States, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This international judicial institution is located in Brussels.The Benelux is particularly active in the field of intellectual property. The three countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs Office, both situated in The Hague. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on September 1, 2006.Geography, Demographics and Languages   Dutch and French are the official languages of the Benelux and its institutions. Out of the total of 27.2 million people living in the member states 22.5 million (83 percent) speak Dutch and 3.9 million (14 percent) speak French, of whom 3.4 million are Walloons and 0.5 million are Luxembourgians (the latter also speaking German and Luxembourgish), whereas 3% is bilingual Dutch-French (inhabitants of Brussels Capital Region, appr. 1 million). Although it is not an official language of the Benelux and its institutions, Belgium and Luxembourg recognise German as one of the official national languages. In fact, there is a small German speaking community in Belgium seated in and around the town of Eupen. (See German-speaking Community of Belgium)SportsIn 2000, Belgium and the Netherlands jointly hosted the UEFA European Championship. In June 2007, representatives of the three countries announced they would bid, as a single political entity, for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.FutureThe treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union will expire in 2010. It will be replaced by a new legal framework, which has been signed on June 17th 2008. The main objectives of the treaty are the continuation and enlargement of the cooperation between the three member states within a larger European context. The name of the "Benelux economic union" will change to Benelux union to reflect this broader scope.ReferencesSee alsoLow countriesGreater NetherlandsExternal linksBenelux Economic Union - Official siteBenelux Parliament - Official siteBenelux Court of Justice - Official siteBenelux Office for Intellectual Property - Official siteCategory:Benelux countries Category:Seventeen Provinces Category:Burgundian Circle Category:International economic organizations Category:Euroregionaf:Benelux ar:بنلوكس frp:Benelux be:Бенілюкс bs:Beneluks bg:Бенелюкс ca:Benelux cs:Benelux cy:Benelux da:Benelux de:Benelux el:Μπενελούξ es:Benelux eo:Benelukso eu:Benelux fa:بنلوکس fr:Benelux fy:Benelúks gl:Benelux ko:베네룩스 hr:Benelux id:Benelux is:Benelúxlöndin it:Benelux he:בנלוקס lv:Benilukss lb:Benelux lt:Beniliuksas hu:Benelux államok mk:Бенелукс ms:Benelux nl:Benelux ja:ベネルクス no:Benelux nds:Benelux pl:Benelux pt:Benelux ro:Benelux ru:Бенилюкс sq:Beneluksi simple:Benelux sk:Benelux sl:Beneluks sr:Бенелукс sh:Benelux fi:Benelux sv:Benelux th:เบเนลักซ์ vi:Benelux tr:Benelüks uk:Бенілюкс ur:بینیلکس vec:Benelux zh:比荷盧三國關稅同盟
