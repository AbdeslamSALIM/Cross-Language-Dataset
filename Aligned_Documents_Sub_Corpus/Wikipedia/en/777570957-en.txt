Cultural artifacts date back to the Bronze Age, as well as those of later Scythian and Sarmatian settlers. There is also evidence that the Chernyakhov culture flourished in the area from the 2nd to the 6th century.Founded in the middle of 17th century, the city has had a university since 1805. During the early years of the Soviet Union, Kharkiv was the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (from 1917&ndash;1934).In the early 1930s, the Ukrainian famine (Holodomor) drove many people off the land into the cities, to Kharkiv in particular, in search of food. Some of them died and were secretly buried in one of the city's cemeteries. During April and May 1940 about 3,800 Polish prisoners of Starobelsk camp were murdered in the Kharkiv NKVD building, later buried in Pyatykhatky forest (part of the Katyn massacre).Fischer, Benjamin B., "The Katyn Controversy: Stalin's Killing Field", Studies in Intelligence, Winter 1999-2000, last accessed on 10 December, 2005During World War II, Kharkiv was the site of several military engagements. The city was captured by Nazi Germany and its military allies, recaptured by the Red Army, captured a second time by the Nazis and then finally liberated on August 23, 1943. Seventy percent of the city was destroyed and tens of thousands of the inhabitants were killed. It is mentioned that Kharkiv was the most populated city in the Soviet Union occupied by Nazis, since in the years preceding World War II, Kiev was the smaller of the two by population.Between December 1941 through January 1942, an estimated 30,000 people (mostly Jewish) were killed by the Nazis. They were laid to rest in one of the largest mass graves that is known as Drobitsky Yar.During World War II, four battles took place for control of the city:Battle for KharkovStruggle for KharkovKharkov offensive operationOperation Polkovodets RumyantsevBefore the occupation, Kharkiv's tank industries were evacuated to the Urals with all their equipment, and became the heart of Red Army's tank programs (particularly, producing the legendary T-34 tank earlier designed in Kharkiv). These enterprises were returned after the war, and still continue to produce some of the world's best tanks.Government and administrative divisionsWhile Kharkiv is the administrative center of the Kharkiv Oblast (province), the city affairs are managed by the Kharkiv City Municipality. Kharkiv is a city of oblast subordinance.The territory of Kharkiv is divided into 9 administrative raions (districts):Dzerzhynsky ()Zhovtnevy ()Kyivsky ()Kominternіvsky ()Leninsky ()Moskovsky ()Frunzensky ()Ordzhonikidzevsky ()Chervonozavodsky ()Demographics| |1788|10,742 (not children)Харьков: Архитектура, памятники, новостройки: Путеводитель.
