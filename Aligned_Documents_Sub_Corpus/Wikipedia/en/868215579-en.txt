Saint Vitus was a pioneering doom metal band from California.BiographySaint Vitus is known as one of the first doom metal bands, starting out as early as the late 1970s. The band first used the name Tyrant, with Scott Reagers (vocals), Dave Chandler (guitar), Mark Adams (bass), and Armando Acosta (drums), but soon changed their name to Saint Vitus after the song "St. Vitus' Dance" by Black Sabbath. Their main influences were Sabbath and Black Flag, the latter of which Saint Vitus toured with during the 1980's.Under this line-up Saint Vitus recorded 2 albums (Saint Vitus & Hallow's Victim) and an EP (The Walking Dead). After The Walking Dead Reagers left the band and was replaced by The Obsessed frontman Scott &quot;Wino&quot; Weinrich (at this time, The Obsessed had only released one 7"). Wino recorded three studio albums (Born Too Late, Mournful Cries & V), a live album (Live), and an EP (Thirsty and Miserable, featuring the Black Flag cover of the same name) with Vitus. He left the band in 1991 to reform The Obsessed after Vitus's label, Hellhound Records, released an album of older Obsessed recordings. Christian Lindersson (of Count Raven) left his band to fill in on vocals. He would record only one album, C.O.D. before being replaced by original Vitus vocalist, Scott Reagers. Reagers recorded vocals for the band's final album, Die Healing.Chandler has recently resurfaced in a new band, Debris, Inc., along with Trouble bassist Ron Holzner.On July 1, 2003, the classic Born Too Late line-up (Weinrich, Chandler, Adams, Acosta) played a gig at Double Door in Chicago.Rock Detector Saint Vitus page The performance was recorded and released on a DVD that is distributed through Chandler's current band, Debris, Inc.MembersScott Reagers (vocals) 1979-1986, 1995Scott Weinrich (vocals & guitar) 1986-1991Dave Chandler (guitar) 1979-1995Mark Adams (bass) 1979-1995Armando Acosta (drums) 1979-1995Christian Lindersson (vocals) 1992-1995DiscographyAlbumsSaint Vitus CD/LP (SST Records 1984)Hallow's Victim LP (SST Records 1985)Born Too Late LP (SST Records 1987)Mournful Cries CD/LP (SST Records 1988)V CD/LP (Hellhound Records 1989)Live CD/LP (Hellhound Records 1990)C.O.D.
