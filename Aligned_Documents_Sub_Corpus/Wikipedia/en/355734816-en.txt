Finally Galindo made his debut with the first team in the 2002 Spring season, and was a solid starter by the 2003 Clausura season. Galindo is an active member of the Mexican national team, and has played for numerous Mexican youth teams; a starter for the U-23 team at the 2004 summer Olympics.Two games into the 2005 FIFA Confederations cup, Galindo along with teammate (of both club and country) Salvador Carmona were separated from the rest of the national team staying in Göttingen, Germany. Initially disciplinary problems was the explanation given by the Mexican federation for the separation, the federation later confirmed both players tested positive for performance enhancement drugs. Both men received a one year ban from competition, which barred Galindo from playing in the 2005 Apertura, 2006 Clausura seasons, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The team doctor for Cruz Azul took most of the blame because, allegedly, he gave the drugs to both athletes without them knowing what they were taking.Hercules CFGalindo signed in the summer of 2006 with Hércules CF of the Spanish second division. Despite being considered a major signing by the club he played very few games and was on the bench for most of the season.Grasshopper-Club ZürichGalindo signed a contract with Swiss team Grasshopper-Club Zürich in February, 2007.
