He worked as a pyro-tech for Black Sabbath during their "Heaven and Hell" tour. DeMaio uses a very "guitar-esque" playing style, resulting to a very powerful and technical sound. He is known to display his technical abilities and playing speed during solos both on Manowar studio recordings and live shows, often covering classical parts such as "Flight of the Bumblebee", which DeMaio has retitled "Sting of the Bumblebee" in reference to his high-speed renditions of the piece. DeMaio is a practitioner of martial arts and weight training, and is also a great fan of motorcycles (Manowar frequently rides on to stage on Harleys).DeMaio is since 1998 a member of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta http://www.graddo.com/index.php?id=205.In 2003, shortly after creating the record label, Magic Circle Music, he became manager of the Italian power metal band Rhapsody of Fire.External linksOfficial Manowar Website Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American heavy metal musicians Category:American rock bass guitarists Category:American bass guitarists Category:Heavy metal bass guitarists Category:New York musicians Category:Italian-American musicians Category:Knights of Maltabg:Джоуи Демайо cs:Joey DeMaio de:Joey DeMaio es:Joey DeMaio fr:Joey DeMaio it:Joey DeMaio nl:Joey DeMaio no:Joey DeMaio pl:Joey DeMaio pt:Joey DeMaio ru:ДиМайо, Джоуи fi:Joey DeMaio sv:Joey DeMaio tr:Joey DeMaio
