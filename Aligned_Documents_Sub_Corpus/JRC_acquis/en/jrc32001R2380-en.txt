of 5 December 2001 
concerning the 10 year authorisation of an additive in feedingstuffs 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Directive 2001/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2(aaa) of Directive 70/524/EEC requires authorisations for coccidiostats to be linked to the person responsible for putting them into circulation. 
(2) Article 9 of Directive 70/524/EEC provides that a substance may be authorised if all conditions laid down in Article 3a of that Directive are met. 
(3) The assessment of the dossier submitted shows that the coccidiostat described in the Annex satisfies all the requirements of Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC, when used for the animal category and under the conditions described in the Annex to this Regulation: the substance should therefore be authorised under those conditions. 
(4) Article 9b of Directive 70/524/EEC provides that the authorisations of such substances shall be given for a period of 10 years from the date on which the final authorisation takes effect. 
(5) The assessment of the dossier shows that certain procedures may be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives. Such protection should however be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(3). 
(6) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety and with regard to the favourable effect on animal production of the coccidiostat under the conditions described in the said Annex. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Feedingstuffs, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
