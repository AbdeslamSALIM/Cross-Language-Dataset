( B ) TAKING OF SPECIMENS 
IN THE CASE OF WHOLE CARCASES , AT LEAST ONE SPECIMEN OF THE SIZE OF A HAZELNUT IS TO BE TAKEN FROM BOTH DIAPHRAGM PILLARS AT THE TRANSITION OF THE SINEWY PART . 
IF THERE IS ONLY ONE DIAPHRAGM PILLAR , ONE SPECIMEN THE SIZE OF TWO HAZELNUTS IS TO BE TAKEN . IN THE ABSENCE OF BOTH DIAPHRAGM PILLARS , TWO SPECIMENS APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A HAZELNUT ARE TO BE TAKEN FROM THE RIB PART OR THE BREASTBONE PART OF THE DIAPHRAGM OR , AS THE CASE MAY BE , FROM THE LINGUAL MUSCLE OR THE JAW MUSCLE OR FROM THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES . 
FOR PIECES OF MEAT , FROM EACH PIECE TAKE THREE SAMPLES OF SKELETAL MUSCLE , CONTAINING LITTLE FAT , IF POSSIBLE THE SIZE OF A HAZELNUT , AND TAKEN FROM DIFFERENT POINTS , WHERE POSSIBLE NEAR TO BONES OR TENDONS . 
( C ) METHOD 
IF BOTH DIAPHRAGM PILLARS ARE PRESENT THE TRICHINAE INSPECTOR MUST CUT , FROM EACH OF THE ABOVE SPECIMENS TAKEN FROM A WHOLE CARCASE , SEVEN PIECES THE SIZE OF AN OAT-KERNEL MAKING 14 IN ALL ; IF ONLY ONE DIAPHRAGM PILLAR IS PRESENT , 14 PIECES , FROM DIFFERENT PLACES AND IF POSSIBLE FROM THE TRANSITION TO THE SINEWY PART ; HE MUST THEN COMPRESS THEM BETWEEN THE GLASS PLATES IN SUCH A WAY THAT NORMAL PRINT CAN BE CLEARLY READ THROUGH THE SLIDE PREPARATION .

IF , IN THE CASE OF WHOLE CARCASES , SPECIMENS HAVE TO BE TAKEN FROM THE RIB PART OR THE BREASTBONE PART OF THE DIAPHRAGM , THE LINGUAL MUSCLE OR JAW MUSCLE OR THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES , THEN 14 PIECES THE SIZE OF AN OAT-KERNAL ARE TO BE CUT FROM EACH SPECIMEN , I.E . A TOTAL OF 28 . 
FROM EACH OF THE SAMPLES TAKEN FROM PIECES OF MEAT , THE TRICHINAE INSPECTOR MUST CUT FOUR PIECES THE SIZE OF AN OAT-KERNAL , MAKING 12 PIECES IN ALL . 
THE TRICHINOSCOPIC EXAMINATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EACH PREPARATION IS SCANNED SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY . IF THE TRICHINOSCOPIC EXAMINATION REVEALS SUSPECT AREAS , THE NATURE OF WHICH CANNOT BE DEFINITELY ASCERTAINED EVEN WITH THE MOST POWERFUL MAGNIFICATION OF THE TRICHINOSCOPE , THESE MUST BE CHECKED BY MICROSCOPE . 
THE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EACH PREPARATION IS SCANNED SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AT A MAGNIFICATION OF 30 TO 40 BY . 
IN THE CASE OF AN UNCERTAIN RESULT , THE EXAMINATION MUST BE CONTINUED ON A FURTHER NUMBER OF SPECIMENS AND SLIDE PREPARATIONS , IF NECESSARY WITH THE AID OF HIGHER MAGNIFICATIONS , UNTIL THE INFORMATION REQUIRED IS OBTAINED . THE TRICHINOSCOPIC EXAMINATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT FOR AT LEAST THREE MINUTES . 
THE TRICHINOSCOPIC EXAMINATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT FOR AT LEAST SIX MINUTES IN THE CASE OF SUBSTITUTE SPECIMENS TAKEN FROM THE RIB PART OR BREASTBONE PART OF THE DIAPHRAGM PILLARS , THE LINGUAL MUSCLE OR THE JAW MUSCLE OR THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES .
