THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products(1), and in particular Articles 5 and 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 2002/308/EC(2), establishes the lists of approved zones and approved fish farms situated in non-approved zones with regard to certain fish diseases. 
(2) France and Germany have submitted the justifications for obtaining the status of approved zones, with regard to VHS and IHN, for certain zones in their territory. The documentation provided shows that those zones meet the requirements of Article 5 of Directive 91/67/EEC. They therefore qualify for the status of approved zones and should be added to the list of approved zones. 
(3) Austria and Italy have submitted the justifications for obtaining the status of approved farms in non-approved zones, with regard to VHS and IHN, for certain farms in their territory. The documentation provided shows that those farms meet the requirements of Article 6 of Directive 91/67/EEC. They therefore qualify for the status of approved farm in a non-approved zone and should be added to the list of approved farms. 
(4) Italy has notified positive finding of VHS in pike (Esox lucius) in a part of a continental zone previously considered free of the disease, and in a farm previously considered free of VHS. The approved status for the continental zone and the farm as regards VHS should therefore be repealed. 
(5) Decision 2002/308/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
