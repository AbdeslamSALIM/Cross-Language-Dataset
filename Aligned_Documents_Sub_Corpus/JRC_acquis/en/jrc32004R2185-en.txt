THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products [1], and in particular, Article 7(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Decision 2004/859/EC of 25 October 2004 concerning the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Norway, of the other part, on Protocol 2 to the bilateral Free Trade Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway [2], and in particular article 3 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Protocol 2 to the bilateral free trade agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway [3], of the one hand, and Protocol 3 to the EEA Agreement [4], determine the trade arrangements for certain agricultural and processed agricultural products between the Contracting Parties. 
(2) Protocol 3 to the EEA Agreement, as amended by Decision 138/2004 of the EEA Joint Committee amending Protocol 3 to the EEA Agreement, concerning products referred to in Article 8(3)(b) of the Agreement [5] provides for a zero duty applying to goods classified under CN codes 22021000 (waters, including mineral waters and aerated waters, containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured) and ex 22029010 (other non-alcoholic beverages containing sugar (sucrose or invert sugar)). 
(3) The zero duty has been temporarily suspended for Norway by the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Norway, of the other part, on Protocol 2 to the bilateral free trade Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway, approved by Council Decision 2004/859/EC. Pursuant to point IV of that Agreement, duty free imports of goods of the CN codes 22021000 (waters, including mineral waters and aerated waters, containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured) and ex 22029010 (other non-alcoholic beverages containing sugar (sucrose or invert sugar)) originating in Norway are permitted only within the limits of a duty free quota. 
(4) It is therefore necessary to open this quota for the year 2005. 
(5) In order to facilitate the set up of the quota and to ensure an appropriate management of it, in the interest of operators, the benefit of the exoneration of the duties within the quota should be temporarily conditional to the presentation to the Community customs authorities of a certificate issued by the Norwegian authorities.
