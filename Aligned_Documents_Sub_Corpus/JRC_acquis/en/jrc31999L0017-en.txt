(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(1), as last amended by Directive 98/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 76/761/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to motor vehicle headlamps which function as main-beam and/or dipped-beam headlamps and to incandescent electric filament lamps for such headlamps(3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
(1) Whereas Directive 76/761/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas, consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 76/761/EEC; 
(2) Whereas, in particular, Article 3(4) and Article 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC require each separate Directive to have attached to it an information document and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI to Directive 70/156/EEC in order that type-approval may be computerised; whereas the type-approval certificate(s) provided for in Directive 76/761/EEC should be amended accordingly; 
(3) Whereas the procedures should be simplified in order to maintain the equivalence envisaged by Article 9(2) of Directive 70//156/EEC between certain separate Directives and the corresponding regulations of the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) when those regulations are amended; whereas, as a first step, the technical requirements of Directive 76/761/EEC should be replaced by those of UN-ECE Regulations Nos 1, 5, 8, 20, 31, 37, 98 and 99 by way of cross-reference; 
(4) Whereas it is necessary to ensure that the requirements in Council Directive 76/756/EEC(4), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/28/EC(5), are complied with; 
(5) Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for adaptation to technical progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC,

(1) In the case of headlamps designed to meet the requirements of traffic moving on one side of the road only (either right or left) it is further recommended that the area which can be occulted to prevent discomfort to users in a country where traffic moves on the side of the road opposite to that of the country for which the headlamp was designed should be outlined indelibly on the front lens and explained in the maintenance book of the vehicles. This marking is not necessary, however where the area is clearly apparent from the design. 
(2) If the lens cannot be separated from the main body of the headlamp, the provision of a marking area on the lens will suffice.
