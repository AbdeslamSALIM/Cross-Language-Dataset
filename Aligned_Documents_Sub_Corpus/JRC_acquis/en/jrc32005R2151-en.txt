v Republic of Macedonia as provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Decision 2005/914/CE of 21 November 2005 on the conclusion of a Protocol amending the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part on a tariff quota for the imports of sugar and sugar products originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Community [1], and in particular Article 3 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The second subparagraph of Article 27(2) of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part [2] (hereinafter referred to as "SAA"), lays down that the Community is to apply duty-free access on imports into the Community for products originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of headings 1701 and 1702 of the Combined Nomenclature within the limit of an annual tariff quota of 7000 tonnes (net weight). 
(2) The SAA enters into force on 1 January 2006, therefore the quota should be opened and detailed rules of application should be in force as from 1 January 2006. 
(3) In order to ensure the respect of the quantity of 7000 tonnes of the annual tariff quota, any positive tolerance on the quantities imported should be avoided whilst the rights deriving from import licences should not be transferable. It is therefore necessary to derogate from some provisions laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down detailed rules fro the application of the system of import and export licenses and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [3]. 
(4) To ensure efficient management of the imports within the annual tariff quota, measures need to be adopted making it possible for the Member States to keep records of the relevant data, and to report those data to the Commission. 
(5) To improve controls, imports of the products falling under the annual tariff quota should be monitored in accordance with Article 308d of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code [4]. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
