Pleas in law and main arguments 
According to the applicant the Court of First Instance made an error of law in that it failed to assess the trade mark in question in its entirety and in concreto, whereas the trade mark in question is composed of a particularly distinctive character and its name, the figurative and verbal elements of that complex trade mark cannot be separated in this instance. 
The Court of Instance also disregarded the provisions of Article 8(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94 of 10 December 1993 on the Community trade mark [1] by failing to take account, when assessing the likelihood of confusion, of all the relevant elements in question, as regards both the trade mark sought by the applicant and the word mark of the intervener. 
Finally, by examining only some of the rights invoked by the intervener in its opposition, the Court of First Instance disregarded the rules applicable to trade mark oppositions.
