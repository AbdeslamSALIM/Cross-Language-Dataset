Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 
of 28 July 2003 
laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2), and in particular Article 9(2) and Article 13(11) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 9(2) and Article 13 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(5) has been substantially amended several times(6). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified. 
(2) In view of the practices specific to trade in cereals and rice, provision should be made for rules further to or derogating from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(8). 
(3) In the case of invitations to tender for the export of intervention stocks, licences should specify the quantities and destinations for which they are issued and provision should be made for the special particulars to be shown on export licences, in particular in the case of invitations to tender for export refunds, of exports of cereal-based compound feedingstuffs and of advance fixing of export taxes. 
(4) The terms of validity of import and export licences for the various products should be fixed in accordance with market requirements and the need for sound management. In view of competition on the world market, a specially lengthy term of validity should be granted for malt exports, expiring, however, on 30 September in the case of licences issued prior to 1 July so that export commitments are not entered into for the new marketing year before the beginning of the barley harvest. 
(5) In view of the risk of licences being issued for excessively high quantities, provision should be made for a period for reflection of three days to elapse before export licences are actually issued for any cereals and most processed cereal products, other than exports, non-commercial exports made with a view to providing Community or national food aid, and certain supplies by humanitarian agencies. 
(6) The Commission's decision not to grant an application for an export certificate at the end of the three-day reflection period may in some cases, however, disrupt the continuity of supplies of products in respect of which regular supplies are necessary. Operators so requesting should be given the opportunity to obtain an export licence without refund, on the condition that special conditions of use are attached to such licences. 
(7) Certain provisions of Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 concerning applications for export licences for certain products in connection with invitations to tender organised in importing third countries should be made more restrictive and thus more in keeping with commercial practice in the cereals trade. 
(8) In view of the competition on the world market for cereals and rice, provision should be made for export licences to be granted for the main products, including durum wheat, with a special term of validity and for relatively large minimum quantities, with more advantageous minimum quantities for exports to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States. The licences should be granted subject to certain additional conditions concerning, in particular, presentation of the delivery contract to the competent agency within a specified time. 
(9) The securities to be lodged for import and export licences should be fixed at different levels for the various product groups according to the possible variations in the refund or export tax during the term of validity of the licences, preferential treatment being granted in respect of deliveries to ACP States. 
(10) The applicable export refunds should be specified in cases where the terms of validity of licences are extended as a result of force majeure pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000. 
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,

Such statements must indicate the projected quantity and quality of the products, the delivery period and the price terms.

2. In the cases set out in paragraph 1, the interested party shall lodge with the competent authority an application for an export licence accompanied by an application for advance fixing of the export refund or export tax applicable on the day of submission of the application for the intended destination, together with details of the minimum and maximum quantities that he intends to export and of the minimum and maximum time necessary to complete export as planned.

4. Where the term of validity fixed for the licence is the same as that applied for, the applicant shall, within the time limit set in accordance with paragraph 3, submit to the competent authority a signed original of the contract, together with a copy thereof. The contract shall specify at least the quantity covered, which must fall within the minimum and maximum quantities indicated in the licence application, the destination, the period within which export is to be carried out (which must fall within the minimum and maximum periods indicated), the price fixed for the duration of the contract and the terms of payment. The licence shall then be issued after the security provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 has been lodged. The country (or countries within a single group) of destination shall be shown in section 7 and the licence shall carry with it an obligation to export to that country or countries. However, up to 10 % of the quantities shown on the licence may be delivered under the contract to another country indicated in Annex III as falling within the same group. 
Where the applicant is unable to conclude such a contract, he shall so inform the competent authority within the time limit set for submission of the contract and the licence shall not be issued. 
5. Except in cases of force majeure, where the applicant does not comply with paragraph 4, no licence shall be issued. 
6. Where the term of validity fixed is different from that applied for but is longer than that laid down in Article 7, paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article shall apply. However, the applicant may, within the time limit set for submission of the contract, withdraw his application for a licence. 
7. Where an application for an extension of the term of validity as provided for in Article 7 is rejected, no licence shall be issued. 
8. Licences issued under the conditions laid down in this Article shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 8(1).

Where the term of validity of licences is extended pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000, the corrective amount applicable shall be that in force on the day the licence application was submitted for export during the last month of the normal term of validity of the licence. 
In addition, the export refund shall be adjusted in accordance with Article 14 of this Regulation. 
Article 14 
1. Refunds applicable pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on products listed in Article 1(1)(a) and (b) of that Regulation with the exception of maize and grain sorghum shall be adjusted, during the months of August to May of the same marketing year, by an amount equal to the monthly increase applicable to the intervention price fixed for that marketing year. 
In the case of maize and grain sorghum, the refunds shall be adjusted, during the months of November of one marketing year to August of the following marketing year, by an amount equal to the monthly increase applicable to the intervention prices fixed for the marketing year concerned. 
The first adjustment shall be made on the first day of the calendar month following that of application. Subsequent adjustments shall apply each month. 
In the case of the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 with the exception of maize and grain sorghum, refunds adjusted in accordance with the first subparagraph and applicable in May shall continue to apply in June. In the case of maize and grain sorghum, refunds adjusted in accordance with the second subparagraph and applicable in August shall continue to apply in September. 
2. The adjustment provided for in paragraph 1 shall not apply where the amount of the refund is equal to zero. 
3. Where the term of validity of licences extends beyond the end of the marketing year and export occurs in the following marketing year, refunds on products listed in Article 1(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, exclusive of any monthly increases referred to in paragraph 1, with the exception of maize and grain sorghum shall be reduced by the price break between the two marketing years. That price break shall occur on 1 July and shall be defined as: 
(a) the difference between the intervention prices, exclusive of any monthly increase, for the previous and the new marketing years; plus 
(b) an amount equal to the monthly increase, multiplied by the number of months elapsing between August and the month of the licence application, inclusive. 
Where the price break is greater than the refund in question, the corrected refund shall be reduced to zero. 
Refunds reduced by the price break shall be increased as from August in the new marketing year, in accordance with the rules set out in paragraph 1, by the monthly increase applying to the new marketing year. 
4. In the case of maize and grain sorghum, the rules on adjustment set out in paragraph 3 shall apply mutatis mutandis, with the following exceptions: 
(a) the end of the marketing year shall be deemed to be 30 September; 
(b) the abovementioned price break shall occur on 1 October instead of 1 July; 
(c) the month of August shall be replaced by November; 
(d) the monthly increases shall be those applicable to the marketing years in question.

1. In the case of products listed in Article 1(1)(c) and (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, the amount resulting from each of the adjustments mentioned in Article 14(1) and (3) of this Regulation shall be multiplied by the processing coefficient applying to the product in question. 
2. The amount of the refund applying in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) and (b) of that Regulation shall be adjusted in the months from October to July inclusive by an amount equal to the monthly increase applying to the intervention price for paddy rice fixed for that marketing year, based on the processing stage and the applicable processing coefficient. 
The first adjustment shall be made on the first day of the calendar month following that in which the licence application is made. Subsequent adjustments shall apply each month. 
3. The adjustment provided for in paragraph 2 shall not apply where the amount of the refund is equal to zero. 
4. Where the term of validity of the licence extends beyond the end of the marketing year and export occurs in the following marketing year, refunds, excluding the monthly increases referred to in paragraph 2, shall be reduced by the break in the intervention price for paddy rice between the two marketing years, based on the processing stage and the applicable processing coefficient. 
This price break shall occur on 1 September and shall be defined as: 
(a) the difference between the intervention price for paddy rice, exclusive of any monthly increase for the previous and the new marketing years; 
(b) an amount equal to the monthly increase multiplied by the number of months elapsing between October and the month of the licence application, inclusive. 
These two factors shall be converted using the relevant processing coefficient applicable at the time the product is exported. 
Where the price break is greater than the refund in question, the corrected refund shall be reduced to zero. 
Refunds shall be reduced by (a) and (b) of the second subparagraph, on the basis of the milling stage and shall be increased from October of the new marketing year by the monthly increase applying to the new marketing year, in accordance with the rules set out in paragraph 2.
