Concerning amendment of the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2008 
Amended Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences 
(presented by the Commission) 
COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION 
Concerning amendment of the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 1 July 2005 to 31 December 2008 
As a consequence of the tsunami of 26 December 2004, several Asian countries are facing problems which are particularly serious. The international community has acknowledged this by agreeing on a number of programs and actions providing special assistance to these countries. The European Community is called upon to join these efforts. One measure that would seem appropriate in this context is to speed up the entry into force of the Council regulation applying a new scheme of generalised tariff preferences. This new regime provides for better market access for all developing countries including the tsunami-hit countries. They benefit from the new regulation through the reinsertion of tariff preferences for several of their products as well as inclusion of new products in the GSP. Sri Lanka will also benefit by inclusion in the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. The entry into force of the regulation should therefore be advanced to 1 April 2005. The procedure for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance has been changed accordingly by provisionally incorporating the countries that already qualify for the arrangement. These beneficiary countries, like any other developing countries, shall submit a request for a definitive selection as beneficiary by 31 May 2005. The Commission will assess all the requests. A final list of countries qualifying on 1 July 2005 will be published. Finally, due to the advanced entry into force of the new GSP it appears necessary to provide for a transition period from the current GSP system under Council Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 to the new GSP scheme. Exceptionally, the preferences under the Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 should therefore continue to apply until 30 June 2005 to the extent that they provide for a more favourable treatment of products than the new GSP regime. Some technical details in the regulation have also been fine-tuned. 
For the above reasons, the Commission has decided to amend its proposal for a Council Regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences. 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
1. Context 
Council Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 of 10 December 2001[1] applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences will expire on 31 December 2005. In July 2004, the Commission adopted guidelines on the role of the GSP for the next ten-year period 2006 to 2015[2]. This memorandum explains the context and provisions of the draft proposal for the implementing regulation. 
In 1994, the previous guidelines[3] for the ten-year period 1994-2005 and their implementing regulations introduced a number of important changes such as tariff modulation according to product sensitivity, graduation and special incentive schemes. In 2001, a special arrangement for the Least Developed Countries was introduced, for an unlimited period of time. Experience has shown that some of these features work well in practise and should be continued while, on the other hand, it would seem necessary to adjust some of the measures in light of experience gained. 
The Community has granted trade preferences to developing countries in the framework of its GSP since 1971. Trade policy plays a key role in the EU’s relations with the rest of the world. The GSP scheme is part of that policy and must be consistent with and consolidate the objectives of development policy. To this end, this scheme must also be compatible with the Doha Development Agenda. A key priority is to help developing countries to benefit from globalisation, in particular by linking trade and sustainable development. 
2. Consultation of interested parties 
A wide number of interest groups have expressed their view and made their own observations and recommendations on the future of the GSP. The Council has presented its conclusions to the Communication on the ten-year guidelines and the European Parliament and European Economic and Social Committee have similarly expressed their opinions on the guidelines. A civil society dialogue was conducted in July 2004. Trade unions and various professional associations have expressed their views. Beneficiary countries of the GSP have been active in bringing forward their views. Owing to the specialised statistics required, impact assessments have been conducted internally. 
3. Budgetary implications 
The regulation does not incur costs charged to the EC budget. Its application does, however, entail loss of customs revenue. The annual loss of customs revenue resulting from the draft regulation is estimated to be EUR 2,2 billion. The proposed regulation entails some changes with respect to the current one. These relate to the graduation mechanism, a new special arrangement for sustainable development (merging three previous arrangements) and changes to the product coverage. It is not expected that these changes would mean a significant change in loss of revenue compared to the present situation. 
4. Explanation of the provisions 
Simplification has been achieved through a reduction in the number of arrangements, from five to three and in particular by the introduction of a single incentive arrangement in place of the three special schemes for the protection of labour rights, of the environment and to combat drug production and trafficking. Thus the proposed scheme consists of a general arrangement, a special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance and a special arrangement for the least developed countries (“EBA – Everything But Arms”). 
Further simplification will be achieved in time by removing from the list of beneficiaries those countries that enjoy preferential access to the Community market under the terms of an agreement, usually a free-trade agreement (FTA). The Community would ensure that no country would lose as a result of this transformation because benefits for any particular product which previously received GSP treatment would be consolidated into the FTA in question. 
As under the current scheme, preferences shall continue being differentiated according to the sensitivity of products. The regulation maintains the current flat rate reduction of 3,5 percentage points for sensitive products and 100% for non-sensitive products. However, it enlarges the scope of the scheme by introducing new products in the general arrangement and by introducing a generous special incentive scheme. The EBA arrangement maintains its global coverage of everything but arms while the two other arrangements incorporate new - mainly agricultural and fishery - products. 
The current GSP Regulation provides for two special incentive arrangements for the protection of labour rights and the environment. These arrangements should be incorporated into a broader scheme in order to reflect the integral nature of the concept of sustainable development. 
It is universally recognised that sustainable development involves a variety of aspects, such as respect of fundamental human and labour rights, good governance and environmental protection. Interrelationship among these elements has been expressed, in particular, in multiple international conventions and instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993, the UN Agenda for Development of 1997, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of 1998, the UN Millenium Declaration of 2000 and the Johannesburg Declaration of Sustainable Development of 2002. In addition, the fight against drugs is a shared responsibility to all countries. 
One element in promoting sustainable development is to improve the economic situation in developing countries, in particular in those which are less integrated into the international trading system and which lack diversification of their economies. Consequently, developing countries which are most vulnerable and which through the ratification and effective implementation of the basic conventions on human and labour rights and the protection of the environment and good governance assume special burdens and responsibilities should benefit from additional tariff preferences under the GSP scheme. Conversely, high income countries and countries with a relatively high degree of diversification and trade integration are in a different position as they are deemed to have the resources allowing them to pursue sustainable development policies without additional assistance. The special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance therefore targets those developing countries most in need. 
The additional preferences shall be granted to developing countries that have ratified and effectively implemented the 16 core conventions on human and labour rights and 7 of the conventions related to good governance and the protection of the environment. At the same time beneficiary countries are committing themselves to ratifying and effectively implementing the international conventions which they have not yet ratified. 
The 16 conventions on human and labour rights have been selected as they incorporate universal standards and reflect rules of customary international law and they form the core basis of the concept of sustainable development. The remaining conventions reflect basic global standards aiming at the effective implementation of policies geared to sustainable development. 
The relevant conventions are also those with mechanisms that the relevant international organisations can use to regularly evaluate how effectively they have been implemented. The Commission will take into account these evaluations before deciding which of the applicant countries will be selected to benefit from the incentive scheme. Based on the applications from developing countries the Commission will produce a list of the beneficiaries under the arrangement. 
In addition to targeting GSP on countries through the graduation mechanism as described below, measures have been adopted to dampen the shock when the United Nations removes a country from the list of LDCs, in the form of a transition period for gradual withdrawal of a country from the special GSP, the Everything-But-Arms arrangement. At present, the country in question automatically loses all the GSP advantages it enjoyed as an LDC. The new mechanism allows for a gradual removal of a country from the EBA arrangement. 
Graduation shall be applied to groups of products from countries that are competitive on the Community market and no longer need the GSP to boost their exports. Graduation is not a penalty, it is a sign that the GSP has successfully performed its function, at least in relation to the countries and products in question. In this way, graduation is very closely linked to the economic competitiveness of the beneficiary countries. The GSP thus focuses on the countries most in need and helps them play a greater role in international trade. For the other beneficiary countries, graduation brings about greater share of the benefits of GSP. 
Essential changes have been made to the graduation mechanism to make it simpler. The current criteria (share of preferential imports, development index and export-specialisation index) have been replaced with a single straightforward criterion: share of the Community market, expressed as a share of preferential imports. Groups of products are defined by reference to the “sections” in the Combined Nomenclature. As only those countries that are competitive for all the products in a section are graduated, small beneficiary countries have not been graduated solely on the basis of a few competitive products in a section. 
Graduation should also play an important role in regulating trade flows for textile products and clothing, following the abolition of MFA quotas on 31 December 2004. 
The new GSP with a graduation mechanism targeted on the most competitive countries will mean that most beneficiaries will be granted preferences without any restrictions other than compliance with the relevant GSP rules. The GSP temporary withdrawal provisions and the safeguard clause will take account of this new situation. Even though they will still be for use in exceptional circumstances only, those provisions will be made more credible and the way they are used more flexible, in particular in case of unfair trading practices. 
As soon as the regulation applies, the Commission will assess its impact on the outermost regions of the EU. 
5. Exceptional transition period 
Due to the tsunami disaster, which occurred on 26 December 2004, the new GSP system should enter into force as quickly as possible. However, in the interest of a smooth transition from the current GSP scheme to the new GSP scheme it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period until 30 June 2005 until when preferences under the Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 shall continue to apply if they provide for a more favourable treatment to products than the new GSP scheme. 
2004/0242 (CNS) 
Amended Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[4], 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament[5], 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee[6], 
Whereas: 
(1) Since 1971, the Community has granted trade preferences to developing countries, in the framework of its scheme of generalised tariff preferences. 
(2) The Community's common commercial policy must be consistent with and consolidate the objectives of development policy, in particular the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development and good governance in the developing countries. It must comply with the WTO requirements, and in particular with the GATT Enabling clause of 1979[7]. 
(3) A communication[8] from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 7 July 2004 sets out the guidelines for the application of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 2006 to 2015. 
(4) This Regulation is the first regulation implementing those guidelines. It should apply from 1 April 2005 until 31 December 2008. 
(5) The scheme should consist of a general arrangement granted to all the beneficiary countries and territories and two special arrangements taking into account the various development needs of similar-situated developing countries. 
(6) The general arrangement should be granted to all beneficiary countries unless they are classified by the World Bank as a high-income country and if they are not sufficiently diversified in their exports. 
(7) The special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance is based on an integral concept of sustainable development as recognized by international conventions and instruments such as the UN Declaration on the Right to Development of 1986, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of 1992, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of 1998, the UN Millennium Declaration of 2000 and the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development of 2002. Consequently, developing countries which due to a lack of diversification and insufficient integration into the international trading system are vulnerable while assuming special burdens and responsibilities due to the ratification and effective implementation of core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance should benefit from additional tariff preferences. These preferences are designed to promote further economic growth and thereby to respond positively to the need for sustainable development. Under this arrangement ad valorem tariffs are therefore suspended for the beneficiary countries, as well as specific duties (unless combined with an ad valorem duty). 
(8) Developing countries which already fulfil the criteria under the special arrangement for sustainable development and good governance at the time of entry into force of this Regulation should benefit from this arrangement as quickly as possible. They should therefore be provisionally listed as beneficiary countries. They should continue to benefit from the preferences if upon their application the Commission confirms their qualification by 30 June 2005. 
(9) The Commission should monitor the effective implementation of the international conventions in accordance with the respective mechanisms thereunder and should assess the relationship between additional tariff preferences and the promotion of sustainable development. 
(10) The special arrangement for the least developed countries should continue to grant duty-free access to products originating in the least developed countries, as recognized and classified by the United Nations. For a country no longer classified by the United Nations as a least developed country a transitional period should be established to alleviate any adverse effects caused by removal of the tariff preferences granted under this arrangement. 
(11) Preferences should continue to be differentiated according to the sensitivity of products, differentiating between non-sensitive and sensitive products, to take into account the situation of the sectors manufacturing the same products in the Community. 
(12) Tariff duties on non-sensitive products should continue to be suspended, while duties on sensitive products should enjoy a tariff reduction to ensure a satisfactory utilisation rate while at the same time taking into account the situation of the respective Community industries. 
(13) Such reduction should be sufficiently attractive in order to motivate traders to use the opportunities offered by the scheme. As far as ad valorem duties are concerned, the reduction should therefore be a flat rate of 3,5 percentage points of the most favoured nation (MFN) duty rate. Specific duties should be reduced by 30 %. Where duties specify a minimum duty, that minimum duty should not apply. 
(14) Where preferential duty rates, calculated in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2501/2001 of 10 December 2001 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004[9], provide for a more favourable treatment of products, they should continue to apply until 30 June 2005 so as to provide for a smooth transition to the new GSP regime. 
(15) Duties should be totally suspended where preferential treatment for an individual import declaration results in ad valorem duties of 1 % or less or in specific duties of EUR 2 or less as the cost of collecting such duties might be higher than the revenue gained. 
(16) For the sake of coherence of the Community commercial policy, a beneficiary country should not benefit from both the Community’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences and a free trade agreement, if that agreement covers at least all the preferences provided by the present scheme for that country. 
(17) Graduation should be based on criteria related to sections of the Common Customs Tariff. The graduation of a section for a beneficiary country should be applied when the section meets the criteria for graduation during three consecutive years, to increase predictability and fairness of graduation by eliminating the effect of large and exceptional variations in the import statistics. 
(18) The rules of origin, concerning the definition of the concept of originating products, the procedures and the methods of administrative cooperation related thereto, laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code[10], apply to tariff preferences provided for by this regulation to ensure that the benefit of this scheme goes only to those whom the scheme is intended to benefit. 
(19) The reasons for temporary withdrawal should include serious and systematic violations of the principles laid down in the conventions listed in Annex III so as to promote the objectives of those conventions and to ensure that no beneficiary receives unfair advantage through continuous violation of those conventions. 
(20) Due to the political situation in Myanmar, temporary withdrawal of all tariff preferences in respect of imports of products originating in Myanmar should remain in force. 
(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[11],

TEMPORARY WITHDRAWAL AND SAFEGUARD PROVISIONS 
ARTICLE 1 5 
1. The preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation may be temporarily withdrawn, in respect of all or of certain products, originating in a beneficiary country, for any of the following reasons: 
(a) serious and systematic violations of principles laid down in the conventions listed in Annex III; 
(b) export of goods made by prison labour; 
(c) serious shortcomings in customs controls on export or transit of drugs (illicit substances or precursors), or failure to comply with international conventions on money laundering;

3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the special incentive arrangement referred to in Section 2 of Chapter II may be temporarily withdrawn, in respect of all or certain products included in this arrangement, originating in a beneficiary country, in particular if the national legislation no longer incorporates the ratified conventions referred to in Annex III or if that legislation is not effectively implemented. 
4. The preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation shall not be withdrawn pursuant to point (e) of paragraph 1 in respect of products which are subject to anti-dumping or countervailing measures under Regulations (EC) No 384/96 or (EC) No 2026/97, for the reasons justifying those measures. 
Article 1 6 
1. Where the Commission or a Member State receives information that may justify temporary withdrawal of preferential arrangements and where the Commission considers that there are sufficient grounds for an investigation, the Commission shall inform the Committee. 
2. The Commission may decide, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 28, to initiate an investigation. 
Article 1 7 
1. Where the Commission decides to initiate an investigation, it shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union announcing the investigation, and notify the beneficiary country concerned thereof.

It shall specify the period within which interested parties may make their views known in writing. 
2. The Commission shall provide the beneficiary country concerned with every opportunity to cooperate in the investigation. 
3. The Commission shall seek all information it considers necessary and may verify the information received with economic operators and the beneficiary country concerned. The available assessments, comments, decisions, recommendations and conclusions of the various supervisory bodies of the UN, the ILO and other competent international organizations, shall serve as the point of departure for the investigation as to whether temporary withdrawal is justified for the reason referred to in point (a) of Article 15(1). 
4. The Commission may be assisted by officials of the Member State on whose territory verification might be sought, if that Member State so requests. 
5. Where information requested by the Commission is not provided within a reasonable period or the investigation is significantly impeded, findings may be made on the basis of the facts available. 
6. The investigation should be completed within a year. The Commission may extend this period, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 28. 
Article 1 8 
1. The Commission shall submit a report on its findings to the Committee.

In that case, the Commission shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the Official Journal of the European Union , announcing the termination of the investigation and setting out its main conclusions. 
3. Where the Commission considers that the findings justify temporary withdrawal for the reason referred to in point (a) of Article 15(1), it shall decide, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 28, to monitor and evaluate the situation in the beneficiary country concerned for a period of six months. The Commission shall notify this decision to the beneficiary country concerned and shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union , announcing that it intends to submit a proposal to the Council for temporary withdrawal, unless, before the end of the period, the beneficiary country concerned made a commitment to take the measures necessary to conform, in a reasonable period of time, with the conventions referred to in Annex III. 
4. Where the Commission considers temporary withdrawal to be necessary, it shall submit an appropriate proposal to the Council, which shall decide within 30 days by a qualified majority. 
5. Where at the end of the period referred to in paragraph 3, the Commission finds that the beneficiary country concerned has not made the required commitment, and where it considers temporary withdrawal necessary, it shall submit an appropriate proposal to the Council, which shall decide within 30 days by a qualified majority. Where the Council decides on temporary withdrawal, such decision shall enter into force six months after it was taken, unless it is decided before then that the reasons justifying it no longer prevail. 
Article 1 9 
1. After informing the Committee, the Commission may suspend the preferential arrangements provided for in this Regulation in respect of all or of certain products, originating in a beneficiary country: 
(a) where it considers that there is sufficient evidence that temporary withdrawal is justified for the reasons referred to in point (d) of Article 15(1), or 
(b) where imports under these arrangements massively exceed the usual levels of production and export capacity of that country. 
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission all relevant information that may justify suspension of preferences. 
3. Where the Commission considers that there is sufficient evidence that the conditions for suspension are met, it shall take all appropriate measures as quickly as possible. 
4. The period of suspension shall be limited to three months and may be renewed once. The Commission may extend this period, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 28. 
Article 20 
1. Where a product originating in a beneficiary country is imported on terms which cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties to a Community producer of like or directly competing products, normal Common Customs Tariff duties on that product may be reintroduced at any time at the request of a Member State or on the Commission's initiative. 
2. Where the Commission decides to initiate an investigation, it shall publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union announcing the investigation. The notice shall state that any useful information should be sent to the Commission. It shall specify the period within which interested parties may make their views known in writing. 
3. In examining whether there are serious difficulties, the Commission shall take account, inter alia, of the following factors concerning Community producers where the information is available: 
(a) market share, 
(b) production, 
(c) stocks, 
(d) production capacity, 
(e) bankruptcies, 
(f) profitability, 
(g) capacity utilisation, 
(h) employment, 
(i) imports, 
(j) prices. 
4. The Commission shall take a decision within 30 working days after consulting the Committee. 
5. Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make an investigation impossible, the Commission may, after informing the Committee, take any preventive measure which is strictly necessary. 
Article 21 
Where imports of products included in Annex I to the EC Treaty cause, or threaten to cause, serious disturbance to Community markets or their regulatory mechanisms, the Commission may suspend the preferential arrangements in respect of the products concerned after informing the management committee for the relevant common market organisation. 
Article 22 
1. The Commission shall inform the beneficiary country concerned of any decision taken in accordance with Articles 1 9, 20 or 21 before it becomes effective. The Commission shall also notify the Council and the Member States thereof. 
2. Any Member State may refer a decision taken in accordance with Articles 19, 20 or 21 to the Council within ten days. The Council, acting by qualified majority, may adopt a different decision within 30 days. 
Article 2 3

OBSERVATIONS: The regulation does not incur costs charged to the EC budget. Its application does, however, entail loss of customs revenue. The annual loss of customs revenue for the draft regulation is estimated to be EUR 2,2 billion (based on GSP statistics for the year 2003). The proposed regulation entails some changes with respect to the current one. These relate to changes in the graduation mechanism and establishing a new special arrangement for sustainable developed (merging three previous arrangements). The draft regulation also proposes extending the product coverage by including in the general arrangement some products covered by the previous drug regime and in the new incentive arrangement products of the previous drug regime as well as some products previously covered only by the general arrangement. It is not expected that these changes would mean a significant change in loss of revenue compared to the present situation. |
