COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2580/88 
of 17 August 1988 
laying down the rules for amending the list of rice varieties set out in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 3878/87 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3878/87 of 18 December 1987 on the production aid for certain varieties of rice (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1424/88 (2), and in particular Article 2 (3) thereof, 
Whereas Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3878/87 lays down the morphological characteristics required for a variety to be eligible for production aid; whereas paragraph 2 of the same Article provides that from the 1988/89 marketing year no variety will qualify for aid unless it also possesses certain qualitative characteristics relating to glutinosity, consistency and amylose content; 
Whereas those qualitative characteristics should correspond to those observed in the varieties imported from areas which have traditionally grown Indica rice; 
Whereas the methods of analysis to be used in determining those morphological and qualitative characteristics should be defined; 
Whereas the procedure for amending the list of varieties set out in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 3878/87 should include yearly checks involving sampling to permit the necessary varietal analysis to take place; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

ANNEX I 
METHODS OF ANALYSIS 
A. MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
The following method shall be used to measure the rice grains and to check for the absence of pearl or striation: 
1. a number of entire grains will be drawn from the sample; 
2. an average shall be established by taking two measurements of 100 grains each; 
3. the result shall be expressed rounded up or down to one decimal place. 
B. QUALITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS 
(a) Standardized procedure for the use of the Instron Food Tester to determine the glutinosity of cooked rice 
1. Purpose 
This method may be used for assessing the glutinosity of cooked rice with the Instron Food Tester. 
2. Scope 
Cooked wholly milled rice. 
3. Definitions 
The following definitions apply for the purposes of this method. 
3.1. Glutinosity: tendency of cooked rice grains to adhere to each other. 
3.2. Wholly milled rice: as defined in paragraph 1 (d) of Annex A to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76. 
4. Principle 
Measurement of the effort required to overcome the resistance to the separation of two plane surfaces of smooth steel between which some grains of cooked rice have been compressed with a given force for a given duration. 
5. Apparatus 
5.1. Instron Food Tester, operating, for compression and traction, at a constant speed of 0,5 cm/min, provided with a loading cell having a measuring range of 0 to 5 kg. 
5.2. Piston, adaptable to the loading cell of the Instron Food Tester (5.1), provided with a square smooth steel base. 
5.3. Smooth-surfaced steel plate placed axially in relation to the piston (5.2.) and firmly on the base of the Instron Food Tester. 
5.4. 25-ml beakers. 
5.5. Electric water bath provided with a non-airtight lid and a perforated plate on which the beakers (5.4) are placed. The level of water in the vessel must be such that, during boiling, it does not rise above the perforated plate. 
5.6. Balance, accurate to 0,1 grams 
5.7. Glass rod. 
5.8. Watch glasses, 6 cm in diameter. 
5.9. Timer. 
5.10. Spatula. 
5.11. Plastic bags or other recipients capable of containing 2 grams of cooked rice and preventing dehydration thereof. 
6. Procedure 
6.1. Heating of bath 
Adjust the temperature of the bath (5.5) so as to keep the water bubbling vigorously. 
6.2. Preparation for cooking 
For each determination: prepare two beakers (5.4) by introducing into each a sample of 8 grams of wholly milled rice (entire grains only), weighed to within 0,1 grams, with 12 ml of distilled water. Stir gently with the glass rod (5.7), cover the beakers with watch glasses (5.8). 6.3. Cooking 
Take the lid off the cooking vessel, place the beakers on the perforated plate and quickly replace the lid. Switch on the timer (5.9). After 20 minutes turn off the heat and leave everything undisturbed for 10 minutes. Remove the beakers from the cooking vessel and invert them onto the watch glasses. Allow to cool for at least one hour. 
6.4. Adjustment of the Instron Food Tester 
Adjust the Instron Food Tester (5.1) according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that the response of the loading cell corresponds to values between 0 and 640 grams and the speed to 0,5 cm/min. 
6.5. Measurement with the Instron Food Tester 
Remove the cooked rice from each beaker and, using the spatula (5.10), discard the extreme upper and lower layers. Prepare eight samples weighing 2 grams each, four from each beaker, weighed to within 0,1 grams, keeping them in the plastic bags (5.11) until they are to be measured. Place one sample, axially in relation to the piston (5.2) on the steel plate (5.3), piling the rice as closely as possible without pressure. Cause the piston to descend at a constant speed of 0,5 cm/min, until the compression force on the rice registers 640 grams. Stop the movement of the piston for 10 seconds then draw it back at the same speed. 
Calculate the area beneath the curve defined (on the ordinate) by the tractive force in grams and (on the abscissa) by the distance covered by the piston in cm during the phase in which a positive tractive force value was exerted. The area represents the effort expressed in grams × cm. 
7. Repeatability 
The difference between the results of two determinations (two series of eight measurements) must not exceed 15 % of the mean value. 
(b) Standardized procedure for the use of the Instron Food Tester to determine the consistency of cooked rice 
1. Purpose 
This method may be used for assessing the consistency of cooked rice with the Instron Food Tester. 
2. Scope 
Cooked wholly milled rice. 
3. Definitions
