(2) The information that the interbranch organisations must supply to the Member State for the purposes of recognition must be specified. 
(3) Member States should be required to carry out checks on the activities of interbranch organisations and inform the Commission, at regular intervals, whether or not those organisations meet the conditions for recognition. 
(4) Certain aspects of the procedure whereby a Member State grants, refuses or withdraws recognition of interbranch organisations need to be defined. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,
