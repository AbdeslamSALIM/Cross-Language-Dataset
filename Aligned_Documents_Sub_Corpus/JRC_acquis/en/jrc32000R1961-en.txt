of 15 September 2000 
amending Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Articles 26(3), 30 and 31(14) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1596/1999(4), provides for various measures to control quantities in relation to licences issued, and in particular the power to suspend the issue of licences. Experience shows that the possibility of suspending the lodging of applications should be extended to save traders, the national authorities and the Commission unnecessary work. 
(2) Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 provides for the grant of refunds for various zones of destination in the case of cheese exports. As a result of changes in the rate of refund for some of those destinations, the definition of the zones concerned should be adjusted. 
(3) Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 lays down provisions on cheese exports to the United States of America under certain tariff quotas. Notwithstanding the fact that, since 1 July 2000, the refund rates for certain cheeses exported to the United States of America have been zero, presentation of an export licence and the lodging of a security are also indispensable for such exports to enable the regime to function properly. The provisions concerned should be adjusted accordingly. 
(4) Provision should be made for the allocation of licences on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 20(3) to be decided in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999. 
(5) Given that applications for the export licences referred to in Article 20 are to be lodged in mid-September 2000, this Regulation should enter into force immediately. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
