Decision No 3/2005 of the EC-EFTA Joint Committee on common transit 
of 17 June 2005 
amending the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure 
(2005/560/EC) 
THE JOINT COMMITTEE, 
Having regard to the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure [1] (hereinafter referred to as the Convention), and in particular Article 15(3)(a) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Annex D2 to Appendix III of the Convention contains the list of the package codes based on Annex V of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Recommendation No 21/rev 1 of August 1994 (hereinafter referred to as the Recommendation). 
(2) Annex V of the Recommendation concerning the list of the package codes has been revised several times since its introduction in order to better meet the requirements of the development of practices in trade and transport. 
(3) The latest revision (revision 4) of the Recommendation was published in May 2002. 
(4) In order to allow economic operators to use the most updated information and, therefore, to harmonise as far as possible the commercial and administrative practices in the countries applying the Convention, it is important to ensure that the package codes which are used to represent the packages in a transit declaration should correspond to the latest version of Annex V of the Recommendation. 
(5) Annex D2 to Appendix III of the Convention also contains the reference to the ISO alpha-2 country codes as specified in ISO-3166 of 1 January 1996, which has been updated on several occasions, and it should therefore be ensured that the list of country codes used in a transit declaration corresponds to the latest version of the ISO-3166 available. 
(6) The provisions concerned should therefore be amended accordingly, 
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
Annexes D1 and D2 to Appendix III of the Convention of 20 May 1987 on a common transit procedure are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision. 
Article 2 
1. This Decision shall enter into force on the date of its adoption. 
2. It shall be applicable from 1 July 2005.
