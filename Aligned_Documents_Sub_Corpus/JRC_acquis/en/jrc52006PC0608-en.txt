B. SPECIAL RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION 
1. The Community reference laboratory for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) shall be the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), New Haw, Weybridge, Surrey KT 15 3NB, United Kingdom. Switzerland shall pay the costs it incurs for operations carried out by the laboratory in that capacity. The functions and tasks of the laboratory shall be as laid down in Chapter B of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. 
2. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland has established an emergency plan for implementing measures to combat TSEs. 
3. Under Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, any animal suspected of being infected by a TSE in the Member States of the Community shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of a clinical and epidemiological examination carried out by the competent authority are known, or sacrificed for laboratory examination under official control. 
In accordance with Articles 179b and 180a of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland has banned the slaughter of animals suspected of being infected by a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Suspect animals must be killed without spilling blood and incinerated, and their brains must be analysed in the Swiss reference laboratory for TSEs. 
Under Article 10 of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland has introduced a permanent identification system for bovine animals enabling them to be traced back to the dam and herd of origin and making it possible to establish that they are not the progeny of BSE suspect females or BSE confirmed bovine animals. 
Under Article 179c of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland slaughters animals infected with BSE and the progeny of bovine animals infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy born in the two years preceding diagnosis. Since 1 July 1999, Switzerland has also implemented slaughter by cohort (it practised slaughter by herd from 14 December 1996 until 30 June 1999). 
4. Pursuant to Article 180b of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland slaughters animals infected with scrapie, their dams and the direct descendants of contaminated dams, as well as all the other sheep and goats in the herd, with the exception of: 
- sheep carrying at least one ARR allele and no VRQ allele; and 
- animals of less than two months old which are intended solely for slaughter. The head and organs of the abdominal cavity of these animals are disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the Ordonnance on the elimination of animal by-products (OESPA). 
By way of exception, in the case of breeds which are low in number, the herd does not have to be slaughtered. In this case, the herd is placed under official veterinary surveillance for a period of two years during which a clinical examination of the animals in the herd is carried out twice a year. If during this period animals are presented for slaughter, their heads, including tonsils, are subjected to an analysis by the reference laboratory for TSEs. 
These measures are reviewed according to the findings from animal health monitoring. In particular, the monitoring period is extended if a new case of the disease is detected in the herd. 
In the event of a confirmed case of BSE in a sheep or goat, Switzerland undertakes to apply the measures laid down in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. 
5. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, the Member States of the Community prohibit the feeding of processed animal proteins to farmed animals which are kept, fattened or bred for the production of food. There is a total prohibition on feeding proteins derived from animals to ruminants in the Member States of the Community. 
Under Article 18 of the Ordonnance on the elimination of animal by-products (OESPA), Switzerland has introduced a total prohibition on the feeding of animal protein to farmed animals, which entered into force on 1 January 2001. 
6. Under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 and in accordance with Chapter A of Annex III to that Regulation, the Member States of the Community are to introduce an annual BSE monitoring programme. This plan includes a rapid BSE test for all cattle more than 24 months old subject to emergency slaughter, animals which have died on the farm or found to be ill during the ante mortem inspection and all animals more than 30 months old slaughtered for human consumption. 
The rapid BSE tests used by Switzerland are listed in Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. 
Under Article 179 of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland is to carry out a compulsory rapid BSE test for all bovine animals more than 30 months old subject to emergency slaughter, animals which have died on the farm or been found to be ill during the ante mortem inspection and all animals more than 30 months old slaughtered for human consumption. In addition, operators are to implement a voluntary programme for monitoring bovine animals more than 20 months old slaughtered for human consumption. 
7. Under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 and in accordance with Chapter A of Annex III to that Regulation, the Member States of the Community are to introduce an annual BSE monitoring programme. 
In application of the provisions of Article 177 of the Ordonnance on epizootic diseases, Switzerland has introduced a TSE monitoring programme for ovine and caprine animals more than 12 months old. Animals which are subject to emergency slaughter, have died on the farm or have been found to be ill during the ante mortem inspection and all animals slaughtered for human consumption were examined over the period from June 2004 to July 2005. As all the samples tested negative for BSE, samples for monitoring purposes are taken from clinical suspect animals, animals subject to emergency slaughter and animals which died on the farm. 
The recognition of similarities in legislation governing the monitoring of TSEs in ovine and caprine animals will be reconsidered in the Joint Veterinary Committee. 
8. The Joint Veterinary Committee is responsible for providing the information required in Article 6 and Chapter B of Annex III and in Annex IV (3.III) to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. 
9. On-the-spot inspections are carried out under the responsibility of the Joint Veterinary Committee in accordance in particular with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 and Article 57 of the Law on epizootic diseases. 
C. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
