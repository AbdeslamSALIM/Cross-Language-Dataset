Commission Regulation (EC) No 1080/2005 
of 8 July 2005 
opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Spanish market of common wheat held by the Hungarian intervention agency 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies [2] provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance. 
(2) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of Spain, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2005/06 marketing year. This situation has already led to high prices locally, causing supply difficulties at competitive prices for growers and the livestock feed industry alike. 
(3) Hungary has significant intervention stocks of common wheat, which should be used up. 
(4) The stocks of common wheat held by the Hungarian intervention agency should therefore be made available on the Spanish cereals market; given the need to supply growers in the east of Spain, those stocks are particularly suited to the traders’ needs. 
(5) To ensure the best supply conditions for these regions, the common wheat must be delivered to the ports of Tarragona, Cartagena or Valencia. 
(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price. 
(7) It is also important that the Hungarian intervention agency’s notification to the Commission should maintain the anonymity of the tenderers. 
(8) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail. 
(9) In order to prevent disturbances on the Spanish market, in particular during marketing of the new year’s maize harvest, these cereals should be delivered before 30 September 2005. 
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
1. The Hungarian intervention agency shall open a standing invitation to tender for the sale on the Community market of 200000 tonnes of common wheat held by it. 
2. These sales are intended to supply the Spanish market. Entry into Spain shall be exclusively through the Spanish ports of Tarragona, Cartagena or Valencia. 
Article 2 
The sale provided for in Article 1 shall take place in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93. 
However, notwithstanding that Regulation: 
(a) tenders shall be drawn up on the basis of the actual quality of the lot to which they apply; 
(b) the minimum selling price shall be set at a level which does not disturb the cereals market. 
Article 3 
1. Notwithstanding Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 the tender security is set at EUR 10 per tonne. 
2. Tenders shall be valid only if they are accompanied by the tenderer’s written commitment to lodge a security of EUR 80 per tonne within two working days of the day on which the notice of award of contract is received. 
Article 4 
1. The first partial invitation to tender shall expire at 15.00 (Brussels time) on 13 July 2005. 
The closing dates for the submission of tenders for subsequent partial invitations to tender shall be each Wednesday at 15.00 (Brussels time), with the exception of 20 July, 3 August, 17 August and 31 August 2005, i.e. weeks when no invitation to tender shall be made.

Where tenders are offering the minimum selling price, the Commission may fix an award coefficient for the quantities offered at the same time as it fixes the minimum selling price. 
Article 7

The T5 control copy must provide proof of compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 1(2) of this Regulation.
