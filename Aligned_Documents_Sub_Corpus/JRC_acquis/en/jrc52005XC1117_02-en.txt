Comments: Firstly, the aid scheme applies to all sectors covered by Regulation (EC) No 68/2001. Secondly, it does not apply to aid for training or retraining workers employed by firms in difficulty within the meaning of the Community guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (OJ C 288, 9.10.1999), as part of rescue or restructuring operations assisted through public funds (rescue and/or restructuring aid). Such aid will be assessed in the light of those guidelines. Thirdly, the aid scheme does not apply if the amount of aid granted to one enterprise for a single training project exceeds EUR 1 million, in which case the individual aid grant must be notified to the Commission for its approval
