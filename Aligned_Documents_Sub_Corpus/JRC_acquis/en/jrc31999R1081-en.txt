COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1081/1999 
of 26 May 1999 
opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for imports of bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 and amending Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/98(2), and in particular Article 12(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2435/98(4), and in particular Article 8 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations(5), and in particular Article 1(1) thereof, 
(1) Whereas, in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Community has undertaken to open two annual tariff quotas each for 5000 head for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of the mottled Simmental breed and of the Schwyz and Fribourg breeds and for cows and heifers other than for slaughter of the grey, brown, yellow and mottled Simental breeds and of the Pinzgau breed at rates of customs duty of 6 % and 4 % respectively; whereas those quotas should be opened on a multiannual basis for twelve-month periods commencing on 1 July, hereinafter referred to as %quot%the year of import%quot%, and detailed rules should be laid down for their application; 
(2) Whereas there should be a guarantee in particular of equal and continuing access to the said quotas for all interested operators within the Community and of uninterrupted application of the customs duties laid down for those quotas to all imports of the animals in question until the quotas are exhausted; 
(3) Whereas experience has shown that limiting imports may lead to speculative import licence applications; whereas, in order to ensure that the planned measures function properly, the greater part of the quantities available should be allocated to %quot%traditional%quot% importers of bulls, cows and heifers of specified Alpine and mountain breeds; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body are liable to restrict the access of importers to that part of the quota; whereas provision should be made to remedy any resulting prejudice; 
(4) Whereas, in order to avoid forcing trade relations in this sector into an excessively rigid mould, a second tranche should be made available to importers who are able to show that they are engaged in genuine trade of some scale with third countries; whereas, in this connection and with a view to efficient management, the operators concerned must be required to have imported at least 15 head in the 12 months preceding the year of import in question; whereas a batch of 15 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and experience shows that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered genuine and viable; 
(5) Whereas, with a view to verifying compliance with these criteria, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the importer is registered for VAT purposes; 
(6) Whereas, in order to prevent speculation, %quot%traditional%quot% operators no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 June prior to the year of import in question should be denied access to the quota; 
(7) Whereas provision should be made for import rights to be allocated after a period of consideration and subject, where applicable, to the application of a uniform percentage reduction; 
(8) Whereas provision should be made for the arrangements to be administered by means of import licences; whereas, to that end, provision should be made in particular for detailed rules on the way applications are to be submitted and on the particulars to be shown in applications and on licences, if necessary by way of derogation from, or by supplementing, certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98(7), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2365/98(9); 
(9) Whereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 82/97(11), provides for customs supervision of goods released for free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on account of their end-use; whereas the animals imported should be monitored for a certain period to ensure they are not slaughtered during that time; whereas, in order to ensure that slaughter does not take place during that period, a security should be required to cover the difference between the common customs tariff (CCT) duty and the reduced duty applicable on the date of release for free circulation of the animals in question; 
(10) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 of 14 May 1998 opening and providing for the administration of tariff quotas for the import of bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine and mountain breeds(12), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1143/98(13), must be repealed; 
(11) Whereas, with a view to ensuring that the animals imported are not slaughtered for a certain period, Article 7(2) and (3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 of 2 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for a tariff quota for cows and heifers of specified mountain breeds originating in various third countries, other than for slaughter, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1012/98 provides for the animals imported to be identified in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 of 21 April 1997 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products(14) and for certain additional particulars; whereas, since those particulars are already compulsory, the two paragraphs in question should be deleted; 
(12) Whereas, for the sake of clarity, Article 2(1)(a) and Article 8(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1143/98 should be corrected; 
(13) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

5. All notifications, including nil notifications, shall be sent by fax, using the forms in Annexes II and III where applications are submitted. 
Article 5

2. As regards applications as referred to in the second indent of Article 4(4), where the quantities applied for exceed the quantities available, the Commission shall set a uniform percentage reduction in the quantities applied for. 
Where the application of the uniform percentage reduction provided for in the first subparagraph results in less than 15 head being allocated per application, the allocation shall be made by the Member States concerned by drawing lots for batches of 15 head. Where the remainder is less than 15 head, that number shall constitute a single batch.

The securities shall be released immediately where proof is supplied to the customs authorities concerned that the animals:
