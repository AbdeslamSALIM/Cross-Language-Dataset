THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,

Whereas: 
(1) Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1222/24/of 30 May 1994 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 701/2000(4), makes the grant of export refunds on the products referred to in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3098/94(6), conditional on production of a certificate which, under Article 6b of Regulation (EC) No 1222/94, is valid for a maximum of one budget period. The budget period is laid down in Article 1(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1222/94 and runs from 1 October of one year to 30 September of the following year. Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 provides that the coefficient applicable to the quantities of cereals placed under control and distilled is to apply from 1 July until 30 June of the following year. To facilitate management of the activities of the distillers involved, those two periods should be harmonised and thus the period of validity for the coefficients brought into line with the period for the certificate. Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 should be amended accordingly.
