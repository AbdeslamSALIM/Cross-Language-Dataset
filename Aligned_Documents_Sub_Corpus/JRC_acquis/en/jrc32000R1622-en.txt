Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 of 24 July 2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 
of 24 July 2000 
laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), and in particular Articles 42, 44, 45, 46 and 80 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Chapter I of Title V of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and several of the Annexes thereto lay down general rules on oenological practices and processes and refer for the rest to detailed implementing rules to be adopted by the Commission. 
(2) Until Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 was adopted, those rules were scattered throughout a large number of Community regulations. In the interests of both economic operators in the Community and the authorities responsible for applying Community rules, all those provisions should be collated in a Community code of oenological practices and processes and the Regulations on the subject, i.e. Commission Regulations (EEC) No 1618/70(2), No 1972/78(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 45/80(4), No 2394/84(5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2751/86(6), No 305/86(7), No 1888/86(8), No 2202/89(9), No 2240/89(10), No 3220/90(11), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1477/1999(12), and (EC) No 586/93(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 693/96(14), No 3111/93(15), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 693/98(16), and (EC) No 1128/96(17), should be repealed. 
(3) This Community code must include the current rules and adapt them to the new requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. However, they must also be simplified and made more coherent and certain gaps must be filled in to ensure that the Community rules in this area are comprehensive. In addition, some rules should be made more specific to ensure greater legal certainty when they are applied. 
(4) Furthermore, in order to simplify the rules, only the detailed implementing rules explicitly referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 should be included. For the rest, the rules under Articles 28 et seq. of the Treaty should suffice to ensure free movement of wine-sector products where oenological processes and practices are concerned. 
(5) It should also be specified that the code is to apply without prejudice to specific provisions in other fields, in particular, rules already existing or to be adopted in future for foodstuffs. 
(6) Article 42(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 permits grapes other than those of the wine-grape varieties listed in the classification established in accordance with Article 19 of that Regulation, or products derived therefrom, to be used in the Community for the manufacture of the products listed in Article 42(5). A list should be drawn up of the varieties to which such derogations may apply. 
(7) Pursuant to Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 1493/1999 a list should be drawn up of quality liqueur wines produced in specified regions (quality liqueur wines psr) for which special rules of preparation are allowed. To enable products to be more easily identified and to facilitate intra-Community trade, reference should be made to the descriptions of products as established by Community rules or, where appropriate, by national legislation. 
(8) Limits on the use of certain substances should also be fixed, pursuant to Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, and conditions should be laid down for the use of some of them. 
(9) In the light of current technical and scientific knowledge on the addition of lysozyme, in particular as regards the quality and health characteristics of wine treated in this way, definitive limits cannot be laid down at present for this new treatment. It should not be allowed for the moment and further trials should be conducted during the forthcoming wine year. 
(10) Article 44 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79(18), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3307/85(19), reduced the maximum total sulphur dioxide content of wines other than sparkling and liqueur wines and certain quality wines by 15 mg per litre, with effect from 1 September 1986. To avoid difficulty in disposing of wine as a result of this change in the production rules, wine produced before that date in the Community, with the exception of Portugal, was allowed to be offered for direct human consumption after that date. That authorisation also applied, for a transitional period of one year from that date, to wine originating in third countries or in Portugal, provided that its total sulphur dioxide content complied with the Community rules or, where applicable, the Spanish rules in force before 1 September 1986. Since there might still be stocks of such wine, the measure in question should be extended. 
(11) Articles 12 and 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 358/79(20) reduced the maximum total sulphur dioxide content of sparkling wines, quality sparkling wines and quality sparkling wines produced in specified regions by 15 milligrams per litre with effect from 1 September 1986. In the case of sparkling wines originating in the Community, with the exception of Portugal, Article 22(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 358/79 allowed such products to be disposed of until stocks were exhausted provided that they had been prepared in accordance with that Regulation as it applied before 1 September 1986. Transitional provisions should be laid down for imported sparkling wines and sparkling wines produced in Spain and Portugal before 1 September 1986 in order to avoid difficulties in disposing of such products. Those products should therefore be permitted to be offered for sale for a transitional period after that date, provided that their total sulphur dioxide content complies with the Community provisions in force before 1 September 1986. 
(12) Annex V(B)(1) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 fixes the maximum volatile-acid content of wine. Provision may be made for derogations for certain quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) and certain table wines described by means of a geographical indication or having an alcoholic strength of 13 % or more. Some German, Spanish, French, Italian, Austrian and United Kingdom wines in these categories normally have a volatile acidity higher than that provided for in abovementioned Annex V owing to the special methods by which they are prepared and their high alcoholic strength. In order that those wines may continue to be prepared by the customary methods whereby they acquire their characteristic properties, provision should be made for a derogation from abovementioned Annex V(B)(1) in their case. 
(13) In accordance with Annex V(D)(3) to Regulation (EEC) No 1493/1999, the wine-growing regions where addition of sucrose was traditionally practised in accordance with legislation in force on 8 May 1970 should be specified. 
(14) The small size of the wine-growing sector of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg means that the competent authorities can carry out systematic analytical checks of all batches of products turned into wine. Declarations of intention to enrich wine are not indispensable so long as those conditions continue to apply. 
(15) In accordance with Annex V(G)(5) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, all enrichment, acidification and deacidification operations must be notified to the competent authorities. This also holds for quantities of sugar, concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must held by the natural or legal persons undertaking such operations. The purpose of such notification is to allow the operations in question to be monitored. Notifications must therefore be addressed to the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory the operation is to take place and must be as accurate as possible. Where an increase in alcoholic strength is involved, the competent authority must be notified in sufficient time to carry out an effective check. In the case of acidification and deacidification, a check after the operation is sufficient. To simplify administrative procedures, it must therefore be possible to make such notification, except for the first notification in the wine year, by updating records regularly verified by the competent authority. 
(16) Annex V(F)(1) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 lays down certain rules for the sweetening of wines. That provision refers primarily to table wine but also applies to quality wines psr by virtue of Annex VI(G)(2) to that Regulation. 
(17) Sweetening must not lead to enrichment in excess of the limits set in Annex V(C) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. Special provision has been made to that end in Annex V1(F)(1) to that Regulation. In addition, checks are essential to ensure compliance with the provisions in question. 
(18) In order in particular to help make checks effective, sweetening should be carried out only at the production stage or another stage as close to production as possible. It should therefore be restricted to the production and wholesale stages. 
(19) The supervisory authorities must be informed of all impending sweetening operations. Anyone intending to carry out a sweetening operation should therefore be required to notify the supervisory authorities in writing. However, this procedure may be simplified when an undertaking carries out sweetening frequently or continuously. 
(20) The purpose of such notifications is to allow the operations in question to be monitored. Notifications must therefore be addressed to the competent authority of the Member State on whose territory the operation is to take place, be as accurate as possible and reach the competent authority prior to the operation. 
(21) For checks to be effective, the quantities of grape must or concentrated grape must held by the party concerned before the sweetening operation must be declared. However, such declarations are of no value unless there is also an obligation to keep inwards and outwards registers of products used in sweetening operations. 
(22) In order to prevent sucrose from being used to sweeten liqueur wines, the use of rectified concentrated grape must, in addition to concentrated grape must, should be permitted. 
(23) %quot%Coupage%quot% is a widespread oenological practice and, in view of its possible consequences, its use must be regulated in order to prevent abuse. 
(24) Coupage is the mixing of wines or musts of different origins or of different categories. 
(25) Indication of geographical origin or vine variety is of great importance for the commercial value of wines or musts originating in the same wine-growing zone of the Community or in the same production area of a third country. The mixing of wines or grape musts from the same zone, but from different geographical areas within that zone, or from different vine varieties or harvest years should therefore also be regarded as coupage where the description of the resulting product mentions the geographical origin, wine variety or harvest year. 
(26) Article 42(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 in principle forbids the coupage of white table wine with red table wine but provides for a derogation for areas where that practice was traditional. 
(27) Under that derogation special detailed rules should be laid down for Spain in line with the structure of the wine-growing sector and consumer attitudes, which change slowly. 
(28) In order to restrict the coupage of white and red table wines to Spain, where it is necessary, it is vital to ensure that wine produced by this practice cannot be consumed outside that country. 
(29) The Member States should be allowed to authorise the use, for a limited time for experimental purposes, of oenological practices and processes not provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. 
(30) Under Article 46(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 methods of analysis must be adopted for establishing the composition of the products covered by Article 1 of that Regulation and rules must be laid down for establishing whether those products have undergone processes contrary to authorised oenological practices. 
(31) Annex VI(J)(1) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for an analytical test which is at least to measure the factors, among those listed in point (J)(3) of that Annex, enabling the quality wine psr concerned to be distinguished. 
(32) Uniform methods of analysis must be introduced to ensure that the particulars on documents relating to the products in question are accurate and comparable for verification purposes. Such methods must therefore be compulsory for all commercial transactions and verification procedures. However, in view of the control requirements and the trade's limited facilities, a small number of usual procedures should continue to be allowed for a limited period so that the requisite factors can be determined rapidly and with reasonable accuracy. 
(33) The Community methods for the analysis of wines were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2676/90(21). Since the methods described therein are valid, that Regulation should remain in force, with the exception of the usual methods which will ultimately no longer be described. 
(34) Under Article 80 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 measures may be adopted to facilitate the changeover to the arrangements provided for in this Regulation. That possibility should be used to protect traders holding large stocks of certain products covered by that Regulation from substantial losses. 
(35) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

ANNEX V 
Requirements and purity criteria for polyvinylpolypyrrolidone 
(Article 6 of this Regulation) 
Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), the use of which is provided for in Annex IV(1)(p) and (3)(y) to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, is a statistically reticulated polymer of [1-(2-oxo-1-pyrrolidinylethylene). 
It is manufactured by polymerizing N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone in the presence of a catalyst, which may be either caustic soda or N,N'-divinylimidazolidone. 
CHARACTERISTICS 
Light powder, white to cream-coloured. 
Insoluble in water and organic solvents. 
Insoluble in strong mineral acids and alkalis. 
TESTS 
1. LOSS ON DRYING 
Less than 5 % in the following conditions: 
Place 2 g of PVPP in a silica capsule with a diameter of 70 mm; dry in oven at 100 to 105 °C for six hours. Leave to cool in a desiccator and weigh. 
Note: 
All the limits fixed below refer to dry weight. 
2. ASH 
Weight of ash less than 0.5 % in the following conditions: 
Gradually ash the residue from test 1, without exceeding 500 to 550 °C, and weigh. 
3. ARSENIC 
Less than 2 parts per million in the following conditions: 
Preparation of the product to be tested: 
Place 0,5 g of PVPP into a round-bottom flask of borosilicate glass placed on a disk with a hole in the middle, with the neck inclined. Add 5 ml of pure sulphuric acid (AR quality) and 10 ml of pure nitric acid (AR quality) and heat gradually. When the mixture begins to turn brown, add a small quantity of nitric acid and continue to heat. Continue in this way until the liquid remains colourless and the flask fills with white SO3 fumes. Leave to cool, take up in 10 ml of water and reheat to dispel the nitrous vapours until white fumes are obtained. This operation is repeated a second time; after taking up a third time, bring to the boil for a few seconds, cool and make up to 40 ml with water. 
Reagents (AR quality) 
1. Concentrated arsenic solution (100 mg of arsenic per litre) 
Weigh exactly 0.132 g of arsenous anhydride, previously dried at 100 °C, into a 500 ml conical flask. Add 3 ml of sodium hydroxide and 20 ml of water. Shake until dissolved. Neutralize the arsenous liquor with 15 ml of sulphuric acid diluted to 10 % (w/w) and add saturated bromine water (AR quality) until the yellow colour of free bromine becomes stable (theoretically, 7 ml). Bring to the boil to dispel the excess bromine, transfer to a 1000 ml volumetric flask and make up to quantity with distilled water. 
2. Diluted arsenic solution (1 mg of arsenic per litre) 
Mix 10 ml of concentrated arsenic solution (100 mg per litre) with distilled water to make up 1000 ml. 1 ml of this solution contains 1/1000 mg of arsenic. 
3. Lead acetate cotton 
Immerse absorbent cotton in a 5 % (w/v) lead acetate solution to which 1 % acetic acid has been added. Drain the cotton and leave to dry in the air. Keep in a well-sealed bottle. 
4. Absorbent cotton dried in an oven at 100 °C 
Keep in a well-sealed bottle. 
5. Mercuric bromide paper 
Place an alcoholic solution of mercuric bromide (5 %) in a rectangular basin. Immerse 80 g/m2 white filter paper, cut into pieces of 15 × 22 cm and folded in two, in the solution. Drain the paper and leave to dry in a dark place hung over a non-metallic line. Cut at 1 mm away from the fold and 1 cm from lower edges. Cut the paper into 15 × 15 mm squares; keep in a well-sealed bottle, covered with black paper. 
6. Stannous chloride solution 
Cold attack 20 g of pure tin shot (analytical quality) with 100 ml of pure hydrochloric acid, d = 1.19. Keep in the presence of metallic tin in an airtight bottle with valve stopper. 
7. Potassium iodide solution 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
8. Nitric acid for the determination of arsenic (AR quality) 
Acid with a density of 1.38 at 20 °C, containing 61.5 to 65.5 % nitric acid (HNO3). It should not leave a fixed residue of more than 0.0001 %. It may not contain lead detectable with dithizone, or more than 1 millionth of chlorine ion, 2 millionths of sulphuric ion, 2 millionths of orthophosphoric ion or one hundred millionth of arsenic. 
9. Sulphuric acid for the determination of arsenic (AR quality) 
Acid with a density of 1.831 to 1.835 at 20 °C containing at least 95 % sulphuric acid (H2SO4). It should not leave a fixed residue of more than 0.0005 %. It may not contain more than 2 millionths of heavy metals, 1 millionth of iron, 1 millionth of chlorine ion, 1 millionth of nitric ion, 5 millionths of ammonium ion or 2 hundred millionths of arsenic. 
10. 20 % (v/v) diluted sulphuric acid solution (36 g H2SO4 per 100 ml) 
Mix 200 ml of pure sulphuric acid (AR quality) with distilled water to make up 1000 ml. 
11. Platinized zinc 
Pure zinc, free of arsenic, in shot or cylinder form. Platinize the zinc by placing it in a cylindrical flask and covering it with a 1/20000 platinum chloride solution. After two hours of contact, wash the zinc with distilled water, drain the platinized zinc on several thicknesses of blotting paper, dry and place in a dry bottle. 
Verify that 5 g of this zinc, placed in the apparatus described below with 4,5 ml of pure sulphuric acid and made up to 40 ml with water, to which two drops of stannous II chloride and 5 ml of 10 % potassium iodide solution are added, leaves no stain after at least two hours on mercuric bromide paper. Check also that 1µg of arsenic used as indicated below leaves a discernible trace. 
Description of the apparatus 
Use a 90 to 100 ml flask sealed with a glass stopper fitted with a 90 mm-long glass tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The lower part of the tube is tapered and pierced by a lateral hole (anti-entrainment device). The upper edge has a ground flat surface perpendicular to the tube's axis. A second glass tube with the same internal diameter and 30 mm in length with an upper edge having a ground flat surface like the first tube may be attached to the former and secured by two coil springs or rubber rings. 
Procedure 
In the outlet tube, at position A, place a plug of dry absorbent cotton, then a plug of lead acetate cotton. 
Place a square of mercuric bromide paper between the two parts of the outlet tube at B and join the two parts of the tube. 
Place 40 ml of sulphuric liquid, two drops of tin chloride solution and 5 ml of potassium iodide solution in the flask. Leave for 15 minutes. Add 5 g of platinized zinc and immediately seal the flask with the tube prepared in advance. 
Allow the emission to continue until exhausted (at least two hours). Take the apparatus apart, immerse the square of mercuric bromide paper in 10 ml of potassium iodide solution for half an hour, shaking occasionally; rinse generously and leave to dry. 
The yellow or brown stain must be invisible, or paler than the stain obtained in a parallel test carried out with 1 ml of arsenic solution at 1µg per ml, to which 4.5 ml of pure sulphuric acid are added and made up to 40 ml with water, to which two drops of stannous chloride and 5 ml of 10 % potassium iodide solution are then added. 
4. HEAVY METALS 
Expressed as lead, less than 20 ppm in the following conditions: 
After weighing, dissolve the ash in 1 ml of pure hydrochloric acid and 10 ml of distilled water. Heat to dissolve. Make up to 20 ml with distilled water. 1 ml of this solution contains the mineral matter of 0.10 g of PVPP. 
Place 10 ml of ash solution in a 160 × 16 test tube with 2 ml of a 4 % pure sodium fluoride solution, 0.5 ml of pure ammonium, 3 ml of water, 0.5 ml of pure acetic acid and 2 ml of hydrogen sulphide saturated aqueous solution. 
No precipitation should take place. If a brown colour is produced, it should be less than the colour produced by the reference, prepared as follows: 
Place 2 ml of a solution containing 0.01 g of lead (Pb) in 1 l (10 mg Pb per litre), 15 ml of water, 0.5 ml of 4 % (m/v) sodium fluoride, 0.5 ml of pure acetic acid and 2 ml of hydrogen sulphide saturated aqueous solution in a 160 × 16 test tube. The tube contains 20µg of lead 
Note: 
At this concentration, the lead sulphide precipitates only in an acetic medium. Precipitation can be obtained in the presence of only 0.05 ml of hydrochloric acid for 15 ml, but this concentration is too delicate to be achieved exactly in practice. 
If the 0.5 ml of acetic acid were replaced by 0.5 ml of hydrochloric acid, only copper, mercury, etc. would be precipitated. 
Any iron present, generally in the ferric state, oxidizes hydrogen sulphide by producing a sulphur precipitate which conceals the colloidal lead sulphide precipitate. Complexed with 0.5 ml of sodium fluoride, iron oxidizes hydrogen sulphide more slowly. 
This quantity is sufficient to complex 1 mg of iron (III). Increase the quantity of sodium fluoride if more iron is present. 
For products containing calcium, filtration is required after the fluoride is added. 
5. TOTAL NITROGEN 
Between 11 and 12.8 % under the following conditions: 
Apparatus 
A. The apparatus is made up of: 
1. A 1 l flask A of borosilicate glass as a heating vessel, fitted with a tap-funnel for filling. It can be heated on a gas or electric ring 
2. An extension C to collect the spent liquid from the bubbler B. 
3. A 500 ml bubbler B with an inclined neck; the entry tube should reach the lower part of the flask. The exit tube is fitted with an anti-entrainment ball which constitutes the upper part of the bubbler. A tap-funnel E for introduction of the liquid to be treated and the alkaline solution. 
4. A vertical condenser, 30 to 40 cm in length, with a fine-necked bulb at the end. 
5. A 250 ml conical flask to collect the distillate. 
B. A 300 ml egg-shaped mineralization flask with a long neck. 
Substances required: 
Pure sulphuric acid 
Mineralization catalyst 
30 % (m/m) sodium hydroxide 
40 % (m/v) pure boric acid solution 
0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution 
A mixed indicator of bromocresol green and methyl red. 
The heating vessel must be filled with water acidulated with 1/1000 sulphuric acid. This liquid should be boiled before each operation, with the purge valve P open to dispel CO2. 
Procedure 
Place approximately 0.20 g of PVPP, weighed exactly, in the mineralization flask. Add 2 g of mineralization catalyst and 15 ml of pure sulphuric acid. 
Heat over a naked flame, with the neck of the flask inclined, until the solution is colourless and the sides of the flask are free of carbonized substances. 
After cooling, dilute with 50 ml of water and cool further; place this liquid in the bubbler B via filter E; next add 40 to 50 ml of 30 % sodium hydroxide, to obtain full alkalinization of the liquid and drive off the ammonia with the steam, collecting the distillate in 5 ml of boric acid solution placed in advance in the conical receiver flask with 10 ml of water, with the end of the bulb immersed in the liquid. Add one or two drops of mixed indicator and collect 70 to 100 ml of distillate. 
Titrate the distillate with the 0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution until the indicator turns pinkish violet. 
1 ml of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid solution corresponds to 1.4 mg of nitrogen.

Requirements for electrodialysis treatment 
(Article 15 of this Regulation) 
The purpose is to obtain tartaric stability of the wine with regard to potassium hydrogen tartrate and calcium tartrate (and other calcium salts) by extraction of ions in supersaturation in the wine under the action of an electrical field and using membranes that are either anion-permeable or cation-permeable. 
1. MEMBRANE REQUIREMENTS 
1.1. The membranes are to be arranged alternately in a %quot%filter-press%quot% type system or any other appropriate system separating the treatment (wine) and concentration (waste water) compartments. 
1.2. The cation-permeable membranes must be designed to extract cations only, in particular K+ and Ca++. 
1.3. The anion-permeable membranes must be designed to extract anions only, in particular tartrate anions. 
1.4. The membranes must not excessively modify the physico-chemical composition and sensory characteristics of the wine. They must meet the following requirements: 
- they must be manufactured according to good manufacturing practice from substances authorised for the manufacture of plastic materials intended to come into contact with foodstuffs as listed in Annex II to Commission Directive 90/128/EEC(1); 
- the user of the electrodialysis equipment must show that the membranes used meet the above requirements and that any replacements have been made by specialised personnel; 
- they must not release any substance in quantities endangering human health or affecting the taste or smell of foodstuffs and must meet the criteria laid down in Directive 90/128/EEC; 
- their use must not trigger interactions between their constituents and the wine liable to result in the formation of new compounds that may be toxic in the treated product. 
The stability of fresh electrodialysis membranes is to be determined using a simulant reproducing the physico-chemical composition of the wine for investigation of possible migration of certain substances from them. 
The experimental method recommended is as follows: 
The simulant is a water-alcohol solution buffered to the pH and conductivity of the wine. Its composition is as follows: 
- absolute ethanol: 11 l, 
- potassium hydrogen tartrate: 380 g, 
- potassium chloride: 60 g, 
- concentrated sulphuric acid: 5 ml, 
- distilled water: to make up 100 litres. 
This solution is used for closed circuit migration tests on an electrodialysis stack under tension (1 volt/cell), on the basis of 50 l/m2 of anionic and cationic membranes, until 50 % demineralisation of the solution. The effluent circuit is initiated by a 5 g/l potassium chloride solution. Migrating substances are tested for in both the simulant and the effluent. 
Organic molecules entering into the membrane composition that are liable to migrate into the treated solution will be determined. A specific determination will be carried out for each of these constituents by an approved laboratory. The content in the simulant of all the determined compounds must be less than 50 g/l. 
The general rules on controls of materials in contact with foodstuffs must be applied to these membranes. 
2. MEMBRANE UTILISATION REQUIREMENTS 
The membrane pair is formulated so that the following conditions are met: 
- the pH reduction of the wine is to be no more than 0.3 pH units, 
- the volatile acidity reduction is to be less than 0.12 g/l (2 meq expressed as acetic acid); 
- treatment must not affect the non-ionic constituents of the wine, in particular polyphenols and polysaccharides; 
- diffusion of small molecules such as ethanol is to be reduced and must not cause a reduction in alcoholic strength of more than 0.1 % vol.; 
- the membranes must be conserved and cleaned by approved methods with substances authorised for use in the preparation of foodstuffs; 
- the membranes are marked so that alternation in the stack can be checked; 
- the equipment is to be run using a command and control mechanism that will take account of the particular instability of each wine so as to eliminate only the supersaturation of potassium hydrogen tartrate and calcium salts; 
- the treatment is to be carried out on the responsibility of an oenologist or qualified technician. 
The treatment is to be recorded in the register referred to in Article 70(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1493/1999. 
(1) OJ L 75, 21.3.1990, p. 19. Last amended by Directive 1999/91/EC (OJ L 330, 4.12.1999, p. 41).
