Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1674/72 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1969/80 (3), lays down that aid may be granted only for seed which is officially certified and which satisfies the definitions laid down by the Directives concerning their marketing, and the standards and conditions laid down in the said Directives; 
Whereas Article 113 (1) of the 1979 Act of Accession provides that, until 31 December 1985, Greece may apply its own rules on the certification and control of production of seeds ; whereas Article 113 (2) (c) provides that Greece shall export to the territory of the Member States only seeds which comply with Community provisions ; whereas Article 113 (3) makes provision for a decision on the progressive liberalization of trade in seeds of certain species between Greece and the other Member States; 
Whereas the seeds in respect of which such a decision will be taken fulfil the conditions laid down in the provisions applicable to Community production ; whereas Community aid should therefore be granted to seeds harvested in Greece which are certified and in respect of which a decision is taken for the liberalization of trade between that Member State and the other Member States,
