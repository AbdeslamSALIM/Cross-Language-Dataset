Final report of the Hearing Officer in Case COMP/32.448 and 32.450 â&#x20AC;&#x201D; Compagnie Maritime Belge 
(pursuant to Article 15 of Commission Decision 2001/462/EC, ECSC of 23 May 2001 on the terms of reference of Hearing Officers in certain competition proceedings â&#x20AC;&#x201D; OJ L 162, 19.6.2001, p. 21) 
(2005/C 162/02) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
The draft decision in this case gives rise to the following observations: 
A Statement of Objections was sent to Compagnie Maritime Belge (CMB) and Dafra-Lines on 17 April 2003. 
On 1 May 2003 the Commission was informed that Dafra-Lines had been liquidated on 4 March 2003. As a result, the procedure against this company was discontinued. 
On 16 May 2003, a list of all documents in the files 32.450 and 32.448 was sent to CMB and to their legal representative. 
On 26 May 2003, CMB requested a two month extension of the deadline to reply to the Statement of Objections, arguing that they had received the Statement of Objections shortly before the Easter weekend and that it was difficult to give an adequate reply within the deadline since the case dated back to the 1980s. I granted an extension of four weeks, that is until 15 July 2003. 
Access to the file was not requested by CMB. 
On 16 July 2004, CMB submitted a reply to the Statement of Objections and requested a formal oral hearing. 
The formal oral hearing took place on 24 September 2003. 
In the light of the above, I consider that the rights to be heard have been respected in the present case. The draft decision deals only with objections in respect of which the parties have been afforded the opportunity of making known their views.
