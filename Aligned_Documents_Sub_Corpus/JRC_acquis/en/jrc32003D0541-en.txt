Commission Decision 
of 17 July 2003 
amending Decisions 92/260/EEC, 93/197/EEC and 97/10/EC as regards the temporary admission and imports into the European Union of registered horses from South Africa 
(notified under document number C(2003) 1212) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2003/541/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and imports from third countries of equidae(1), as last amended by Commission Decision 2002/160/EC(2), and in particular Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Articles 14, 15, 16 and Article 19(i) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 92/260/EEC(3), as last amended by Decision 2002/635/EC(4), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses. 
(2) Commission Decision 93/197/EEC(5), as last amended by Decision 2002/841/EC(6), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production. 
(3) Annex I to Commission Decision 97/10/EC of 12 December 1996 amending Council Decision 79/542/EEC and Commission Decisions 92/160/EEC, 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC in relation to the temporary admission and imports into the Community of registered horses from South Africa(7), as last amended by Decision 2001/622/EC(8), provides for additional guarantees which apply to the regionalisation of South Africa for imports of registered horses into the European Union. 
(4) Those additional guarantees require a specific period of residence of registered horses within the African horse sickness-free zone and lay down conditions under which the registered horses intended for transport by air to the European Union must be transported to the airport situated in the surveillance zone under vector-protected conditions. 
(5) Taking into account the required isolation in an approved and vector-protected quarantine station, it appears justified to require the same minimum residence period in the African horse sickness-free zone for registered horses temporarily admitted and imported into the European Union. 
(6) Due to changes in the schedules of airlines, the transport of registered horses in standard cargo aircraft appears to be impossible, leaving the transport of registered horses by sea the only realistic alternative. 
(7) It is necessary to lay down the conditions under which registered horses may be transported without compromising the health status of those animals during the journey by sea from the port of Cape Town situated in the free zone to a harbour in the European Union approved as border inspection post in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(9), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC(10). 
(8) Decisions 92/260/EEC, 93/197/EEC and 97/10/EC should be amended accordingly. 
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
