COMMISSION DECISION of 28 July 1997 amending Decision 93/70/EEC on codification for the message 'Animo` (Text with EEA relevance) (97/628/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning the veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable to intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (2), and in particular Article 20 (3) thereof, 
Whereas, in order to ensure that the Animo message is quickly understood, the Commission, by Decision 93/70/EEC (3), as amended by Decision 94/295/EC (4), has stipulated the codes to be used for animals and animal products; 
Whereas, in the light of the experience gained, substantial changes have been made to the data file relating to the codes for the animals products to improve its use; 
Whereas the Annex to Decision 93/70/EEC should be amended to adjust it to the corresponding data file in the new software; 
Whereas the fact that certain live animals and products are included in the codification does not mean that a message has to be sent by means of the computerized Animo network; 
Whereas the codification of live animals and of products will be re-examined when the decisions needed to introduce the Shift project are being adopted; 
Whereas the measures laid down in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION: 
Article 1 
The Annex to Decision 93/70/EEC is replaced by the Annex hereto.
