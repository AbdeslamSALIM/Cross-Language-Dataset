COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 98/90/EC of 30 November 1998 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 70/387/EEC relating to the doors of motor vehicles and their trailers (Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 98/14/EC (2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 70/387/EEC of 27 July 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the doors of motor vehicles and their trailers (3), as amended by the Act of Accession of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom, and in particular Article 3 thereof, 
Whereas Directive 70/387/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC; whereas consequently the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to the present Directive; 
Whereas it is possible further to adapt Directive 70/387/EEC to technical progress by improving safety of persons entering and leaving the driver's compartment of some heavy goods vehicles; 
Whereas, in particular, Article 3(4) and Article 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC necessitate that each separate Directive has attached to it an information document incorporating the relevant items referred to in Annex I to that Directive and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI thereto in order that type-approval may be computerised; 
Whereas with a view to the practical application of Directive 70/387/EEC, it is necessary to ensure that uniform provisions exist in all Member States; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the adaption to technical progress established by Directive 70/156/EEC, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: 
Article 1 
Directive 70/387/EEC is amended as follows: 
1. In Article 1, the words 'agricultural tractors` are replaced by 'agricultural and forestry tractors` and the words 'machinery and public works vehicles` are replaced by 'all mobile machinery`. 
2. The Annexes are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive. 
Article 2 
1. With effect from l January 1999 Member States may not on grounds relating to vehicle doors: 
- refuse, in respect of a type of vehicle, to grant EC type-approval or national type-approval,

if the vehicles comply with the requirements of Directive 70/387/EEC, as amended by this Directive. 
2. With effect from l October 2000 Member States: 
- shall no longer grant EC type-approval, 
and

for a new type of vehicle on grounds relating to vehicle doors if the requirements of Directive 70/387/EEC, as amended by this Directive, are not fulfilled. 
Article 3 
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 1998 at the latest. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. 
When Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. Member States shall determine how such reference is to be made. 
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. 
Article 4

2. DEFINITIONS 
For the purpose of this Directive: 
2.1. %quot%approval of a vehicle%quot%, means the approval of a vehicle type with regard to its doors and to the characteristics applicable to such doors; 
2.2. %quot%vehicle type%quot%, means vehicles which do not differ essentially with respect to the following main characteristics: 
- design and strength characteristics of the latches and hinges as regards the vehicles mentioned in Annex II, 
- construction and fitting requirements of the running boards and steps as regards vehicles not covered by Annex III, 
- position and geometrical characteristics of the access steps and the handholds as regards vehicles mentioned in Annex III, 
in so far as these characteristics have a bearing on the requirements of this Directive. 
3. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
3.1. Design 
3.1.1. The design characteristics of the vehicle must permit entry to and exit from it in perfect safety. 
3.1.2. Vehicles of category N2 with a maximum mass exceeding 7,5 tonnes and N3 are deemed to satisfy the abovementioned requirements if they comply with the prescriptions of Annex III.

1. Access steps to the driver's compartment (see figure) 
1.1. The distance (A) from the ground to the upper surface of the lowest step, measured with the vehicle in running order on a horizontal and flat surface, shall not be more than 600 mm. 
1.1.1. However, for off-road vehicles, as defined in Annex IIA to Directive 70/156/EEC, that distance (A) may be increased up to 700 mm. 
1.2. The distance (B) between the upper surfaces of the steps shall be not more than 400 mm. The vertical distance between two subsequent steps shall not vary by more than 50 mm. 
1.2.1. However, for off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1), this latter figure may be increased up to 100 mm. 
1.3. In addition, the following minimum geometrical specifications shall be fulfilled: 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
1.3.1. However, for off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1), the value (F) may be reduced to 200 mm. 
1.4. The lowest step may be designed as a rung, if this is necessary for reasons relating to construction or use, and in the case of off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1). In such case the rung depth (R) shall be at least 20 mm. 
1.4.1. Rungs of round cross section are not permitted. 
1.5. While getting down from the driver's compartment the position of the uppermost step shall be easily found out. 
1.6. The upper surface of the steps shall be non-slip. In addition, steps exposed to the weather and the dirt during driving shall have adequate run-off (draining surface). 
2. Access to handholds to the driver's compartment (see figure) 
2.1. One or more suitable handrails and handholds or other equivalent holding devices shall be provided for the access to the driver's compartment. 
2.1.1. The handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices must be positioned in such a way that they can be easily grasped and do not obstruct access. 
2.1.2. A maximum discontinuity of 100 mm in the holding area of the handrails or handholds or equivalent holding devices may be allowed (for instance intermediate fixation). 
2.1.3. In the case of access with more than two steps the handrails, handholds or equivalent holding devices shall be located so that a person may support himself at the same time at three points (with two hands and one foot or with two feet and one hand). 
2.1.4. Except in the case of a stairway, the design and positioning of the handrails, handholds and equivalent holding devices must be such that operators are encouraged to descend facing the cab. 
2.1.5. The steering wheel may be considered as a handhold. 
2.2. The height (N) of the lower edge of at least one handrail or handhold or equivalent holding device, measured from the ground with the vehicle in running order on a horizontal and flat surface, shall not be more than 1 850 mm. 
2.2.1. However, for off-road vehicles (see 1.1.1), such distance (N) may be increased up to 1 950 mm. 
2.2.2. If the floor of the driver's compartment has a height from the ground greater than %quot%N%quot%, this height shall be assumed as %quot%N%quot%. 
2.2.3. In addition, the minimum distance %quot%P%quot% of the upper edge of the handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices from the uppermost step (floor of the driver's compartment) shall be: 
- handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices (U) 650 mm, 
- handrail(s) or handholds or equivalent holding devices (V) 550 mm. 
2.3. The following geometrical specifications shall be fulfilled:

3. In the case of a sloped floor of the driver's compartment the required measurements shall be made from a horizontal plane passing through a point which is given by the intersection of the front edge of the floor with a vertical plane through the centre of the step immediately below and which is perpendicular to the longitudinal medium plane of the vehicle.`
