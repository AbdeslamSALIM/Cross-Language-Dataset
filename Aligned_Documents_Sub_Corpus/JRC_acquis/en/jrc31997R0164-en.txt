Whereas by Commission Decision 97/18/EC (3) the Commission approved measures proposed by France in order to control and eradicate BSE in that Member State; whereas in accordance with the abovementioned Decision financial assistance to France for carrying out the slaughtering of the animals concerned should be provided along the lines laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 716/96 of 19 April 1996 adopting exceptional support measures for the beef market in the United Kingdom (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2423/96 (5); whereas, consequently it is appropriate to provide for a Community contribution of 70 % of the market value of the animals slaughtered; whereas, for the purpose of establishing the market value France shall set up a system securing a fair and objective evaluation of each animal; 
Whereas, it is necessary to ensure that the animals concerned are killed and destroyed in a manner which does not pose any threat to human health or the health of other animals; whereas, it is therefore necessary to specify the conditions for the destruction of these animals and of the controls to be carried out by the French authorities; 
Whereas, provision should be made for Commission experts to check compliance with the conditions as specified; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,
