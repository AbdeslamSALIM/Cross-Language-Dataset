Council Regulation (EC) No 177/2005 
of 24 January 2005 
concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2005-2006) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [1], 
Whereas: 
(1) The International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter "the Fund") was established in 1986 by the Agreement of 18 September 1986 between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the International Fund for Ireland (hereinafter "the Agreement") in order to promote economic and social advance, and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland, in implementation of one of the objectives specified by the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 15 November 1985. 
(2) The Community has provided financial contributions to the Fund from 1989. For the period 2003 to 2004 EUR 15 million was committed from the Community budget for each of the years 2003 and 2004 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/2002 of 10 December 2002 concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2003–2004) [2]. That Regulation expired on 31 December 2004. 
(3) The assessments carried out in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2236/2002 have confirmed the need for further support for Fund activities, while continuing reinforcing synergy of objectives and coordination with Structural Funds interventions, in particular with the Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland (hereinafter "the PEACE Programme") set up in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds [3]. 
(4) The peace process in Northern Ireland requires a continuation of Community support to the Fund beyond 31 December 2004. 
(5) At its meeting in Brussels on 17 and 18 June 2004, the European Council called on the Commission to examine the possibility of aligning interventions under the PEACE Programme and the International Fund for Ireland with those of the other programmes under the Structural Funds that come to an end in 2006, including the implications in financial terms. 
(6) The Community contribution to the Fund should take the form of financial contributions for the years 2005 and 2006, thus terminating at the same time as an extended PEACE programme. 
(7) In allocating the Community contribution, the Fund should give priority to projects of a cross-border or cross-community nature, in such a way as to complement the activities funded by the PEACE Programme. 
(8) In accordance with the Agreement, all financial contributors to the Fund participate as observers at the meetings of the Board of the International Fund for Ireland. 
(9) The Commission should foster coordination at all levels between the Fund’s Board and agents, and the managing bodies set up under the Structural Funds interventions concerned, in particular under the PEACE programme. 
(10) Assistance from the Fund should be regarded as effective only in so far as it brings about sustainable economic and social improvement and is not used as a substitute for other public or private expenditure. 
(11) An assessment reviewing the performance of the Fund and the need for further Community support should be carried out before 1 April 2006. 
(12) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of Point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure [4] is included in this Regulation for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty. 
(13) The amount of the Community contribution to the Fund should be EUR 15 million for each of the years 2005 and 2006, expressed in current values. 
(14) That support will contribute to reinforcing solidarity between the Member States and between their peoples. 
(15) The Treaty provides for no powers other than those in Article 308 thereof for the adoption of this Regulation, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
