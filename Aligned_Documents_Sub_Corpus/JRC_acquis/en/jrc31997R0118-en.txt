COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 118/97 of 2 December 1996 amending and updating Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee, 
Whereas, for the sake of coherence and clarity, it is appropriate to adapt the wording of certain provisions of Council Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving with the Community (3) and (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 March 1972 laying down the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community (4); and to delete other provisions that have become invalid and superfluous; whereas these amendments are of an exclusively technical nature, intended to improve the said Regulations; 
Whereas since the latest updating of Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72 through Council Regulation (EEC) No 2001/83 (5) several amendments have been made; whereas it is therefore appropriate, in order to render the relevant Community rules more transparent and accessible, to adopt a new updated version of the abovementioned Regulations, in the form of a single text for each of the Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 and (EEC) No 574/72, which appear in Parts I and II respectively of Annex A; whereas it is already also opportune to present, in an appendix to Part II of this Annex, the text of Article 95 of Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3095/95 (6), which will apply as from 1 January 1998 or, in relations with the French Republic, from 1 January 2002; 
Whereas Article 106 of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, concerning the balance of payments, was deleted by Article G of the Treaty on European Union and Article 73b (2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community prohibits all restrictions on payments among the Member States; 
Whereas, in order to attain the objective of free movement for workers in the field of social security, it is necessary and appropriate that the rules relating to the coordination of national social security schemes should be amended through a Community legal instrument that is binding and directly applicable in each Member State; 
Whereas the amendments introduced by this Regulation comply with the condition set by the third paragraph of Article 3b of the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament, 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee, 
Whereas the provisions for coordination of national social security legislations fall within the framework of freedom of movement for workers who are nationals of Member Sates and should contribute towards the improvement of their standard of living and conditions of employment; 
Whereas freedom of movement for persons, which is one of the cornerstones of the Community, is not confined to employed persons but also extends to self-employed persons in the framework of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to supply services; 
Whereas the considerable differences existing between national legislations as regards the persons to whom they apply make it preferable to establish the principle that the Regulation applies to all persons insured under social security schemes for employed persons and for self-employed persons or by virtue of pursuing employment or self-employment; 
Whereas it is necessary to respect the special characteristics of national social security legislations and to draw up only a system of coordination; 
Whereas it is necessary, within the framework of that coordination, to guarantee within the Community equality of treatment under the various national legislations to workers living in the Member States and their dependants and their survivors; 
Whereas the provisions for coordination must guarantee that workers moving within the Community and their dependants and their survivors retain the rights and the advantages acquired and in the course of being acquired; 
Whereas these objectives must be attained in particular by aggregation of all the periods taken into account under the various national legislations for the purpose of acquiring and retaining the right to benefits and of calculating the amount of benefits, and by the provision of benefits for the various categories of persons covered by the Regulation regardless of their place of residence within the Community; 
Whereas employed persons and self-employed persons moving within the Community should be subject to the social security scheme of only one single Member State in order to avoid overlapping of national legislations applicable and the complications which could result therefrom; 
Whereas the instances in which a person should be subject simultaneously to the legislation of two Member States as an exception to the general rule should be as limited in number and scope as possible; 
Whereas with a view to guaranteeing the equality of treatment of all workers occupied on the territory of a Member State as effectively as possible, it is appropriate to determine as the legislation applicable, as a general rule, that of the Member State in which the person concerned pursues employment of self-employment; 
Whereas in certain situations which justify other criteria of applicability, it is possible to derogate from this general rule; 
Whereas certain benefits foreseen under national laws may fall simultaneously within social security and social assistance, because of the personal scope of their application, their objectives and their manner of application, it is necessary to lay down a system of coordination, which takes into account the special characteristics of the benefits concerned, that should be included in the Regulation in order to protect the interests of migrant workers in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty; 
Whereas such benefits should be granted, in respect of persons falling within the scope of this Regulation, solely in accordance with the legislation of the country of residence of the person concerned or of the members of his or her family, with such aggregation of periods of residence completed in any other Member State as is necessary and without discrimination on grounds of nationality; 
Whereas it is necessary to lay down specific rules, in particular in the field of sickness and unemployment, for frontier workers and seasonal workers, taking account of the specific nature of their situation; 
Whereas in the field of sickness and maternity benefits, it is necessary to guarantee the protection of persons living or staying in a Member State other than the competent Member State; 
Whereas the specific position of pension claimants and pensioners and the members of their families calls for the provisions governing sickness insurance to adapted to their situation; 
Whereas for invalidity benefits a system of coordination should be drawn up which respects the specific characteristics of national legislations; whereas it is therefore necessary to make a distinction between legislations under which the amount of invalidity benefit is independent of the length of insurance and legislations under which the amount depends on the aforementioned length; 
Whereas the differences between the schemes in the Member States call for the adoption of rules of coordination which are applicable in the case of aggravation of invalidity; 
Whereas it is expedient that a system for the award of old-age benefits and survivors benefits be worked out where the employed or self-employed person has been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States; 
Whereas there is a need to determine the amount of a pension calculated in accordance with the method used for aggregation and pro rata calculation and guaranteed by Community law where the application of national legislation, including provisions concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal, is less favourable than the aforementioned method; 
Whereas, to protect migrant workers and their survivors against an excessively stringent application of the national provisions concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal, it is necessary to include provisions laying down strict rules for the application of these provisions; 
Whereas, in respect of benefits for accidents at work and occupational diseases, it is necessary, for the purpose of affording protection, that rules be laid down covering the situation of persons residing or staying in a Member State other than the competent Member State; 
Whereas it is necessary to lay down specific provisions for death grants; 
Whereas, in order to secure mobility of labour under improved conditions, it is necessary henceforth to ensure closer coordination between the unemployment insurance schemes and the unemployment assistance schemes of all the Member States; 
Whereas it is therefore particularly appropriate, in order to facilitate search for employment in the various Member States, to grant to an unemployed worker, for a limited period, the unemployment benefits provided for by the legislation of the Member State to which he was last subject; 
Whereas, with a view to determining the legislation applicable to family benefits, the criterion of employment ensures equal treatment between all workers subject to the same legislation; 
Whereas, in order to avoid unwarranted overlapping of benefits, there is a need to provide for rules of priority in the case of overlapping of the right to family benefits under the legislation of the competent State and under the legislation of the country of residence of the members of the family; 
Whereas the legislations of the Member States differ from each other and are specific in nature, it is considered necessary to draw up specific rules for the coordination of the national schemes providing benefits for dependent children of pensioners and for orphans; 
Whereas it is necessary to establish an Administrative Commission consisting of a government representative from each of the Member States, charged in particular with dealing with all administrative questions or questions of interpretation arising from the provisions of this Regulation, and to further cooperation between the Member States; 
Whereas it is desirable, within the framework of an Advisory Committee, to have the representatives of workers and employers examine the issues treated by the Administrative Commission; 
Whereas it is necessary to lay down special provisions which correspond to the special characteristics of the national legislations in order to facilitate the application of the rules of coordination,

If, under this legislation, the amount of the benefit is independent of the duration of the periods completed, the amount shall be regarded as being the theoretical amount referred to in this paragraph; 
(b) the competent institution shall subsequently determine the actual amount of the benefit on the basis of the theoretical amount referred to in the preceding paragraph in accordance with the ratio of the duration of the periods of insurance or of residence completed before the materialization of the risk under the legislation which it administers to the total duration of the periods of insurance and of residence completed before the materialization of the risk under the legislations of all the Member States concerned. 
3. The person concerned shall be entitled to the highest amount calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 from the competent institution of each Member State without prejudice to any application of the provisions concerning reduction, suspension or withdrawal provided for by the legislation under which this benefit is due. 
Where that is the case, the comparison to be carried out shall relate to the amounts determined after the application of the said provisions.

For the purposes of the Chapter, overlapping of benefits of the same kind shall have the following meaning: all overlapping of benefits in respect of invalidity, old age and survivors calculated or provided on the basis of periods of insurance and/or residence completed by one and the same person.

2. The competent institution of each of the Member States concerned shall take into account the periods referred to in paragraph 1, for the purposes of applying Article 46 (2) excepting subparagraph (b). 
3. If the effect of applying paragraph 1 would be to relieve all the institutions of the Member States concerned of their obligations, benefits shall be awarded exclusively under the legislation of the last of those States whose conditions are satisfied, as if all the periods of insurance and residence completed and taken into account in accordance with Article 45 (1) to (4) had been completed under the legislation of that State.

(a) each of the competent institutions administering a legislation whose conditions are satisfied shall calculate the amount of the benefit due, in accordance with Article 46;

(i) if the person concerned satisfies the conditions of at least two legislations without having recourse to periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislations whose conditions are not satisfied, these periods shall not be taken into account for the purposes of Article 46 (2) unless taking account of the said periods makes it possible to determine a higher amount of benefit; 
(ii) if the person concerned satisfies the conditions of one legislation only without having recourse to periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislations whose conditions are not satisfied, the amount of the benefit due shall, in accordance with Article 46 (1) (a) (i), be calculated only in accordance with the provisions of the legislation whose conditions are satisfied, taking account of the periods completed under that legislation only, unless taking account of the periods completed under the legislations whose conditions are not satisfied makes it possible, in accordance with Article 46 (1) (a) (ii), to determine a higher amount of benefit. 
The provisions of this paragraph shall apply mutatis mutandis where the person concerned has expressly requested the postponement of the award of old-age benefits, in accordance with the second sentence of Article 44 (2). 
2. The benefit or benefits awarded under one or more of the legislations in question, in the case referred to in paragraph 1, shall be recalculated automatically in accordance with Article 46, as and when the conditions required by one or more of the other legislations to which the person concerned has been subject are satisfied, taking into account, where appropriate, Article 45 and taking into account once again, where appropriate, paragraph 1.

The competent institution of that State shall, if necessary, pay him throughout the period of his residence in its territory a supplement equal to the difference between the total of the benefits payable under this Chapter and the amount of the minimum benefit. 
Article 51 (11) Revalorization and recalculation of benefits 
1. If, by reason of an increase in the cost of living or changes in the level of wages or salaries or other reasons for adjustment, the benefits of the States concerned are altered by a fixed percentage or amount, such percentage or amount must be applied directly to the benefits determined under Article 46, without the need for a recalculation in accordance with that Article.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES FOR APPLYING THE LEGISLATIONS OF CERTAIN MEMBER STATES 
(Article 89 of the Regulation) 
A. BELGIUM 
1. Persons whose entitlement to sickness insurance benefits in kind derives from the provisions of the Belgian compulsory sickness and invalidity scheme applicable to self-employed persons shall be eligible under the provisions of Chapter 1 of Title III of the Regulation, including Article 35 (1), under the following conditions: 
(a) In the event that they are temporarily resident in the territory of a Member State other than Belgium, the persons concerned shall be entitled: 
(i) to the benefits in kind provided for under the legislation of the Member State of temporary residence in respect of hospitalization care; 
(ii) to reimbursement in respect of other benefits in kind provided for under the Belgian scheme by the relevant Belgian institution at the rate provided for under the legislation of the State of temporary residence. 
(b) In the event that they are permanently resident in the territory of a Member State other than Belgium, the persons concerned shall be entitled to the benefits in kind provided for under the legislation of the Member State of permanent residence provided that they pay the relevant Belgian institution the appropriate additional contribution provided for under Belgian regulations. 
2. For the application of the provisions of Chapters 7 and 8 of Title III of the Regulation by the competent Belgian institution, a child shall be considered to have been brought up in the Member State in whose territory he resides. 
3. For the purposes of Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, periods of old-age insurance completed under Belgian legislation before 1 January 1945 shall also be considered as periods of insurance completed under the Belgian legislation on the general invalidity scheme and the mariners' scheme. 
4. In applying Article 40 (3) (a) (ii), account shall only be taken of periods during which the employed or self-employed person was incapable of work within the meaning of Belgian legislation. 
5. For the purposes of Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, periods of old-age insurance completed by self-employed persons under Belgian legislation, prior to the entry into force of the legislation on the incapacity for work of self-employed persons, shall be considered as periods completed under the latter legislation. 
6. In order to establish whether the requirements imposed by Belgian legislation for entitlement to unemployment benefits are fulfilled, account shall be taken only of days of paid employment; however, account shall be taken of days accepted as equivalent within the meaning of the said legislation only in so far as the days worked which preceded them were days of paid employment. 
7. Pursuant to Articles 72 and 79 (1) (a) of the Regulation, account shall be taken of periods of employment and/or periods of insurance completed under the legislation of another Member State where entitlement to benefit under Belgian legislation is subject to the condition that, for a specified previous period, the qualifying conditions for family benefits in the framework of the scheme for employment persons have been met. 
8. For the purposes of applying Article 14a (2), (3) and (4), 14c (a) and 14d of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, business revenues in the reference year which serve as a basis for determining the contributions due by virtue of the social arrangements for self-employed persons shall be calculated using the mean annual rate for the year during which this income was received. 
The rate of conversion is the annual mean of the conversion rates published in the Official Journal of the European Communities pursuant to Article 107 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 547/72. 
9. In the calculation of the theoretical amount of an invalidity pension, as referred to in Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, the competent Belgian institution shall take as its basis the income received in the profession last exercised by the person concerned. 
10. Any employed person or self-employed person who is no longer insured in Belgium under the sickness and invalidity insurance legislation - which also makes the grant of the right to benefits conditional upon the person concerned being insured when the risk materializes - shall be considered to be still insured when the risk materializes, for the purposes of implementation of Chapter 3 of Title III of the Regulation, if he is insured for the same risks under the legislation of another Member State. 
11. If the person concerned is entitled to a Belgian invalidity benefit under Article 45 of the Regulation, that benefit shall be awarded in accordance with the rules laid down by Article 46 (2) of the Regulation: 
(a) In accordance with the provisions laid down by the Law of 9 August 1963 on the establishment and organization of a compulsory sickness and invalidity insurance scheme if, at the time of occurrence of the incapacity for work, he was insured for the same risk under the legislation of another Member State as an employed person within the meaning of Article 1 (a) of the Regulation. 
(b) In accordance with the provisions laid down by the Royal Decree of 20 July 1971 on the establishment of an insurance scheme against incapacity for work for self-employed persons if, at the time of occurrence of the incapacity for work, he was a self-employed person within the meaning of Article 1 (a) of the Regulation. 
B. DENMARK 
1. Completed periods of insurance, employment or self-employment in a Member State other than Denmark shall be taken into account for admission to membership of an approved unemployment insurance fund in the same way as if they were periods of employment or self-employment completed in Denmark. 
2. Employed or self-employed persons, pension claimants and pensioners, and members of their families referred to in Articles 19, 22 (1) and (3), 25 (1) and (3), 26 (1), 28a, 29 and 31 of the Regulation, resident or staying in Denmark, shall be entitled to benefits in kind on the same terms as those laid down by Danish legislation for persons who, under the law on the public health service (lov om offentlig sygesikring), belong to class 1. 
3. (a) The provisions of Danish legislation on social pensions that stipulate that the right to pension is subject to the claimant being resident in Denmark are not applicable to employed or self-employed persons or their survivors who reside in the territory of a Member State other than Denmark. 
(b) For the purpose of calculating the pension, periods of employment or self-employment completed in Denmark by a frontier worker or a seasonal worker are regarded as periods of residence completed in Denmark by the surviving spouse in so far as the surviving spouse was during these periods, linked to the frontier worker or seasonal worker by marriage without separation from bed and board or de facto separation on grounds of incompatibility and provided that during these periods the spouse resided in the territory of another Member State. 
(c) For the purpose of calculating the pension, periods of employment or self-employment completed in Denmark before 1 January 1984 by an employed or self-employed person other than a frontier worker or seasonal worker shall be regarded as periods of residence completed in Denmark by the surviving spouse, in so far as the surviving spouse was during these periods, linked to the employed or self-employed person by marriage without separation from bed and board or de facto separation on grounds of incompatibility, and provided that during these periods the spouse resided in the territory of another Member State. 
(d) Periods to be taken into account under the terms of (b) and (c) shall not be taken into consideration if they coincide with the periods taken into account for the calculation of the pension due to the person concerned under the legislation on compulsory insurance of another Member State or with the periods during which the person concerned received a pension under such legislation. 
These periods shall, however, be taken into consideration if the annual amount of the said pension is less than half the basic amount of the social pension. 
4. The terms of the Regulation shall be without prejudice to the provisional rules under the Danish laws of 7 June 1972 on the pension rights of Danish nationals having their effective residence in Denmark for a specified period immediately preceding the date of the claim. However, a pension shall be granted under those conditions laid down for Danish nationals to nationals of other Member States having their effective residence in Denmark during the year immediately preceding the date of claim. 
5. (a) The periods during which a frontier worker residing within the territory of a Member State other than Denmark has pursued his professional or trade activity in Denmark are to be considered as periods of residence for the purposes of Danish legislation. The same shall apply to periods in which a frontier worker is posted to or provides services in a Member State other than Denmark. 
(b) The periods during which a seasonal worker residing within the territory of a Member State other than Denmark has pursued his occupation in Denmark are to be considered as periods of residence for the purposes of Danish legislation. The same applies to periods during which a seasonal worker is posted to the territory of a Member State other than Denmark. 
6. In order to determine whether or not conditions for entitlement to daily allowances in the case of sickness or maternity laid down by the law of 20 December 1989 on daily allowances in the case of sickness or maternity have been satisfied, where the person concerned is no longer subject to Danish legislation during the periods of reference fixed by the abovementioned law: 
(a) account shall be taken of the insurance periods and employment periods fulfilled under the legislation of a Member State other than Denmark during the abovementioned reference periods during which the person concerned was not covered by Danish legislation, as if they are periods completed under the latter legislation, 
and 
(b) during the periods taken into account, a self-employed person or an employed person (in cases where, for the latter, remuneration cannot serve as a basis for calculating the daily allowances) are regarded as having had an average remuneration or salary of an amount equal to that on the basis of which the cash allowances are calculated in respect of the periods completed under Danish legislation during the reference periods. 
7. Article 46a (3) (d) and Article 46c (1) and (3) of the Regulation and Article 7 (1) of the implementing Regulation shall not be applied to pensions awarded in the context of Danish legislation. 
8. For the purpose of applying Article 67 of the Regulation, unemployment benefits for self-employed persons insured in Denmark shall be calculated in accordance with Danish legislation. 
9. Where the beneficiary of a Danish retirement pension or early retirement pension is also entitled to a survivor's pension from another Member State, these pensions, for the implementation of Danish legislation shall be regarded as benefits of the same kind within the meaning of Article 46a (1) of the Regulation, subject to the condition, however, that the person whose periods of insurance or of residence serve as the basis for the calculation of the survivor's pension has also completed periods of residence in Denmark. 
C. GERMANY 
1. The provisions of Article 10 of the Regulation are without prejudice to the provisions under which accidents (and occupational diseases) occurring outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, and periods completed outside that territory, do not give grounds for benefits, or do so only subject to certain conditions, when the persons concerned are resident outside the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
2. (a) The standard period for allocation (pauschale Anrechnungszeit) shall be determined exclusively with reference to German periods. 
(b) For the purpose of taking into account German pension periods for miners' pension insurance, only German legislation shall apply. 
(c) For the purpose of taking into account German substitute periods (Ersatzzeiten), only German legislation shall apply. 
3. If application of the Regulation or later regulations on social security places an exceptional burden on certain sickness insurance institutions, that shall be compensated for in full or in part. The Federal Association of Local General Funds, as liaison body (sickness insurance), shall take decisions regarding such compensation by common agreement with the other central federations of sickness funds. The resources necessary to implement the compensation shall be provided by taxes levied on all the sickness insurance institutions in proportion to the average number of members over the previous years, with the exception of retired members. 
4. Article 7 of Book VI of the Social Code shall apply to nationals of the other Member States and to stateless persons and refugees residing in the territory of other Member States, according to the following rules. 
If the general conditions are fulfilled, voluntary contributions may be paid to the German pension insurance scheme: 
(a) if the person concerned is domiciled or resident in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany; 
(b) if the party concerned is domiciled or resident in the territory of another Member State and has at some point previously contributed, either compulsorily or voluntarily, to the German pension insurance scheme; 
(c) if the party concerned is a national of another Member State, is domiciled or resident in the territory of a third Member State, has contributed for at least 60 months to the German pension insurance scheme or was eligible for voluntary insurance pursuant to Article 232 of Book VI of the Social Code, and is not compulsorily or voluntarily insured under the legislation of another Member State.

8. . . . . . . 
9. Where the costs of benefits in kind which are granted by German institutions of the place of residence to pensioners or members of their family who are insured with competent institutions of other Member States must be refunded on the basis of monthly lump sums, such costs shall, for the purpose of financial equalization among German institutions of sickness insurance for pensioners, be treated as expenditure on the German sickness insurance scheme for pensioners. The lump sums refunded to the German institutions of the place of residence by the competent institutions of other Member States shall be regarded as receipts which must be taken into account in the aforementioned financial equalization. 
10. In the case of self-employed persons, the award of unemployment assistance (Arbeitslosenhilfe) shall be conditional on the person concerned having, before reporting himself unemployed, worked for at least a year mainly as a self-employed person in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany, and not having simply left that work temporarily. 
11. Periods of insurance completed under the legislation of another Member State, under a special old-age insurance scheme for farmers or, if no such scheme exists, as farmers under the general scheme, shall be taken into account to satisfy the conditions of minimum length of insurance required for the person to be subject to contribution within the meaning of Article 27 of the law on old-age insurance for farmers (Gesetz über die Alterssicherung der Landwirte - GAL), always providing that: 
(a) the declaration on which the obligation to pay contributions is based shall have been lodged within the prescribed time, 
and 
(b) before lodging the declaration, the person concerned shall have been last subject to contribution under the old-age insurance scheme for farmers in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. 
12. Periods of compulsory insurance completed under the legislation of another Member State, either under a special scheme for craftsmen, or, if no such scheme exists, under a special scheme for self-employed persons or under the general scheme, shall be taken into account to justify the existence of the 18 years of compulsory contributions required for exemption from compulsory affiliation to pension insurance for self-employed craftsmen. 
13.

When, under the legislation of Finland, an increment is payable by an institution in Finland because of a delay in processing a claim for a benefit, a claim submitted to an institution of another Member State shall, for the purpose of applying the provisions of the Finnish legislation relating to such increment, be considered to have been presented on the date when that claim, along with all necessary enclosures, reaches the competent institution in Finland. 
N. SWEDEN 
1. When applying Article 18 (1) for the purpose of establishing a person's entitlement to a parental benefit period of insurance completed under the legislation of another Member State than Sweden shall be considered to be based on the same average earnings as the Swedish periods of insurance to which they are aggregated. 
2. The provisions of the Regulation on the aggregation of insurance or residence periods shall not apply to the transitional rules of the Swedish legislation on the right to a more favourable calculation of basic pensions for persons residing in Sweden for a specified period preceding the date of the claim. 
3. For the purpose of establishing the entitlement to an invalidity or survivor's pension partly based on future assumed insurance periods a person shall be considered to meet the insurance and income requirements of the Swedish legislation when covered as an employed or self-employed person by an insurance or residence scheme of another Member State. 
4. Years of care of small children shall, according to prescribed conditions of the Swedish legislation, be considered as insurance periods for supplementary pension purposes even when the child and the person concerned are residing in another Member State, provided that the person taking care of the child is on parental leave under the provisions of the Law on Right to Leave for Child Rearing. 
O. UNITED KINGDOM 
1. When a person who is normally resident in Gibraltar, or who has been required, since he last arrived in Gibraltar, to pay contributions under the legislation of Gibraltar as an employed person, applies, as a result of incapacity to work, maternity or unemployment, for exemption from the payment of contributions over a certain period, and asks for contributions for that period to be credited to him, any period during which that person has been working in the territory of a Member State other than the United Kingdom shall, for the purposes of his application, be regarded as a period during which he has been employed in Gibraltar and for which he has paid contributions as an employed person in accordance with the legislation of Gibraltar. 
2. Where, in accordance with United Kingdom legislation, a person may be entitled to a retirement pension if: 
(a) the contributions of a former spouse are taken into account as if they were that person's own contributions, 
or 
(b) the relevant contribution conditions are satisfied by that person's spouse or former spouse, 
then provided, in each case, that the spouse or former spouse is or was an employed or self-employed person who had been subject to the legislation of two or more Member States, the provisions of Chapter 3 of Title III of the Regulation shall apply in order to determine entitlement under United Kingdom legislation. In this case, references in the said Chapter 3 to 'periods of insurance` shall be construed as references to periods of insurance completed by: 
(i) a spouse or former spouse, where a claim is made by a married woman, a man who is widowed or a person whose marriage has terminated otherwise than by the death of the spouse, 
or 
(ii) a former spouse, where a claim is made by a widow, who was not in receipt of a survivor's benefit immediately before reaching pensionable age or who is only in receipt of an age-related widow's pension calculated pursuant to Article 46 (2) of the Regulation. 
3. (a) If unemployed benefit provided under United Kingdom legislation is paid to a person pursuant to Article 71 (1) (a) (ii) or (b) (ii) of the Regulation, then for the purpose of satisfying the conditions imposed by United Kingdom legislation in relation to child benefit concerning a period of presence within Great Britain or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland, periods of insurance, employment or self-employment completed by that person under the legislation of another Member State shall be regarded as periods of presence in Great Britain or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland. 
(b) If, pursuant to Title II of the Regulation, excluding Article 13 (2) (f), United Kingdom legislation is applicable in respect of an employment or self-employed person who does not satisfy the condition imposed by United Kingdom legislation in relation to child benefit concerning: 
(i) presence within Great Britain or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland, he shall be regarded, for the purpose of satisfying such condition, as being so present; 
(ii) a period of presence within Great Britain, or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland, periods of insurance, employment or self-employment completed by the said worker under the legislation of another Member State shall, for the purpose of satisfying such conditions, be regarded as periods of presence in Great Britain or, as the case may be, Northern Ireland. 
(c) In respect of claims to family allowances under the legislation of Gibraltar the foregoing provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall apply by analogy. 
4. The widow's payment provided under United Kingdom legislation shall be treated, for the purposes of Chapter 3 of the Regulation, as a survivor's pension. 
5. For the purposes of applying Article 10a (2) to the provisions governing entitlement to attendance allowance, invalid care allowance and disability living allowance, a period of employment, self-employment or residence completed in the territory of a Member State other than the United Kingdom shall be taken into account insofar as is necessary to satisfy conditions as to presence in the United Kingdom, prior to the day on which entitlement to the benefit in question first arises. 
6. In the event of an employed person subject to United Kingdom legislation being the victim of an accident after leaving the territory of one Member State while travelling, in the course of this employment, to the territory of another Member State, but before arriving there, his entitlement to benefits in respect of that accident shall be established: 
(a) as if the accident had occurred within the territory of the United Kingdom, 
and 
(b) for the purpose of determining whether he was an employed earner under the legislation of Great Britain or the legislation of Northern Ireland or an employed person under the legislation of Gibraltar, by disregarding his absence from those territories. 
7. The Regulation does not apply to those provisions of United Kingdom legislation which are intended to bring into force any social security agreement concluded between the United Kingdom and a third State. 
8. For the purposes of Chapter 3 of Title III of the Regulation no account shall be taken of graduated contributions paid by the insured person under United Kingdom legislation or of graduated retirement benefits payable under that legislation. The amount of the graduated benefits shall be added to the amount of the benefit due under the United Kingdom legislation as determined in accordance with the said chapter. The total of these two amounts shall constitute the benefit actually due to the person concerned. 
9. . . . . . . 
10. For the purpose of applying the Non-Contributory Social Insurance Benefit and Unemployment Insurance Ordinance (Gibraltar), any person to whom this Regulation is applicable shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident in Gibraltar if he resides in a Member State. 
11. For the purpose of Articles 10, 27, 28, 28a, 29, 30 and 31 of the Regulation, the attendance allowance granted to an employed or self-employed person under United Kingdom legislation shall be considered as an invalidity benefit. 
12. For the purpose of Article 10 (1) of the Regulation any beneficiary under United Kingdom legislation who is staying in the territory of another Member State shall, during that stay, be considered as if he resided in the territory of that other Member State. 
13.1 For the purpose of calculating an earnings factor with a view to determining the right to benefits under United Kingdom legislation, subject to point 15, each week during which an employed or self-employed person has been subject to the legislation of another Member State and which commenced during the relevant income tax year within the meaning of United Kingdom, legislation shall be taken into account in the following way: 
(a) Periods between 6 April 1975 and 5 April 1987: 
(i) for each week of insurance, employment or residence as an employed person, the person concerned shall be deemed to have paid contributions as an employed earner on the basis of earnings equivalent to two-thirds of that year's upper earnings limit; 
(ii) for each week of insurance, self-employment or residence as a self-employed person the person concerned shall be deemed to have paid class 2 contributions as a self-employed earner. 
(b) Periods from 6 April 1987 onwards: 
(i) for each week of insurance, employment or residence as an employed person, the person concerned shall be deemed to have received, and paid contributions as an employed earner, for, weekly earnings equivalent to two-thirds of that week's upper earnings limit; 
(ii) for each week of insurance, self-employment or residence as a self-employed person the person concerned shall be deemed to have paid class 2 contibutions as a self-employed earner. 
(c) For each full week during which he has completed a period treated as a period of insurance, employment, self-employment or residence, the person concerned shall be deemed to have had contributions or earnings credited to him as appropriate, but only to the extent required to bring his total earnings factor for that tax year to the level required to make that tax year a reckonable year within the meaning of the United Kingdom legislation governing the crediting of contributions or earnings. 
13.2. For the purposes of Article 46 (2) (b) of the Regulation, where: 
(a) if in any income tax year starting on or after 6 April 1975, an employed person has completed periods of insurance, employment or residence exclusively in a Member State other than the United Kingdom, and the application of paragraph 1 (a) (i) or paragraph 1 (b) (i) results in that year being counted as a qualifying year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation for the purposes of Article 46 (2) (a) of the Regulation, he shall be deemed to have been insured for 52 weeks in that year in that other Member State: 
(b) any income tax year starting on or after 6 April 1975 does not count as a qualifying year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation for the purposes of Article 46 (2) (a) of the Regulation, any periods of insurance, employment or residence completed in that year shall be disregarded. 
13.3. For the purpose of converting an earnings factor into periods of insurance the earnings factor achieved in the relevant income tax year within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation shall be divided by that year's lower earnings limit. The result shall be expressed as a whole number, any remaining fraction being ignored. The figure so calculated shall be treated as representing the number of weeks of insurance completed under United Kingdom legislation during that year provided that such figure shall not exceed the number of weeks during which in that year that person was subject to that legislation. 
14. In applying Article 40 (3) (a) (ii), account shall only be taken of periods during which the employed or self-employed person was incapable of work within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation. 
15.1. For the purpose of calculating, under Article 46 (2) (a) of the Regulation, the theoretical amount of that part of the pension which consists of an additional component under United Kingdom legislation: 
(a) the expression 'earnings, contributions or increases` in Article 47 (1) (b) of the Regulation shall be construed as meaning surpluses in earnings factors as defined in the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 or, as the case may be, the Social Security Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1975; 
(b) an average of the surpluses in earnings factor shall be calculated in accordance with Article 47 (1) (b) of the Regulation as construed in subparagraph (a) above by dividing the aggregated surpluses recorded under United Kingdom legislation by the number of income tax years within the meaning of United Kingdom legislation (including part income tax years) completed under that legislation since 6 April 1978 which occur within the relevant period of insurance. 
15.2. The expression 'periods of insurance or residence ` in Article 46 (2) of the Regulation shall be construed, for the purpose of assessing the amount of that part of the pension which consists of an additional component under United Kingdom legislation, as meaning periods of insurance or residence which have been completed since 6 April 1978. 
16. An unemployed person returning to the United Kingdom after the end of the period of three months during which he continued to receive benefits under the legislation of the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 69 (1) of the Regulation shall continue to be entitled to unemployment benefits by way of derogation from Article 69 (2) if he satisfies the conditions in the aforementioned legislation. 
17. For the purposes of entitlement to severe disablement allowance any employed or self-employed person who is, or has been, subject to United Kingdom legislation in accordance with Title II of the Regulation, excluding Article 13 (2) (f): 
(a) shall, for the entire period during which he was employed or self-employed and subject to United Kingdom legislation whilst present or resident in another Member State, be treated as having been present or resident in the United Kingdom; 
(b) shall be entitled to have periods of insurance as an employed or self-employed person completed in the territory and under the legislation of another Member State treated as periods of presence or residence in the United Kingdom. 
18. A period of subjection to United Kingdom legislation in accordance with Article 13 (2) (f) of the Regulation may not: 
(i) be taken into account under that provision as a period of subjection to United Kingdom legislation for the purposes of Title III of the Regulation, 
nor 
(ii) make the United Kingdom the competent State for the provision of the benefits provided for in Article 18, 38 or 39 (1) of the Regulation. 
19. Subject to any conventions concluded with individual Member States, for the purposes of Article 13 (2) (f) of the Regulation and Article 10b of the Implementing Regulation, United Kingdom legislation shall cease to apply at the end of the day on the latest of the following three days to any person previously subject to United Kingdom legislation as an employed or self-employed person: 
(a) the day on which residence is transferred to the other Member State referred to in Article 13 (2) (f); 
(b) the day of cessation of the employment or self-employment, whether permanent or temporary, during which that person was subject to United Kingdom legislation; 
(c) the last day of any period of receipt of United Kingdom sickness or maternity benefit (including benefits in kind for which the United Kingdom is the competent State) or unemployment benefit which 
(i) began before the date of transfer of residence to another Member State or, if later, 
(ii) immediately followed employment or self-employment in another Member State while that person was subject to United Kingdom legislation. 
20. The fact that a person has become subject to the legislation of another Member State in accordance with Article 13 (2) (f) of the Regulation, Article 10b of the Implementing Regulation and point 19 above, shall not prevent: 
(a) the application to him by the United Kingdom as the competent State of the provisions relating to employed or self-employed persons of Title III, Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, Section 1 or Article 40 (2) of the Regulation if he remains and employed or self-employed person for those purposes and was last so insured under the legislation of the United Kingdom; 
(b) his treatment as an employed or self-employed person for the purposes of Chapter 7 and 8 of Title III of the Regulation or Articles 10 or 10a of the Implementing Regulation, provided United Kingdom benefit under Chapter 1 of Title III is payable to him in accordance with paragraph (a).

(a) To periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of one Member State shall be added periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of any other Member State, to the extent that this is necessary to have recourse thereto in order to supplement periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of the first Member State for the purpose of acquiring, retaining, or recovering the rights to benefits, provided that such periods of insurance or residence do not overlap. Where benefits in respect of invalidity, old age or death (pensions) are to be awarded by the institutions of two or more Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 46 (2) of the Regulation, each of the institutions concerned shall effect a separate aggregation, by taking into account the whole of the periods of insurance or residence completed by the employed or self-employed person under the legislations of all the Member States to which he has been subject, without prejudice, where appropriate, to the provisions of Article 45 (2) and (3) and Article 47 (1) (a) of the Regulation. Nevertheless, in the cases referred to in Article 14c (b) of the Regulation, the above mentioned institutions shall likewise take account, for the award of benefits, of the periods of insurance or of residence completed under an obligatory insurance scheme under the legislation of the two Member States in question which overlap each other.

(e) Where it is not possible to determine accurately the period of time in which certain periods of insurance or residence were completed under the legislation of one Member State, such periods shall be presumed not to overlap with periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of another Member State and shall, where advantageous, be taken into account. 
(f) Where under the legislation of one Member State certain periods of insurance or residence are taken into account only if they have been completed within a specified time limit, the institution which administers such legislation shall: 
(i) only take into account periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of another Member State if they were completed within the said time limit, 
(ii) extend such a time limit for the duration of periods of insurance or residence completed wholly or partly within the said time limit under the legislation of another Member State, where the periods of insurance or residence involved under the legislation of the second Member State give rise only to the suspension of the time limit within which the periods of insurance or residence must be completed. 
2. Periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of a Member State to which the Regulation does not apply, but which are taken into account under the legislation of that Member State to which the Regulation does apply, shall be considered as periods of insurance or residence to be taken into account for the purposes of aggregation. 
3. When periods of insurance completed under the legislation of one Member State are expressed in units different from those used by the legislation of another Member State, the conversion necessary for the purposes of aggregation shall be carried out according to the following rules: 
(a) Where the person concerned is an employed person who has been subject to a six-day week or if he is self-employed:

(v) for the conversion of weeks into months and vice versa the weeks and months shall be converted into days; 
(vi) the application of the preceding rules shall not have the effect of producing, for the sum total of the periods of insurance completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding 312 days or 52 weeks or 12 months or four quarters. 
(b) If the person concerned is an employed person who has been subject to a five-day week: 
(i) one day shall be equivalent to nine hours and vice versa; 
(ii) five days shall be equivalent to one week and vice versa; 
(iii) 22 days shall be equivalent to one month and vice versa; 
(iv) three months or 13 weeks or 66 days shall be equivalent to one quarter and vice versa; 
(v) for the conversion of weeks into months and vice versa, the weeks and the months shall be converted into days; 
(vi) the application of the preceding rules shall not have the effect of producing, for the sum total of the periods of insurance completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding 264 days or 52 weeks or 12 months for four quarters. 
(c) If the person concerned is an employed person who has been subject to a seven-day week:

(v) for the conversion of weeks into months and vice versa, the weeks and the months shall be converted into days; 
(vi) the application of the preceding rules shall not have the effect of producing, for the sum total of the periods of insurance completed during one calendar year, a total exceeding 360 days or 52 weeks or 12 months for four quarters.

Article 95 (14) 
Refund of benefits in kind provided under sickness and maternity insurance to pensioners and to members of their families who are not resident in a Member State under whose legislation they receive a pension and are entitled to benefits 
1. The amount of the benefits in kind provided pursuant to Articles 28 (1) and 28a of the Regulation shall be refunded by the competent institutions to the institutions which provided the said benefits, on the basis of a lump sum which is as close as possible to the actual expenditure incurred. 
2. The lump sum shall be determined by multiplying the annual average per capita cost by the average annual number of pensioners and members of their families to be taken into account and by reducing the resultant amount by 20 %. 
3. The factors necessary for the calculation of the said lump sum shall be determined according to the following rules: 
(a) the average annual per capita cost shall be obtained for each Member State, by dividing the annual costs of the total benefits in kind provided by the institutions of that Member State to all pensioners whose pensions are payable under the legislation of that Member State, under the social security schemes to be taken into consideration and to members of their families, by the average annual number of pensioners and members of their families; the social security schemes to be taken into consideration for that purpose are specified in Annex 9; 
(b) in dealings between the institutions of two Member States, the average annual number of pensioners and members of their families to be taken into account shall be equal to the average annual number of pensioners and members of their families referred to in Article 28 (2) of the Regulation who, whilst residing in the territory of one of the Member States, are entitled to benefits in kind chargeable to the institution of the other Member State. 
4. The number of pensioners and members of their families to be taken into account in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) shall be determined by means of a list kept for that purpose by the institution of the place of residence, based upon documentary evidence supplied by the competent institution of the rights of the persons concerned. In the event of any dispute, the observations of the institutions involved shall be submitted to the Audit Board provided for in Article 101 (3) of the implementing Regulation. 
5. The Administrative Commission shall lay down the methods and procedures for determining the calculation factors referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4. 
6. Two or more Member States or the competent authorities of those Member States may, after receiving the opinion of the Administrative Commission, agree to introduce other methods of assessing the amounts to be refunded.
