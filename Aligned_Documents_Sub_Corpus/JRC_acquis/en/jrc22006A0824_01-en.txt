LETTER No 1 
Letter from the European Community 
Brussels, 24 April 2006 
Sir, 
I have the honour to refer to meetings related to technical adaptations which have been held in accordance with Article 29(2) of the Agreement on Trade in Wines of the Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part, of 18 November 2002, which provides that the Contracting Parties may, by mutual consent, amend Appendices to this Agreement. 
Due to the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004, and in light of the conclusions of the first Joint Committee of the Agreement on Trade in Wines that took place in Santiago de Chile on 8 January 2004, the conclusions of the Association Committee meeting that was held in December 2004 in Santiago de Chile and the conclusions of the second Joint Committee meeting of the Agreement on Trade in Wines and first Joint Committee meeting of the Agreement on Trade in Spirit Drinks and Aromatised Drinks of the EU-Chile Association Agreement of 13- 14 June 2005, both held in Madrid, it is necessary to make technical adaptations to Appendices I (Geographical Indications of Wines Originating in the Community); II (Geographical indications of Wines Originating in Chile); III (List of Traditional Expressions of the Community) and IV (Complementary Quality Mentions of Chile) of the Agreement on Trade in Wines. 
I have therefore the honour to propose that Appendices I, II, III and IV to the Agreement on Trade in Wines be replaced by the Appendices attached hereto, with effect as of today's date. 
I should be obliged if you would confirm that your Government is in agreement with the content of this letter. 
Please accept, Sir, the assurance of my highest consideration. 
On behalf of the European Community
