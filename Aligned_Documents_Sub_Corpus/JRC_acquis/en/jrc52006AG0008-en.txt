Common Position (EC) No 8/2006 of 23 Febrruary 2006 adopted by the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, with a view to adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Council Directive 82/714/EEC 
Common Position (EC) No 8/2006 
adopted by the Council on 23 February 2006 
with a view to adopting a Directive 2006/…/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of … laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and repealing Council Directive 82/714/EEC 
(2006/C 166 E/01) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee [1], 
Following consultation of the Committee of the Regions, 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Council Directive 82/714/EEC of 4 October 1982 laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels [3] introduced harmonised conditions for issuing technical certificates for inland waterway vessels in all Member States, albeit excluding operations on the Rhine. Nevertheless, at European level, various technical requirements for inland waterway vessels have remained in force. Up to now, the coexistence of various international and national regulations has obstructed efforts to ensure mutual recognition of national navigation certificates without the need for an additional inspection of foreign vessels. Furthermore, the standards contained in Directive 82/714/EEC, in part, no longer reflect current technological developments. 
(2) Essentially, the technical requirements set out in the annexes to Directive 82/714/EEC incorporate the provisions laid down in the Rhine vessel inspection Regulation, in the version approved by the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR) in 1982. The conditions and technical requirements for issuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation have been revised regularly since then and are recognised as reflecting current technological developments. For competition and safety reasons it is desirable, specifically in the interests of promoting harmonisation at European level, to adopt the scope and content of such technical requirements for the whole of the Community's inland waterway network. Account should be taken in this regard of the changes that have occurred in that network. 
(3) Community inland navigation certificates attesting the full compliance of vessels with the aforementioned revised technical requirements should be valid on all Community inland waterways. 
(4) It is desirable to ensure a greater degree of harmonisation between the conditions for the issuing of supplementary Community inland navigation certificates by Member States for operations on Zone 1 and 2 waterways (estuaries), as well as for operations on Zone 4 waterways. 
(5) In the interests of passenger transport safety, it is desirable that the scope of Directive 82/714/EEC be extended to include passenger vessels designed to carry more than 12 passengers, along the lines of the Rhine vessel inspection Regulation. 
(6) In the interests of safety, harmonisation of standards should be at a high level and should be achieved in such a way so as not to result in any reduction in safety standards on any Community inland waterway. 
(7) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional regime for vessels in service not yet carrying a Community inland navigation certificate when subjected to a first technical inspection under the revised technical requirements established by this Directive. 
(8) It is appropriate, within certain limits and according to the category of vessel concerned, to determine the period of validity of Community inland navigation certificates in each specific case. 
(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [4]. 
(10) It is necessary that the measures provided for in Council Directive 76/135/EEC of 20 January 1976 on reciprocal recognition of navigability licenses for inland waterway vessels [5] remain in force for those vessels not covered by this Directive. 
(11) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making [6], Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public. 
(12) Directive 82/714/EEC should be repealed, 
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

PART II 
CHAPTER 3 
SHIPBUILDING REQUIREMENTS 
Article 3.01 
Basic requirements 
Vessels shall be built in accordance with good shipbuilding practice. 
Article 3.02 
Strength and stability 
1. The hull shall be sufficiently strong to withstand all of the stresses to which it is normally subjected. 
(a) In the case of newly built vessels or major conversions affecting vessel strength, adequate strength shall be demonstrated by presenting design calculation proof. That proof is not required where a classification certificate or a declaration from an approved classification society is submitted. 
(b) Where there is an inspection as referred to in Article 2.09 the minimum thicknesses of the bottom, bilge and side plates shall be checked in accordance with the following conditions: 
For vessels made from steel minimum thickness tmin is given by the highest of the values resulting from the following formulae: 
1. for vessels that are longer than 40 m: tmin = f · b · c (2,3 + 0,04 L) (mm); 
for vessels not more than 40 m in length: tmin = f · b · c (1,5 + 0,06 L) (mm), however, not less than 3.00 mm 
2. tmin= 0,005 · aTmm 
where: 
a = frame spacing (mm); 
f f = 1 for a ≤ 500 mm 
f = 1 + 0,0013 (a — 500) for a %gt% 500 mm 
b b = 1,0 for bottom plates and side plates 
b = 1,25 for bilge plates. 
f = 1 may be taken for the frame spacing when calculating the minimum thickness of the side plates. However, the minimum thickness of the bilge plates may in no case be less than that of the bottom plates and side plates. 
c c = 0,95 for vessels with double bottom and wing void, where the partition between wing void and hold is located vertically in line with the coaming 
c = 1,0 for all other types of structure. 
(c) In longitudinally framed vessels with double bottom and wing voids, the minimum value calculated for the plate thickness in accordance with the formulae in paragraph (b) may be reduced to a calculated value certified by an approved classification society for sufficient hull strength (longitudinal, lateral and local strength). 
Plates shall be renewed if bottom, bilge or side plates are below the permissible value laid down in this way. 
The minimum values calculated in accordance with the method are limit values taking account of normal, uniform wear, and provided that shipbuilding steel is used and that the internal structural components such as frames, frame floor, main longitudinal and transverse structural members are in a good state and that the hull shows no indication of any overloading of the longitudinal strength. 
As soon as these values are no longer achieved, the plates in question shall be repaired or replaced. However, lesser thicknesses, of not more than 10 % reduction from calculated values, are acceptable locally for small areas. 
2. Where a material other than steel is used for the construction of the hull, it shall be proved by calculation that the hull strength (longitudinal, lateral and local strength) equals at least the strength that would result from the use of steel under the assumption of minimum thickness in accordance with paragraph1. If a certificate of class or a declaration issued by a recognised classification society is presented, a proof by calculation may be dispensed with. 
3. The stability of vessels shall correspond to their intended use. 
Article 3.03 
Hull 
1. Bulkheads rising up to the deck or, where there is no deck, up to the gunwale, shall be installed at the following points: 
(a) A collision bulkhead at a suitable distance from the bow in such a way that the buoyancy of the laden vessel is ensured, with a residual safety clearance of 100 mm if water enters the watertight compartment ahead of the collision bulkhead. 
As a general rule, the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 shall be considered to have been met if the collision bulkhead has been installed at a distance of between 0,04 L and 0,04 L + 2 m measured from the forward perpendicular in the plane of maximum draught. 
If this distance exceeds 0,04 L + 2 m, the requirement set out in paragraph 1 shall be proved by calculation. 
The distance may be reduced to 0,03 L. In that case the requirement referred to in paragraph 1 shall be proved by calculation on the assumption that the compartment ahead of the collision bulkhead and those adjacent have all been filled with water. 
(b) An aft-peak bulkhead at a suitable distance from the stern where the vessel length L exceeds 25 m. 
2. No accommodation or installations needed for vessel safety or operation may be located ahead of the plane of the collision bulkhead. This requirement shall not apply to anchor gear. 
3. The accommodation, engine rooms and boiler rooms, and the workspaces forming part of these shall be separated from the holds by watertight transverse bulkheads that extend up to the deck. 
4. The accommodation shall be separated from engine rooms, boiler rooms and holds in a gastight manner and shall be directly accessible from the deck. If no such access has been provided an emergency exit shall also lead directly to the deck. 
5. The bulkheads specified in paragraphs 1 and 3 and the separation of areas specified in paragraph 4 shall not contain any openings. 
However, doors in the aft-peak bulkhead and penetrations, in particular for shafts and pipework, shall be permitted where they are so designed that the effectiveness of those bulkheads and of the separation of areas is not impaired. Doors in the aft-peak bulkhead shall be permitted only if it can be determined by remote monitoring in the wheelhouse whether they are open or closed and shall bear the following readily legible instruction on both sides: 
"Door to be closed immediately after use". 
6. The water inlets and discharges, and the pipework connected to these, shall be such that no unintentional ingress of water into the vessel is possible. 
7. The foresections of vessels shall be built in such a way that the anchors neither wholly nor partly protrude beyond the side plating. 
Article 3.04 
Engine and boiler rooms, bunkers 
1. Engine or boiler rooms shall be arranged in such a way that the equipment therein can be operated, serviced and maintained easily and safely. 
2. The liquid-fuel or lubricant bunkers and passenger areas and accommodation may not have any common surfaces which are under the static pressure of the liquid when in normal service. 
3. Engine room, boiler room and bunker bulkheads, ceilings and doors shall be made of steel or another equivalent non-combustible material. 
Insulation material used in engine rooms shall be protected against the intrusion of fuel and fuel vapours. 
All openings in walls, ceilings, and doors of engine rooms, boiler rooms, and bunker rooms shall be such that they can be closed from outside the room. The locking devices shall be made from steel or an equivalently non-combustible material. 
4. Engine and boiler rooms and other premises in which flammable or toxic gases are likely to escape shall be capable of being adequately ventilated. 
5. Companionways and ladders providing access to engine and boiler rooms and bunkers shall be firmly attached and be made of steel or another shock-resistant and non-combustible material. 
6. Engine and boiler rooms shall have two exits of which one may be an emergency exit. 
The second exit may be dispensed with if: 
(a) the total floor area (average length x average width at the level of the floor plating) of the engine or boiler room does not exceed 35 m2; and 
(b) the path between each point where servicing or maintenance operations are to be carried out and the exit, or foot of the companionway near the exit providing access to the outside, is not longer than 5 m; and 
(c) a fire extinguisher is located at the servicing point that is furthest removed from the exit door and also, by way of derogation from Article 10.03(1)(e), where the installed power of the engines does not exceed 100 kW. 
7. The maximum permissible sound pressure level in the engine rooms shall be 110 dB(A). The measuring points shall be selected as a function of the maintenance work needed during normal operation of the plant located therein.

Article 4.02 
Freeboard 
1. The freeboard of vessels with a continuous deck, without sheer and superstructures, shall be 150 mm. 
2. The freeboard of vessels with sheer and superstructures shall be calculated using the following formula: 
where: 
a is a correction coefficient that takes account of all of the superstructures involved; 
βv is a coefficient for correcting the effect of the forward sheer resulting from the presence of superstructures in the forward quarter of length L of the vessel; 
βa is a coefficient correcting the effect of the aft sheer resulting from the presence of superstructures in the aft quarter of length L of the vessel; 
Sev is the effective forward sheer in mm; 
Sea is the effective aft sheer in mm. 
3. The coefficient α is calculated using the following formula: 
where: 
lem is the effective length, in m, of a superstructure located in the median part corresponding to half of length L of the vessel; 
lev is the effective length, in m, of a superstructure in the forward quarter of vessel length L; 
lea is the effective length, in m, of a superstructure in the aft quarter of vessel length L. 
The effective length of a superstructure is calculated using the following formulae: 
where: 
l is the effective length, in m, of the superstructure involved; 
b is the width, in m, of the superstructure involved; 
B1 is the width of the vessel, in m, measured on the outside of the vertical sideplates at deck level halfway along the superstructure involved; 
h is the height, in m, of the superstructure involved. However, in the case of hatches, h is obtained by reducing the height of the coamings by half of the safety distance according to Article 4.01(1) and (2). In no case will a value exceeding 0,36 m be taken for h. 
If bB or bB1is less than 0,6 the effective length le of the superstructure will be zero. 
4. Coefficients βv and βa are calculated using the following formulae: 
βv= 1 –3 · levLβa= 1 –3 · leaL 
5. The effective aft/forward sheers Sev/Sea are calculated using the following formulae: 
Sev = Sv · p 
Sea = Sa · p 
where: 
Sv is the actual forward sheer, in mm; however Sv shall not be taken to be more than 1000 mm; 
Sa is the actual aft sheer, in mm; however Sa may not be taken to be more than 500 mm; 
p 
is a coefficient calculated using the following formula:p = 4 ·xL 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
x 
is the abscissa, measured from the extremity of the point where the sheer is 0,25 Sv or 0,25 Sa (see figure).Sv or Sa0,25 Sv or 0,25 Sa 
However, coefficient p will not be taken to be more than 1. 
6. If βa · Sea is greater than βv · Sev, the value βv · Sev of will be taken as being the value for βa · Sea. 
Article 4.03

In view of the reductions referred to in Article 4.02 the minimum freeboard shall be not less than 0 mm. 
Article 4.04 
Draught marks 
1. The plane of maximum draught shall be determined in such a way that the specifications concerning minimum freeboard and minimum safety clearance are both met. However, for safety reasons, the inspection body may lay down a greater value for the safety clearance or freeboard. The plane of maximum draught shall be determined at least for Zone 3. 
2. The plane of maximum draught shall be indicated by means of highly visible, indelible draught marks. 
3. The draught marks for Zone 3 shall consist of a rectangle 300 mm long and 40 mm deep, the base of which is horizontal and coincides with the plane of the maximum authorised draught. Any differing draught marks shall include such a rectangle. 
4. Vessels shall have at least three pairs of draught marks, of which one pair shall be centrally located and the two others located, respectively, at a distance from the bow and stern that is equal to roughly one-sixth of the length.

Longitudinal bulkheads at a distance of less than B/3 from the outer plating measured perpendicular to centre line from the shell plating at the maximum draught shall not be taken into account for calculation purposes. 
(b) For two-compartment status each bulkhead within the extent of damage will be assumed to be damaged. This means that the position of the bulkheads shall be selected in such a way as to ensure that the passenger vessel remains buoyant after flooding of two or more adjacent compartments in the longitudinal direction. 
(c) The lowest point of every non-watertight opening (e.g. doors, windows, access hatchways) shall lie at least 0,10 m above the damaged waterline. The bulkhead deck shall not be immersed in the final stage of flooding.

Lounges | 95 % | 
Engine and boiler rooms | 85 % | 
Luggage and store rooms | 75 % | 
Double bottoms, fuel bunkers, ballast and other tanks, depending on whether, according to their intended purpose, they are to be assumed to be full or empty for the vessel floating at the plane of maximum draught | 0 or 95 % | 
The calculation of free surface effect in intermediate stages of flooding shall be based on the gross surface area of the damaged compartments. 
(e) If damage of a smaller dimension than specified above produces more detrimental effects with respect to heeling or loss of metacentric height, such damage shall be taken into account for calculation purposes.

(b) beyond the heel in the equilibrium position of the intermediate stage in question, the positive part of the righting lever curve shall display a righting lever value of GZ ≥ 0,02 m before the first unprotected opening becomes immersed or a heeling angle φ of 25° is reached; 
(c) non-watertight openings shall not be immersed before the heel in the equilibrium position of the intermediate stage in question has been reached. 
11. During the final stage of flooding, the following criteria shall be met taking into account the heeling moment due to persons in accordance with paragraph 4: 
(a) the heeling angle φE shall not exceed 10°; 
(b) beyond the equilibrium position the positive part of the righting lever curve shall display a righting lever value of GZR ≥ 0,05 m with an area A ≥ 0,0065 mrad. These minimum values for stability shall be met until the immersion of the first unprotected opening or in any case before reaching a heeling angle φm ≤ 25°; 
+++++ TIFF +++++ 
(c) non-watertight openings shall not be immersed before the equilibrium position has been reached; if such openings are immersed before this point, the rooms affording access are deemed to be flooded for damaged stability calculation purposes.

Residual righting lever means the maximum difference existing between 0° and 30° of heel between the righting lever curve and the heeling lever curve. If an opening towards the inside of the vessel is reached by the water at a heeling angle less than that corresponding to the maximum difference between the lever curves, the lever corresponding to that heeling angle shall be taken into account.

CHAPTER 22a 
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO CRAFT LONGER THAN 110 M 
Article 22a.01 
Application of Part I 
In addition to the requirements set out in Article 2.03(3), the inspection body which is subsequently to issue the Community certificate shall be informed by the owner or his representative before building of craft longer than 110 m, except sea-going ships, begins (building of a new vessel or extension of a vessel already in service). That inspection body shall conduct inspections during the building stage. It may dispense with inspections during the building stage if a certificate is produced before building begins to show that an approved classification society declares that it is to supervise that building. 
Article 22a.02 
Application of Part II 
In addition to Part II, Articles 22a.03 to 22a.05 shall apply to craft that are longer than 110 m. 
Article 22a.03 
Strength 
Sufficient hull strength in accordance with Article 3.02(1)(a) (longitudinal, lateral and local strength) shall be verified by a certificate issued by an approved classification society. 
Article 22a.04 
Buoyancy and stability 
1. Paragraphs 2 to 9 shall apply to craft that are longer than 110 m, with the exception of passenger vessels. 
2. The proof of sufficient stability, including stability after damage, shall be verified for the most unfavourable loading condition. 
The basic values for the stability calculation, the vessel's lightweight and the location of the centre of gravity, shall be determined: 
- either by means of a heeling experiment, or 
- by detailed mass and moment calculation, in which case the lightweight of the vessel shall be verified by checking the draught, with a tolerance limit of +/- 5 % between the mass determined by calculation and the displacement determined by the draught readings. 
3. The proof of buoyancy after damage shall be verified for the fully laden craft. 
For this purpose, calculated proof of sufficient stability shall be established for the critical intermediate stages of flooding and for the final stage of flooding. Negative values of stability in intermediate stages of flooding may be accepted by the competent authority if sufficient stability in subsequent intermediate stages is verified. 
4. The following assumptions shall be taken into consideration for the damaged condition: 
(a) Extent of side damage: 
longitudinal extent : at least 0,10 L, 
transverse extent : 0,59 m, 
vertical extent : from the base line upwards without limit; 
(b) Extent of bottom damage: 
longitudinal extent : at least 0,10 L, 
transverse extent : 3,00 m, 
vertical extent : from the base 0,39 m upwards, the sump excepted. 
(c) Any bulkheads within the damaged area shall be assumed damaged, which means that the subdivision shall be chosen so that the vessel remains afloat after the flooding of two or more adjacent compartments in the longitudinal direction. 
For the main engine room only the one-compartment standard need be taken into account, i.e. the end bulkheads of the engine room shall be assumed as not damaged. 
For bottom damage, adjacent athwartship compartments shall also be assumed as flooded. 
(d) Permeability 
Permeability shall be assumed to be 95 %. 
By way of derogation from this assumption, the following permeability may be assumed: 
—engine and operation rooms: | 85 % | 
—double bottoms, fuel tanks, ballast tanks, etc. depending on whether, according to their function, they have to be assumed as full or empty for the vessel floating at the maximum permissible draught: | 0 or 95 %. | 
If a calculation proves that the average permeability of any compartment is lower, the calculated value may be used. 
(e) The lower edge of any non-watertight openings (e.g. doors, windows, access hatches) shall, at the final stage of flooding, be not less than 100 mm above the damaged waterline. 
5. The stability after damage shall be sufficient if, on the basis of the assumptions inparagraph 4: 
(a) at the final stage of flooding a safety clearance of not less than 100 mm remains and the heeling angle of the craft does not exceed 5°; or 
(b) calculations in accordance with the procedure for calculation of damaged stability specified in Part 9 of the ADNR produce a positive result. 
6. When cross- or down-flooding openings are provided for reduction of asymmetrical flooding, the time for equalisation shall not exceed 15 minutes, if during the intermediate stages of flooding sufficient damaged stability has been verified. 
7. If openings through which undamaged compartments may additionally become flooded are capable of being closed watertight, the closing appliances shall be marked according to their operating instructions. 
8. The proof by calculation in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5 shall be considered to have been provided if damaged stability calculations in accordance with Part 9 of the ADNR, are produced with a positive result. 
9. Where necessary in order to meet the requirements in paragraphs 2 or 3, the plane of maximum draught shall be re-established.

CHAPTER 1 
DEFINITIONS 
Article 1.01 
Signal lanterns 
1. "Lantern" means a device for distributing the flux from an artificial light source; it also includes the components needed to filter, refract or reflect the light, and to hold or operate the light source. 
2. Lanterns intended to give signals on board a vessel are called signal lanterns. 
Article 1.02 
Signal lights 
1. "Signal lights" means the light signals emitted by signal lanterns. 
2. "Masthead light" means a white light, visible throughout a horizontal arc of 225° and projecting a uniform uninterrupted beam over 112° 30' on each side, i.e. from the bow to 22° 30' abaft the beam on each side. 
3. "Side lights" means a green light to starboard and a red light to port; each of these lights shall be visible throughout a horizontal arc of 112° 30' and project a uniform uninterrupted beam, i.e. from the bow to 22° 30' abaft the beam. 
4. "Stern light" means a white light, visible throughout a horizontal arc of 135° and projecting a uniform uninterrupted beam over a sector of 67° 30' along each side from the stern. 
5. "Yellow stern light" means a yellow light, visible throughout a horizontal arc of 135° and projecting a uniform uninterrupted beam over a sector of 67° 30' along each side from the stern. 
6. "Light visible from all directions" means a light visible throughout a horizontal arc of 360° and projecting a uniform uninterrupted beam. 
7. (a) "Scintillating light" means a light flashing at a rate of 40 to 60 light periods per minute. 
(b) "Rapidly scintillating light" means a light flashing at a rate of 100 to 120 light periods per minute. 
A scintillating light is a series of regular light periods per unit time. 
8. Signal lights are classified according to their luminous intensity as: 
- ordinary lights, 
- bright lights, 
- strong lights. 
Article 1.03 
Light sources 
"Light sources" means electrical or non-electrical devices designed to produce light fluxes in signal lanterns. 
Article 1.04 
Optic 
1. "Optic" means a device comprising refracting, reflecting, or refracting and reflecting components, including their holders. The function of these components is to direct the rays from a light source in new specific directions. 
2. "Coloured optic" means an optic which modifies the colour and intensity of the light transmitted. 
3. "Neutral optic" means an optic which modifies the intensity of the light transmitted. 
Article 1.05 
Filter 
1. "Coloured filter" means a selective filter which modifies the colour and intensity of the light transmitted. 
2. "Neutral filter" means a non-selective component which modifies the intensity of the light transmitted. 
Article 1.06 
Relation between IO, IB and t 
IO means the photometric luminous intensity in candelas (cd) measured at normal voltage for electric lights. 
IB means the operational luminous intensity in candelas (cd). 
t means the range in kilometres (km). 
Taking into account, for example, the ageing of the light source, the degree of dirtiness of the optic and variations in the voltage of the on-board grid, IB is taken as 25 % less than IO. 
Consequently: 
IB = 0,75 · IO 
The relation between IB and t of signal lights is given by the following equation: 
IB = 0,2 · t2 · q-t 
The atmospheric transmission coefficient q is taken as 0,76, corresponding to a meteorological visibility of 14,3 km. 
CHAPTER 2

Appendix 
Environment tests 
1. Test concerning protection against splashing water and dust 
1.1. The type of lantern protection shall be guaranteed in accordance with classification IP 55 of the IEC publication — Part 598-1. 
The test concerning protection of the sample against splashing water and against dust, and the evaluation of the results, shall be carried out in conformity with IEC publication 529, classification IP 55. 
The first "5" stands for protection against dust. This means: full dust-proof protection of live components and protection against harmful deposits of dust. The penetration of dust is not completely prevented. 
The second "5" stands for protection against splashing water. This means that a water jet aimed at the lantern from all directions shall have no damaging effect. 
1.2. The protection of the sample against water is evaluated as follows: the protection is considered to be adequate if any water which has entered has no detrimental effect on operation of the sample. 
No water deposits shall have formed on the insulating materials, if this means that minimum vanishing point values could not be achieved. Live components shall not be wetted and shall not be affected by any water accumulating inside the lantern. 
2. Humid atmosphere test 
2.1. Purpose and application 
This test is to determine the action of humid heat and of humidity during a change of temperature, as described in Article 3.01(10)(b), during operation or during transport or storage, on nautical installations, appliances and instruments, given that they could experience surface humidity from condensation. 
This condensation is similar in the case of non-enclosed components to the action of a dust deposit or of a hygroscopic salt film forming during operation. 
The following specification is based on IEC publication 68, Part 2-30 in conjunction with Article 3.01(10)(a) and (b). Additional information can be found in the publication. 
Components and groups of components submitted non-enclosed for approval as type models shall be tested in that non-enclosed state or, if this is not possible given the nature of the components, by providing them with the minimum protection devices which the applicant considers necessary for use on board. 
2.2. Execution 
1. The test is conducted in a test chamber in which, if necessary by means of an air circulation device, the temperature and level of humidity are practically the same at all points. The movement of the air shall not noticeably cool the sample being tested, but should be sufficient to ensure that the prescribed values for air temperature and humidity are maintained in its immediate vicinity. 
Condensate shall be continuously evacuated from the test chamber. No condensate shall drip on to the sample. Condensate may only be reused for humidification following reprocessing, in particular once chemicals from the sample have been eliminated. 
2. The sample shall not be exposed to heat radiation from the heating of the chamber. 
3. The sample shall have been out of service immediately prior to the test long enough for all its parts to be at ambient temperature. 
4. The sample is placed in a test chamber at an ambient temperature of + 25 ± 10 °C corresponding to its normal use on board. 
5. The chamber is closed. The air temperature is set at -25 ± 3 °C and the relative humidity at 45 to 75 % and those conditions are maintained until the sample has reached the same temperature. 
6. The relative humidity of the air is raised to not less than 95 % in a maximum time of one hour, the air temperature remaining unchanged. This increase may take place during the last hour of temperature conditioning of the sample. 
7. The air temperature in the chamber is increased progressively to +40 ± 2 °C over a period of 3 h ± 0,5 h. As the temperature rises, the relative humidity of the air is maintained at not less than 95 %, and at not less than 90 % during the last 15 minutes. During this temperature rise, the sample becomes damp. 
8. The air temperature is maintained at + 40 ± 2 °C for a time period of 12 h ± 0,5 h measured from the start of phase 7, with a relative air humidity of 93 ± 3 %. During the first 15 and the last 15 minutes of the period during which the temperature is + 40 ± 2 °C, relative air humidity may be between 90 and 100 %. 
9. The air temperature is reduced to + 25 ± 3 °C over a period of three to six hours. The relative humidity of the air must be constantly maintained at over 80 %. 
10. The air temperature is maintained at + 25 ± 3 °C for a period of 24 hours from the start of phase 7, relative air humidity remaining constantly above 95 %. 
11. Phase 7 is repeated. 
12. Phase 8 is repeated. 
13. Not earlier than 10 hours after the start of phase 12 the air conditioning equipment of the sample is switched on. When the climatic data indicated by the manufacturer for the sample have been obtained, the sample is put into operation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and at the rated voltage of the on-board network, with a tolerance of ± 3 %. 
14. After the time necessary to achieve normal operation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions has elapsed, the functions are checked and the operating data of importance for use on board recorded and noted. If the chamber needs to be opened for this purpose, it shall be reclosed as quickly as possible. 
If more than 30 minutes are required to reach normal operation, this phase shall be extended sufficiently so that, once the operating state has been reached, at least 30 minutes are available to monitor the functions and measure the operating data. 
15. Within a period of one to three hours, with the sample again in service, the air temperature is lowered to ambient temperature, with a tolerance of ± 3 °C, and the relative humidity of the air to under 75 %. 
16. The chamber is opened and the sample exposed to the normal temperature and humidity of the ambient air. 
17. After 3 hours, and when all humidity visible on the sample has evaporated, the functions of the sample are monitored again, and operating data of importance for use on board recorded and noted.

The following specification is based on IEC publication 68, Part 2-2 in conjunction with Article 3.01(10)(a). Additional information can be found in the IEC publication. 
| Normal | Extreme | 
Environment tests | 
Climate classes X and S | + 55 °C | + 70 °C | 
Permissible tolerance ± 2 °C | 
The test under extreme ambient conditions shall, in principle, be performed first. If the operating data are within the tolerances applicable under normal ambient conditions, the normal ambient test may be dispensed with. 
4.2. Execution

5. Vibration test 
5.1. Purpose and application 
This test is to determine the functional and structural effects of the vibrations referred to in Article 3.01(10)(e). Structural effects concern the performance of the mechanical components, particularly vibrations by resonance and stress on materials leading to fatigue without necessarily producing direct effects on operation or changes in operating data. 
The functional effects directly concern the operation and operating data of the sample. They may be linked to structural effects. 
The following specification is based on IEC publication 68, Part 2-6 in conjunction with Article 3.01(10)(e). Values deviating from those in the abovementioned provisions are indicated by *. Additional information may be found in IEC publication 68, Part 2-6. 
Test requirements: 
The test shall be conducted with sinusoidal vibrations using the following frequencies with the amplitudes indicated: 
| Normal | Extreme | 
Environment tests | 
Vibration class V: | | | 
Frequencies | 2 to 10 Hz | 2 to 13,2 Hz* | 
Amplitude | ± 1,6 mm | ± 1,6 mm | 
Frequencies | 10 to 100 Hz | 13,2 to 100 Hz* | 
Acceleration amplitude | ± 7 m/s2 | ± 11 m/s2 | 
The test under extreme ambient conditions shall, in principle, be performed first. If the operating data are within the tolerances applicable under normal ambient conditions, the normal ambient test may be dispensed with. 
Samples intended to be used with shock-absorbing devices shall be tested with those devices. If, in exceptional cases, it is not possible to test with the shock-absorbers intended for normal operation, the appliances shall be tested without shock-absorbers and the stress modified to take account of the action of the shock-absorber. 
A test without shock-absorbers is also acceptable for the determination of characteristic frequencies. 
The vibration test shall be conducted in three main directions perpendicular to each other. For samples which on account of their construction may be subject to special stresses from vibrations at an oblique angle to the main directions, the test shall also be performed in the directions of special sensitivity. 
5.2. Execution 
1. Test apparatus 
The test is conducted using a vibrating device known as a vibrating table, which enables the sample to be subjected to mechanical vibrations in accordance with the following conditions: 
- The basic movement shall be sinusoidal and such that the mounting points of the sample basically move in phase and along parallel lines. 
- The maximum amplitude of vibration of the lateral movement of any mounting point shall not exceed 25 % of the specified amplitude of the basic movement. 
- The relative importance of the spurious vibration, expressed by the formula 
d =atot2–a12a1· 100(in %) 
where a1 is the effective value of the acceleration produced by the frequency applied, 
and where atot is the effective value of the total acceleration, including a1, measured in the frequencies %lt% 5000 Hz, 
shall not exceed 25 % at the mounting point taken as the point of reference for measurement of the acceleration. 
- The vibration amplitude shall not differ from its theoretical value by more than: 
± 15 % at the mounting point taken as the point of reference and 
± 25 % at any other mounting point. 
In order to determine the characteristic frequencies, it must be possible to adjust the vibration amplitude in small steps between zero and the theoretical value. 
- The vibration frequency shall not differ from its theoretical value by more than 
± 0,05 Hz | for frequencies up to 0,25 Hz, | 
± 20% | for frequencies higher than 0,25 Hz and up to 5 Hz, | 
± 1Hz | for frequencies higher than 5 Hz and up to 50 Hz, | 
± 2% | for frequencies higher than 50 Hz, | 
In order to compare the characteristic frequencies, it must be possible to adjust them at the beginning and end of the vibration test to within: 
± 0,05 Hz for frequencies up to 0,5 Hz, | 
± 10% | ± 0,5 Hz for frequencies up to 5 Hz, | 
± 0,5 Hz for frequencies higher than 5 Hz and up to 100 Hz, | 
± 0,5% for frequencies higher than 100 Hz. | 
In order to scan the frequencies, it should be possible for the vibration frequency to vary continuously and exponentially in both directions between the lower and upper limits of the frequency ranges indicated in paragraph 5.1, with a scanning speed of 1 octave/minute ± 10 %. 
In order to determine the characteristic frequencies, it must be possible to slow the speed of variation of the vibration frequency as desired. 
- The intensity of the magnetic field created by the vibration device in the vicinity of the sample should not exceed 20 kA/m. The testing authority may require lower permissible values for some samples. 
2. First inspection, mounting and putting into service 
The sample is inspected visually to verify that it is in impeccable condition as far as is apparent, and that the assembly is impeccable from the point of view of the construction of all the components and groups of components. 
The sample is mounted on the vibrating table in accordance with the type of mount provided for on-board installation. Samples, the operation and performance of which under the influence of vibrations depend on their position in relation to the vertical, shall be tested in their normal operating position. The mounts and devices used for the mounting shall not noticeably modify the amplitude and the movements of the sample in the range of frequencies used in the test. 
The sample is put into operation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions at the rated voltage of the on-board network with a tolerance of ± 3 %. 
After the time necessary to achieve normal operation has elapsed, the functions are checked and the operating data of importance for use on board recorded and noted. 
3. Preliminary inspection of performance when subjected to vibrations 
This test phase shall be conducted for all samples. For samples which may be used for different purposes with varying vibratory effects, the test shall be conducted for all or some of the various uses. 
A frequency cycle is effected with the vibrating table so that the frequency range indicated in paragraph 5.1, with its corresponding amplitudes, is covered from the lowest frequency to the highest and conversely, at a rate of one octave per minute. The sample is observed during this operation using the appropriate means of measurement and visually, if necessary using a stroboscope, to check thoroughly for any operating problems, modifications of operating data and mechanical phenomena such as vibrations by resonance and rattling noises occurring in specific frequencies. These frequencies are described as "characteristic". 
If necessary, in order to determine characteristic frequencies and vibration effects, the frequency variation is slowed down, stopped or reversed and the amplitude of the vibrations reduced. During the gradual modification of the operating data, it is necessary to wait until the final value is reached while maintaining the vibration frequency, although not more than five minutes. 
During the frequency scan, at least the frequencies and operating data of importance for use on board are recorded, and all characteristic frequencies are noted, with their effects, for subsequent comparison during phase (7). 
If the response of the sample to mechanical vibrations cannot be adequately determined during operation, an additional vibration response test shall be performed without connecting the sample. 
If during the frequency scan the operational data noticeably exceed the permissible tolerances, the operation is unacceptably disrupted or if the structural resonance vibrations are likely to cause destruction should the vibration test be continued, the test may be interrupted. 
4. Test of switching functions 
This test phase shall be conducted for all samples where vibratory stress may influence switching functions, for example relays. 
The sample is subjected to vibrations in the frequency ranges indicated in paragraph 5.1 with frequency variation steps in accordance with the E-12 series [4] and the corresponding amplitudes. At each frequency step, all switching functions which may be sensitive to vibration, if necessary including switching-on and switching-off, are carried out at least twice. 
Switching functions may also be tested at frequencies occurring between the E-12 series values. 
5. Extended test 
This test phase shall be conducted for all samples. For samples which may be used for different purposes with varying vibratory effects, the first part of this phase (when the sample is in service) may be conducted several times, for all or some of the various uses. 
When the sample is in service as described in phase (2) above, it is subjected to five cycles during which the frequency range indicated as stress producing in paragraph 5.1, with the corresponding amplitudes, is covered each time from the lowest to the highest frequency and conversely, at a rate of one octave per minute. 
After the fifth cycle, the vibrating table may be stopped, the functions are tested and the operating data of importance for on-board use recorded and noted. 
6. Fixed frequency extended test 
This test phase shall be conducted if, on examining vibratory performance during phase (3) above, mechanical resonances are observed during the scan of the frequency range above 5 Hz, which are acceptable for extended use on board according to the manufacturer or his authorised representative, but for which the strength of the parts concerned cannot be taken for granted. In particular, this phase concerns appliances fitted with shock absorbers with a resonance frequency within the frequency range indicated in paragraph 5.1 and higher than 5 Hz. 
When the sample is in service as described in phase 2 above, for each resonance frequency concerned, it is subjected for two hours to vibrations at the amplitude provided for in the extreme ambient test and at the corresponding frequency as referred to in paragraph 5.1, the direction of vibration being that which in normal use exerts the maximum stress on the parts in question. If necessary, the frequency applied must be rectified so that the resonance vibrations continue at not less than 70 % of their maximum amplitude, or the frequency must be made to vary continuously between two values 2 % below and 2 % above the resonance frequency initially observed, at a rate of at least 0,1 but not more than 1 octave per minute. During the vibratory stress, the functions of the sample are monitored until malfunctions begin to occur, as a result of mechanical parts becoming detached or displaced or of a break in the electrical connection or of a short-circuit. 
Samples for which the execution of this test phase is relevant when switched off may be tested in that state, provided the mechanical stress on the parts concerned is not less than in normal use. 
7. Final inspection of performance when subjected to vibration 
This test phase must be effected as necessary. 
The inspection of performance when subjected to vibrations referred to in phase 3 is repeated using the frequencies and amplitudes applied in that phase. The characteristic frequencies observed and the observed effects of vibration stress are compared with the results of phase 3 in order to determine any changes which occurred during the vibration test. 
8. Conclusions of the inspection 
Once the vibrating table has stopped and the time necessary to arrive at an operating state without vibratory stress has elapsed, the functions are tested and the operating data of importance for on-board use recorded and noted. 
Lastly, the sample is inspected visually to verify that it is in impeccable condition. 
5.3. Results to be obtained 
The sample and its components and groups of components should not show any mechanical resonance vibrations in the frequency ranges indicated in paragraph 5.1. When resonance vibrations of this type are unavoidable, construction measures must be taken to ensure that the sample, its components and groups of components suffer no damage. 
During and following the vibration test, no perceptible effect of vibratory stress shall occur, and in particular no difference between the characteristic frequencies observed in phase 7 and the values determined in phase 3 and no damage or malfunction as a result of extended vibration shall be observed. 
In the case of the normal ambient test, the operating data recorded in phases 3 to 8 shall remain within the tolerances permitted on the basis of these test and approval conditions. 
During the switching functions test in phase 4, no switching malfunction or breakdown shall occur. 
6. Accelerated weather resistance test 
6.1. Purpose and application 
The accelerated weather resistance test (simulation of exposure to the elements through exposure to radiation from xenon lamps with filters and by sprinkling) is conducted in accordance with Parts 2-3, 2-5 and 2-9 of IEC publication 68 plus the following additions: 
According to this publication, the accelerated weather resistance test aims at simulating natural weather conditions by means of a test apparatus under specific reproducible conditions, so as to provoke rapid changes in the properties of the materials. 
The accelerated test is carried out in a test apparatus with filtered radiation from xenon lamps and intermittent sprinkling. Following exposure to the elements, measured by the product of the intensity of radiation and its duration, the agreed properties of the samples are compared with those of samples of the same origin which have not been exposed to the elements. First to be specified are the properties crucial for practical use, such as colour, surface quality, shock resistance, tensile strength and solidity. 
In order to compare the results with those of exposure to natural weather conditions, it is assumed that the alteration of properties by the elements is caused in particular by natural radiation and the simultaneous action of oxygen, water and heat on the materials. 
For the accelerated test, particular account must be taken of the fact that the radiation in the appliance is very close to natural radiation (see the IEC publication). The radiation from the xenon lamp with a special filter simulates natural radiation. 
Experience has shown that, under the test conditions indicated, there is a strong correlation between resistance to weather in the accelerated test and resistance to natural weather conditions. The accelerated test, which is independent of place, climate and season, has the advantage over natural weather conditions of being reproducible and of making it possible to shorten the duration of the test as it is independent of the alternation of day and night and of the seasons. 
6.2. Number of samples 
For the weather-resistance test, unless otherwise agreed, an adequate number of samples is used. An adequate number of samples not subjected to weather conditions is required for the purposes of comparison. 
6.3. Preparation of samples 
The samples are subjected to the tests in the state in which they are delivered, unless otherwise agreed. The samples to be used for comparison are kept in the dark at ambient temperature throughout the tests. 
6.4. Test apparatus 
The test apparatus consists basically of a ventilated test chamber with the radiation source in the centre. Optical filters are placed round the radiation source. The sample mounts are rotated around the longitudinal axis of the system at the required distance from the source and the filters to reach the intensity of radiation prescribed in paragraph 6.4.1. 
The intensity of the radiation on any component of the total sample surfaces exposed shall not differ by more than ± 10 % from the arithmetical mean of radiation intensity on the various surfaces. 
6.4.1. Radiation source 
A xenon lamp is used as the radiation source. The radiation flux shall be selected so that the intensity of radiation on the sample surface is 1000 ± 20O W. m-2 in the 300 to 830 nm waveband (see paragraph 6.9 for the apparatus for measuring irradiation). 
If air-cooled xenon lamps are used, the air already used containing ozone must not enter the test chamber and must be evacuated separately. 
The experimental values show that the radiation flux from xenon lamps drops to 80 % of its initial value after approximately 1500 hours of operation; after this period, the proportion of ultra-violet radiation is also reduced noticeably compared with other forms of radiation. The xenon lamp must therefore be replaced after this period (see also the data supplied by the xenon lamp manufacturer). 
6.4.2. Optical filters 
Optical filters must be positioned between the radiation source and the sample mounts so that the filtered radiation from the xenon lamps is as close as possible to natural radiation (see IEC publication 68, Parts 2 to 9). 
All glass filters must be cleaned regularly to avoid any undesirable decrease in radiation intensity. The filters must be replaced if the similarity to natural radiation can no longer be achieved. 
With regard to appropriate optical filters, the data supplied by the manufacturer of the test apparatus must be complied with. On delivery of test apparatus, the manufacturer must guarantee that it meets the requirements set out in paragraph 6.4. 
6.5. Sprinkling and air humidifying device 
The sample shall be wetted in such a way that the action is the same as that of natural rain and dew. The sample sprinkling device shall be so constructed that during sprinkling all the external surfaces of the samples are wetted. It must be controlled in such a way that the sprinkling/dry-period cycle prescribed in paragraph 6.10.3 is complied with. The air in the test chamber must be humidified so as to maintain the relative humidity prescribed in paragraph 6.10.3. The water used for sprinkling and for humidifying the air must be distilled water or fully desalinated water (conductivity %lt% 5 μS/cm). 
The tanks, pipes and sprayers for distilled or fully desalinated water must be of corrosion-resistant materials. The relative humidity of the air in the test chamber is measured using a hygrometer protected against sprinkling and direct radiation and is adjusted by means of the hygrometer. 
When fully desalinated water or water in a closed circuit is used the risk exists (as in the varnish test) of the formation of a deposit on the surface of the samples or of wear on the surface by substances in suspension. 
6.6. Ventilation device 
The temperature of the black panel prescribed in paragraph 6.10.2 is maintained in the test chamber by the circulation of clean, filtered, humidified and, if necessary, temperature-controlled air over the samples. The flow and speed of the air shall be selected so as to ensure uniform tempering of all external surfaces of the mounts of the samples in the system. 
6.7. Sample mounts 
Any mounts in stainless steel enabling the samples to be mounted as set out in paragraph 6.10.1 may be used. 
6.8. Blackpanel thermometer 
In order to measure the temperature of the black panel during the dry period of the cycle, a blackpanel thermometer is used. This thermometer consists of a stainless steel panel thermally insulated from its mounts, the same size as the sample mounts and 0,9 ± 0,1 mm thick. The two sides of the panel are covered with shiny black varnish which is highly weather-resistant and has a maximum reflecting power of 5 % at wave-lengths of more than 780 nm. The temperature of the panel is measured using a bimetallic thermometer the sensor of which is placed in the middle of the panel with a good thermal contact. 
It is not advisable to leave the thermometer in the apparatus throughout the test referred to in paragraph 6.10. It is sufficient for it to be inserted into the test apparatus every 250 hours, for 30 minutes or so, and for the temperature of the black panel to be taken during the dry period. 
6.9. Irradiation measuring apparatus 
Irradiation (unit of measurement: W. s m-2) is the product of the intensity of irradiation (unit: W. m-2) and duration of irradiation (unit: s). The irradiation of the surfaces of the sample in the test apparatus is measured with an appropriate irradiation measuring apparatus, adapted to the radiation function of the system consisting of the radiation source and the filter. The irradiation measuring apparatus shall be graduated or calibrated so that infra-red radiation over 830 nm is not taken into account. 
The capacity of the irradiation measuring apparatus depends basically on whether its sensor is highly resistant to weather and to ageing and has adequate spectral sensitivity to natural radiation. 
The irradiation measuring apparatus may include the following parts, for example: 
(a) a silicon photo-electric cell as radiation sensor; 
(b) an optical filter placed in front of the photo-electric cell; and 
(c) a coulometer which measures the product (unit: C = A.s) of the intensity of the current produced in the photo-electric cell in proportion to radiation intensity (unit: A) and the duration of radiation (unit: s). 
The scale of the irradiation measuring apparatus shall be calibrated. The calibration shall be checked after being used for a year and corrected if necessary. 
The intensity of irradiation on the surface of samples depends on the distance from the radiation source. Sample surfaces shall therefore, as far as possible, be at the same distance from the source as the sensor of the irradiation measuring apparatus. If this is not possible, the irradiation reading on the measuring apparatus shall be multiplied by a correction factor. 
6.10. Execution 
6.10.1. The samples are placed in mounts so that water cannot collect on the rear surface. The sample mounts must cause only the smallest possible amount of mechanical stress. In order to ensure irradiation and sprinkling are as evenly distributed as possible, the samples are rotated during the test at a rate of one to five revolutions per minute round the source-filter system and the sprinkling device. Normally, a single side of the sample is exposed to the weather conditions. Depending on the applicable provisions of the IEC publication, or as otherwise agreed, the front and back surfaces of a single sample may also be exposed. In this case, each surface is exposed to the same radiation and the same sprinkling. 
The exposure of the front and back surfaces of a given sample to the same radiation and sprinkling may be produced by the periodic rotation of the sample. This can be done automatically using rotating appliances if the mount is in the form of an open frame. 
6.10.2. The temperature of the black panel at the point where the samples are placed during the dry period is set and regulated in accordance with the IEC publications applicable to the equipment in question. Unless otherwise agreed, the average temperature of the black panel must be kept at + 45 °C. Average temperature of the black panel means the arithmetic mean of the black panel temperature reached at the end of the dry period. During the dry period, a local difference of ± 5 °C is permissible, and ± 3 °C in borderline cases. 
In order to maintain the required temperature of the black panel and, when necessary, ensure radiation of equal intensity on the front and back surfaces of the sample (see paragraph 6.10.1), the samples may be turned automatically through 180° after each revolution. In this case, the blackpanel thermometer and the irradiation measuring apparatus shall be included in the rotation movement. 
6.10.3. Samples installed in mounts and the sensor of the irradiation measuring apparatus referred to in paragraph 6.9 are evenly exposed to radiation and sprinkled according to the cycle defined below, which is repeated successively: 
Sprinkling : 3 minutes 
Dry period: : 17 minutes 
The relative humidity of the air must be 60 to 80 % during the dry period. 
6.11. Test duration and procedure 
The test follows procedure B in IEC publication 68, Part 2-9. The test duration is 720 hours, with the sprinkling cycle defined in paragraph 6.10.3. 
It is recommended that the weather-resistance test should be carried out with one and the same sample (in the case of a non-destructive test of the modification of the properties to be considered, such as the weather-resistance test, for example) or with several samples (in the case of a destructive test, as for shock-resistance, for example) at various degrees of irradiation, to be agreed upon. The development of the modification of the properties of a piece of equipment throughout the weather test can therefore be determined. 
6.12. Assessment 
After the exposure to bad weather is completed, the sample is kept for at least 24 hours in darkness in an air temperature of +23 °C, a dew point of +12 °C, a relative air humidity of 50 %, an air circulation speed of 1 m/s and an atmospheric pressure of 860 to 1060 hPa. (The permissible difference may be ± 2 °C for the air temperature and ± 6 % for the relative humidity.) 
These samples and those used for the comparison referred to in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 are inspected to determine properties in accordance with the requirements indicated in Article 2.01(1) and (2) and in Article 3.01(12). 
7. Salt water and weather-resistance test 
(sea-fog test) 
7.1. Purpose and application 
This test is to determine the action of salt water and a saline atmosphere during operation and during transport and storage in accordance with Article 3.01. 
It may be restricted to the sample or to specimens of the materials used. 
The following specifications are based on IEC publication 68, Part 2-52. Additional information can be found in the publication. 
7.2. Execution 
1 Test apparatus 
The test is conducted in a test chamber using an atomiser and a saline solution meeting the following conditions: 
- the materials of the test chamber and the atomiser must not influence the corrosive action of the salt mist, 
- a fine, homogeneous, wet, thick mist must be diffused inside the test chamber; the distribution must not be affected by eddies or by the presence of the sample. The jet must not touch the sample directly. Drops forming on the inside of the chamber must not be able to fall on the sample; 
- the test chamber must be adequately ventilated and the ventilation outlet protected against sudden changes in the movement of the air, so as to prevent the formation of a strong air current in the chamber, 
- the saline solution used must consist, by mass, of 5 ± 1 parts of pure sodium chloride, with a maximum of 0,1 % sodium iodide and 0,3 % impurities, in the dry state, to 95 ± 1 parts of distilled or fully desalinated water. Its pH must be between 6,5 and 7,2 at a temperature of + 20 ± 2 °C and be kept within these limits during the operation. Solution once sprayed must not be reused, 
- the compressed air used for spraying must be free of impurities such as oil or dust and shall have a humidity level of at least 85 % in order to avoid blockage of the nozzle, 
- the mist diffused in the chamber must have a density such that, in a clean receptacle with an open horizontal surface area of 80 cm2, placed anywhere in the chamber, the average precipitation over the whole time is between 1.0 ml and 2.0 ml per hour. In order to monitor the density of the mist, at least two receptacles shall be placed in the chamber in such a way as not to be covered by the sample and not to receive drops of condensation. In order to calibrate the quantity of solution sprayed, the duration of spraying shall be at least eight hours, 
the period of humidity between phases of spraying is spent in an air-conditioned chamber in which the air can be kept at a temperature of + 40 ± 2 °C and at a relative humidity of 93 ± 3 %. 
2. Preliminary inspection 
The sample is inspected visually to verify that it is in impeccable condition, and in particular that it is correctly assembled and that all openings close properly. External surfaces soiled with grease, oil or mud are cleaned. All controls and moving parts are manipulated and checked for proper operation. The mobility of all closures, covers and moving parts intended to be detached or moved during operation or maintenance must be inspected for mobility and correctly replaced. 
The sample is put into operation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions at the rated voltage of the on-board network with a tolerance of ± 3 %. 
After the time required to reach normal operation has elapsed, the functions are tested and the operating data of importance for on-board use and for assessing the action of the salt mist atmosphere are recorded and noted. The sample is then disconnected for exposure to spraying. 
3. Spraying phase 
The sample is put into the salt mist chamber and exposed to the salt mist for two hours at a temperature of +15 °C to +35 °C. 
4. Humidity period 
The sample is placed in the air-conditioned chamber so that the least possible amount of saline solution drips from it. It is kept in the air-conditioned chamber for seven days, at an air temperature of + 40 ± 2 °C and a relative humidity of 93 ± 3 %. It must not come into contact with any other sample or metal object. Several samples may be so arranged as to preclude any mutual influence. 
5. Repetition of the test cycle 
The test cycle, including phases 3 and 4, is repeated three times. 
6. Subsequent treatment 
Following the fourth test cycle, the sample is taken out of the air-conditioned chamber and immediately washed for five minutes in running tap water and rinsed in distilled or desalinated water. Drops adhering to the sample are removed by an air jet or shaken off. 
The sample is exposed to the normal ambient atmosphere for at least three hours, and in any case long enough for any visible humidity to have evaporated, before being subjected to a final inspection. The sample is dried for an hour at + 55 ± 2 °C after rinsing. 
7. Conclusions of the inspection 
The external appearance of the sample is inspected visually. The nature and extent of deterioration from its initial state are recorded in the test report, with supporting photographs if necessary. 
The sample is put into operation in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions at the rated voltage of the on-board network with a tolerance of ± 3 %. 
After the time required to reach normal operation has elapsed, the functions are tested and the operating data of importance for on-board use and for assessing the action of the salt mist atmosphere are recorded and noted. 
All controls and moving parts are manipulated and checked for proper operation. The mobility of all closures, covers and moving parts intended to be detached or moved during operation or maintenance is checked. 
7.3. Results to be obtained 
The sample must not show any change which could: 
- hinder its use and operation, 
- prevent to any considerable extent the detachment of closures and covers, or the movement of moving parts in so far as this is necessary for use or maintenance, 
- impair the waterproofness of the housing, 
- be expected to cause malfunctions in the long run. 
The operating data recorded in phases 3 and 7 must remain within the tolerances laid down in these test and approval conditions.

-------------------------------------------------- 
STATEMENT OF THE COUNCIL'S REASONS 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In December 1997 the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 82/714/EEC of 4 October 1982 laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels. The aim of the proposal is to align the Community technical requirements on the advanced standards governing navigation on the Rhine with a view to establishing a single scheme for the entire network of European waterways. 
On 20 October 1998 the European Parliament adopted a number of amendments at first reading. 
On 1 May 1999 the legal basis was changed following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam introducing the co-decision procedure for the transport sector. On 16 September 1999 the European Parliament confirmed its opinion adopted at first reading. 
In the light of these developments, the Commission presented an amended proposal in July 2000, consisting of the parts of the original proposal in which changes had been made as a result of the amendments by the European Parliament. 
Work in the Council bodies on this proposal remained at a standstill for a long time because of the issue of the possibility of admitting craft with Community certificates to navigation on the Rhine. Whereas such a possibility was previously excluded under the rules established by the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR), this situation changed when the CCNR adopted a modification of the Mannheim Act (Additional Protocol 7) on 27 November 2002, introducing a legal basis for navigation on the Rhine with certificates delivered by bodies other than the CCNR, such as the European Community. After all five contracting States to the CCNR had ratified this Additional Protocol, it entered into force on 1 December 2004. 
In view of this development, it became possible to resume examination of the text and on 10 December 2004 the Council reached partial political agreement relating to the operative part of the draft Directive. Several months later, the Council bodies were able to reach agreement on the text of the annexes as well. 
Following revision of the entire text by legal-linguistic experts, the Council adopted its common position on 23 February 2006. In adopting this position, the Council took good note of the opinion of the European Parliament at first reading. 
The Council took also note of the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee. 
II. ANALYSIS OF THE COMMON POSITION 
The Council was able to agree on the main lines of the Commission proposal. On some points, however, the Council decided to modify the text, generally in order to make it clearer, simpler and easier to understand. 
The most important change relates to Article 3, concerning the 'Obligation to carry a certificate'. The text of this Article, which provides for the equivalence of Community inland navigation certificates with certificates issued by the CCNR, is the result of in-depth preparative discussions between the Commission and the Member States of the CCNR. This Article constitutes the cornerstone of the Directive as it ensures that certificates issued under this Community Directive give rights to navigation on the Rhine equivalent to those given by certificates issued by the CCNR. 
Article 5, concerning 'Additional or reduced technical requirements for certain zones', has been modified and now caters for the wish expressed by some Member States to have the possibility to disapply the transitional provisions set out in Chapter 24a of Annex II in those cases where their application would result in a reduction of existing national safety standards. 
In Article 27, concerning 'Addressees', the text was modified so as to provide that the Directive is only addressed to the 13 Member States which have inland waterways as referred to in Article 1(1). 
In the light of technical progress and developments arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that of the CCNR, the voluminous annexes have all been redrafted in an experts group involving both experts from the Community and its Member States as well as experts from the CCNR and its Member States. During this procedure, three new annexes, currently numbered 7, 8 and 9, were inserted in the text. 
III. AMENDMENTS BY THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 
In its amended proposal, the Commission took on board almost all the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading; see the explanatory memorandum to this amended proposal, pages 2 and 3. 
The Council, who carried out its work on the basis of the amended proposal of the Commission, entirely followed the line of the Commission's approach and thus took the same positive stance as the Commission in respect of the amendments by the European Parliament. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The Council submits that the text of its common position is appropriate and balanced. With respect to the amendments proposed by the European Parliament at first reading, the Council observes that these amendments have been almost entirely taken on board, subject to some minor refinements. The Council therefore holds that the text of its common position ensures that the aim sought by Parliament's amendments will be achieved.
