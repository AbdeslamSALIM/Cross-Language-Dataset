Proposal for a 
DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund according to point 3 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 7 November 2002 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on the financing of the European Union Solidarity Fund, supplementing the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
The Interinstitutional Agreement of 7 November 2002[1] allows for the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund through a flexibility mechanism, within the annual ceiling of 1 billion euros, over and above the relevant headings of the financial perspective. The conditions of eligibility to the Fund are detailed in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002[2]. 
On the basis of applications for assistance from the Fund by Sweden, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania which were affected by a major storm on 8 January 2005, total estimates of the damage caused are as follows: 
Direct damage (in EUR) | 
Sweden | 2 297 313 252 | 
Estonia | 47 868 000 | 
Latvia | 192 590 000 | 
Lithuania | 15 156 395 | 
Total | 2 552 927 647 | 
In the light of the examination of these applications[3], and considering the maximum possible grant from the Fund as well as the scope for reallocating appropriations under the heading requiring additional expenditure, the Commission proposes to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund for a total amount of EUR 92 880 830, to be allocated under heading 3 of the financial perspective. 
The Commission will present an amending budget (AB) in order to enter in the 2005 budget specific commitment appropriations, broken down by beneficiary country, as requested in Point 4 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 7 November 2002.
