Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Consiglio Di Stato (Italy) — Interpretation of Articles 6 and 11 of Directive 97/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 April 1997 on a common framework for general authorisations and individual licences in the field of telecommunications services (OJ 1997 L 117, p. 15) — Compatibility with Community law of a national provision requiring companies providing a public service and having created telecommunications networks to create a separate company for the exercise of any activity in the field of telecommunications 
Operative part of the judgment 
Article 11 of Directive 97/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 April 1997 on a common framework for general authorisations and individual licences in the field of telecommunications services precludes a national provision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires the holder of an individual licence for the provision of a public telecommunications network, for which it has paid a fee as provided for in that article, to pay an additional fee in respect of the private use of that network calculated in accordance with criteria which do not correspond to those laid down in that article.
