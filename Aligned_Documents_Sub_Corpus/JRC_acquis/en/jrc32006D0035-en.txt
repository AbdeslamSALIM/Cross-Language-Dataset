ANNEX 
TURKEY: 2005 ACCESSION PARTNERSHIP 
1. INTRODUCTION 
At its meeting in Luxembourg in December 1997, the European Council decided that the Accession Partnership would be the key feature of the enhanced pre-accession strategy, mobilising all forms of assistance to the candidate countries within a single framework. In this manner, the Community targets its assistance towards the specific needs of each candidate so as to provide support for overcoming particular problems with a view to accession. 
The first Accession Partnership for Turkey was adopted by the Council in March 2001. In the Commission's Strategy Paper on enlargement of October 2002, it was stated that the Commission would propose a revised Accession Partnership for Turkey. A revised Accession Partnership was then presented by the Commission in March 2003 and adopted by the Council in May of the same year. In its recommendation of October 2004, the Commission proposed that, with a view to guaranteeing the sustainability and the irreversibility of the political reform process, the EU should continue to monitor closely progress of the political reforms. In particular, the Commission proposed the adoption of a revised Accession Partnership in 2005. 
Turkey is expected to develop a plan including a timetable and specific measures foreseen to address the Accession Partnership priorities. 
The revised Accession Partnership provides the basis for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate state in the preparations for membership. In particular, the revised Accession Partnership will serve as a basis for future political reforms and as a yardstick against which to measure future progress. 
2. PRINCIPLES 
The main priorities identified for Turkey relate to its capacity to meet the criteria defined by the Copenhagen European Council of 1993 and the requirements of the negotiating framework adopted by the Council on 3 October 2005. 
3. PRIORITIES 
The priorities listed in this Accession Partnership have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that the country can complete them or take them substantially forward over the next few years. A distinction is made between short-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within one to two years, and medium-term priorities, which are expected to be accomplished within three to four years. The priorities concern both legislation and the implementation thereof. 
The revised Accession Partnership indicates the priority areas for Turkey’s membership preparations. Turkey will, in the end, nevertheless have to address all issues identified in the progress report, including consolidating the political reform process in order to guarantee its irreversibility and ensure its uniform implementation throughout the country and at all levels of the administration. It is also important that Turkey fulfil the commitments of legislative approximation and implementation of the acquis in accordance with the commitments made under the Association Agreement, customs union and related decisions of the EC-Turkey Association Council, for example on the trade regime for agricultural products.

4. PROGRAMMING 
Financial assistance for the priorities identified in the Accession Partnership will be made available through annual financing decisions taken by the Commission, following the procedure set out in Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001 of 17 December 2001 concerning pre-accession financial assistance for Turkey [2] (for the 2006 programme) and in the Regulation for the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA), once this has been adopted (for the 2007 to 2013 programmes). The financing decisions will be followed by a financing agreement signed with Turkey. 
5. CONDITIONALITY 
Community assistance for financing projects through the pre-accession instruments is conditional on the respect by Turkey of its commitments under the EC-Turkey Agreements, including Customs Union Decision 1/95 and other decisions, further concrete steps towards satisfying effectively the Copenhagen criteria and in particular progress in meeting the specific priorities of this revised Accession Partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001. Specific conditions are also included in individual annual programmes. 
6. MONITORING 
The implementation of the Accession Partnership shall be examined through the framework of the mechanisms established under the Association Agreement as appropriate and through the Commission’s progress reports. 
The Association Agreement sub-committees provide the possibility to review implementation of the Accession Partnership priorities as well as progress as regards legal approximation, implementation and enforcement. The Association Committee discusses overall developments, progress and problems in meeting the Accession Partnership’s priorities as well as more specific issues referred to it from the sub-committees. 
The monitoring of the pre-accession financial assistance programme shall be carried out jointly by Turkey and the European Commission through a joint monitoring committee. In order to ensure the effectiveness of monitoring, projects being funded under each financing agreement must incorporate verifiable and measurable indicators of achievements. Monitoring based on these indicators will assist the Commission, the Phare Management Committee (and its successor under IPA) and Turkey in subsequently reorienting programmes where necessary and in the design of new programmes. 
The Phare Management Committee ensures that actions financed under the pre-accession programme are compatible with each other as well as with the Accession Partnership as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001. 
The Accession Partnership will continue to be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 622/98 of 16 March 1998 on assistance to the applicant states in the framework of the pre-accession strategy, and in particular on the establishment of Accession Partnerships [3].
