Commission notice pursuant to Article 4(1)(a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 
Amendment of public service obligations imposed on certain scheduled air services within Portugal 
(2006/C 280/07) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
1. The Portuguese Government has decided to apply the provisions of Article 4(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92, with a view to revising the Commission notices (98/C 267/05) and (98/C 267/06) published in the OJEC of 26 August 1998 on the amendment of public service obligations imposed on scheduled air services operated on the following routes: 
- Lisbon/Funchal/Lisbon 
- Lisbon/Porto Santo/Lisbon 
- Porto/Funchal/Porto 
- Funchal/Porto Santo/Funchal 
2. Fuel surcharge 
In order to mitigate abnormal variations in the price of fuel, air carriers may impose a surcharge (SC) to offset the additional costs arising from the increase in the price of fuel. 
This surcharge will be revised quarterly and calculated according to the following formula (rounded off to the nearest unit): 
SC = k × (b - 50,00) 
Where: 
SC = Additional cost of fuel on return trips between Funchal and Porto Santo and single trips on the other routes. 
k = 0,684862 × average USD/Euro exchange rate for the preceding quarter 
B = average barrel price in USD in the preceding quarter 
3. The remaining public service obligations provided for in the notices (98/C 267/05) and (98/C 267/06) of 26 August 1998 remain unchanged. 
4. This notice shall enter into force on the date of its publication.
