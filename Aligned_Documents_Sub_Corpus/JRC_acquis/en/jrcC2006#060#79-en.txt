Pleas in law and main arguments 
Applicant for the Community trade mark: Mission Productions GmbH 
Community trade mark concerned: The word mark %quot%Dr. No%quot% for goods in classes 9, 12, 18, 25 and 32 — application No 2256378 
Proprietor of the mark or sign cited in the opposition proceedings: The applicant 
Mark or sign cited: The earlier well-known mark, earlier non-registered mark and earlier sign used in the course of trade %quot%Dr. No%quot% and %quot%Dr. NO%quot% for films, DVDs, comic books, music recordings, books, posters and action figures (toys) 
Decision of the Opposition Division: Opposition rejected in its entirety 
Decision of the Board of Appeal: Dismissal of the appeal 
Pleas in law: Infringement of Article 8(2)(c) of Council Regulation No 40/94 as the Board of Appeal misinterpreted Article 6 bis of the Paris Convention by holding that use within the Community had to be proved by the applicant. 
Infringement of Article 8(1)(a) and (b) of Council Regulation No 40/94 since there is a likelihood of confusion between the conflicting trade marks as the conflicting marks and several of the goods covered by these marks are identical. 
Infringement of Articles 8(4) and 73 of Council Regulation No 40/94 and Rules 50(2) and 52(1) of Commission Regulation No 2868/95 because the Board of Appeal failed to consider the opposition under Article 8(4) of Council Regulation No 40/94 and should have recognised that the applicant was the proprietor of numerous earlier rights and that it had used the marks cited in the opposition in the course of trade.
