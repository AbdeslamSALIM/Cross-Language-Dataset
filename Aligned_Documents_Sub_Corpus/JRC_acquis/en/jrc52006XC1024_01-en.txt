Description of product 
Esrom 20+ and Esrom 30+ have been produced in the past, but only in small quantities and almost only to order. As production of 20+ and 30+ was so limited, these were not included in the original application. The European market, in this case primarily Denmark, Germany and Austria, has changed dramatically in recent years notably towards low-fat cheeses, hence the need to also include 20+ and 30+ in the official and protected range. 
We wish to produce Esrom in a slightly taller form as quality is improved when cheeses of a minimum weight of 2 kg are up to 7 cm high. 
Proof of origin 
Further details have been added to the section on Proof of origin to take account of traceability requirements. 
Link 
The historical background has been moved from the Proof of origin to the Link section. 
Inspection body 
Information has been added concerning accreditation under EN45011 of the private inspection body. 
Labelling 
The Labelling section has been corrected as regards use of the term Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), and labelling requirements for lower-fat cheeses have been added. 
National requirements 
The National requirements section has been amended solely due to the fact that Danish legislation has itself been amended. The amendment concerns the reference to this legislation. The provisions relating to Esrom remain unchanged.

Exterior: thin, supple, yellow to yellowy-orange edible rind with a clean, almost dry, thin and uniform yellowish brown to reddish brown outer skin. Older cheeses have a slightly greasy surface due to the regeneration of the outer skin. 
Colour: uniformly yellowish to white colour. 
Build: evenly distributed irregular holes approximately the size of rice. 
Consistency: uniform throughout the whole cheese. Soft but easily cut. 
Smell and flavour: mild, acidic, aromatic with hints of surface ripening. The smell and flavour from the surface ripening become dominant as the cheese ages. 
Maturation time: minimum 2 weeks. 
Geographical area : Denmark 
Proof of origin : Esrom is produced exclusively from milk from the designated geographical area, and documentation showing this is checked by the inspection body, which must present proof of this check to the accreditation body. Meticulous records of all suppliers are kept as these form the basis for payments for the milk. The cheeses are labelled in accordance with current legislation before leaving the dairy to ensure they can be traced back to the dairy. Labelling is checked by the authorities. 
Method of production : Raw Danish cows' milk is standardised as regards fat content and pasteurised at low temperature. Starters and curdling agents are added. The curd is cut with a knife once an appropriate level of firmness has been reached; it is then stirred, the whey is drawn off and it is heated. The curds are poured into moulds and the cheese is then lightly pressed. The cheeses are allowed to cool, salt is added, the surface is treated with a culture and the cheeses are then stored at a high air humidity. After the maturation process the cheeses are washed, dried and packaged. 
Link : 
Developed by the monks of Esrom Monastery in the 12th-13th centuries. Further developed by the National Experimental Dairy in the mid-1930s. Production started at Midtsjællands Herregårdsmejeri and later at other dairies. 
Esrom has a reputation as a Danish specialty both inside and outside the Community, acquired through legislative initiatives and the quality work carried out by the manufacturers' association for 40 years, which has safeguarded the cheese's traditional and distinctive characteristics.
