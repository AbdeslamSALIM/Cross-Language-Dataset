( 78/932/EEC ) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES , 
HAVING REGARD TO THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY , AND IN PARTICULAR ARTICLE 100 THEREOF , 
HAVING REGARD TO THE PROPOSAL FROM THE COMMISSION ( 1 ) , 
HAVING REGARD TO THE OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ( 2 ) , 
HAVING REGARD TO THE OPINION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE ( 3 ) , 
WHEREAS THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS WHICH MOTOR VEHICLES MUST SATISFY PURSUANT TO NATIONAL LAWS RELATE INTER ALIA TO HEAD RESTRAINTS ; 
WHEREAS THOSE REQUIREMENTS DIFFER FROM ONE MEMBER STATE TO ANOTHER ; WHEREAS IT IS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT ALL MEMBER STATES ADOPT THE SAME REQUIREMENTS , EITHER IN ADDITION TO OR IN PLACE OF THEIR EXISTING RULES IN ORDER , IN PARTICULAR , TO ALLOW THE EEC TYPE-APPROVAL PROCEDURE , WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 70/156/EEC OF 6 FEBRUARY 1970 ON THE APPROXIMATION OF THE LAWS OF THE MEMBER STATES RELATING TO THE TYPE-APPROVAL OF MOTOR VEHICLES AND THEIR TRAILERS ( 4 ) , AS LAST AMENDED BY DIRECTIVE 78/547/EEC ( 5 ) , TO BE INTRODUCED IN RESPECT OF EACH TYPE OF VEHICLE ; 
WHEREAS THE COMMON REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INTERIOR PARTS OF THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT , THE LAYOUT OF THE CONTROLS , THE ROOF AND BACKREST AND REAR PART OF THE SEATS WERE LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVE 74/60/EEC ( 6 ) ; WHEREAS THOSE FOR THE INTERNAL FITTINGS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE DRIVER FROM THE STEERING MECHANISM IN THE EVENT OF AN IMPACT WERE LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVE 74/297/EEC ( 7 ) ; WHEREAS THOSE RELATING TO THE STRENGTH OF THE SEATS AND THEIR ANCHORAGES WERE LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVE 74/408/EEC ( 8 ) ; WHEREAS THOSE RELATING TO ANCHORAGES FOR SAFETY BELTS WERE LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVE 76/115/EEC ( 9 ) ; WHEREAS THOSE RELATING TO SAFETY BELTS AND RESTRAINT SYSTEMS WERE LAID DOWN IN DIRECTIVE 77/541/EEC ( 10 ) ;

1.3.3 . TIME RECORDING : 
_ THE INSTRUMENTATION MUST ENABLE THE ACTION TO BE RECORDED THROUGHOUT ITS DURATION AND READINGS TO BE MADE WITHIN ONE THOUSANDTH OF A SECOND , 
_ THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPACT AT THE MOMENT OF FIRST CONTACT BETWEEN THE HEADFORM AND THE HEAD RESTRAINT BEING TESTED IS NOTED ON THE RECORDINGS USED FOR ANALYZING THE TEST . 
1.4 . TEST PROCEDURE 
1.4.1 . THE SURFACE TO BE TESTED MUST BE SO PLACED THAT THE PENDULUM WILL STRIKE THE SURFACE PERPENDICULAR TO THE POINT CONCERNED . 
1.4.2 . THE HEADFORM MUST STRIKE THE TEST ITEM AT A SPEED OF 24 * 1 KM / H THIS SPEED IS ACHIEVED EITHER BY THE MERE ENERGY OF PROPULSION OR BY USING AN ADDITIONAL PROPELLING DEVICE .
