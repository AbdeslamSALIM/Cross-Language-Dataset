%quot%Illuminating surface of a lighting device%quot% (1.5.7 to 1.5.10) means the orthogonal projection of the full aperture of the reflector in a transverse plane. If the lighting device has no reflector, the definition of item 1.6.2 shall be applied. If the lamp glass (or glasses) extend(s) over part only of the full aperture of the reflector, then the projection of that part only is taken into account. 
In the case of a dipped-beam headlamp, the illuminating surface is limited by the apparent trace of the cut-off on to the lens. If the reflector and glass are adjustable relative to one another, the mean adjustment should be used.%quot% Item 1.6.4 is hereby amended as follows: 
%quot%1.6.4. Apparent surface 
%quot%Apparent surface%quot%, for a defined direction of observation, means the orthogonal projection of the light-emitting surface in a plane perpendicular to the direction of observation (see drawing in Appendix 2) and tangential to the most exterior point of the lens.%quot%
