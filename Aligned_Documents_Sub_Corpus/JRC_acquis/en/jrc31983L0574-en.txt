COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 26 October 1983 amending for the third time Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (83/574/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Article 11 of Directive 76/768/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 83/496/EEC (5), provides that the Commission shall, on the basis of the results of the latest scientific and technical research, submit to the Council appropriate proposals establishing lists of permitted substances; 
Whereas, on the basis of the latest scientific and technical research, a list of substances authorized as ultra-violet filters can be established; 
Whereas the amendments necessary to adapt Annex VII to technical progress must also be adopted in accordance with the procedure of the Committee established by Directive 76/768/EEC; 
Whereas the indication of the expiry date for cosmetic products whose period of stability is less than three years, provided for in Article 6 (1) (c) of Directive 76/768/EEC, is not justified in the case of cosmetic products which may still be used after that period ; whereas indication of the date of minimum durability is therefore more appropriate,
