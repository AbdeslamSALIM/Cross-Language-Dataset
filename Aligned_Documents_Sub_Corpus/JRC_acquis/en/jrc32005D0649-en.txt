Decision No 649/2005/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13&amp;nbsp;April 2005 amending Decision No&amp;nbsp;1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2005 to 2019 
Decision No 649/2005/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 13 April 2005 
amending Decision No 1419/1999/EC establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2005 to 2019 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 151 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions [1], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty [2], 
Whereas: 
(1) Decision No 1419/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture event for the years 2005 to 2019 [3] is geared towards highlighting the wealth, diversity and shared characteristics of European cultures and towards contributing to improving European citizens' mutual knowledge. 
(2) Annex I to Decision No 1419/1999/EC sets out the chronological order in accordance with which the Member States can submit nominations for this event. That Annex is limited to the Member States at the time the Decision was adopted on 25 May 1999. 
(3) Article 6 of Decision No 1419/1999/EC states that that decision may be revised, in particular with a view to the future enlargement of the European Union. 
(4) In the light of the 2004 enlargement, it is important that the new Member States should likewise be able within a short period of time to submit nominations in the context of the European Capital of Culture event, without changing the order for the other Member States so that, from 2009 onwards and until the end of the current Community action, two capitals may be selected each year in the Member States. 
(5) Decision No 1419/1999/EC should therefore be amended, 
HAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS: 
Article 1 
Decision No 1419/1999/EC is hereby amended as follows: 
1. The following Recital shall be inserted: 
"(12a) Whereas account should be taken of the financial consequences of this Decision in such a way as to ensure that there is adequate and appropriate Community funding for the designation of two European Capitals of Culture;"; 
2. Article 2(1) shall be replaced by the following: 
"1. Cities in Member States shall be designated as European Capital of Culture, in turn, as set out on the list contained in Annex I. Up until 2008 inclusive, the designation shall apply to one city of the Member State appearing on the list. From 2009 onwards, the designation shall apply to one city of each of the Member States appearing on the list. The chronological order set out in Annex I may be altered by mutual agreement between the Member States concerned. Each Member State shall submit, in turn, its nomination of one or more cities to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Committee of the Regions. This nomination shall be submitted no later than four years before the event in question is due to begin and may be accompanied by a recommendation from the Member State concerned."; 
3. Annex I shall be replaced by the text appearing in the Annex to this Decision. 
Article 2 
This Decision shall enter into force on the twentieth day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
It shall apply from 1 May 2004.
