Notice regarding the application of anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures in force in the Community following enlargement to include the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania and the possibility of review 
(2006/C 297/04) 
When enlargement takes place on 1 January 2007, all anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures in force will automatically apply to imports into the enlarged twenty-seven Member State Community. Accordingly, these measures will also apply to imports into the two new Member States [1]. On enlargement, there will be a number of pending investigations initiated before 1 January 2007. Should such investigations lead to measures, these will equally apply to imports into the twenty-seven Member State Community. 
The Commission gives notice that it is prepared to review anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard measures pursuant to Article 11 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 [2], Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 [3], and Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 [4] where any interested party so requests and submits evidence that the measures would have been significantly different if they were based on information including the new Member States. In this regard, it should be noted that enlargement per se, in the absence of such evidence, is not a sufficient basis for a review to be initiated. Interested parties are invited to visit the DG Trade trade defence enlargement website:
