Commission Regulation (EC) No 1193/2005 
of 25 July 2005 
amending Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of countries and territories 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC [1], and in particular Articles 10 and 21 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 lays down a list of third countries and territories from which movement of pet animals to the Community may be authorised, provided that certain requirements are met. 
(2) A provisional list of third countries was established by Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 592/2004 [2]. That list includes countries and territories which are free of rabies and countries in respect of which the risk of rabies entering the Community as a result of movements from their territories has been found to be no higher than the risk associated with movements between Member States. 
(3) From information supplied by Argentina it appears that the risk of rabies entering the Community as a result of movements of pet animals from Argentina has been found to be no higher than the risk associated with movements between Member States or from third countries already listed in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. Therefore Argentina should be included in the list of countries and territories set out in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. 
(4) In the interest of clarity that list of countries and territories should be replaced in its entirety. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 is replaced by the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 25 July 2005.
