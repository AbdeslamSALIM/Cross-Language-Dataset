4.1. Name: 
"Jamón de Trevélez" 
Description: Rounded hams, covered with a rind and having the trotter attached. Cured for at least 14, 7 or 20 months depending on the fresh weight of the each ham. The meat is red and shiny when cut, with partial fat infiltration in the muscle tissue. It has a subtle taste, being barely salted. The fat has a greasy consistency and is shiny, yellowish-white and pleasant tasting. 
Geographical area: The production area is in the east of the province of Granada, on the south face of the Sierra Nevada National Park, where factors such as altitude (more than 1200 metres), vegetation, temperature and humidity combine to give the product the unique qualities which have traditionally characterised it. The area comprises the municipalities of Trevélez, Juviles, Busquístar, Pórtugos, La Tahá, Bubión, Capileira and Bérchules. 
Proof of origin: Legs of pork intended to be processed into hams under this PGI are numbered and marked by a seal checked by the Regulatory Board. The Board checks that all cuts of meat bearing the seal in each company in the production area meet the specifications for the PGI ham. The hams are processed in companies listed in the Board's Registers of Meat Salting and Drying establishments. 
- legs weighing between 11,3 and 12,3 kg, 
- legs weighing between 12,3 and 13,5 kg, 
- legs weighing more than 13,5 kg. 
Processing stages: 
Salting: 
The aim of salting is to impregnate the muscle tissue with salt to promote the ubsequent drying of the ham and preserve it in perfect condition. 
Washing: 
After salting, the meat is washed with fresh water to remove the salt deposits on the surface of the ham. 
Post-salting: 
This stage takes place in a natural environment and is designed to slowly and gradually dry the ham to promote the uniform distribution of the salt within the muscle tissue of the meat. 
Drying/Maturation: 
The meat, classified by weight, is transferred to the drying sheds where it is hung up in conditions of natural temperature and humidity. 
During this whole process the hams must shrink by at least 35 % or be cured for at least 3 months more than the minimum laid down for each of the weight categories determined when the legs are received. 
Link Historical link: 
"Jamón de Trevélez" has been known in and linked to the high Alpujarra area for over 200 years. It features in numerous bibliographical references from the 19th century, the most noteworthy of which is the recognition of the quality of "Jamón de Trevélez" in 1862 by Queen Isabel II of Spain. Currently the area is home to many companies that have been specialising in making this type of ham for more than 50 years. 
Natural link: 
"Jamón de Trevélez" owes its particular organoleptic properties to the area in which it is produced (the mid to low Sierra Nevada National Park). It is this combination of environment, climate and vegetation that promotes the development of a specific bacterium needed for the ham. Between 1200 m and 1900 m, the altitude at which "Jamón de Trevélez" is produced, is the area where the Sierra Nevada's holm oaks and its large number of indigenous plant species are found. As regards climate, the area between 1200 m and the Sierra Nevada peaks is a cold zone which has plentiful snow in winter and is cool in summer.
