Whereas sales under this Regulation at prices fixed in advance should be governed by the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 216/69 of 4 February 1969 laying down detailed rules for the disposal of frozen beef purchased by the intervention agencies (7), subject to certain special exceptions on account of the particular use to which these products are to be put; 
Whereas it should be laid down that, in addition to the security provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 216/69, a security is to be provided as guarantee of the use to which products sold under this Regulation are put ; whereas this security should be varied according to the use to which the meat is to be put; 
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76 of 30 June 1976 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1723/77 (9), laid down detailed rules for verification of use or destination of intervention products ; whereas certain of these rules should be applied to sales effected under this Regulation; 
Whereas Article 4 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1134/68 of 30 July 1968 laying down rules for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 653/68 on conditions for alterations to the value of the unit of account used for the common agricultural policy (10) provides that, in the case of transactions carried out pursuant to the common agricultural policy, the sums owed by a Member State or a duly authorized body, expressed in national currency and representing amounts fixed in units of account, should be paid on the basis of the relationship between the unit of account and the national currency which obtained at the time when the transaction or part transaction was carried out; 
Whereas under Article 6 of the abovementioned Regulation the time when a transaction is carried out is considered as being the date on which occurs the (1)OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 24.
