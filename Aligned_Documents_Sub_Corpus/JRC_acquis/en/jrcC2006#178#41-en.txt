Form of order sought

No 289.405. 
- Order the OHIM and Barilla Alimentare s.p.a. to pay the costs of all of the proceedings 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicant puts forward a single ground for annulment based on infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 40/94 on the Community trade mark. The applicant claims that the expression %quot%ORO%quot% (of which the trade mark which is the subject of the dispute consists, or which in any case forms part thereof) has inherent distinctive character; that with reference to the international mark (which is also the subject of the present dispute) part of the relevant public is unaware of the meaning of the word %quot%ORO%quot% and that this is common knowledge and does not have to be proved by the parties; that having regard to the principle of interdependence, given the identity of the goods covered and signs in question, it is sufficient that the earlier sign has only weak distinctiveness. 
The applicant submits moreover that the distinctive character of the word %quot%ORO%quot% is reinforced and/or acquired through use, with regard to both the trade mark %quot%ORO%quot% and the trade mark %quot%ORO SAIWA%quot%. 
The applicant finally submits that the trade marks %quot%ORO%quot% and %quot%ORO SAIWA%quot% on the one hand, and %quot%Selezione ORO BARILLA%quot% on the other hand, are likely to be confused and that in any case there is a likelihood of association between them.
