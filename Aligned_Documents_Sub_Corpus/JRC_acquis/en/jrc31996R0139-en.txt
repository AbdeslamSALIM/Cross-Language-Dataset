COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 139/96 of 22 January 1996 amending Regulations (EC) No 3285/94 and (EC) No 519/94 with respect to the uniform Community surveillance document 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 of 22 December 1994 on the common rules for imports and repealing Regulation (EC) No 518/94 (1) and Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports from certain third countries and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82, (EEC) No 1766/82 and (EEC) No 3420/83 (2) established a common surveillance document for use in cases of prior Community surveillance; whereas the model for the surveillance document, which is identical for both the Regulations, appears in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 3285/94 and in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 519/94; 
Whereas, in the interests of good administrative management and to assist Community operators, the content and layout of the abovementioned surveillance document should be aligned as far as possible on the common import licence forms provided for in Commission Regulations (EC) No 3168/94 (3), (EC) No 3169/94 (4) and (EC) No 1150/95 (5) and in Commission Recommendation No 3118/94/ECSC (6), bearing in mind the technical characteristics of the surveillance document; 
Whereas, under the current arrangements applications for surveillance documents must be made using a special form which itself fulfils the function of a surveillance document once completed and authenticated by the competent national authorities; whereas, in order to simplify the formalities which importers must complete, it should no longer be required that an application for a surveillance document be made using a Community form specially intended for that purpose; whereas the information which must be given in the application for a surveillance document must nevertheless be specified; 
Whereas transitional arrangements expiring on 31 December 1996 should be made for Community surveillance documents already printed and issued by the Member States by the time this Regulation enters into force,
