THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and imports from third countries of equidae(1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Articles 15(a) and 16 thereof, 
(1) Whereas the health conditions and veterinary certification for the temporary admission and imports of registered horses among others from the United Arab Emirates are laid down respectively in Commission Decision 92/260/EEC(2), as last amended by Decision 1999/228/EC(3); and Commission Decision 93/197/EEC(4), as last amended by Decision 1999/252/EC(5); 
(2) Whereas following a second Commission veterinary inspection mission to the United Arab Emirates the animal health situation appears to be under the satisfactory control of the veterinary services and in particular the movement of equidae and their health status are sufficiently controlled; 
(3) Whereas African horse sickness has never been reported in the United Arab Emirates and vaccination against this disease is prohibited for more than one year; whereas moreover a series of serological surveys have been carried out over the entire territory of the country and the satisfactory results have been communicated to the Member States and the Commission; 
(4) Whereas the conditions for imports of equidae into the country concerned are at least as strict as the conditions for imports of equidae into the Community; whereas therefore the country should be considered at low risk of incursion of African horse sickness from outside; 
(5) Whereas the animal health conditions and veterinary certification must be adopted according to the animal health situation of the third country concerned; whereas the present case relates only to registered horses to be temporarily or permanently imported from the United Arab Emirates; 
(6) Whereas Commission Decisions 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC must be amended accordingly; 
(7) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,
