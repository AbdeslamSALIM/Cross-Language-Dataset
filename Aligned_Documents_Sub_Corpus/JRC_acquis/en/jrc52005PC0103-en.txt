Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
On 28 October 2000, the United States of America (‘United States’) enacted the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‘CDSOA’). This legislation mandates the yearly distribution of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the preceding fiscal year to the companies that brought or supported the complaint at the origin of the anti-dumping or countervailing duty order. 
Following a joint request of the Community and 10 other WTO Members (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Thailand), a WTO Panel in September 2002 and the Appellate Body in January 2003 found that the CDSOA provides remedies against dumping or a subsidy which are not allowed by the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures . The two reports were adopted at a special meeting of the Dispute Settlement Body (‘DSB’) on 27 January 2003 thus putting on the United States the obligation to bring its legislation into conformity with the WTO rules. The United States was subsequently awarded until 27 December 2003 to do so. To date, the United States has still not implemented the WTO ruling and recommendation. 
On 26 January 2004, the Community exercised its rights under Article 22.2 of the Understanding on Rules and Procedures governing the Settlement of Disputes (‘DSU’) and requested to the DSB the authorisation to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade 1994 to the United States. 
The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations and the matter was referred to arbitration. In the award circulated on 31 August 2004, the Arbitrator determined that the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community in a particular year was equal to 72% of the amount of disbursements relating to duties paid on imports from the EC for the most recent year for which data are available at that time. The Arbitrator concluded that the suspension by the Community of concessions, in the form of the imposition of an additional import duty above bound customs duties, on a list of products originating in the United States covering, on a yearly basis, a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of nullification or impairment would be consistent with Article 22.4 of the DSU. 
On 10 November 2004, the Community presented a new request to suspend every year the application of its tariff concessions to the United States at a level not exceeding the annual level of nullification or impairment determined in accordance with the result of the arbitration. The suspension of concessions would take the form of an additional import duty on imports from the United States of products selected from an indicative list notified in the request. The DSB granted the requested authorisation on 26 November 2004. The imposition of the additional import duty is postponed to 1 May 2005 so as to leave to the United States the opportunity to bring its legislation into conformity with the WTO ruling and recommendation. 
At the time of adopting the present proposal for a Council Regulation, the most recent distribution for which data were published by the United States’ authorities relates to the disbursements of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the fiscal year 2004. On that basis, the level of nullification or impairment to the Community is USD 27,81 million. 
If the non-implementation of the DSB ruling and recommendation persists, the Commission will, annually, adjust the level of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community by the CDSOA at that time. The Commission will modify the rate of the additional import duty or the list of products subject to the additional import duty in accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in the basic Council Regulation. 
The selection of products was initiated on the basis of the list of United States’ products which would have been subject to an additional import duty if the US had not repealed its safeguard measures on steel (annex II of Council Regulation 1031/2002 of 13 June 2002 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America, OJ L 157 of 15 June 2002, p. 8). Member States presented requests to exclude products from that list or to add products to it. On that basis, the indicative list notified to the WTO was established and subsequently split into two lists: 
- The first list (Annex I of the proposed Regulation) contains those products that will be subject to a 15% ad valorem additional import duty as from 1 May 2005. The effect of the additional import duty over one year on imports of the selected products originating in the United States represents a value of trade that does not exceed USD 27,81 million. 
- The second list (Annex II of the proposed Regulation) is a reserve list. If the level of suspension increases, products may be added to the list of products subject to the additional import duty. The selection of new products will be made from the reserve list in an automatic fashion by following the order of that list. 
Prior to the application of a new level of suspension, the Community will notify to the DSB the new level of suspension, the rate of the additional import duty, the list of products and the amount of imports from the United States of the selected products that will be affected by the measure.

Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION 
establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Whereas: 
On 27 January 2003, the Dispute Settlement Body (‘DSB’) of the World Trade Organisation (‘WTO’), adopted the Appellate Body report ([2]) and the Panel report ([3]), as upheld by the Appellate Body report, finding that the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‘CDSOA’) was incompatible with the United States’ obligations under the WTO agreements. 
Since the United States failed to bring its legislation in conformity with the covered agreements, the Community requested to the DSB the authorisation to suspend the application of its tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 to the United States ([4]). The United States objected to the level of suspension of tariff concessions and related obligations and the matter was referred to arbitration. 
On 31 August 2004, the arbitrators determined that the level of nullification or impairment caused every year to the Community was equal to 72% of the amount of CDSOA disbursements relating to anti-dumping or countervailing duties paid on imports from the Community for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States’ authorities. The Arbitrator concluded that the suspension by the Community of concessions or other obligations, in the form of the imposition of an additional import duty above bound custom duties, on a list of products originating in the United States covering, on a yearly basis, a total value of trade not exceeding the amount of nullification or impairment would be consistent with WTO rules. On 26 November 2004, the DSB granted the authorisation to suspend the application to the United States of tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 in accordance with the decision of the arbitrator. 
The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2004 (1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004). On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 27,81 million. The Community may, therefore, suspend the application of its tariff concessions to the United States at an equivalent amount. The effect of a 15% ad valorem additional import duty on imports of the products in Annex I originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 27,81 million. In respect of these products, the Community shall suspend the application of its tariff concessions to the United States from 1 May 2005. 
If the non implementation of the DSB ruling and recommendation persists, the Commission shall adjust annually the level of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time. The Commission shall amend the list in Annex I or the rate of the additional import duty so that the effect of the additional duty on imports from the United States of the selected products represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the amount of nullification or impairment. 
The Commission shall respect the following criteria: (a) The Commission shall amend the rate of the additional import duty when adding or removing products from the list in Annex I does not allow to adjust the level of suspension to the level of nullification or impairment. Otherwise, the Commission shall add products to the list in Annex I if the level of suspension increases or withdraw products from this list if the level of suspension decreases. (b) If products are added, the Commission shall select the products from the list in Annex II in an automatic fashion by following the order in which the products are listed. As a consequence, the Commission shall also amend the list in annex II by removing from it the products added to the list in annex I. (c) If products are withdrawn, the Commission shall, first, remove products that were added to the list in Annex I at a later stage. The Commission shall then remove products presently in the list in Annex I by following the order of that list. 
The Decision will be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ([5]). 
The origin of any product to which this Regulation applies shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code ([6]). 
Products for which an import licence with an exemption from, or a reduction of, duty has been issued prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation should not be subject to the additional customs duty. 
Products for which it can be proved that they were already en route to the Community on the date of application of this Regulation, and whose destination could not be changed should not be subject to the additional customs duties. 
Imports of a selected product which enjoy relief from the application of import duties pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 ([7]) should not be subject to the additional import duty. 
Products affected by the suspension of concessions should be placed under the customs procedure “Processing under Customs Control” under Part II, Title III, Chapter IV of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 ([8]) only pursuant to an examination in the Committee of the Customs Code. 
To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, the Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication.
