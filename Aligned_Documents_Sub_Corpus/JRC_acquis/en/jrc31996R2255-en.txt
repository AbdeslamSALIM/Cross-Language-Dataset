Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),

Whereas point 1 of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 (4) provides that the Member States may grant aid designed to facilitate the development of more economic transport systems and technologies for the Community in general, and the development of combined transport; 
Whereas the costs of loading and unloading form a significant part of the total cost of transport by inland waterway; whereas it is essential to the development of inland waterway transport for major investments to be made to render loading and unloading installations and equipment for interland waterway terminals more efficient and better suited to the current logistical requirements; whereas, to this end, it is important that aid granted by the Member States or through State resources can be made available to the undertakings concerned; 
Whereas harmonized conditions should be laid down for the granting of this aid for the development of inland waterway transport and whereas the impact of the aid must be assessed at regular intervals; 
Whereas this aid must be granted for a sufficiently long period for the said investment to have the time to win over the market and bring new traffic to inland waterways and whereas the Council should decide on subsequent arrangements, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

The aid granted may not exceed 50 % of the total amount of investment. 
The purpose of the aid shall be to develop new or additional transport tonnage on the inland waterway. The beneficiaries must comply with the detailed arrangements laid down by the Member State concerned and shall be responsible for the actual carrying out of the investment.

The Member States shall provide the Commission with the information needed to draw up this report. 
No later than 31 July 1999 the Council shall decide, on a proposal from the Commission and under the conditions set out in the Treaty, on subsequent arrangements or, where appropriate, on the conditions for terminating the arrangements.`
