ANNEX 
The architecture of the computer systems of the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection is based on n-tier technology, with a client-side browser, a web server for the presentation of information and a separate Oracle database server. Strategic applications are developed in JAVA using BEA Weblogic. The network protocol is IP, and, where necessary for security reasons, a private data-network, TESTA II, and security protocols such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) are used. Data is exchanged between applications using the XML standard. 
Statistical reports are generated from BO (Business Object) and cartographic software.
