Notification of a request under Article 30 of Directive 2004/17/EC 
(2006/C 298/07) 
Request from a Member State 
On 20 November 2006 the Commission received a request under Article 30(4) of Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [1]. The first working day following receipt of the request was 21 November 2006. 
The request, from Denmark, concerns mail services relating to parcels in Denmark. Article 30 of Directive 2004/17/EC stipulates that the Directive shall not apply if the activity in question is directly exposed to competition on markets to which access is not restricted. Assessment of these conditions shall be made exclusively under Directive 2004/17/EC and without prejudice to application of the rules on competition. 
The Commission has a three-month period from 21 November 2006, i.e. until 21 February 2007, within which to take a decision on this request. 
The third subparagraph of Article 30(4) of Directive 2004/17/EC applies. Consequently, the period within which the Commission must take a decision may be extended by one month. Such an extension would be subject to publication.
