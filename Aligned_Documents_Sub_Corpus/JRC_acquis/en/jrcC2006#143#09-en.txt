Re: 
Reference for a preliminary ruling — Corte d'appello di Milano — Interpretation of Articles 4, 10, 43, 48, 49, 82, 86, 87 and 98 EC — Compatibility of national rules relating to the declaration of income which confer on tax advice centres the exclusive right to provide certain consultation and assistance services to undertakings and their employees 
Operative part of the judgment 
1. Articles 43 EC and 49 EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings which reserves exclusively to Tax Advice Centres the right to pursue certain tax advice and assistance activities. 
2. A measure by which a Member State provides for the payment of compensation from State funds to certain undertakings responsible for helping taxpayers in connection with the completion of tax declarations and filing them with the tax authorities must be classified as State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) EC, where: 
- the level of the compensation exceeds what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of public service obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging those obligations, and 
- the compensation is not determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately provided with the means required so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging the obligations.
