COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/60/EEC of 30 June 1992 amending Directive 90/425/EEC concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Whereas the Community is to adopt measures designed to establish the internal market progressively over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; 
Whereas Directive 90/425/EEC (3) provides that veterinary checks on certain live animals and animal products are no longer to be carried out at the Community's internal borders; 
Whereas, since adopting Directive 90/425/EEC, the Council has fixed the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on live animals and animal products entering the Community from third countries; whereas, in this respect, account should be taken of Council Directive 70/675/EEC of 10 December 1990, laying down the principles govering the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (4) and Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (5); 
Whereas the fourth paragraph of Article 21 of Directive 90/452/EEC provides for the inclusion in the scope of the said Directive, and of Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (6) of live animals and products of animal origin not covered by the said Directives; 
Whereas Article 25 of Directive 90/425/EEC stipulates that the arrangements which are to apply when the transitional provisions provided for in Article 24 expire must be determined; whereas, in this regard, account should be taken of the progress made in the Community as regards both the adoption of rules concerning live animals and animal products from third countries and the harmonization of measures to control foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever, specifically Council Directive 90/423/EEC of 26 June 1990 amending Directive 85/511/EEC introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease, Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine and Directive 72/462/EEC on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat or meat products from third countries (7) and Council Directive 91/685/EEC of 11 December 1991 amending Directive 80/217/EEC introducing Community measures for the control of classical swine fever (8); 
Whereas, particularly in the light of the progress made in harmonizing veterinary rules, provision should be made for the abolition, from 1 July 1992, of veterinary checks carried out at internal borders on all live animals and animal products; 
Whereas, however, provision must be made for specific rules concerning the veterinary checks applicable to movements of pets accompanied by and under the responsibility of a natural person, where such movements are not the subject of a commercial transaction,
