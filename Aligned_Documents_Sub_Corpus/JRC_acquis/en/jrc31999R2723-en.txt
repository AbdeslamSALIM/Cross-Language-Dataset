COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2723/1999 
of 17 December 1999 
amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(1), 
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Whereas: 
(1) The area where, and the time-period during which, spawning of a certain herring stock has changed and therefore the special provisions relating to fishing in the said area and during the said time-period have also to be changed; 
(2) Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 850/98(3) contains a number of exemptions for the use of specific fishing gears; these exemptions should apply equally to the gear-type Danish seine; as on oversight, exemptions for this gear were not originally included in that Article; therefore, Danish seine should be included among the exemptions of Article 29; 
(3) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 prohibits the use of purse seines on schools of fish found in association with marine mammals; such use would be acceptable in the case of fishing vessels operating under the conditions agreed within the Agreement for the International Dolphin Conservation Program, which the Community has decided to apply provisionally by Council Decision 1999/386/EC(4); therefore, an exemption clause to that effect should be added to Article 33; 
(4) Annex VI establishes categories of mesh sizes for fixed gears to be used for catching certain species or groups of species; in the light of data made available to the Commission, the mesh size categories for two species of spotted dogfish should be revised; 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 805/98 should therefore be amended,
