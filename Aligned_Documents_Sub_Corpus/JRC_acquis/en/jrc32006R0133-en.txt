Commission Regulation (EC) No 133/2006 
of 26 January 2006 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community [1], and in particular Article 6 thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 [2] lays down the detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons. 
(2) In order to ensure proper implementation of the annual distribution plan for 2006, as established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1819/2005 of 8 November 2005 adopting a plan allocating resources to the Member States to be charged against the 2006 budget year for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community [3], the deadlines set for the withdrawal of dairy products from intervention stocks should be adapted. 
(3) The products to be withdrawn from intervention stocks under the annual plan may be supplied unprocessed or processed for the manufacture of food, or withdrawn in payment for the supply or manufacture of food mobilised on the Community market. In the latter case, the products in intervention stocks which may be withdrawn in payment for the manufacture of cereal products should be specified. The conditions, laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, governing calls for tender for the organisation of supplies in the Member States must in this case be specified accordingly. 
(4) Since intra-Community transport costs are borne by the Community on the basis of the actual costs, as determined by means of calls for tender, it is no longer necessary to make provision for the production of supporting documents concerning the distances covered for reimbursement purposes. 
(5) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1903/2004 [4], lays down that the period for implementing the annual plan ends on 31 December. The deadline for sending annual reports, laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, should therefore be adapted accordingly. 
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 should be amended accordingly. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees concerned,
