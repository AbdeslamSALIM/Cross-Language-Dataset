2006: 
EUR 1380488 from the ERDF and 
EUR 1380488 from Land resources 
Maximum aid intensity: EUR 200000 
Date of implementation: The Directive was published in the Brandenburg Official Gazette No 19 of 8 May 2002 (p. 506). 
Duration of scheme: Until 30 April 2006 
Objective: 
SMEs play a crucial role in job creation and are one of the pillars of social stability and economic dynamism. For these reasons, they should be granted assistance. Owing to a lack of resources, some of them do not possess information on such important matters as new technologies, development of new markets and preventive workplace protection. 
The aid is aimed at improving economic efficiency and safeguarding stable, long-term employment by creating safe and healthy working conditions in SMEs in Brandenburg. The conditions necessary for enhanced productivity will be created by investing in measures to maintain and create competitive jobs and, at the same time, by developing people-friendly forms of work. These conditions will stem from efficient work processes, less absenteeism, smooth production processes and a more motivated and more efficient workforce. 
Aid will be granted only to measures that go beyond the new labour-protection legislation and take account in an innovative fashion of matters to do with the development of means of work, jobs and work processes conducive to the health of the workforce. The measures can be subsumed under the concepts in Article 2(c) and (d) of Regulation (EC) No 70/2001 of 12 January 2001. 
Economic sector(s) concerned: 
All economic sectors 
Aid to firms engaged in the production, processing or marketing of products listed in Annex I to the EC Treaty is excluded, as is the granting of aid for export-related activities and aid contingent upon the use of domestic over imported goods.
