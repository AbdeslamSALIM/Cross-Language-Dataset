Action brought on 13 April 2006 — Oakley v OHIM 
Parties 
Applicant: Oakley, Inc. (Foothill Ranch, USA) (represented by: Michaela Huth-Dierig, lawyer) 
Defendant: Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) 
Other party to the proceedings before the Board of Appeal: Venticinque Ltd (Hailsham, United Kingdom) 
Form of order sought 
- The decision of the First Board of Appeal of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) of January 17, 2006 in appeal R 682/2004-1 to be annulled. 
- The defendant to be ordered to pay the costs. 
Pleas in law and main arguments 
Registered Community trade mark subject of the application for a declaration of invalidity: The word mark %quot%O STORE%quot% for services in class 35 — Community trade mark No 2 074 599 
Proprietor of the Community trade mark: The applicant 
Party requesting the declaration of invalidity of the Community trade mark: Venticinque Limited 
Trade mark right of the party requesting the declaration of invalidity: The earlier national word mark %quot%THE O STORE%quot% for goods and services in classes 18 and 25 
Decision of the Cancellation Division: Partial declaration of invalidity of the Community trade mark 
Decision of the Board of Appeal: Dismissal of both the applicant's and Venticinque Ltd's appeal 
Pleas in law: Infringement of Article 8(1)(b) of Council Regulation No 40/94 as the goods and services are absolutely dissimilar and there is no likelihood of confusion between the conflicting trade marks since the distinctive character of the earlier mark %quot%THE O STORE%quot% is very limited. Furthermore, proof has not been provided that %quot%THE O STORE%quot% is in any way known or well established in the French market.
