Proposal for a 
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
of amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL | 
110 | Grounds for and objectives of the proposal This proposal concerns extending the transposition deadline for Member States and the compliance date for regulated firms of Directive 2004/39/EC on Market in Financial Instruments (MiFID). This is because serious difficulties have been reported by industry and Member States in relation to the ability of regulated entities to comply with the current deadline for transposition of the Directive (30 April 2006). 1. Adoption of implementing measures in practice shortens transposition period The transposition deadline agreed in Council and by the European Parliament was the standard 24 months after the entry into force of the directive. However, a significant part of that transposition period will be taken up by the preparation of the necessary implementing measures for 17 provisions of the directive, which cannot be effective without such measures. Under current planning, the Commission expects to have adopted the complete set of implementing measures by the beginning of 2006. The adoption of these measures cannot be accelerated both because of their complexity, the need to consult widely and building consensus as well as because the process must be carried out in accordance with the comitology procedure specified in Decision 1999/468/EC. Transposition of those provisions of the Directive which are linked to implementing measures cannot proceed until the concomitant implementing measures have been finalised. In fact, this delay in turn affects the timely transposition of other provisions of the Directive related to the provisions that require implementing measures. As a result, Member States will not have sufficient time to complete the transposition of the entire Directive in the period between the expected adoption of the implementing measures (beginning 2006) and the current transposition deadline (April 2006). Therefore in order to ensure the effective and uniform implementation of the MIFID in all Member States from the transposition deadline, it is appropriate to postpone that deadline. 2. Practical implications for the firms The Commission services have been informed by a wide range of industry participants that the current MIFID implementing timetable imposes impossible deadlines for the entities within its scope. These contend that compliance with the MIFID may require significant time consuming modifications to their technological infrastructure, IT software, record-keeping and reporting systems. In addition, firms may have to adapt internal policies and guidelines concerning client relations, the segregation of assets, and the management of conflicts of interest. Moreover, market participants claim not to be able to make definitive decisions as to what operational steps will be needed until implementing measures are finally adopted. Directive 2004/39/EC only sets general principles with respect to these requirements; the precise technical details will be provided for in the implementing legislation which will not be available until year end. |

CONSULTATION OF INTERESTED PARTIES AND IMPACT ASSESSMENT | 
Consultation of interested parties | 
219 | Though no specific consultation has been launched for this proposal its presentation is justified because : - There have been numerous comments from the industry to the Commission, providing extensive evidence that an extension of the deadline for the application of the Directive is essential to allow market participants sufficient time to adapt systems and procedures to comply with the MiFID; - Discussions with Member States in the European Securities Committee have shown that Member States, having consulted their markets and evaluated their transposition needs, are almost unanimously in favour of the proposed extension of both the transposition and application deadlines; - Responses received to a general consultation on legislative procedures in the field of securities markets have indicated very broad support for the extension of transposition deadlines generally in this field; a number of respondents referred to the MiFID as a specific example of a directive the complexity of which justified an extended transposition deadline. - The need to extend deadlines was also confirmed in the 3rd Report of the Inter-institutional Monitoring Group on the monitoring of the Lamfalussy process of 17th November . | 
Collection and use of expertise |

LEGAL ELEMENTS OF THE PROPOSAL | 
305 | Summary of the proposed action The purpose of the present proposal is to remedy to the difficulties that Member States and the industry will face in the transposition and application of the Directive. To this end it is proposed to : - extend the deadline by which Member States must transpose the MiFID into national law by 6 months, i.e. until October 2006; - grant an extra 6 month period, after transposition into national law, for the effective application of the MiFID in order to allow firms sufficient time to adapt their systems and internal procedures so as to comply with the requirements of the Directive i.e. until April 2007. Given the close interaction between the various parts of the MiFID, these proposals apply to the whole Directive (and not just those provisions which will be supplemented by implementing measures). 1. Technical modifications All modifications to Directive 2004/39/EC have been included in one single Article (Article 1). These are : 1) the substitution of the transposition deadline for Member States with the new date of 30.10.06 . 2) a further deadline of 6 months for Member States to defer the application of new domestic laws implementing the MiFID until 30.4.07. 3) A number of further consequential amendments are required to - a. The date of repeal of Directive 93/22/EC (the Investment Services Directive), which is to be replaced by the MiFID, must be postponed by 6 months to coincide with the extended transposition deadline of the MiFID in order to avoid a legislative void. However, it is proposed that Member States should be required to retain their current national regulatory regime implementing Directive 93/22/EC for a further 6 months after that Directive has been repealed in order to avoid a legal void; b. The date of entry into force of the transitional provisions in Article 71. These provisions should come into force at the same time as the full application of the MiFID in Member States; c. The dates by which the Commission is required to produce a series of reports concerning matters relating to the MiFID and its operation. The timetable for reports was designed to allow the Commission to monitor the practical application of the MiFID - and so logically they also should be deferred by 12 months. These modifications are purely technical, and are necessary to preserve the timetable for the various stages of entry into force and the review of the directive. 2. Transposition - entry into force For reasons of coherence the transposition deadline for this proposal has been aligned to the proposed extended transposition deadline (i.e. 30 October 2006) for Directive 2004/39/EC (Article 2). However, national legislation, implementing the previous regime established by Directive 93/22/EC may remain into force until the full application of the MiFID into national law (i.e. 30 April 2007). The proposal, once adopted by the Council and EP should enter into force on the day following that of its publication. This is a proposal of a Directive for modifying a basic Directive providing for harmonisation of authorisation conditions in order to ensure effective freedom of establishment and free provision of services ("coordination directive"). The proposal only includes some technical adaptations strictly linked to the extension of the various deadlines included in the basic Directive; no further substantial modification is provided for in the proposal. | 
310 | Legal basis Article 47(2) of the EC Treaty | 
320 | Subsidiarity principle The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. | 
The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reason(s): | 
321 | see Directive 2004/39/EC | 
Community action will better achieve the objectives of the proposal for the following reason(s): | 
324 | see Directive 2004/39/EC | 
The proposal therefore complies with the subsidiarity principle: | 
Proportionality principle The proposal complies with the proportionality principle for the following reason(s): | 
331 | The proposed extensions are balanced and proportionate. They grant Member States and regulated entities the additional time needed to comply properly with the requirements of the Directive, but do not go beyond what is necessary. | 
Choice of instruments | 
341 | Proposed instruments: Directive. | 
342 | Other means would not be adequate for the following reason(s). Modifying Directive including technical adaptations to Directive 2004/39/EC: A directive can only be modified by another directive. | 
BUDGETARY IMPLICATION | 
409 | The proposal has no implication for the Community budget. | 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION | 
550 | The Member States are required to communicate to the Commission the text of national provisions transposing the Directive. No obligation to provide a correlation table is included in this Directive since this obligation had not been included in the basic Directive either. . |

Proposal for a 
DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL 
of amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines (Text with EEA relevance) 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 47(2) thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission[1], 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty, 
Whereas: 
(1) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC[2] introduces a comprehensive regulatory regime to ensure a high quality of execution of investor transactions. 
(2) Directive 2004/39/EC provides that Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions to comply with that Directive by 30 April 2006 at the latest. In order to ensure uniform application in the Member States, a significant number of complex provisions of that Directive need to be supplemented by implementing measures, to be adopted by the Commission during the period for transposition by Member States. Because Member States cannot fully prepare and finalise their domestic laws until the content of the implementing measures is clear, they may have difficulty in meeting the current transposition deadline. 
(3) In order to comply with the requirements of Directive 2004/39/EC and domestic implementing legislation, investment firms and other regulated entities may have to introduce new Information Technology systems, new organisational structures, and reporting and record-keeping procedures, or to make significant modifications to existing systems and practices. This can only be done once the contents of both the implementing measures to be adopted by the Commission and domestic legislation transposing the Directive are settled. 
(4) It is also necessary that Directive 2004/39/EC and its implementing measures be transposed into national law or apply directly in Member States simultaneously for the Directive to produce its full effect. 
(5) It is therefore appropriate to extend the deadline for Member States to transpose Directive 2004/39/EC into national law. Similarly, the deadline for investment firms and banks to comply with the new requirements should be deferred for a period after the transposition into national law has been completed by the Member States. 
(6) Given the interaction between the different provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC, it is appropriate that any extension of those deadlines apply to all the provisions of that Directive. Any extension of the transposition and application deadlines should be proportionate to, and not exceed, the needs of the Member States and regulated entities. In order to avoid fragmentation that could hamper the functioning of the Internal Market in securities, Member States should apply the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC from the same time. 
(7) Further consequential amendments are necessary to defer the dates for the repeal of Directive 93/22/EEC and for the transitional provisions laid down in Directive 2004/39/EC, and to extend the timetable for the Commission’s reporting obligations. 
(8) Directive 2004/39/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,
