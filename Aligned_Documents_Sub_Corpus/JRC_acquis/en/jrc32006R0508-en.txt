Commission Regulation (EC) No 508/2006 
of 29 March 2006 
amending Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 as regards export licences for milk powder exported to the Dominican Republic 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 30(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 20a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products [2] lays down the rules for administering the milk powder quota for export to the Dominican Republic under the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic, approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC [3]. 
(2) Given an increasing interest for milk powder in retail packs in the Dominican Republic it is appropriate to include the product code 0402 10 11 9000 in the list of products eligible for an export licence under Article 20a of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999. 
(3) Since there might be a considerable period of time between the day on which a licence application has been lodged and the time of actual export, experience has shown that it is very difficult to foresee which will be the final packaging of the product on the day of its export. To solve this problem it should be allowed to switch products provided that they have an identical export refund rate and provided the exporter makes such request before completion of the export formalities. 
(4) Paragraph 4(a) of Article 20a reserves a part of the quota to those exporters who can prove that they have exported the products concerned during each of the three calendar years prior to the period for submission of applications. It appears, due to specific temporary circumstances in the Dominican Republic, that some traditional exporters have not been able to actually export in one of the reference years, although they can prove regularity in their export patterns. It is therefore appropriate to extend the reference period. 
(5) Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

3. The following paragraph 18 is added:
