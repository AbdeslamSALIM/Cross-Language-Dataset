of 9 March 2006 
amending Regulations (EC) No 174/1999, (EC) No 581/2004 and (EC) No 582/2004 as regards the security levels on export licences in the milk sector 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products [1], and in particular Article 31(14) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products [2] establishes the securities to be lodged on the day export licence applications are submitted. 
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 581/2004 of 26 March 2004 opening a standing invitation to tender for export refunds concerning certain types of butter [3] and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 582/2004 of 26 March 2004 opening a standing invitation to tender for export refunds concerning skimmed milk powder [4] provide for the amounts of the tendering security to be lodged before the end of the period during which tenders may be submitted. 
(3) Following the trend of export refunds over the past months, it is appropriate to adjust the level of the securities while still ensuring that they remain sufficiently high to prevent speculative applications. 
(4) It is appropriate, in order to establish a correlation between refund and security amount and aiming at a harmonised approach for all refunds applicable, to fix the tendering securities by way of a percentage of the refund amount. 
(5) Regulations (EC) No 174/1999, (EC) No 581/2004 and (EC) No 582/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,
