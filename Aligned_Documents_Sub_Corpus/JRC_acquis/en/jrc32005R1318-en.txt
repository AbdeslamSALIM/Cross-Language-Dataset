Commission Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;1318/2005 of 11 August 2005 amending Annex II of Council Regulation (EEC) No&amp;nbsp;2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1318/2005 
of 11 August 2005 
amending Annex II of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs [1] and in particular the second indent of Article 13, 
Whereas: 
(1) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 7(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, certain Member States have since 2002 submitted information in view of including certain products in Annex II to that Regulation. 
(2) Industrial lime, a by-product from vacuum salt production from brine found in mountains, is considered essential for specific soil-conditioning and nutrition requirements in some Member States and has been found not to have any harmful impact on the environment. 
(3) Calcium hydroxide has been found to be essential to control a fungal disease in fruit trees in certain climates. The control of this disease in organic production is difficult and requires the use of copper, the use of which can be reduced by applying calcium hydroxide. 
(4) Ethylene is already included in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 as a substance of traditional use in organic farming. It has appeared appropriate to complete the conditions for use of that substance in order to cover, besides bananas, certain other fruits for which ethylene is needed in the production. 
(5) Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION: 
Article 1 
Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation. 
Article 2 
This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. 
Done at Brussels, 11 August 2005.
