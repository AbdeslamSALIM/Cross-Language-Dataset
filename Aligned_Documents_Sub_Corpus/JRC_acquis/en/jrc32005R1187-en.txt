Commission Regulation (EC) No&amp;nbsp;1187/2005 of 22 July 2005 amending Regulation (EEC) No&amp;nbsp;1859/82 concerning the selection of returning holdings for the purpose of determining incomes of agricultural holdings 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1187/2005 
of 22 July 2005 
amending Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 concerning the selection of returning holdings for the purpose of determining incomes of agricultural holdings 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation No 79/65/EEC of 15 June 1965 setting up a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operation of agricultural holdings in the European Economic Community [1], and in particular Article 4(4) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 [2] fixes per Member State the threshold of economic size of returning holdings falling within the field of survey of the farm accountancy data network. 
(2) In the case of Germany, structural changes have lead to a decrease in the number of the smallest holdings and in their contribution to the total output of agriculture. This has made their use for a survey covering the most relevant part of the agricultural activity no longer necessary. It is therefore indicated to raise the threshold from 8 ESU to 16 ESU. 
(3) In the case of Cyprus, the threshold set initially to 1 ESU should be raised to 2 ESU, because the holdings with an economic size smaller than 2 ESU represent only 7 % of the total standard gross margin. The most relevant part of the agricultural activity can therefore be covered with a threshold excluding the smaller holdings. 
(4) The number of returning holdings per Member State to be selected by division is fixed in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82. In the case of Spain, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Finland, the number of returning holdings has remained the same for a long time despite the significant reduction in the number of holdings. The reduction has been accompanied by an increase in the uniformity of the holdings, which is such that it enables satisfactory representation to be achieved on the basis of a smaller sample than the current one. Due to this structural change the number of returning holdings to be selected in Spain, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Finland can be reduced. However, for some divisions in Spain and Italy that number should be increased as a result of improved statistical methodologies used for the selection. 
(5) The number of returning holdings in Malta should be revised based on new information concerning its agricultural structure. 
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1859/82 should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Community Committee for the Farm Accountancy Data Network, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
