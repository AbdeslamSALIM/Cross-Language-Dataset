An appeal against the order made on 26 May 2005 by the Court of First Instance of the European Communities (Second Chamber) in Case T-377/04 between Bart Nijs and the Court of Auditors of the European Communities was brought before the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 10 October 2005 by Bart Nijs, represented by Frì±„nk Rollinger, lawyer.
