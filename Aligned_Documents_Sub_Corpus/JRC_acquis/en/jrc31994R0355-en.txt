COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 355/94 of 14 February 1994 amending Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 setting up a Community system of reliefs from customs duty 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas Article 45 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (4), provides that goods contained in the personal luggage of travellers coming from a third country shall be admitted free of import duties, provided such imports are of a non-commercial nature; 
Whereas, in accordance with Article 47 of Regulation (EEC) No 918/83, the total value of goods admissible free of import duties may not exceed ECU 45 per traveller; whereas, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 47, Member States may reduce this amount to ECU 23 for travellers under 15 years of age; 
Whereas account must be taken of measures in favour of travellers recommended by specialized international organizations, in particular the measures contained in Annex F (3) to the International Convention on the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures; 
Whereas those objectives could be attained by increasing the reliefs; 
Whereas it is necessary to provide, for a limited period, a derogation for Germany taking into account the economic difficulties likely to be caused by the amount of the reliefs, particularly as regards travellers entering the territory of that Member State by land frontiers linking Germany to third countries other than EFTA member countries or by coastal shipping routes from the said countries; 
Whereas there are special links between continental Spain and Ceuta and Melilla,
