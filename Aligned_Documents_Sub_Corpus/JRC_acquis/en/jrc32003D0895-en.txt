(notified under document number C(2003) 4846) 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
(2003/895/EC) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(1), and in particular Article 53(1) thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(2), and in particular Article 22(1) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 2002/251/EC of 27 March 2002 concerning certain protective measures with regard to poultrymeat and certain fishery and aquaculture products intended for human consumption and imported from Thailand(3) was adopted because of the presence of nitrofurans in poultrymeat and shrimps imported from Thailand. 
(2) Decision 2002/251/EC was amended by Decision 2003/477/EC(4) to revoke the systematic checks imposed on shrimp consignments certified after 21 September 2002 and by Decision 2003/559/EC to reduce the systematic checks imposed on consignments of poultrymeat certified after 21 September 2002. Those amendments were based on the results of the tests carried out by the Member States and on the guarantees provided by the competent authority in Thailand. 
(3) The results of the reinforced checks carried out by Member States in poultrymeat imported from Thailand continue to be favourable. Therefore, the reinforced checks imposed by Decision 2002/251/EC, as amended by Decision 2003/559/EC, should no longer be applied to those consignments certified by the Thai authority after the date of 21 September 2002 as having been submitted to a systematic pre-shipment check. Systematic checks should only be maintained for consignments certified prior to that date. 
(4) Decision 2002/251/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
