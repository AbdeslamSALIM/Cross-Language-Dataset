Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2916/95 (3), and in particular Article 15 thereof, 
Whereas Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 25 February 1998 on the trade regime for agricultural products (4) establishes the system of preferences applicable to imports into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey; 
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 779/98 opens with effect from 1 January 1998 new annual tariff quotas for certain poultrymeat products; whereas the quotas are to apply for an indefinite period; 
Whereas provision should be made for the administration of these arrangements by means of import licences; whereas, to that end, notwithstanding Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (6), detailed rules for submission of applications and the particulars which should appear in applications and licences should be laid down; whereas, in addition, provision should be made for licences to be issued after a period of consideration, applying, where necessary, a single acceptance rate;

Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,
