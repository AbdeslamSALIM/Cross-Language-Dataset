THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2), 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of 10 January 1997 extending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 on bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China and levying the extended duty on such imports registered under Commission Regulation (EC) No 703/96(3), and maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000(4), 
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97 of 20 January 1997 on the authorisation of the exemption of imports of certain bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China from the extension by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93(5), and maintained by Regulation (EC) No 1524/2000,

Whereas: 
(1) After the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, which exempted a certain number of bicycle assemblers from the payment of the anti-dumping duty as extended to imports of certain bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 (the %quot%extended anti-dumping duty%quot%), the Commission by successive Decisions published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(6) has exempted additional parties from the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 88/97. 
(2) The Commission was informed from various sources that a number of exempted parties have ceased to exist or have stopped assembling bicycles. 
(3) The Commission informed the parties concerned in writing that it intended to revoke their exemption and gave them the opportunity to comment. The Commission received confirmation from most of these parties that they have ceased the production or the assembling of bicycles. For the remaining parties, the Commission did not receive any comments within the given deadline. 
(4) Consequently, in accordance with the principle of good administration, the exemptions for these parties, which are listed in Article 1 of this Decision, should be revoked,
