- Passengers whose principal place of residence is in Corsica and who use tickets purchased in Corsica, the validity of which is restricted to a stay outside the island of less than 40 days, in order to make a round trip starting from Corsica, other than resident students under 27 years of age, must be entitled to a fare of EUR 42 per leg on Marseille-Corsica routes and a fare of EUR 39 per leg on Nice-Corsica routes all year round on all flights, without capacity restriction. 
- The following categories of passengers must be entitled to a fare of EUR 45 per leg, increased to EUR 50 per leg during the ten-week period from late June to early September, on Marseille-Corsica routes, and to a fare of EUR 42 per leg, increased to EUR 47 per leg during the ten-week period from late June to early September, on Nice-Corsica routes:

In respect of at least 50 % of daily capacity in each direction on each route, carriers must authorise the sale of tickets at the above fares to the above categories of passenger without any restriction whatsoever until the last seat available has been sold. 
For the above categories of passenger, and for residents of Corsica, carriers may require tickets to be issued and paid for by a deadline proportional to the period of advance reservation, in accordance with a table drawn up for that purpose. 
If an abnormal and unforeseeable increase in the cost factors affecting the operation of the routes takes place for which the carriers are not responsible, these maximum fares may be raised in proportion to the increase. The new maximum fares will be notified to the carriers operating the services and will apply within an appropriate period. They will also be communicated forthwith to the European Commission for publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. 
2.3. Continuity of service 
Except in cases of force majeure, the number of flights cancelled for reasons directly attributable to the carrier must not exceed 1 % of the number of flights, other than additional flights, scheduled in any IATA scheduling season.

The carrier may discontinue these services only on the first day of an IATA winter scheduling season, and only after giving at least six months' advance notice. 
Community carriers should be aware that operation of these routes without complying with the public service obligations mentioned above may, in addition to incurring the stipulated administrative and/or legal penalties, lead to their being banned from taking part in any tender procedures organised by the Corsican regional authorities for a period of at least 5 years.
