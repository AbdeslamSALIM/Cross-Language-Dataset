COOPERATION AGREEMENT 
concerning terminology, in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the Swiss Confederation, represented by the Swiss Federal Council, and the European Economic Community (EEC), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM), represented by the Commission of the European Communities 
(88/85/ECSC, EEC, Euratom) 
(Letter from the Commission) 
Brussels, 13 November 1987 
Sir, 
Relations between your country and the European Communities have expanded along with the building of Europe. At the meeting in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984, the Ministers of the Member States of the Communities, the Ministers of the Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and the Commission concluded that the growing economic interdependance of the Communities and the EFTA countries justified particular cooperation on research and development. 
Since 1973, the Commission of the European Communities has been developing a terminological data bank called Eurodicautom, which supplies equivalent terms in the official and working languages of the European Communities. 
Switzerland shares three of the Communities' official and working languages and has made considerable efforts to systemize both its own terminological research and training and European cooperation in this field. 
On 28 September 1979, Switzerland and the European Economic Community exchanged letters defining the general framework for cooperation on the field of information services and in particular the extension into Swiss territory of the Community data-transmission network (Euronet). 
At a time when technological and economic development in Europe is being facilitated by developments in multilingual terminology activity, it is in the interests of the Swiss Federal Council and the Commisssion of the European Communities to cooperate together in the terminological and linguistic field and to promote the use of Eurodicautom and its original software to avoid duplication of effort, to develop the multilingual terminological base offered by Eurodicautom and to ensure the widest possible harmonization of data. 
With a view to achieving this cooperation. I have the honour to put to you the following: COOPERATION AGREEMENT CONCERNING TERMINOLOGY BETWEEN THE SWISS CONFEDERATION, REPRESENTED BY THE SWISS FEDERAL COUNCIL, AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EEC) THE EUROPEAN COAL AND STEEL COMMUNITY (ECSC) AND THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY (EURATOM), REPRESENTED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
