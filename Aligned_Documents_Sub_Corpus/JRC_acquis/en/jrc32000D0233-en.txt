Whereas: 
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6) has laid down the active substances of plant protection products, designated by the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 and identified the notifiers for each active substance.

(10) This decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC(9).
