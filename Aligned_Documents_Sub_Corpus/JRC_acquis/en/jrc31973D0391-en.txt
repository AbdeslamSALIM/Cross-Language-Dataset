Section I Scope 
Article 1 
Consultation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section II shall take place where it is proposed - by the State, any other State organization or any body for credit insurance or finance - to grant or guarantee, fully or partially, foreign credits: - linked to exports of goods or services 
- which depart from the norms listed in Annex I or from any other norm adopted by the Member States. 
Article 2 
The consultation procedure shall be applicable: - whether it concerns supplier credits or financial credits 
- whether these credits form the subject-matter of individual contracts or global credit arrangements as described in Article 3 
- whether the credits are purely private or are sponsored fully or partially, out of public funds. 
Mixed credits combining public and private funds and global private credit arrangements combined with public fund interest subsidies shall for the purpose of this procedure be considered as public credits. 
Article 3 
1. %quot%Global credit arrangement%quot% shall mean any understanding or statement, in whatever form, whereby the intention to guarantee supplier or financial credits or to open financial credits, up to a specified or ascertainable ceiling, and in respect of a connected series of transactions, is made known to a third country or to exporters or to financial institutions. 
The consultation procedure shall be applicable to these global arrangements even where the nature of the transactions has not been specified and no formal commitment has been entered into, without prejudice to the right to decide on each particular contract. 
2. If, in the course of a consultation on the granting of a global arrangement - whether public or private in nature - a Member State or the Commission should request oral consultation and if in the course of this oral consultation five Member States should request that all or some of the individual contracts to be charged to this global arrangement constitute the subject of prior consultations, consultation shall be applicable to such contracts. 
3. Any Member State which has granted a global arrangement shall, at a date subsequent thereto, and every six months thereafter, give notification of the use made of that arrangement.

Article 8 
Where there are changes in the factors justifying departure from the norms or if new basic terms of the credit are proposed which differ from those initially specified by the consulting Member Sate, renewed consultation shall take place under a revised reference. 
If, however, the new terms proposed are more restrictive, the Member State concerned shall be committed only to direct information under the initial reference. 
Article 9

Participants in the aforementioned procedure shall be allowed a maximum period of three working days following receipt of such additional details within which to express their opinion. 
Article 12

However, the possibility of taking an immediate decision on transactions shall be permitted on terms which another Member State has already decided to support;

The notification of such decision shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for which the consulting Member State was unable to take account of any comments, reservations or unfavourable opinions expressed by the partners consulted. 
TITLE II SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
Article 16 
Any Member State may ask any other Member State whether it has knowledge of a transaction which until then has not been the subject of consultation and, in particular, of the credit terms alleged by an exporter or a financial institution. Should no reply to these requests for details be forthcoming within seven calendar days, the enquiring Member State shall be entitled to consider that the Member State consulted has knowledge of this matter and that the alleged credit terms are deemed to have been established. In accordance with the procedure prescribed under Title I, the enquiring Member State shall have the right to institute a consultation while indicating expressly that it is motivated by a competitive situation which is deemed to have been established. 
If consultation has already been initiated by a Member State and another Member State which is called upon to support the same transaction questions the first-mentioned State as to its final position, failure to reply to such questioning on the expiry of a period of five working days shall authorize the enquiring Member State to consider that the Member State thus questioned has supported the matter on the terms indicated during consultation. 
Article 17 
Untied credits departing from the norms set out in Annex I or from any other norm adopted by the Member States shall, within the framework of the Policy Coordination Group for Insurance Credit, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits, entail notification: - of the basic components of credits granted in the course of the preceding quarter; 
- of the use made of untied credits at the close of the preceding year. 
Article 18 
When a Member State concludes with a third country an agreement which refers to the possible grant of credits without specifying the precise terms thereof: - in the case of tied credits, it shall on conclusion of the agreement communicate the main features thereof to the recipients referred to in Article 9; 
- in the case of untied credits, the notifications provided for in Article 17 shall equally apply to such credits. 
Where grants of untied credits are concerned, these shall also be subject to notification as provided in Article 17. 
TITLE III PERIODIC REPORTS 
Article 19 
The Policy Coordination Group for Credit Insurance, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits shall submit half-yearly reports on the application of the procedure referred to in Titles I and II. 
These periodic reports notwithstanding, supplementary reports shall also be drawn up, if the nature and importance of the difficulties encountered in the application of the relevant procedure so require.
