COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 3533/93 of 21 December 1993 amending Regulations (EEC) No 3444/90, (EEC) No 3445/90 and (EEC) No 3446/90, laying down detailed rules for granting private storage aid for pigmeat, beef and veal, and sheepmeat and goatmeat 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 7 (2) and the second subparagraph of Article 22 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 747/93 (4), and in particular Articles 8 (2) and 25 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 363/93 (6), and in particular Article 7 (5) and the second paragraph of Article 28 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (7), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof, 
Whereas there is some ambiguity in the current texts of Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3444/90 (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3792/90 (9), (EEC) No 3445/90 (10) and (EEC) No 3446/90 (11), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1258/91 (12), as regards the penalty to be imposed in the event that the time limit for placing in storage is exceeded; whereas therefore it is necessary to clarify the text on this point; 
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 introduces new agrimonetary arrangements as from 1 January 1993; whereas, under those arrangements, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying the agricultural conversion rates (13) establishes the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates; whereas, therefore, it is necessary to establish the operative event for private storage in the pigmeat sector, provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90, in the beef and veal sector provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3445/90 and in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector, provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3446/90; 
Whereas experience has shown that in certain circumstances, and in particular where excessive use is made of the private-storage aid scheme, there is a risk of abuse in applying it; 
Whereas, therefore, decisions on applications to conclude contracts should be notified only after a period for reflection has elapsed; whereas that period must allow the market situation to be assessed and permit provision to be made, where appropriate, for special measures applying in particular to applications pending; whereas, in order to be able to administer this system, the Commission must have information about the quantities of products for which applications to conclude contracts have been submitted; 
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees for Pigmeat, Beef and Veal and Sheepmeat and Goatmeat, 
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
