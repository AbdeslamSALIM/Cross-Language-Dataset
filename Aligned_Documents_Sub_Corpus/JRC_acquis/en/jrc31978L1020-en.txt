COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 5 December 1978 amending Directives 66/401/EEC, 66/402/EEC and 69/208/EEC on the marketing of fodder plant seed, cereal seed and seed of oil and fibre plants (78/1020/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 100 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), 
Whereas the provisions on the marketing of fodder plant seed, seed of oil and fibre plants provide that, after 1 July 1977, the equivalence of measures taken in third countries concerning official seed examination can no longer be established at national level ; whereas certain equivalence decisions taken at Community level only took effect as from 1 July 1978 ; whereas the period provided for the establishment of equivalence at national level should therefore be extended by one year in order to cover traditional trade patterns which were maintained after 1 July 1977 pending Community decisions; 
Whereas the provisions on the marketing of cereal seed allow seeds which have not been the subject of an official field inspection to be certified officially under certain conditions until 31 December 1978 ; whereas an additional period should be granted in order that the necessary experience for a more general and definitive solution may be acquired,
