2005/0226 (CNS) 
Proposal for a 
COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) 
amending Regulation (EC) No 533/2004 
(presented by the Commission) 
EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM 
This proposal to change the name of the partnership of Croatia from ‘European Partnership’ into ‘Accession Partnership’ is launched in order to align the name of the Croatian Partnership with the name of the Turkey Partnership, as both are candidate countries which have started accession negotiations. In order to make the instrument of the Partnerships more understandable, it is appropriate to have the same name for the Partnerships for both countries which are now in the same stage of their accession process. This is in line with the wording of the 2005 Strategy Paper on enlargement. 
The regulation contains the proposals for the changes in the relevant regulation. The Commission therefore invites the Council to adopt the attached proposed regulation.
