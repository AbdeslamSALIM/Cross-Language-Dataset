Within Council Regulation (EC) No 1920/2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 992/95 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and fishery products originating in Norway and within Council Regulation (EC) No 1921/2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 499/96 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products and live horses originating in Iceland, tariff quotas with order numbers 09.0752, 09.0754, 09.0756, 09.0760, 09.0763, 09.0778 and 09.0792 are opened for certain fishery products "for industrial manufacture". The Regulations do not specify the term "for industrial manufacture". 
In order to ensure a uniform application of these Community tariff quotas the Commission, having heard the views of the Customs Code Committee, Economic tariff questions section, provides the hereafter indicated guidelines. 
1) For the application of the tariff quotas with order numbers 09.0752, 09.0754, 09.0760, 09.0763, 09.0778 and 09.0792, the term "for industrial manufacture" should be understood as following: 
"The tariff quotas shall apply to products intended to undergo any operation, except where they are intended to undergo exclusively one or more of the following operations: cleaning, gutting, tailing, heading, cutting, sampling, sorting, labelling, packing, chilling, freezing, deep freezing, thawing and separation. 
However, the tariff quotas shall apply to products intended to undergo the following cutting operations: dicing, filleting, production of flaps, cutting of frozen blocks or splitting of frozen interleaved fillet blocks. 
The tariff quotas do not apply for products intended to undergo operations qualifying for the tariff quotas where such operations are carried out at retail or catering level. 
The concession on the customs duties within the tariff quotas shall apply only to fish intended for human consumption." 
2) For the application of the tariff quota with order number 09.0756, the term "for industrial manufacture" should be understood as following:
