Pleas in law and main arguments 
The applicant contests the decision of the Commission of 7 December 2005 addressed to the French Republic, Ireland and the Italian Republic relating to a series of Council Decisions authorising exemptions from excise duty on mineral oils used for alumina production in Gardanne, in the Shannon region and in Sardinia. In the contested decision, the Commission found that the exemptions constituted State aid. 
In support of its application, the applicant submits that it had the right to expect that the present exemption, proposed by the Commission and unanimously approved by Council Decision 2001/224/EEC [1] until the end of December 2006 is a legally valid Community act and that any act taken by the Italian State and the applicant to implement and rely on these measures would not lead to an unlawful result. According to the applicant, it had the right to expect that the monies foregone by the Italian State in accordance with the exemptions legally granted would not be recovered in any event. The Commission, by claiming that the application of the exemptions was a State aid recoverable from 3 February 2002 until 31 December 2003, has therefore allegedly violated the applicant's rights in respect of the principle of legitimate expectations, the principles of legal certainty, presumption of validity, %quot%lex specialis%quot% and %quot%effet utile%quot%, as well as the principle of good administration. 
Furthermore it is submitted that in deciding that the applicant's legitimate expectation came to an end on 2 February 2002, the Commission failed to take the appropriate period over which any investments were to be made and amortised relating to the applicant's plant into account. The Commission has, therefore, allegedly failed to state the reasons underlying the contested decision.
