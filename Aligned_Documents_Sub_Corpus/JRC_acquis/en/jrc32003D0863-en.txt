THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Decision 98/258/EC of 16 March 1998 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in trade in live animals and animal products(1), and in particular Article 3 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat from third countries(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(3), and in particular Article 11(2) and Article 22(2) thereof, and the corresponding provisions of the other directives establishing sanitary conditions and models of certificates for the importation of live animals and animal products from third countries,

(2) Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(4), as last amended by Commission Decision 2003/721/EC(5), provides for special certification requirements for animals and products of animal origin to prevent the spread of animal and human diseases. 
(3) Article 10 of Directive 92/118/EEC requires that gelatine and collagen for human consumption intended for import into the EC must be accompanied by a health certificate corresponding to the specimen drawn up in Annex II, chapter 4.

(5) It is appropriate for the Community to implement the recognition of equivalence so granted to the United States on a provisional basis, pending confirmation by the United States of their approval of the changes made to the Agreement. 
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
