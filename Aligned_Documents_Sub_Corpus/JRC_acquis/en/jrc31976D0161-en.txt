COUNCIL DECISION of 8 December 1975 establishing a common procedure for the setting up and constant updating of an inventory of sources of information on the environment in the Community (76/161/EEC) 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2), 
Whereas the programme of action of the European Communities on the environment (3) provides for the preparation of a permanent inventory of sources of information on the environment and its integration, as a Community contribution, into the International Referral System (IRS) of the United Nations Environment Programme, into other appropriate international systems and into the European Documentation Network referred to in Council Decision 75/200/EEC of 18 March 1975 adopting an initial three-year Community plan of action in the field of scientific and technical information and documentation (4); 
Whereas this inventory could facilitate the access to existing sources of information for all users in the Community, particularly for those responsible for the supervision, protection and management of the environment ; whereas it will also make it possible to determine what coordination or harmonization of information sources would be desirable, to propose the creation of new systems of information on the basis of requirements not yet covered and to integrate such sources into a harmonized European network; 
Whereas such an inventory seems necessary in order to achieve, within the context of the functioning of the common market, one of the objectives of the Community in the field of protection of the environment and of the quality of life ; whereas the powers of action required in this matter were not provided for in the Treaty; 
Whereas this inventory, which will be published by the Commission in the form of an inventory of sources of information on the environment in the Community, must make known for each Member State the scientific and technical information and documentation centres, the specialist centres and independent experts and the current or scheduled research projects; 
Whereas, in order that an inventory can be drawn up, the Member States must forward to the Commission the information relating to the different national sources of information ; whereas an updating procedure for the inventory should also be established,
