Directive 2001/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 November 2001 relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC 
Directive 2001/85/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 20 November 2001 
relating to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and amending Directives 70/156/EEC and 97/27/EC 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1), 
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2), 
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 25 June 2001, 
Whereas: 
(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured. It is important to adopt measures to that end. 
(2) The technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate, inter alia, to special provisions for vehicles used for the carriage of passengers comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat. 
(3) Those requirements differ from one Member State to another. 
(4) Owing to differences in technical prescriptions, these vehicles have been prevented from being put on to the Community market. The adoption of harmonised requirements by all of the Member States in place of their national regulations should facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market for these vehicles. 
(5) It is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to, or in place of, their existing rules in order, in particular, to allow the EC type-approval procedure which is the subject of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4) to be applied in respect of each type of vehicle. 
(6) This Directive is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure, which was established by Directive 70/156/EEC. 
(7) To acknowledge advances already made in order to improve accessibility for persons of reduced mobility to vehicles of Classes I and II, existing types of vehicle should be permitted to have a steeper slope in parts of the gangway than new types of vehicle. 
(8) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the avoidance of barriers to trade within the Community through the application of EC vehicle type-approval for such vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States on account of the scale and impact of the action proposed in the sector in question, and can therefore be better attained at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives. 
(9) In order to distinguish between existing and new types of vehicle, it is necessary to refer to Council Directive 76/756/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles and their trailers(5). 
(10) It is desirable to take account of the existing technical requirements adopted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) in its Regulation No 36 (%quot%Uniform Provisions concerning the Approval of Large Passenger Vehicles with regard to their General Construction%quot%), its Regulation No 52 (%quot%Uniform Provisions concerning the Construction of Small-Capacity Public Service Vehicles%quot%), its Regulation No 66 (%quot%Uniform Provisions Concerning the Approval of Large Passenger Vehicles with regard to the Strength of their Superstructure%quot%) and its Regulation No 107 (%quot%Uniform Provisions concerning the Approval of Double-Deck Large Passenger Vehicles with regard to their General Construction%quot%), which are annexed to the Agreement of 20 March 1958 concerning the adoption of uniform conditions for approval and reciprocal recognition of approval for motor vehicle equipment and parts. 
(11) While the principal aim of this Directive is to guarantee the safety of passengers, it is also necessary to provide technical prescriptions to allow accessibility for persons of reduced mobility to the vehicles covered by the Directive, in accordance with the Community transport and social policies. Every effort must be made to improve access to these vehicles. To this end, accessibility for persons of reduced mobility can be achieved either by technical solutions applied to the vehicle, as covered by this Directive, or by combining them with appropriate local infrastructure to guarantee access for wheelchair users. 
(12) As a result of the foregoing, it is necessary to amend Directive 70/156/EEC and Directive 97/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 1997 relating to the masses and dimensions of certain categories of motor vehicles and their trailers(6). 
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7),

7.6.1.2. The minimum number of service doors in each rigid section of an articulated vehicle shall be one except that this minimum number shall be two in the case of the front section of an articulated vehicle of Class I. 
7.6.1.3. For the purpose of this requirement, service doors equipped with a power operated control system shall not be deemed to be emergency doors unless they can be readily opened by hand, once the control prescribed in paragraph 7.6.5.1 has been activated if necessary. 
7.6.1.4. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
Escape hatches can only count as one of the abovementioned number of emergency exits. 
7.6.1.5. Each rigid section of an articulated vehicle shall be treated as a separate vehicle for the purpose of determining the minimum number and the position of exits, except for 7.6.2.4. Toilet compartments or galleys are not considered to be separate compartments for the purposes of defining the number of emergency exits. A number of passengers shall be determined for each rigid section. 
7.6.1.6. A double service door shall count as two doors and a double or multiple window as two emergency windows. 
7.6.1.7. If the driver's compartment does not provide access to the passenger compartment by means of a passageway complying with one of the conditions described in paragraph 7.7.5.1.1, the following conditions shall be met: 
7.6.1.7.1. the driver's compartment shall have two exits, which shall not both be in the same lateral wall; when one of the exits is a window, it shall comply with the requirements set out in paragraphs 7.6.3.1 and 7.6.8 for emergency windows; 
7.6.1.7.2. one or two seats are permitted alongside the driver for additional people, in which case both the exits referred to in paragraph 7.6.1.7.1 shall be doors. The driver's door shall be accepted as the emergency door for the occupants of those seats, provided that the driver's seat, the steering wheel, the engine housing, the gear lever, the hand brake control, etc. do not constitute too great an obstruction. The door provided for those additional people shall be accepted as the emergency door for the driver. Up to five additional seats may be fitted in a compartment incorporating the driver's compartment, provided that the additional seats and the space for these seats comply with all requirements of this Directive and at least one door giving access to the passenger compartment complies with the requirements of paragraph 7.6.3 for emergency doors; 
7.6.1.7.3. in the circumstances described in paragraphs 7.6.1.7.1 and 7.6.1.7.2, the exits provided for the driver's compartment shall not count as one of the doors required by paragraphs 7.6.1.1 to 7.6.1.2, nor as one of the exits required by paragraph 7.6.1.4, except in the case mentioned in paragraphs 7.6.1.7.1 and 7.6.1.7.2. Paragraphs from 7.6.3 to 7.6.7, 7.7.1, 7.7.2 and 7.7.7 shall not apply to such exits. 
7.6.1.8. If the driver's compartment and seats adjacent to it are accessible from the main passenger compartment by means of a passageway complying with one of the conditions described in paragraph 7.7.5.1.1, no external exit is required from the driver's compartment. 
7.6.1.9. If a driver's door or other exit from the compartment is provided in the circumstances described in paragraph 7.6.1.8, it may only count as an exit for passengers provided: 
7.6.1.9.1. it is not necessary to squeeze between the steering wheel and the driver's seat, in order to make use of that exit; 
7.6.1.9.2. it satisfies the requirements relating to the dimensions of emergency doors indicated in paragraph 7.6.3.1. 
7.6.1.10. Paragraphs 7.6.1.8. and 7.6.1.9 do not preclude there being a door or other barrier between the driver's seat and the passenger compartment, provided that this barrier can be released quickly by the driver in an emergency. A driver's door in a compartment protected by such a barrier shall not be counted as an exit for passengers. 
7.6.1.11. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
7.6.2. Siting of exits 
Vehicles having a capacity exceeding 22 passengers shall meet the requirements shown below. Vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers may meet either the requirements shown below or those contained in Annex VI, paragraph 1.2. 
7.6.2.1. The service door(s) shall be situated on the side of the vehicle that is nearer to the side of the road corresponding to the direction of traffic in the country in which the vehicle is to be licensed for operation and at least one of them shall be in the forward half of the vehicle. This does not preclude the provision of a door in the rear face of a vehicle for use by wheelchair passengers. 
7.6.2.2. Two of the doors referred to in paragraph 7.6.1.1 shall be separated such that the distance between transverse vertical planes through their centres of area is not less than 40 % of the overall length of the passenger compartment. If one of these two doors forms part of a double door this distance shall be measured between the two doors which are furthest apart. 
7.6.2.3. The exits shall be placed in such a way that their number on each of the two sides of the vehicle is substantially the same. 
7.6.2.4. At least one emergency exit shall be situated either in the rear face or in the front face of the vehicle respectively. For Class I vehicles and for vehicles with a rear part permanently closed off from the passenger compartment, this requirement is fulfilled if an escape hatch is fitted. 
7.6.2.5. The exits on the same side of the vehicle shall be suitably spaced out along the length of the vehicle. 
7.6.2.6. A door shall, provided that it is not a service door, be permitted in the rear face of the vehicle. 
7.6.2.7. If escape hatches are fitted they shall be positioned as follows: if there is only one hatch, it shall be situated in the middle third of the vehicle; if there are two hatches, they shall be separated by a distance of at least 2 m measured between the nearest edges of the apertures in a line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. 
7.6.3. Minimum dimensions of exits 
7.6.3.1. 
%gt%TABLE%gt% 
7.6.3.2. Vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers may meet either the requirements shown in paragraph 7.6.3.1 or those contained in Annex VI, paragraph 1.1. 
7.6.4. Technical requirements for all service doors 
7.6.4.1. Every service door shall be capable of being easily opened from inside and from outside the vehicle when the vehicle is stationary (but not necessarily when the vehicle is moving). However, this requirement shall not be construed as precluding the possibility of locking the door from outside, provided that the door can always be opened from the inside. 
7.6.4.2. Every control or device for opening a door from the outside shall be between 1000 and 1500 mm from the ground and not more than 500 mm from the door. In vehicles of Classes I, II and III every control or device for opening a door from the inside shall be between 1000 and 1500 mm from the upper surface of the floor or step nearest to the control and not more than 500 mm from the door. This shall not apply to controls located within the driver's area. 
7.6.4.3. Every one-piece manually-operated service door which is hinged or pivoted shall be so hinged or pivoted that if the open door comes into contact with a stationary object while the vehicle is moving forwards it tends to close. 
7.6.4.4. If a manually-operated service door is fitted with a slam lock it shall be of the two-stage type. 
7.6.4.5. On the inside of a service door there shall not be any device intended to cover the inside steps when the door is closed. This does not exclude the presence in the step well, when the door is closed, of the door-operating mechanism and other equipment attached to the inside of the door which does not form an extension of the floor on which passengers may stand. This mechanism and equipment should not be dangerous for the passengers. 
7.6.4.6. If the direct view is not adequate, optical or other devices shall be installed to enable the driver to detect from his seat the presence of a passenger in the immediate interior and exterior vicinity of every side service door which is not an automatically operated service door. In the case of a service door in the rear face of the vehicle not exceeding 22 passengers, this requirement is satisfied if the driver is able to detect the presence of a person 1,3 m tall standing 1 m behind the vehicle. 
7.6.4.7. Every door which opens towards the interior of the vehicle and its mechanism shall be so constructed that its movement is not likely to cause injury to passengers in normal conditions of use. Where necessary, appropriate protection devices shall be fitted. 
7.6.4.8. If a service door is located adjacent to a door to a toilet or other internal compartment the service door shall be proofed against unintentional operation. However, this requirement shall not apply if the door is locked automatically when the vehicle is moving at a speed exceeding 5 km/h. 
7.6.4.9. In the case of vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers, the service doors of which are in the rear face of the vehicle, the leaves shall not be capable of being opened more than 115 ° nor less than 85 ° and, when open, shall be capable of being held automatically in that position. This does not preclude the ability to override that stop and open the door beyond that angle when it is safe to do so; for example, to enable reversing against a high platform for loading or to open the doors through 270 ° to allow a clear loading area behind the vehicle. 
7.6.5. Additional technical requirements for power-operated service doors 
7.6.5.1. In the event of an emergency, every power-operated service door shall be capable, when the vehicle is stationary (but not necessarily when the vehicle is moving), of being opened from inside and, when not locked, from outside by controls which, whether or not the power supply is operating: 
7.6.5.1.1. override all other door controls; 
7.6.5.1.2. in the case of interior controls, are placed on, or within 300 mm of, the door, at a height of not less 1600 mm above the first step; 
7.6.5.1.3. can be easily seen and clearly identified, when approaching the door and when standing in front of the door and if additional to the normal opening controls, be clearly marked for emergency use. 
7.6.5.1.4. can be operated by one person when standing immediately in front of the door; 
7.6.5.1.5. cause the door to open, or enable the door to be easily opened by hand; 
7.6.5.1.6. may be protected by a device which can be easily removed or broken to gain access to the emergency control; the operation of the emergency control, or the removal of a protective cover over the control, shall be indicated to the driver both audibly and visually, and 
7.6.5.1.7. in the case of a driver-operated door which does not comply with the requirements of paragraph 7.6.5.6.2, it shall be such that after the controls have been operated to open the door and returned to their normal position, the door will not close again until the driver subsequently operates a closing control. 
7.6.5.2. A device may be provided which is operated by the driver from the driving seat to deactivate the outside emergency controls in order to lock the service doors from outside. In this case, the outside emergency controls shall be reactivated automatically either by the starting of the engine or before the vehicle reaches a speed of 20 km/h. Subsequently, deactivation of the outside emergency controls shall not occur automatically, but shall require a further action by the driver. 
7.6.5.3. Every driver-operated service door shall be capable of operation by the driver when in the driving seat using controls which, except in the case of a foot control, are clearly and distinctively marked. 
7.6.5.4. Every power-operated service door shall activate a visual tell-tale, which shall be plainly visible to the driver when seated in the normal driving position in any ambient lighting condition, to warn that a door is not fully closed. This tell-tale shall signal whenever the rigid structure of the door is between the fully open position and a point 30 mm from the fully closed position. One tell-tale may serve for one or more doors. However, no such tell-tale shall be fitted in respect of a front service door which does not comply with the requirements of 7.6.5.6.1.1 and 7.6.5.6.1.2. 
7.6.5.5. Where controls are provided for the driver to open and close a power operated service door, they shall be such that the driver is able to reverse the movement of the door at any time during the closing or opening process. 
7.6.5.6. The construction and control system of every power-operated service door shall be such that a passenger is unlikely to be injured by the door or trapped in the door as it closes. 
7.6.5.6.1. This requirement shall be considered satisfied if the following two requirements are met. 
7.6.5.6.1.1. The first requirement is that when the closing of the door at any measuring point described in Annex V is resisted by a clamping force not exceeding 150 N, the door shall reopen automatically to its fullest extent and, except in the case of an automatically-operated service door, remain open until a closing control is operated. The clamping force may be measured by any method to the satisfaction of the competent authority. Guidelines are given in Annex V to this Directive. The peak force may be higher than 150 N for a short time provided that it does not exceed 300 N. The reopening system may be checked by means of a test bar having a section of height 60 mm, width 30 mm with corners radiused to 5 mm. 
7.6.5.6.1.2. The second requirement is that whenever the doors are closed onto the wrist or fingers of a passenger: 
7.6.5.6.1.2.1. the door reopens automatically to its fullest extent and, except in the case of an automatically operated service door, remains open until a closing control is operated, or 
7.6.5.6.1.2.2. the wrist or fingers can be readily extracted from the doors without risk of injury to the passenger. This requirement may be checked by hand, or by means of the test bar mentioned in paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.1, tapered at one end over a length of 300 mm from a thickness of 30 mm to a thickness of 5 mm. It shall not be treated with polish nor lubricated. If the door traps the bar it shall be capable of being easily removed, or 
7.6.5.6.1.2.3. the door is maintained at a position allowing the free passage of a test bar having a section of height 60 mm, width 20 mm, with corners radiused to 5 mm. This position shall not be more than 30 mm distant from the fully closed position. 
7.6.5.6.2. In the case of a front service door the requirement of paragraph 7.6.5.6 shall be considered satisfied if the door: 
7.6.5.6.2.1. fulfils the requirements of paragraphs 7.6.5.6.1.1 and 7.6.5.6.1.2, or 
7.6.5.6.2.2. is fitted with soft edges; these shall not, however be so soft that if the doors are closed on the test bar mentioned in paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.1 the rigid structure of the doors will reach the fully closed position. 
7.6.5.7. Where a power-operated service door is held closed only by continued application of the power supply there shall be provided a visual warning device to inform the driver of any failure in the power supply to the doors. 
7.6.5.8. A starting prevention device, if fitted, shall be effective only at speeds of less than 5 km/h and shall be incapable of operation above that speed. 
7.6.5.9. If the vehicle is not fitted with a starting prevention device, an audible warning to the driver shall be activated if the vehicle is driven away from rest when any power-operated service door is not fully closed. This audible warning shall be activated at a speed exceeding 5 km/h for doors complying with the requirements of paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.2.3. 
7.6.6. Additional technical requirements for automatically operated service doors 
7.6.6.1. Activation of the opening controls 
7.6.6.1.1. Except as provided in paragraph 7.6.5.1, the opening controls of every automatically operated service door shall be capable of being activated and deactivated only by the driver from his seat. 
7.6.6.1.2. Activation and deactivation may be either direct, by means of a switch, or indirect, for example by opening and closing the front service door. 
7.6.6.1.3. Activation of the opening controls by the driver shall be indicated inside and, where a door is to be opened from outside, also on the outside of the vehicle; the indicator (e.g. illuminated push-button, illuminated sign) shall be on or adjacent to the door to which it relates. 
7.6.6.1.4. In the case of direct actuation by means of a switch, the functional state of the system shall be clearly indicated to the driver, by, for example, the position of the switch or an indicator lamp or an illuminated switch. The switch shall be specially marked and arranged in such a way that it cannot be confused with other controls. 
7.6.6.2. Opening of automatically operated service doors 
7.6.6.2.1. After activation of the opening controls by the driver, it shall be possible for passengers to open the door as follows: 
7.6.6.2.1.1. from inside, for example by pressing a push-button or passing a light barrier, and 
7.6.6.2.1.2. from outside, except in the case of a door intended only as an exit and marked as such, by, for example, pressing an illuminated push-button, a push-button beneath an illuminated sign, or a similar device marked with a suitable instruction. 
7.6.6.2.2. The pressing of the push-buttons mentioned in paragraph 7.6.6.2.1.1, and the use of the means of communication with the driver mentioned in paragraph 7.7.9.1, may send a signal which is stored and which, after the activation of the opening controls by the driver, effects the opening of the door. 
7.6.6.3. Closing of automatically operated service doors 
7.6.6.3.1. When an automatically operated service door has opened it shall close again automatically after a time interval has elapsed. If a passenger enters or leaves the vehicle during this time interval, a safety device (e.g. a footboard contact, light barrier, one-way gate) shall ensure that the time until the door closes is sufficiently extended. 
7.6.6.3.2. If the passenger enters or leaves the vehicle while the door is closing, the closing process shall be interrupted automatically and the door shall return to the open position. The reversal may be actuated by one of the safety devices referred to in paragraph 7.6.6.3.1 or by any other device. 
7.6.6.3.3. A door that has closed automatically in accordance with paragraph 7.6.6.3.1 shall be capable of being opened again by a passenger in accordance with paragraph 7.6.6.2; this shall not apply if the driver has deactivated the opening controls. 
7.6.6.3.4. After deactivation of the opening controls of the automatically operated service doors by the driver, open doors shall close in accordance with paragraphs 7.6.6.3.1 to 7.6.6.3.2.

7.6.7. Technical requirements for emergency doors 
7.6.7.1. Emergency doors shall be capable of being easily opened from inside and from outside when the vehicle is stationary. However, this requirement shall not be construed as precluding the possibility of locking the door from the outside, provided that the door can always be opened from the inside by the use of the normal opening mechanism. 
7.6.7.2. Emergency doors, during their use as such, shall not be of the power-operated type unless, once the control prescribed in paragraph 7.6.5.1 has been actuated and returned to its normal position, the doors do not close again until the driver subsequently operates a closing control. They shall also not be of the sliding type except in the case of vehicles having a capacity not exceeding 22 passengers. For these vehicles a sliding door, which has been shown to be capable of being opened without the use of tools after a frontal barrier collision test in accordance with Directive 74/297/EEC, can be accepted as an emergency door. 
7.6.7.3. Every control or device for opening an emergency door from the outside shall be between 1000 and 1500 mm from the ground and not more than 500 mm from the door. In vehicles of Classes I, II and III every control or device for opening a emergency door from the inside shall be between 1000 and 1500 mm from the upper surface of the floor or step nearest to the control and be not more than 500 mm from the door. This shall not apply to controls located within the drivers area. 
7.6.7.4. Hinged emergency doors fitted to the side of the vehicle shall be hinged at their forward edge and shall open outwards. Check-straps, chains or other restraining devices shall be permitted, provided that they do not prevent the door from opening to, and remaining open at, an angle of at least 100 °. If a means is provided sufficient to give free passage to the emergency door access gauge, the 100 ° minimum angle shall not apply. 
7.6.7.5. Emergency doors shall be proofed against unintentional operation. However, this requirement shall not apply if the emergency door is locked automatically when the vehicle is moving at a speed exceeding 5 km/h. 
7.6.7.6. All emergency doors shall be provided with an audible device to warn the driver when they are not securely closed. The warning device shall be operated by movement of the door catch or handle and not by movement of the door itself. 
7.6.8. Technical requirements for emergency windows 
7.6.8.1. Every hinged or ejectable emergency window shall open outwards. Ejectable types shall not become totally detached from the vehicle when operated. The operation of ejectable windows shall be such that inadvertent ejection is effectively prevented. 
7.6.8.2. Every emergency window shall: 
7.6.8.2.1. either be capable of being easily and instantaneously operated from inside and from outside the vehicle by means of a device recognised as satisfactory, or 
7.6.8.2.2. be made of readily breakable safety glass. This latter provision precludes the possibility of using panes of laminated glass or of plastic material. A device shall be provided adjacent to each emergency window, readily available to persons inside the vehicle, to ensure that each window can be broken. 
7.6.8.3. Every emergency window which can be locked from the outside shall be so constructed as to be capable of being opened at all times from inside the vehicle. 
7.6.8.4. If the emergency window is of a type horizontally hinged at the top edge, an appropriate device shall be provided to hold it fully open. Every hinged emergency window shall operate so as not to obstruct clear passage from inside or outside the vehicle. 
7.6.8.5. The height of the lower edge of an emergency window fitted in the side of the vehicle from the general level of the floor immediately below it (excluding any local variations such as the presence of a wheel or transmission housing) shall be not more than 1200 mm nor less than 650 mm in the case of a hinged emergency window, or 500 mm in the case of a window made of breakable glass. 
However, in the case of a hinged emergency window, the height of the lower edge may be reduced to a minimum of 500 mm provided that the window aperture is equipped with a guard up to a height of 650 mm to prevent the possibility of passengers falling out of the vehicle. Where the window aperture is equipped with a guard, the size of the window aperture above the guard shall not be less than the minimum size prescribed for an emergency window. 
7.6.8.6. Every hinged emergency window which is not clearly visible from the driver's seat shall be fitted with an audible warning device to warn the driver when it is not completely closed. The window lock, and not the movement of the window itself, shall actuate this device. 
7.6.9. Technical requirements for escape hatches 
7.6.9.1. Every escape hatch shall operate so as not to obstruct the clear passage from inside or outside the vehicle. 
7.6.9.2. Roof escape hatches shall be either ejectable, hinged or made of readily breakable safety glass. Floor hatches shall be either hinged or ejectable and shall be fitted with an audible warning device to warn the driver when it is not securely closed. The floor escape hatch lock, and not the movement of the hatch itself, shall actuate this device. Floor escape hatches shall be proofed against unintentional operation. However this requirement shall not apply if the floor hatch is locked automatically when the vehicle is moving at a speed exceeding 5 km/h. 
7.6.9.3. Ejectable types shall not become totally detached from the vehicle when operated such that the hatch is not a danger to other road users. The operation of ejectable escape hatches shall be such that inadvertent operation is effectively prevented. Floor ejectable hatches shall eject only into the passenger compartment. 
7.6.9.4. Hinged escape hatches shall hinge along the edge towards the front or rear of the vehicle and shall hinge through an angle of at least 100 °. Hinged floor escape hatches shall hinge into the passenger compartment. 
7.6.9.5. Escape hatches shall be capable of being easily opened or removed from the inside and from the outside. However, this requirement shall not be construed as precluding the possibility of locking the escape hatch for the purpose of securing the vehicle when unattended, provided that the escape hatch can always be opened or removed from the inside by the use of the normal opening or removal mechanism. In the case of a readily breakable hatch, a device shall be provided adjacent to the hatch, readily available to persons inside the vehicle, to ensure that the hatch can be broken. 
7.6.10. Technical requirements for retractable steps 
Retractable steps if fitted shall comply with the following requirements: 
7.6.10.1. the operation of retractable steps may be synchronised with that of the corresponding service or emergency door; 
7.6.10.2. when the door is closed no part of the retractable step shall project more than 10 mm beyond the adjacent line of the bodywork;

7.6.10.4. in the case of a power-operated step, it shall not be possible for the vehicle to move from rest, under its own power, when the step is in the extended position. In the case of a manually operated step, an audible indication shall alert the driver when the step is not fully retracted; 
7.6.10.5. a power-operated step shall not be capable of being extended when the vehicle is in motion. If the device to operate the step fails, the step shall retract and remain in the retracted position. However, the operation of the corresponding door shall not be hindered in the event of such a failure or by the step being damaged or obstructed; 
7.6.10.6. when a passenger is standing on a power-operated retractable step, the corresponding door shall be incapable of being closed. Compliance with this requirement shall be checked by placing a mass of 15 kg, representing a small child, at the centre of the step. This requirement shall not apply to any door within the driver's direct field of view; 
7.6.10.7. the movement of the retractable step shall not be liable to cause any bodily harm either to passengers or to persons waiting at bus stops; 
7.6.10.8. the corners of retractable steps facing forwards or rearwards shall be rounded to a radius of not less than 5 mm; the edges shall be rounded to a radius of not less than 2,5 mm; 
7.6.10.9. when the passenger door is open, the retractable step shall be securely held in the extended position. When a mass of 136 kg is placed in the centre of a single step or a mass of 272 kg is placed in the centre of a double step the deflection at any point on the step shall not exceed 10 mm. 
7.6.11. Markings 
7.6.11.1. Each emergency exit shall be marked, inside and outside the vehicle, by an inscription reading, for example:

supplemented, where appropriate, by one of the symbols shown in Annex II, paragraph 3.4 of Council Directive 92/58/EEC. 
7.6.11.2. The emergency controls of service doors and of all emergency exits shall be marked as such inside and outside the vehicle either by a representative symbol or by a clearly-worded inscription. 
7.6.11.3. Clear instructions concerning the method of operation shall be placed on or close to every emergency control of an exit. 
7.6.11.4. The language in which any textual markings intended to comply with paragraphs 7.6.11.1 to 7.6.11.3 above are to be inscribed shall be determined by the approving authority bearing in mind the country/countries in which the applicant intends to market the vehicle in liaison if necessary with the competent authorities of the country/countries concerned. If the authority of the country/countries where the vehicle is to be registered has the language changed, this change shall imply no new type-approval process. 
7.7. Interior arrangements 
7.7.1. Access to service doors (see Annex III, figure 1) 
7.7.1.1. The free space extending inwards into the vehicle from the side wall in which the door is mounted shall permit the free passage of a vertical rectangular panel 20 mm thick, 400 mm wide and 700 mm in height above the floor, having a second panel 550 mm wide superimposed symmetrically above it; the height of the second panel being as prescribed for the relevant class of vehicle. The dual panel shall be maintained parallel with the door aperture as it is moved from the starting position, where the plane of the face nearest to the interior of the vehicle is tangential to the outermost edge of the aperture, to the position where is touches the first step, after which it shall be kept at right angles to the probable direction of motion of a person using the entrance. 
7.7.1.2. The height of the upper rectangular panel shall be for the relevant class of vehicle and category as prescribed in the table below.

7.11.2.1. Handrails and/or handholds shall be provided in sufficient number for each point of the floor area intended, in conformity with paragraph 7.2.2, for standing passengers. For this purpose, strap hangers, if fitted, may be counted as handholds, provided that they are held in their position by suitable means. This requirement shall be deemed to be fulfilled if, for all possible sites of the testing device shown in Annex III, figure 20 hereto, at least two handrails or handholds can be reached by the device's movable arm. The testing device may be freely turned about its vertical axis. 
7.11.2.2. When applying the procedure described in paragraph 7.11.2.1, only such handrails and handholds shall be considered as are not less than 800 mm and not more than 1900 mm above the floor. 
7.11.2.3. For every position that can be occupied by a standing passenger, at least one of the two required handrails or handholds shall be not more than 1500 mm above the level of the floor at that position. This does not apply to an area adjacent to a door where the door or its mechanism in open position would prevent the use of this handhold. 
7.11.2.4. Areas which can be occupied by standing passengers and are not separated by seats from the side walls or rear wall of the vehicle shall be provided with horizontal handrails parallel to the walls and installed at a height of between 800 mm and 1500 mm above the floor. 
7.11.3. Handrails and handholds for service doors 
7.11.3.1. Door apertures shall be fitted with handrails and/or handholds on each side. In the case of double doors this requirement can be fulfilled by fitting one central stanchion or one central handrail. 
7.11.3.2. Handrails and/or handholds to be provided for service doors shall be such that they include a grasping point available to a person standing on the ground adjacent to the service door or on any of the successive steps. Such points shall be situated, vertically, between 800 mm and 1100 mm above the ground or above the surface of each step, and horizontally: 
7.11.3.2.1. for the position appropriate to a person standing on the ground, not more than 400 mm inwards from the outer edge of the first step, and 
7.11.3.2.2. for the position appropriate to a particular step, not outwards from the outer edge of the step considered, and not more than 600 mm inwards from that same edge. 
7.11.4. Handrails to priority seating 
7.11.4.1. A handrail at a height of between 800 mm and 900 mm above the floor level shall be provided between the priority seats as described in paragraph 7.7.8.5.2 and the service door suitable for boarding and alighting. A break is permitted where it is necessary to gain access to a wheelchair space, a seat located at a wheel arch, a staircase, an access passage or a gangway. Any break in the handrail shall not exceed 1050 mm and a vertical handrail shall be provided on at least one side of the break. 
7.12. Guarding of step wells 
Where any seated passenger is likely to be thrown forward into a step well as a result of heavy braking, a guard shall be fitted. The guard shall have a minimum height from the floor on which the passenger's feet rest of 800 mm and shall extend inwards from the wall of the vehicle at least as far as 100 mm beyond the longitudinal centre line of any seating position where the passenger is at risk or to the riser of the innermost step; whichever is the lesser dimension. 
7.13. Baggage racks and occupant protection 
The occupants of the vehicle shall be protected from objects liable to fall from baggage racks under braking or cornering forces. If baggage compartments are fitted, they must be designed in such a way that baggage is prevented from falling in the event of sudden braking. 
7.14. Trap doors, if fitted 
Every trap door, that is not an escape hatch, on the floor of a vehicle shall be so fitted and secured that it cannot be dislodged or opened without the use of tools or keys and no lifting or securing device shall project by more than 8 mm above floor level. Edges of projections shall be rounded. 
7.15. Visual entertainment 
Forms of visual entertainment for passengers, for example television monitors or videos, shall be located out of the driver's view when the driver is seated in his normal driving position. This shall not preclude any television monitor or similar device used as part of the driver's control or guidance of the vehicle, for example to monitor service doors. 
Appendix 
VERIFICATION OF STATIC TILTING LIMIT BY MEANS OF CALCULATION 
1. A vehicle may be shown to meet the requirement specified in paragraph 7.4 of Annex I by a calculation method approved by the technical service for conducting the tests. 
2. The technical service responsible for conducting the tests may require tests to be carried out on parts of the vehicle to verify the assumptions made in the calculation. 
3. Preparations for calculation 
3.1. The vehicle shall be represented by a spatial system. 
3.2. Due to the location of the centre of gravity of the body of the vehicle and the different spring rates of the vehicle suspension and tyres, axles do not generally lift simultaneously on one side of the vehicle as a result of lateral acceleration. Therefore, lateral tilting of the body over each axle has to be ascertained on the supposition that the wheels of the other axle(s) remain on the ground. 
3.3. To simplify matters, it shall be assumed that the centre of gravity of the unsprung masses lies in the longitudinal plane of the vehicle on the line passing through the centre of the wheel rotation axle. The small shifting of the roll centre due to deflection of the axle can be neglected. The air suspension control should not be taken into account. 
3.4. The following parameters, at least, shall be taken into account: 
vehicle data such as wheel base, tread width and sprung/unsprung masses, location of the centre of gravity of the vehicle, deflection and rebound and the spring rate of the vehicle suspension, considering also non linearities, horizontal and vertical spring rate of the tyres, torsion of the superstructure, location of the roll centre of the axles. 
4. Validity of the calculation method. 
4.1. The validity of the calculation method shall be established to the satisfaction of the technical service, e.g. on the basis of a comparative test with a similar vehicle.

Appendix 4 
VERIFICATION OF STRENGTH OF SUPERSTRUCTURE BY CALCULATION 
1. A superstructure or sections of a superstructure may be shown to meet the requirement specified in paragraph 3.1 of this Annex by a calculation method approved by the technical service responsible for conducting the tests. 
2. If the structure is likely to be subject to deformations beyond the elastic limit of the materials used, then the calculations shall simulate the behaviour of the structure when undergoing large plastic deformations. 
3. The technical service responsible for conducting the tests may require tests to be carried out on joints or parts of the structure to verify the assumptions made in the calculation. 
4. Preparations for calculation 
4.1. Calculations cannot be started until the structure has been analysed and a mathematical model of it produced. This will define the separate members to be considered and identify the points at which plastic hinges may develop. The dimensions of the members and the properties of material used must be stated. Physical tests must be made on the hinge points to determine the force (moment of rotation)-deformation characteristics in the plastic mode as this is essential data for the calculations. The strain rate and the dynamic yield stress appropriate for this strain rate must be determined. If the calculation method will not indicate when a significant fracture will occur, it will be essential to determine, by experiment, separate analyses or appropriate dynamic distribution. Distribution of loading along the length of a vehicle shall be stated. 
4.2. The calculation method shall include the deformations up to the elastic limits of the materials followed by the identification of where plastic hinges will form and the subsequent formation of other plastic hinges unless the position and sequences of formation of plastic hinges is known from previous experience. The method shall accommodate the changes of geometry of the structure that take place, at least up to the stage where the deformations have passed the acceptable limits. The calculations shall simulate the energy and the direction of impact which would occur if that particular superstructure were to be submitted to the roll-over tests prescribed in Appendix 1. The validity of the calculation method shall have been established by comparison with the results of physical tests, which need not necessarily have been made in connection with the vehicle now being approved. 
5. Tests of section of superstructure 
When a calculation method is used for a section of the complete superstructure, the same conditions shall apply as stated above for the complete vehicle. 
ANNEX V 
(See Annex I, paragraph 7.6.5.6.1.1) 
GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING THE CLOSING FORCES OF POWER-OPERATED DOORS 
1. General 
The closing of a power-operated door is a dynamic process. When a moving door hits an obstacle, the result is a dynamic reaction force, the history of which (in time) depends on several factors (e.g. mass of the door, acceleration, dimensions). 
2. Definitions 
2.1. Closing force F(t) is a time function, measured at the closing edges of the door (see paragraph 3.2 below). 
2.2. Peak force FS is the maximum value of the closing force. 
2.3. Effective force FE is the average value of the closing force related to the pulse duration: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
2.4. Pulse duration T is the time between the t1 and t2: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
where: 
t1= threshold of sensitivity, where the closing force exceeds 50 N, 
t2= fade-away threshold, where the closing force becomes less than 50 N. 
2.5. The relation between the above parameters is shown in figure 1 below (as an example): 
Figure 1 
%gt%PIC FILE= %quot%L_2002042EN.008302.TIF%quot%%gt% 
2.6. Clamping force Fc is the arithmetical mean value of the effective forces, measured at the same measuring point subsequently more times: 
%gt%REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC%gt% 
3. Measurements 
3.1. Conditions of measurement: 
3.1.1. temperature range: 10° to 30 °C; 
3.1.2. the vehicle shall stay on a horizontal surface. 
3.2. Measurement points shall be: 
3.2.1. at the main closing edges of the door: 
- one in the middle of the door, 
- one 150 mm above the lower edge of the door; 
3.2.2. in the case of doors equipped with clamping prevention devices for the opening process: 
at the secondary closing edges of the door at that point which is considered to be the most dangerous place of clamping; 
3.2.3. at least three measurements shall be taken at each of the measuring points to determine the clamping force according to paragraph 2.6. 
3.3. The signal of the closing force shall be recorded by means of a low-pass filter with a limiting frequency of 100 Hz. Both the threshold of sensitivity and the fade-away threshold to limit the pulse duration shall be set at 50 N. 
3.5. The deviation of the reading from the rated value shall not be more than ± 3 %. 
4. Measuring device 
4.1. The measuring device shall consist of two parts: one handle and one measuring part which is a load cell (see figure 2). 
4.2. The load cell shall have the following characteristics: 
4.2.1. it shall consist of two sliding housings with the outer dimension of 100 mm in diameter and 115 mm in width. Inside the load cell a compression spring shall be fitted between the two housings such that the load cell can be pressed together if an appropriate force is applied. 
4.2.2. the stiffness of the load cell shall be 10 ± 0,2 N/mm. The maximum spring deflection shall be limited to 30 mm so that a maximum peak force of 300 N is achieved.
