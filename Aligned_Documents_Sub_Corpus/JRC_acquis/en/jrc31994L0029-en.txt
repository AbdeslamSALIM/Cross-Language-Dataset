Council Directive 94/29/EC of 23 June 1994 amending the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin respectively 
COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 94/29/EC of 23 June 1994 amending the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin respectively 
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin (2), and in particular Article 11 thereof, 
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, 
Whereas the Commission has received a mandate in the framework of Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC to prepare the list of pesticide residues and their maximum levels for approval by the Council; 
Whereas, in the light of technical and scientific progress and the requirements of public health and agriculture, it is now desirable to amend Annex II to the abovementioned Directives by adding provisions relating to further pesticide residues for cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin, namely, daminozide, lambda-cyhalothrin, ethephon, propiconazole, carbofuran, carbosulfan, benfuracarb, furathiocarb, cyfluthrin, metalaxyl, benalaxyl and fenarimol; 
Whereas, however, available data are insufficient for certain pesticide-cereal/foodstuffs of animal origin combinations as appropriate; whereas a period of time, not exceeding four years, will be necessary to generate such data; whereas, therefore, maximum levels should be established on the basis of such data by 30 June 1999 at the latest; whereas failure to provide satisfactory data should normally result in the establishment of levels at the appropriate limit of determination; 
Whereas, in order better to estimate dietary intake of pesticide residues, it is prudent to establish simultaneously, where possible, maximum residue levels for individual pesticides in all major components of the diet; whereas these levels represent the use of minimum quantities of pesticide to achieve adequate control, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable; 
Whereas the maximum residue levels established in the current Directive will have to be reviewed in the framework of the re-evaluations of active substances provided for in the work programme established in Annex 8 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3), 
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

(3) OJ No L 230, 19. 8. 1991, p. 1. Directive as amended by Commission Directive 93/71/EEC (OJ No L221, 31. 8. 1993, p. 27. 
(4)() Indicates other limit of analytical determination. 
(a) (b) (c) As from 30 June 1999 and save for adoption of other levels, the following maximum limits shall apply as indicated: 
(5)(): 0,02 (*), 
(6)(): 0,05 (*), 
(7)(): 0,1 (*). (8)() Indicates limit of analytical determination. 
(9) In the case of foodstuffs with a fat content of 10 % or less by weight, the residue is related to the total weight of the boned foodstuff. In such cases, the maximum level is one-tenth of the value related to fat content, but must be no less than 0,01 mg/kg. 
(10) In determining the residues in raw cow's milk and whole cream cow's milk, a fat content of 4 % by weight should be taken as a basis. For raw milk and whole cream milk of another animal origin the residues are expressed on the basis of the fat. 
For the other foodstuffs listed in Annex I under heading Nos 0401, 0402, 0405 00 and 0406: 
- with a fat content of less than 2 % by weight, the maximum level is taken as half that set for raw milk and whole cream milk, 
- with a fat content of 2 % or more by weight, the maximum level is expressed in mg/kg of fat. In such cases, the maximum level is 25 times that set for raw milk and whole cream milk. 
(11) For egg products with a fat content higher than 10 % the maximum level is expressed in mg/kg fat. In this case the maximum level is 10 times higher than the maximum level for fresh eggs. 
(12) Footnotes (1), (2) and (3) do not apply in cases where the limit of analytical determination is indicated. (13)() Indicates limit of analytical determination. 
(14)() As from 30 June 1999 and save for adoption of other levels, the following maximum limit shall apply: 0,02.
