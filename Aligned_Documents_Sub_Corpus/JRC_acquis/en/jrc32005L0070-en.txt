Commission Directive 2005/70/EC of 20 October 2005 amending Council Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for certain pesticides in and on cereals and certain products of animal and plant origin (Text with EEA relevance) 
Commission Directive 2005/70/EC 
of 20 October 2005 
amending Council Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for certain pesticides in and on cereals and certain products of animal and plant origin 
(Text with EEA relevance) 
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables [1], and in particular Article 5 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals [2], and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin [3], and in particular Article 10 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables [4], and in particular Article 7 thereof, 
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market [5] and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof, 
Whereas: 
(1) The following existing active substances have been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC: glyphosate by Commission Directive 2001/99/EC [6], chlorpropham by Commission Directive 2004/20/EC [7] and bromoxynil, and ioxinyl by Commission Directive 2004/58/EC [8]. 
(2) The following new active substances have been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC: dimethenamid-P and flurtamone by Commission Directive 2003/84/EC [9] propoxycarbazone and zoxamide by Commission Directive 2003/119/EC [10], flazasulfuron and pyraclostrobin by Commission Directive 2004/30/EC [11], quinoxyfen by Commission Directive 2004/60/EC [12] and mepanipyrim, by Commission Directive 2004/62/EC [13]. 
(3) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning their proposed use. Information relating to that use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed. 
(4) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a number of Codex MRLs for chlorpropham, and glyphosate. There are already Community MRLs in Directive 76/895/EEC for chlorpropham (Council Directive 82/528/EEC [14]) and in Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC for glyphosate (Council Directive 1998/82/EC [15]). These have been taken into consideration when setting the MRLs concerned by the adaptations made by this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs have been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers. No risk was established when using the toxicological end points based on the studies available to the Commission. 
(5) The Commission review reports which were prepared for the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and, if necessary, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for those substances. The exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substances concerned has been assessed in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation [16] and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants [17] on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs or ARfD being exceeded. 
(6) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, provisional MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination. 
(7) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances concerned in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive. 
(8) It is therefore necessary to add or replace all of the MRLs arising from the use of these plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer. Where MRLs have already been defined in the Annexes to those Directives it is appropriate to modify them. Where MRLs have not been defined until now, it is appropriate to set them for the first time. 
(9) Glyphosate is used as ester or salt. In case of glyphosate trimesium salt, the residue of trimethylsulfonium cation is also of toxicological relevance. It is therefore necessary to set MRLs for that cation. 
(10) Provisions of Directive 76/895/EEC which set MRLs for chlorpropham should consequently be deleted. 
(11) Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly. 
(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,
