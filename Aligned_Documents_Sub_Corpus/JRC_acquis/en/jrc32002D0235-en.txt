THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Decision 94/728/EC, Euratom of 31 October 1994 on the system of the Communities' own resources(1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,

Whereas:

(2) On that basis, the Commission adopted Decision 97/245/EC, Euratom on 20 March 1997 laying down the arrangements for the transmission of information to the Commission by the Member States under the own resources system(4).

(4) Steps should be taken to capitalise on the experience acquired in the transmission of requests for write-offs and to improve the presentation of the form used to that end. 
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are consistent with the opinion of the Advisory Committee on own resources provided for in Article 20 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000,
