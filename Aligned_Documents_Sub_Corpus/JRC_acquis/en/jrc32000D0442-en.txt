THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES, 
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, 
Having regard to Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine(1), as last amended by Directive 2000/15/EC(2), and in particular Annex AI(4) and AII(7) thereto, 
Whereas: 
(1) Commission Decision 1999/466/EC of 15 July 1999 establishing the officially brucellosis-free status of bovine herds of certain Member States or regions of Member States and repealing Decision 97/175/EC(3), as amended by Decision 2000/69/EC(4) granted this status to certain Member States and regions thereof until 30 June 2000.

(3) The temporary limitations of the officially-free status with regard to bovine brucellosis foreseen in the above Decisions was introduced due to incoherence of dates in different pieces of legislation relating to the system of identification of bovine animals.
