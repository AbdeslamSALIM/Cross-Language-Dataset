AGREEMENT between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland 
THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY, 
of the one part, and 
THE REPUBLIC OF ICELAND, 
of the other part, 
DESIRING to consolidate and to extend, upon the enlargement of the European Economic Community, the economic relations existing between the Community and Iceland and to ensure, with due regard for fair conditions of competition, the harmonious development of their commerce for the purpose of contributing to the work of constructing Europe, 
RESOLVED to this end to eliminate progressively the obstacles to substantially all their trade, in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade concerning the establishment of free trade areas, 
DECLARING their readiness to examine, in the light of any relevant factor, and in particular of developments in the Community, the possibility of developing and deepening their relations where it would appear to be useful in the interests of their economies to extend them to fields not covered by this Agreement, 
HAVE DECIDED, in pursuit of these objectives and considering that no provision of this Agreement may be interpreted as exempting the Contracting Parties from the obligations which are incumbent upon them under other international agreements, 
TO CONCLUDE THIS AGREEMENT: 
Article 1 
The aim of this Agreement is: (a) to promote through the expansion of reciprocal trade the harmonious development of economic relations between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Iceland and thus to foster in the Community and in Iceland the advance of economic activity, the improvement of living and employment conditions, and increased productivity and financial stability, 
(b) to provide fair conditions of competition for trade between the Contracting Parties, 
(c) to contribute in this way, by the removal of barriers to trade, to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade. 
Article 2 
The Agreement shall apply to products originating in the Community or Iceland: (i) which fall within Chapters 25 to 99 of the Brussels Nomenclature, excluding the products listed in Annex I; 
(ii) which are specified in Protocols Nos 2 and 6, with due regard to the arrangements provided for in those Protocols. 
Article 3 
1. No new customs duty on imports shall be introduced in trade between the Community and Iceland. 
2. The Community as originally constituted and Ireland shall progressively abolish customs duties on imports in accordance with the following timetable: (a) on 1 April 1973 each duty shall be reduced to 80 % of the basic duty; 
(b) four further reductions of 20 % each shall be made on: 
1 January 1974, 
1 January 1975, 
1 January 1976, 
1 July 1977. 
3. The basic duty to which the successive reductions provided for in this Article and in Protocol No 1 are to be applied shall, for each product, be the duty actually applied on 1 January 1972. 
If, after 1 January 1972, any tariff reductions resulting from the tariff agreements concluded as a result of the Trade Conference held in Geneva from 1964 to 1967 become applicable, such reduced duties shall replace the basic duties referred to in the previous subparagraph. 
4. The reduced duties calculated in accordance with this Article and Protocol No 1 shall be applied rounded to the first decimal place. 
Subject to the application by the Community of Article 39 (5) of the %quot%Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties%quot% drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as regards the specific duties or the specific part of the mixed duties in the Irish Customs Tariff, this Article and Protocol No 1 shall be applied, with rounding to the fourth decimal place. 
Article 4 
1. On the dates indicated Iceland shall reduce customs duties on imports from the Community as originally constituted and from Ireland to the rates of the various basic duties applicable on 1 March 1970 specified below. %gt%PIC FILE= %quot%T0010677%quot%%gt% 
2. After 1 January 1974 Iceland shall continue to reduce customs duties in respect of Denmark, Norway and the United Kingdom in accordance with the timetable shown in paragraph 1.

1. The provisions concerning the progressive abolition of customs duties on imports shall also apply to customs duties of a fiscal nature. 
The Contracting Parties may replace a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty by an internal tax. 
2. Iceland may temporarily retain, with due regard to the conditions of Article 19, customs duties of a fiscal nature on the products specified in Annex II. 
When production is started in Iceland of a product of like kind to one of those listed in Annex II, the duty to which the latter product is subject must be reduced to the level which would have been reached if that duty had been reduced in accordance with the timetable contained in Article 4 (1) since the entry into force of the Agreement. If in respect of third countries a customs duty lower than the duty of a fiscal nature is introduced, the tariff reductions shall be made on the basis of the former duty. 
Subsequent reductions shall be made in accordance with the timetable laid down in Article 4 (1). 
3. Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom may retain until 1 January 1976 a customs duty of a fiscal nature or the fiscal element of a customs duty upon implementation of Article 38 of the %quot%Act concerning the Conditions of Accession and the Adjustments to the Treaties%quot% drawn up and adopted within the Conference between the European Communities and the Kingdom of Denmark, Ireland, the Kingdom of Norway and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

1 July 1977.

Article 24 
1. The following are incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement in so far as they may affect trade between the Community and Iceland: (i) all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition as regards the production of or trade in goods; 
(ii) abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position in the territories of the Contracting Parties as a whole or in a substantial part thereof; 
(iii) any public aid which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods. 
2. Should a Contracting Party consider that a given practice is incompatible with this Article, it may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. 
Article 25 
Where an increase in imports of a given product is or is likely to be seriously detrimental to any production activity carried on in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties and where this increase is due to: (i) the partial or total reduction in the importing Contracting Party, as provided for in the Agreement, of customs duties and charges having equivalent effect levied on the product in question ; and 
(ii) the fact that the duties or charges having equivalent effect levied by the exporting Contracting Party on imports of raw materials or intermediate products used in the manufacture of the product in question are significantly lower than the corresponding duties or charges levied by the importing Contracting Party; 
the Contracting Party concerned may take appropriate measures under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28. 
Article 26 
If one of the Contracting Parties finds that dumping is taking place in trade with the other Contracting Party, it may take appropriate measures against this practice in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, under the conditions and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 28.

Article 28 
1. In the event of a Contracting Party subjecting imports of products liable to give rise to the difficulties referred to in Articles 25 and 27 to an administrative procedure, the purpose of which is to provide rapid information on the trend of trade flows, it shall inform the other Contracting Party. 
2. In the cases specified in Articles 23 to 27, before taking the measures provided for therein or, in cases to which paragraph 3 (d) applies, as soon as possible, the Contracting Party in question shall supply the Joint Committee with all relevant information required for a thorough examination of the situation with a view to seeking a solution acceptable to the Contracting Parties. 
In the selection of measures, priority must be given to those which least disturb the functioning of the Agreement. 
The safeguard measures shall be notified immediately to the Joint Committee and shall be the subject of periodical consultations within the Committee, particularly with a view to their abolition as soon as circumstances permit. 
3. For the implementation of paragraph 2, the following provisions shall apply: (a) As regards Article 24, either Contracting Party may refer the matter to the Joint Committee if it considers that a given practice is incompatible with the proper functioning of the Agreement within the meaning of Article 24 (1). 
The Contracting Parties shall provide the Joint Committee with all relevant information and shall give it the assistance it requires in order to examine the case and, where appropriate, to eliminate the practice objected to. 
If the Contracting Party in question fails to put an end to the practice objected to within the period fixed by the Joint Committee, or in the absence of agreement in the Joint Committee within three months of the matter being referred to it, the Contracting Party concerned may adopt any safeguard measures it considers necessary to deal with the serious difficulties resulting from the practices in question ; in particular it may withdraw tariff concessions. 
(b) As regards Article 25, the difficulties arising from the situation referred to in that Article shall be referred for examination to the Joint Committee which may take any decision needed to put an end to such difficulties. 
If the Joint Committee or the exporting Contracting Party has not taken a decision putting an end to the difficulties within thirty days of the matter being referred, the importing Contracting Party is authorized to levy a compensatory charge on the product imported. 
The compensatory charge shall be calculated according to the incidence on the value of the goods in question of the tariff disparities in respect of the raw materials or intermediate products incorporated therein. 
(c) As regards Article 26, consultation in the Joint Committee shall take place before the Contracting Party concerned takes the appropriate measures. 
(d) Where exceptional circumstances requiring immediate action make prior examination impossible, the Contracting Party concerned may, in the situations specified in Articles 25, 26 and 27 and also in the case of export aids having a direct and immediate incidence on trade, apply forthwith the precautionary measures strictly necessary to remedy the situation. 
Article 29 
Where one or more Member States of the Community or Iceland is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments, the Contracting Party concerned may take the necessary safeguard measures. It shall inform the other Contracting Party forthwith.
