ANNEX 
In the Annex to Decision 2005/240/EC, the following part 4 is added: 
"Part 4 
IM-03 
1. Grading of pig carcases is carried out by means of the apparatus known as "IM-03". 
2. The apparatus shall be equipped with a needle-optical probe (single line scanner SLS01) of 7 millimetres diameter. The probe contains the line of contact image sensors (CIS) and green light-emitting diodes. The operating distance is between 0 and 132 millimetres. 
3. The lean meat content of the carcase shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
= 45,07537 Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201C; 0,52724X1 + 0,31380X2 
where: 
the estimated percentage of lean meat in the carcase, 
X1= the thickness of back fat (including rind) in millimetres measured at 6 centimetres off the midline of the carcase between the third and fourth last rib, 
X2= the thickness of the muscle in millimetres measured at the same time and in the same place as X1. 
This formula shall be valid for carcases weighing between 60 and 120 kilograms."
